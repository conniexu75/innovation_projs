However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called AlphaZero, which taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). AlphaZero managed to beat state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of AlphaZero to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a general game-playing system. Science , this issue p. 1140 ; see also pp. 1087 and 1118"

We recently found that the bacterial species Lactobacillus (L.) reuteri reverses social deficits in maternal high-fat-diet offspring. However, whether the effect of L. reuteri on social behavior is generalizable to other ASD models and its mechanism(s) of action remains unknown. Here, we found that treatment with L. reuteri selectively rescues social deficits in genetic, environmental, and idiopathic ASD models. Interestingly, the effects of L. reuteri on social behavior are not mediated by restoring the composition of the host's gut microbiome, which is altered in all of these ASD models. Instead, L. reuteri acts in a vagus nerve-dependent manner and rescues social interaction-induced synaptic plasticity in the ventral tegmental area of ASD mice, but not in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice. Collectively, treatment with L. reuteri emerges as promising non-invasive microbial-based avenue to combat ASD-related social dysfunction."

Mining the metagenomic database, Yan et al. systematically discovered additional subtypes of type V CRISPR-Cas systems. The additional Cas12 effectors displayed a range of activities, including target and collateral cleavage of single-stranded RNA and DNA, as well as double-stranded DNA nicking and cleavage. These diverse nuclease activities suggest how an ancient transposase may have evolved into various type V effectors and expand the nucleic acid detection and genome-editing toolbox.

Nonetheless, maintaining cellular diversity in human intestinal organoids has been challenging. Based on niche ligands present in the natural stem cell milieu, we establish a refined organoid culture condition for intestinal epithelia that allows human intestinal organoids to concurrently undergo multi-differentiation and self-renewal. High-throughput screening reveals that the combination of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) enhances the clonogenic capacity and CRISPR-genome engineering efficiency of human intestinal stem cells. The combination equally enables long-term culture of a range of intestinal organoids, including rat small intestinal organoids. Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing further illustrates the conservation of the native cellular diversity in human small intestinal organoids cultured with the refined condition. The modified culture protocol outperforms the conventional method and offers a viable strategy for modeling human intestinal tissues and diseases in an in vivo relevant context."

Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moir\'e superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway towards controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials eliminating need for arduous top-down nanofabrication."

Stapels et al. found that these cells are not dormant but are actively modulating their environment. Salmonella within their host macrophage niche deployed a specialized type 3 secretory system called SPI-2 to deliver virulence factors, including SteE, into host cells. SteE changed the cytokine profile of the infected macrophages to reprogram them into a noninflammatory and infection-permissive state. Thus, when antibiotics were removed, the Salmonella could reemerge and cause disease. Science , this issue p. 1156"

Myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are considered clonal blood disorders. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with mutations in AML-related genes such as TET2 or DNMT3A represent what are commonly defined as preleukemic HSPCs (Jan et al., 2012Jan M. Snyder T.M.

Additionally, preleukemic HSPCs can transform through serial acquisition of additional somatic mutations over time and contribute to the development of full-blown AML. What is unclear is the nature of environmental signals that might contribute to the “switch” from a preleukemic state to a leukemic state in cells bearing these mutations. In this context, inflammation has been hypothesized to play an essential role, but precisely how inflammatory signals influence the growth, survival, differentiation, and overall engraftment potential of preleukemic HSPCs is poorly understood. Older mice carrying loss-of-function alleles in Tet2 or Dnmt3a manifest an expanded HSPC pool, including a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-enriched fraction defined by the cell-surface markers Lineage−/Sca-1+/c-Kit+ (LSK). Some of these genetically modified mice go on to develop CMML or MPN with modest penetration when aged (Challen et al., 2011Challen G.A. Sun D. Jeong M. Luo M. Jelinek J. Berg J.S. Bock C.

The majority of preleukemic mutations on their own are insufficient to cause AML in mice, suggesting that a single mutation among the above-described mutations defines a preleukemic state and perhaps additional cooperating mutations and/or environmental factors are necessary to provide a more effective selection advantage for preleukemic HSPCs leading to the development of full-blown leukemia. Inflammation has been linked to tumor induction and transformation in solid tissues and has recently been speculated as an enabling characteristic of cancer and its malignancies (Grivennikov et al., 2010Grivennikov S.I.

Sica A. Balkwill F. Cancer-related inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (7861) Google Scholar). Inflammation caused by environmental exposure, infection, autoimmunity, or aging may result in mutations and genomic instability in somatic cells as well as in reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment through regulating angiogenesis and expression of cytokines and chemokines. Considering that both innate and adaptive immune cells are generated from HSPCs and are involved in regulating local as well as whole-body inflammatory processes, the relationship between inflammation and hematopoietic malignancies is likely to be complex. While the influence of inflammatory stress on normal HSPCs has recently gained significant attention, recent studies have begun to address how preleukemic HSPCs respond or contribute to inflammation (Abegunde et al., 2018Abegunde S.O.

Regulation of stress-induced hematopoiesis.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2015; 22: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because HSPCs in adults reside in the bone marrow and are surrounded by mature immune cells, the inflammatory microenvironment is likely to influence the growth and self-renewal of these cells in part by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In support of this hypothesis are epidemiologic findings demonstrating that infection may act as a trigger for AML development in humans (Kristinsson et al., 2011Kristinsson S.Y. Björkholm M. Hultcrantz M. Derolf Å.R. Landgren O. Goldin L.R. Chronic immune stimulation might act as a trigger for the development of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.J. Clin. Oncol. 2011; 29: 2897-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the present study, we asked whether and how Tet2-KO HSPCs maintain survival advantage during pathological stress by examining how Tet2-KO preleukemic HSPCs respond to inflammatory stress. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand that functions by stimulating the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, is widely used to induce inflammation in mice (Manz and Boettcher, 2014Manz M.G. Boettcher S. Emergency granulopoiesis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To assess how Tet2-KO pre-leukemic stem, progenitor, and mature cells respond to acute inflammation, we injected LPS in Tet2-KO mice and their wild-type counterparts and followed these mice for 7 days to assess changes in peripheral blood (PB) hematologic parameters (Rodriguez et al., 2009Rodriguez S. Chora A. Goumnerov B. Mumaw C. Goebel W.S. Fernandez L. Baydoun H. HogenEsch H. Dombkowski D.M. Karlewicz C.A. et al.Dysfunctional expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and block of myeloid differentiation in lethal sepsis.Blood. 2009; 114: 4064-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On day 2 (48 hr) after LPS treatment, a significant increase in white blood cells (WBC) was observed in Tet2-KO mice relative to controls (Figure 1A). The increase in WBCs in these mice was associated with an increase in the absolute number and the frequency of neutrophils (NEs), consistent with enhanced “emergency granulopoietic” response (Figures 1A and 1B) (Manz and Boettcher, 2014Manz M.G. Boettcher S. Emergency granulopoiesis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The number of monocytes (MO) was comparable between wild-type and Tet2-KO mice after LPS treatment, while eosinophil (EO) and basophil (BA) counts were also elevated like neutrophils in Tet2-KO mice (Figure S1A; data not shown). In addition, the numbers of lymphocytes (LYs), platelets (PLTs), and red blood cells (RBCs) were comparable between wild-type and Tet2-KO mice (Figure S1A). Although no gross changes in the histology of bone marrow and spleen was seen upon LPS challenge (Figure S2B), flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency of Mac1+ myeloid cells in Tet2-KO mice on day 2 after LPS treatment compared to wild-type controls (Figure S1C). Taken together, these data suggest that Tet2-KO mice manifest a transient but significant increase in both number and frequency of neutrophils in response to acute inflammatory stress. Infection induces acute inflammation and modulates hematopoiesis at the level of both HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) to adapt to pathological insult (King and Goodell, 2011King K.Y.

Demand-adapted regulation of early hematopoiesis in infection and inflammation.Blood. 2012; 119: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast to steady-state hematopoiesis (naive; hematopoietic hierarchy illustrated in Figure 1C), infection or stress-induced hematopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) is recognized as “emergency hematopoiesis” (Trumpp et al., 2010Trumpp A.

After LPS challenge, we analyzed the LSK and HSC compartments (defined by LSK/CD48−/CD150+) in wild-type and Tet2-KO mice (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz Ö.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). We also analyzed various BM progenitor cell subsets composed of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs; defined by Lin−/Sca-1−/c-Kit+/CD16−/CD34+), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs; defined by Lin−/Sca-1−/c-Kit+/CD16+/CD34+), and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs; defined by Lin−/Sca-1−/c-Kit+/CD16−/CD34−) in these mice (Figure 1D). We observed a similar drop in the overall BM cellularity in both wild-type and Tet2-KO mice after LPS challenge (Figure 1E). In contrast, LPS treatment resulted in significant differences in the frequencies and absolute number of BM progenitors in Tet2-KO mice relative to controls after LPS challenge. Quantitatively, LPS challenge of Tet2-KO mice resulted in increased number and frequencies of CMPs and GMPs, but not MEPs (Figure 1E; data not shown). A significant enrichment in LSK and HSC frequency and numbers was also observed in Tet2-KO mice compared to controls after LPS treatment (Figure 1E). Similarly, Tet2-KO mice exhibit an increase in multipotent progenitors (MPPs; defined by LSK/CD48+/CD150−) and short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs; defined by LSK/CD48+/CD150+) after LPS challenge (Figure S1D). Given that adult (12–16 weeks old) Tet2-KO mice also manifest increased basal (day 0, before LPS challenge) levels of CMPs, LSKs, and HSCs compared to controls, we assessed if juvenile (younger) Tet2-KO mice, which show a similar frequency and number of CMPs, LSKs, and HSCs as wild-type controls under basal conditions, respond to LPS challenge in a manner similar to older Tet2-KO mice. As shown in Figure S1E, juvenile Tet2-KO mice also exhibit enhanced response to LPS challenge in all the BM progenitor subsets examined, including CMPs, LSKs, and HSCs, compared to controls. Collectively, these data suggest that deficiency of Tet2 in HSPCs primes them to respond to acute inflammatory stress much more efficiently than WT controls. Recent studies have shown that LPS challenge or bacterial infection in mice not only expands the HSC and/or LSK population in the BM but also potentially depletes HSCs and impairs their self-renewing capability (Esplin et al., 2011Esplin B.L.

We asked whether LPS-challenged Tet2-KO HSPCs also demonstrate impaired stem cell activity after being exposed to an inflammatory stress. To assess this, we first performed a competitive repopulation assay using whole BM cells before and after LPS challenge. The scheme for conducting competitive BM transplantation (cBMT) is shown in Figure 2A. PB chimerism revealed that the repopulating activity of CD45.2 donor cells from wild-type (WT) mice on day 2 after LPS treatment (measured by percentage of CD45.2_WT_day 2 in primary recipients) was significantly reduced compared to non-LPS-treated WT donor cells (measured by percentage of CD45.2_WT_day 0 in primary recipients) (percentage of CD45.2_WT_day 2 versus percentage of CD45.2_WT_day 0, ∗p < 0.05; Figure 2B). In contrast, LPS-stressed Tet2-KO CD45.2 donor cells did not show any decline in repopulating ability on any of the post-LPS-treatment time points examined (Figure 2B). Further, at every time point after LPS treatment, Tet2-KO CD45.2 BM donor cells demonstrated a higher repopulating ability than WT CD45.2 donor controls, and the greatest difference was observed on day 2 after LPS treatment (i.e., percentage of CD45.2_WT_Day 2 versus percentage of CD45.2_Tet2-KO_Day 2, ∗∗p < 0.01; Figures 2B and S2A). Secondary cBMT experiments further confirmed that WT CD45.2 donor cells on day 2 after LPS treatment showed a significant decrease in the repopulating activity while Tet2-KO CD45.2 donor cells were resistant to LPS stress and maintained robust engraftment advantage (Figure 2C). Chimerism analysis of various fractions of BM cells, including Lin-negative (Lin−) cells, LSK cells, myeloid cells (labeled by Mac1), B cells (labeled by CD19), and T cells (labeled by CD3), in the BM of primary cBMT recipients also demonstrated that the repopulation of Tet2-KO donor cells was higher than controls (Figure S2A–S2D). To further compare the repopulating activity of stem cells after LPS-induced inflammatory damage in WT and Tet2-KO mice, identical numbers of LSK cells from pre- and post-LPS-treated WT and Tet2-KO mice were sorted and subjected to a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay in vitro and BM transplantation assay in vivo (Figure 2D). Because the frequencies of HSCs in the LSK pool were comparable between WT and Tet2-KO mice (Figure S2E), the analysis using LSK cells allowed us to assess the functional difference between the two groups with regards to HSCs upon LPS challenge. Consistent with our data utilizing whole BM cells (Figure 2B), purified WT LSK cells derived from mice 2 days after LPS treatment showed impaired colony-forming ability in vitro and significantly reduced repopulating activity in vivo compared to Tet2-KO LSK cells, which were significantly more resistant to inflammatory insult (Figures 2E and 2F). Taken together, our functional data demonstrate that while the repopulating activity of WT HSPCs is significantly impaired in response to LPS-induced inflammatory stress, LPS-treated Tet2-KO HSPCs maintain greater engraftment and are resistant to inflammatory stress. Given our results demonstrating increased frequency, increased number, and enhanced engraftment of Tet2-KO HSPCs upon LPS challenge, we sought to determine whether Tet2-KO and WT HSPCs manifest differences in apoptosis and/or proliferation upon encountering inflammatory stress. We analyzed apoptosis in HSPCs by Annexin-V and 7-AAD staining followed by flow cytometry analysis after LPS treatment (Figure 3A). We also determined proliferation by assessing the percentage of Ki67+ HSPCs (Figure S3A). Although we observed only subtle changes in proliferating LSK pool (Figure S3A), remarkable and consistent differences in apoptosis were detected in both Lin− and LSK pool between WT and Tet2-KO cells upon LPS challenge (Figures 3A and 3B). Furthermore, the phenotypic observation with regard to reduced apoptosis in Tet2-KO cells after LPS treatment was consistent with changes in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including Casp1 (encoding Caspase-1) and Bcl2l11 (encoding Bim), which were significantly reduced in Tet2-KO cells (Figure 3C). Furthermore, pro-survival genes, including Bcl2 and Morrbid, showed increased expression in Tet2-KO cells in both naive condition and upon LPS challenge (Figure 3C). Morrbid is a recently identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) involved both in regulating the expression of Bim and in the survival of myeloid cells, including neutrophils; however, the role of Morrbid in the survival of preleukemic HSPCs is not known (Kotzin et al., 2016Kotzin J.J.

We hypothesized that the hyperactivation of Morrbid in Tet2-KO HSPCs could be mediated via direct regulation of Morrbid promoter by Tet2 or perhaps via an indirect mechanism involving transcription factors that regulate inflammation (See Figure 3D). It has been reported that knockout of a specific promoter region (∼800 bp) of Morrbid impairs its activity (Kotzin et al., 2016Kotzin J.J. Spencer S.P. McCright S.J. Kumar D.B.U. Collet M.A. Mowel W.K. Elliott E.N. Uyar A. Makiya M.A. Dunagin M.C. et al.The long non-coding RNA Morrbid regulates Bim and short-lived myeloid cell lifespan.Nature. 2016; 537: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Detailed methylation analysis on the ∼800-bp promoter region of Morrbid showed no profound difference in either 5-mC or 5-hmC modifications (Figures S3B–S3E). In contrast, we readily detected hyperactive phospho-Stat3 (pStat3) in Tet2-KO cells by flow cytometry and western blot analysis (Figures 3E and 3F). Furthermore, we detected increased binding of Stat3 to the Morrbid promoter (Figure 3G). Taken together, these results suggest that Tet2 loss results in survival advantage in preleukemic cells, which is associated with increased expression of Morrbid and activation of Stat3. Acute inflammatory stress can induce an immediate and transient “cytokine storm” to regulate emergency hematopoiesis and granulopoiesis (Manz and Boettcher, 2014Manz M.G. Boettcher S. Emergency granulopoiesis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To determine the upstream regulators of Stat3-Morrbid survival pathway and see if the observed resistance to inflammatory stress in Tet2-KO HSPCs is in part due to dysregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines in Tet2-KO mice, we quantified 31 cytokines and chemokines to assess their levels in serum. 15 cytokines or chemokines (G-CSF, interleukin-6 [IL-6], CCL2, CCL4, CXCL1, CCL5, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-10, GM-CSF, IL-1α, IL-1β, M-CSF, IL-2) were found to be stimulated in serum by LPS on day 1 and/or day 2 compared to day 0 in WT and Tet2-KO mice (Figures 4A and S4A). However, we consistently observed that loss of Tet2 resulted in a profound increase in serum IL-6 levels on day 0, while a further increase was observed on days 1 and 2 after LPS treatment (Figure 4A). CCL2, CCL4 TNF-α, and CXCL9 were also increased in Tet2-KO mice on day 2 (Figure 4A). G-CSF, one of the most essential cytokines for granulopoiesis, was also slightly, but not significantly, increased in Tet2-KO mice on day 2 after LPS treatment compared to WT (p = 0.06, Figure 4A). Recent studies suggest that LPS can directly induce the production of multiple cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, GM-CSF, and TNF-α, in WT HSPCs (Zhao et al., 2014Zhao J.L. Ma C. O’Connell R.M. Mehta A. DiLoreto R. Heath J.R. Baltimore D. Conversion of danger signals into cytokine signals by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for regulation of stress-induced hematopoiesis.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 445-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Tet2-KO HSPCs also produce these cytokines. IL-6 was expressed more highly by mature BM cells as well as immature BM cells (HSPCs) lacking Tet2 upon LPS treatment compared to WT controls (Figures 4B–4D and S4B). TNF-α was expressed at a higher level on day 1 in Lin− BM cells derived from Tet2-KO mice (Figure S4C). Expression of IL-1β and GM-CSF was also enhanced by LPS treatment but was comparable between WT and Tet2-KO HSPCs (Figures S4D and S4E). qRT-PCR analysis on Lin− BM cells confirmed that Il6 mRNA was significantly elevated on days 0, 1, and 2 after LPS treatment in adult Tet2-KO mice relative to controls (Figure 4E). Likewise, in juvenile mice, where serum IL-6 and expression of Il6 were comparable between WT and Tet2-KO cells on day 0, LPS challenge resulted in significantly higher expression of Il6 in Lin− cells derived from Tet2-KO mice relative to controls (Figure 4F). Expression of Ccl2 was also increased in the serum and in Lin− cells on day 1 after LPS treatment in Tet2-KO mice relative to controls (Figures 4A, 4E, and 4F). Taken together, these data suggest that Tet2-KO preleukemic hematopoietic cells produce increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, upon LPS challenge. LPS activates canonical TLR4/NF-κB signaling, which induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 to induce emergency hematopoiesis (a schematic of the TLR4/NF-κB/IL-6 and IL-6/Shp2/Stat3 signaling pathways is illustrated in Figure 5A) (Lu et al., 2008Lu Y.-C. Yeh W.-C. Ohashi P.S. LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway.Cytokine. 2008; 42: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). Interestingly, multiple components of the TLR4/NF-κB/IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway, including Tlr4, Nfkbiz, Il6, and Stat3, were elevated in Tet2-KO Lin− cells with or without LPS challenge, consistent with a heightened inflammatory response in Tet2-KO HSPCs (Figures S5A–S5C). Given the increased expression of IL-6 in Tet2-KO HSPCs, we asked how IL-6 might contribute to the enhanced survival of Tet2-KO HSPCs. In vitro stimulation of Lin− Tet2-KO cells with IL-6 resulted in reduced apoptosis of these cells compared to controls (Figure 5B). Importantly, the reduced apoptosis of Tet2-KO cells in the presence of IL-6 was associated with increased activation of Stat3 and expression of lncRNA, Morrbid (Figures S5D and 5C). Given the importance of IL-6 in activating Stat3 via Shp2 (Heinrich et al., 2003Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Principles of interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokine signalling and its regulation.Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar), we examined the consequence of constitutively active Shp2 expression in Lin− cells on Morrbid activation. Consistent with IL-6 stimulation of Morrbid in vitro, HSPCs with expression of a constitutive Shp2 isoform, Shp2E76K, also demonstrated reduced apopt"

Ackermann et al. sequenced more than 400 pretreatment neuroblastomas and identified molecular features that characterize the three distinct clinical outcomes.

These encounters can result in commensal-specific T cell responses that promote, for example, host defense and tissue repair. Harrison et al. show that subsets of skin-resident commensal-specific interleukin-17A–producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have a dual nature: They coexpress transcription factors that direct antagonistic antimicrobial (type 17) and antiparasite and pro–tissue repair (type 2) programs. When skin is damaged, epithelial cell alarmins license type 17 T cells to turn on type 2 cytokines. Thus, commensal-specific type 17 T cells can direct antimicrobial activity under homeostatic conditions but rapidly turn on tissue repair in the context of injury. Science , this issue p. eaat6280"

Despite extensive research, disease heterogeneity is poorly characterized, hampering efforts for early diagnosis and improved treatments. Here, we apply single cell RNA sequencing to study the heterogeneity of 40 individuals along the multiple myeloma progression spectrum, including 11 healthy controls, demonstrating high interindividual variability that can be explained by expression of known multiple myeloma drivers and additional putative factors. We identify extensive subclonal structures for 10 of 29 individuals with multiple myeloma. In asymptomatic individuals with early disease and in those with minimal residual disease post-treatment, we detect rare tumor plasma cells with molecular characteristics similar to those of active myeloma, with possible implications for personalized therapies. Single cell analysis of rare circulating tumor cells allows for accurate liquid biopsy and detection of malignant plasma cells, which reflect bone marrow disease. Our work establishes single cell RNA sequencing for dissecting blood malignancies and devising detailed molecular characterization of tumor cells in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients."

We determine the charge diffusion constant in our system by measuring the relaxation of an imposed density modulation and modeling its decay hydrodynamically. The diffusion constant is converted to a resistivity, which exhibits a linear temperature dependence and exceeds the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, two characteristic signatures of a bad metal.

Harris et al. identified a protein complex in Arabidopsis that is recruited to chromatin by DNA methylation. This complex specifically activated the transcription of genes that are already mildly transcribed but had no effect on transcriptionally silent genes such as transposable elements. The complex thereby counteracts the repression effect caused by transposon insertion in neighboring genes while leaving transposons silent. Thus, by balancing both repressive and activating transcriptional effects, DNA methylation can act to fine-tune gene expression. Science , this issue p. 1182"

The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08+/-0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with 3D simulations of the planet's upper atmosphere suggests it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large scale height and a helium mass loss rate =< 3x10^5 g/s.

Resistance is emerging to even the latest frontline combination therapies, which target the blood stages of the Plasmodium parasite.

To do so, they devised a luciferase-reporter drug screen for the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei. Three rounds of increasingly stringent screening were used. From this regime, several chemotypes that inhibit Plasmodium mitochondrial electron transport were identified. Excitingly, several new scaffolds, with as-yet-unknown modes of action but solely targeting the parasites' liver stages, emerged as promising drug leads for further development.

We detected 87 active brain regions during visual stimulation that evoked the optokinetic reflex, a visuomotor behavior that stabilizes the gaze both horizontally and vertically. Using a genetic mouse model of congenital nystagmus incapable of generating the horizontal reflex, we identified a subset of regions whose activity was reflex dependent. By blocking eye motion in control animals, we further separated regions whose activity depended on the reflex’s motor output. Remarkably, all reflex-dependent but eye motion-independent regions were located in the thalamus.

Correlative neuroimaging studies implicate dysfunction within ventromedial prefrontal cortex, but the causal roles of specific subregions remain unidentified. We addressed these issues by combining intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular and behavioral monitoring in marmoset monkeys to show that over-activation of primate subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, area 25) blunts appetitive anticipatory, but not consummatory, arousal, whereas manipulations of adjacent perigenual ACC (pgACC, area 32) have no effect. sgACC/25 over-activation also reduces the willingness to work for reward. 18F-FDG PET imaging reveals over-activation induced metabolic changes in circuits involved in reward processing and interoception. Ketamine treatment ameliorates the blunted anticipatory arousal and reverses associated metabolic changes. These results demonstrate a causal role for primate sgACC/25 over-activity in selective aspects of impaired reward processing translationally relevant to anhedonia, and ketamine's modulation of an affective network to exert its action."

A fundamental feature of behavior is the ability to optimize performance based on outcomes (Ullsperger et al., 2014Ullsperger M. Danielmeier C. Jocham G. Neurophysiology of performance monitoring and adaptive behavior.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 35-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).

Successful detection of errors then initiates behavioral adjustments on various timescales.

Less is known about the MFC’s involvement in control of action production triggered by monitored outcomes (mentioned above as the second type of behavioral adjustments). In the case of externally cued response inhibition, electrical stimulation of the supplementary eye field or pre-SMA has been shown to delay saccades in service of avoiding errors (Stuphorn and Schall, 2006Stuphorn V. Schall J.D. Executive control of countermanding saccades by the supplementary eye field.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007Isoda M. Hikosaka O. Switching from automatic to controlled action by monkey medial frontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These studies provide crucial causal evidence that MFC can influence action production, but the neuronal mechanisms that bridge monitoring to such control and the possible roles of other brain regions in this process remain unclear. Self-monitored errors, on the other hand, have a typical behavioral consequence: they can delay successive actions, a phenomenon known as the post-error slowing (PES) (Ullsperger et al., 2014Ullsperger M. Danielmeier C. Jocham G. Neurophysiology of performance monitoring and adaptive behavior.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 35-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Functional imaging studies have revealed the complex neural mechanism that may underlie PES with MFC being the central node of this control network. In this framework, the need for PES is signaled by MFC after detection of an error. PES involves inhibitory activity in the cortico-subthalamic pathways (Danielmeier et al., 2011Danielmeier C. Eichele T. Forstmann B.U. Tittgemeyer M. Ullsperger M. Posterior medial frontal cortex activity predicts post-error adaptations in task-related visual and motor areas.J.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12759-12769Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This argument is principally supported by the finding that blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activation in dACC is correlated with the magnitude of PES (Kerns et al., 2004Kerns J.G. Cohen J.D. MacDonald 3rd, A.W. Cho R.Y. Stenger V.A. Carter C.S. Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). In addition, in rodents, pharmacological inactivation of MFC abolishes PES (Narayanan et al., 2013Narayanan N.S. Cavanagh J.F. Frank M.J. Laubach M. Common medial frontal mechanisms of adaptive control in humans and rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1888-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A natural hypothesis thus links the detection of self-generated errors, as reflected in the ERN, with changes in cognitive control, as exhibited behaviorally in PES, predicting that the two measures should be correlated. However, several electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have failed to find a significant relationship between PES and ERN (Gehring and Fencsik, 2001Gehring W.J. Fencsik D.E. Functions of the medial frontal cortex in the processing of conflict and errors.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9430-9437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Nieuwenhuis et al., 2001Nieuwenhuis S.

To err is autonomic: Error-related brain potentials, ANS activity, and post-error compensatory behavior.Psychophysiology. 2003; 40: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Curiously, while BOLD activity in MFC predicts PES, the ERN does not. Based on these discrepancies in the literature, we tested a more detailed mechanistic hypothesis that might reconcile them. The ERN is thought to be produced by the summation of postsynaptic potentials within MFC and may thus, in part, reflect inputs to this region (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B. Coles M.G.H. The neural basis of human error processing: Reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol.

An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique. Second Edition. MIT Press, 2014Google Scholar). One possibility explaining the aforementioned discrepancies is that the inputs to the MFC that produce the ERN only carry information about error monitoring, but not about the engagement of control. The computations within MFC that underlie cognitive control, while not reflected in the ERN, might instead be evident in oscillatory components in the local field potential (LFP) (Siegel et al., 2012Siegel M. Donner T.H. Engel A.K. Spectral fingerprints of large-scale neuronal interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, Pesaran et al., 2018Pesaran B.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or in correlations between spike rates of neurons and the LFP (Nir et al., 2007Nir Y. Fisch L. Mukamel R. Gelbard-Sagiv H. Arieli A. Fried I. Malach R. Coupling between neuronal firing rate, gamma LFP, and BOLD fMRI is related to interneuronal correlations.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Such correlated neuronal activity could also explain why BOLD signals are associated with PES (Niessing et al., 2005Niessing J. Ebisch B. Schmidt K.E. Niessing M. Singer W. Galuske R.A. Hemodynamic signals correlate tightly with synchronized gamma oscillations.Science. 2005; 309: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This model predicts that spike rates and intracranial EEG (iEEG) power within MFC would be correlated with the strength of PES, even though the ERN is not. Subjects performed a color-naming Stroop task, which required subjects to name the color of words while ignoring their semantic meaning (Figure 1A). Reaction times (RTs) were longer on word-color incongruent trials than word-color congruent trials (the “Stroop effect”; 224.9 ± 19.2-ms difference, mean ± SEM across sessions, F (1, 84) = 116.6, p < 0.001, mixed-effects one-way ANOVA). Subjects responded incorrectly (“error trials”) in 7.2% ± 0.5% (±SEM) of all trials. On correct trials that follow an error (“EC” trials), responses were significantly slower than on correct trials that follow another correct trial (“CC” trials) (Figure 1B, amount of PES: 64.3 ± 11.0 ms, mean ± SEM across sessions, mixed-effect one-way ANOVA, F (1,184) = 23.4, p < 0.001). To quantify PES for individual trials in the analysis below, we used sequences of CCEC trials (‘C’ represents correct trials; ‘E’ represents error trials; see STAR Methods; median single-trial PES = 33 ms, p = 0.0016, z = 3.154; signed-rank test). We isolated 1,171 single units from dACC (n = 618) and pre-SMA (n = 553) across 29 patients (Figure 1C, Table S1; see also Figures S1A–S1C and S1D–S1I). Some neurons were in sessions with fewer than seven error trials and thus were excluded from the analyses that involve errors (number of neurons included in dACC is n = 399 and in pre-SMA is n = 431). Error neurons were identified using a Poisson regression model. Spike rates in a 1-s epoch starting immediately after the action (button press) were regressed against trial labels (error or correct) and RTs. 34% (n = 134) of dACC and 46% (n = 198) of pre-SMA neurons signaled errors (see Figures 2A–2D, 3A–3C, S2C, and S2D and Table S2). We classified error neurons based on whether they had higher (“type I,” error > correct, n = 99 and 118 in dACC and pre-SMA, respectively; see Figures 2A, 2C, 3B, and 3C, left) or lower (“type II,” error < correct, n = 35 and 80 in dACC and pre-SMA, respectively, Figures 2B, 2D, 3B, and 3C, right) spike rates for error than correct trials. The responses of error neurons on individual trials differed reliably between error and correct trials as evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (see STAR Methods and Figure 3F): area under the curve (AUC) values were, on average, 0.61 and 0.60 for dACC and pre-SMA, respectively (significantly greater than 0.5 with p < 10−10, t(133) = 12.86 and p < 10−10, t(197) = 18.5, respectively; t test). AUC values of error neurons did not differ significantly between dACC and pre-SMA (Figure 3F; p = 0.52, t(330) = 0.64, t test).Figure 3Temporal Profile of Error and Error-Integrating NeuronsShow full caption(A) Percentage of significant error and error-integrating neurons in dACC and pre-SMA.

The majority of errors (67%) occurred on incongruent trials. Spike rates of error neurons on the error trials (within the post-action epoch; Figure S2A) did not correlate with RT (Figures S3A and S3B; for type I error neurons, p > 0.4, t(98) = 0.86 in dACC, p > 0.5, t(117) = −0.41 in pre-SMA; for type II error neurons, p > 0.5, t(34) = −0.54 in dACC and p > 0.5, t(79) = −0.63 in pre-SMA; t test) and did not distinguish significantly between congruent and incongruent errors (Figures S4A and S4C; see Figures S4B and S4D for statistics). We thus pooled congruent and incongruent error trials in all subsequent analyses. Unlike the responses of error neurons, RTs were significantly longer on incongruent compared to congruent error trials (Figure S4G; p < 0.001, t(57) = 4.03, paired t test), arguing that errors were not due to lapses in stimulus processing. While the neuronal error signal persisted into the post-feedback epoch (which appeared 1 s after button press; Figures 1A and S2A), the maximal spike rate modulation for both types of error neurons occurred before onset of feedback (Figures 3B and 3C). An out-of-sample analysis of effect sizes (see STAR Methods) confirmed this impression: spike rates of error neurons in the epoch between action and feedback onset carried significantly more information about the occurrence of an error than those in the post-feedback epoch (Figure 3G; p < 10−10, t(199) = 98.3 in dACC, p < 10−10, t(199) = 288.2 in pre-SMA, paired t test). Thus, feedback onset did not reactivate error neurons or terminate their ongoing response on error trials (Figures 3B and 3C). In summary, error neurons were action-triggered and encoded the detection of a mismatch between the intended action and the actual action performed. We hypothesized that MFC neurons signal information about the history of self-monitored outcomes (Shima and Tanji, 1998Shima K. Tanji J.

Walton M.E. Behrens T.E. Buckley M.J. Rushworth M.F. Optimal decision making and the anterior cingulate cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). We identified a significant proportion of MFC neurons (see Figure 3A; n = 46, 11.5% in the dACC; n = 58, 13.5% in pre-SMA, p < 0.001 for both areas, permutation test; also see Table S2) whose spike rates signaled whether the response in the preceding trial was an error or not (Figures 2E, 2F, 3A, S2C, and S2D). Response patterns of these “error-integrating” neurons differed between dACC and pre-SMA: whereas dACC neurons (Figure 3D) showed a peri-stimulus onset spike rate increase on trials that followed an error, responses in pre-SMA were characterized by an extended decrease starting in the pre-stimulus baseline period (Figure 3E). We next tested whether this response pattern was the result of error signals persisting from the preceding error trial, in which case the error-integrating neurons would also be classified as error neurons. While there was some overlap between the two categories (overlap: n = 12 and 20 for dACC and pre-SMA), many error-integrating neurons were not also error neurons (non-overlap: n = 34 and n = 38 for dACC and pre-SMA, respectively). The time course of the population activity of all error-integrating neurons confirmed this: while these neurons did signal errors to some degree during the post-action epoch (definition see Figure S2) on the preceding trial (Figure 3H, orange; mean AUC for dACC 0.59 ± 0.01, for pre-SMA 0.63 ± 0.01; p < 0.05 versus chance for both areas, permutation tests), this error signal was attenuated after feedback (Figure 3H, green; mean AUC for dACC 0.59 ± 0.01, for pre-SMA 0.57 ± 0.01), reinforced before stimulus onset, and then continued on to after the stimulus onset on the next correct trial (Figure 3H, blue; mean AUC for dACC 0.65 ± 0.01, for pre-SMA 0.62 ± 0.01; blue versus green, p < 0.001, z = 4.74 in dACC and p < 0.001, z = 4.72 in pre-SMA, rank-sum test). In summary, we found error-integrating neurons carried a sustained error signal that was reinforced around stimulus onset on the subsequent trial, consistent with a putative role in post-error behavioral control. Response conflict is thought to be the stimulus-evoked competition between a pre-potent but task-irrelevant response (reading the word) and a task-relevant response (th"

Our objective was to develop a rapid biomarker-based method for diagnosing FM by using vibrational spectroscopy to differentiate patients with FM from those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to identify metabolites associated with these differences. Blood samples were collected from patients with a diagnosis of FM (n = 50), RA (n = 29), OA (n = 19), or SLE (n = 23). Bloodspot samples were prepared, and spectra collected with portable FT-IR and FT-Raman microspectroscopy and subjected to metabolomics analysis by ultra-HPLC (uHPLC), coupled to a photodiode array (PDA) and tandem MS/MS. Unique IR and Raman spectral signatures were identified by pattern recognition analysis and clustered all study participants into classes (FM, RA, and SLE) with no misclassifications (p < 0.05, and interclass distances > 2.5). Furthermore, the spectra correlated (r = 0.95 and 0.83 for IR and Raman, respectively) with FM pain severity measured with fibromyalgia impact questionnaire revised version (FIQR) assessments. Protein backbones and pyridine-carboxylic acids dominated this discrimination and might serve as biomarkers for syndromes such as FM. uHPLC-PDA-MS/MS provided insights into metabolites significantly differing among the disease groups, not only in molecular m/z+ and m/z− values but also in UV-visible chromatograms.

Current evidence suggests that FM belongs to a much larger continuum of chronic pain syndromes, which includes chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal syndromes, temporomandibular syndrome, migraine, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, among others, all with considerable overlap (1Yunus M.B.

Estimates suggest that at least 2% of the adult population in the United States may be affected by FM, with an overall annual impact considering work absenteeism, lost productivity, and health care rivaling the costs of rheumatoid arthritis (11Silverman S.

The diagnosis of FM has evolved from relying primarily on evidence for multiple painful tender points as promulgated in the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (14Wolfe F. Smythe H.A. Yunus M.B. Bennett R.M. Bombardier C. Goldenberg D.L. Tugwell P. Campbell S.M. Abeles M. Clark P.

The 2010 ACR criteria included symptom severity criteria coupled with pain and other somatic symptoms (10Wolfe F. Clauw D.J. Fitzcharles M.A. Goldenberg D.L. Katz R.S. Mease P. Russell A.S. Russell I.J. Winfield J.B. Yunus M.B. The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity.Arthritis Care Res. (Hoboken). 2010; 62 (20461783): 600-61010.1002/acr.20140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), and in 2016, the FM criteria were further refined to add additional distinctions to help avoid misclassifying patients with regional myofascial pain syndromes as having FM (9Ablin J.N. Wolfe F. A comparative evaluation of the 2011 and 2016 criteria for fibromyalgia.J. Rheumatol. 2017; 44 (28572464): 1271-127610.3899/jrheum.170095Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fibromyalgia is currently diagnosed on the basis of the following findings: 1) presence of generalized pain, defined as pain in at least four of the five regions of the body; 2) symptoms present at a similar level for at least 3 months; 3) widespread pain index (WPI) ≥ 7 and symptom severity scale (SSS) score ≥ 5 or WPI of 4–6 and SSS score ≥ 9; and 4) the diagnosis of FM is valid irrespective of other diagnoses. Some studies have shown that a diagnosis alone improves FM patients’ health satisfaction, with fewer symptoms reported over the long term and reductions in the cost of medical resource utilization by patients (12Annemans L. Wessely S. Spaepen E. Caekelbergh K. Caubère J.P. Le Lay K. Taïeb C.

Such a test would be a significant step toward earlier diagnosis of and intervention for this condition, helping to improve patient outcomes, contain health care and/or legal costs, and potentially provide clues to the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome. Our group has recently reported the first metabolomics approach in two central sensitivity syndromes, interstitial cystitis (15Rubio-Diaz D.E. Pozza M.E. Dimitrakov J. Gilleran J.P. Giusti M.M. Stella J.L. Rodriguez-Saona L.E. Buffington C.A. A candidate serum biomarker for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis.Analyst. 2009; 134 (19475139): 1133-113710.1039/b901736dCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and FM (16Hackshaw K.V. Rodriguez-Saona L. Plans M. Bell L.N. Buffington C.A.T. A bloodspot-based diagnostic test for fibromyalgia syndrome and related disorders.Analyst. 2013; 138 (23595128): 4453-446210.1039/c3an36615dCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We isolated a low-molecular weight fraction of human blood using centrifugal ultrafiltration through a semipermeable membrane (filtrate), leaving high molecular solutes in the retentate (16Hackshaw K.V. Rodriguez-Saona L. Plans M. Bell L.N. Buffington C.A.T. A bloodspot-based diagnostic test for fibromyalgia syndrome and related disorders.Analyst. 2013; 138 (23595128): 4453-446210.1039/c3an36615dCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The low-molecular weight fraction was analyzed using IR microspectroscopy, which provided a unique spectral pattern based on functional groups (e.g. methyl, carbonyl, indole, etc.) in serum samples that vibrated in predictable ways after absorbing IR light. Pattern recognition analysis of the spectra allowed us to discriminate FM patients from those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA) that appeared to be metabolically similar (16Hackshaw K.V. Rodriguez-Saona L. Plans M. Bell L.N. Buffington C.A.T. A bloodspot-based diagnostic test for fibromyalgia syndrome and related disorders.Analyst. 2013; 138 (23595128): 4453-446210.1039/c3an36615dCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The approach did not conclusively identify the metabolites responsible for the diagnostic spectral differentiation, although changes in tryptophan catabolism seemed to be involved (16Hackshaw K.V. Rodriguez-Saona L. Plans M. Bell L.N. Buffington C.A.T. A bloodspot-based diagnostic test for fibromyalgia syndrome and related disorders.Analyst. 2013; 138 (23595128): 4453-446210.1039/c3an36615dCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Another metabolomics approach has involved LC/quadrupole–TOF/MS with multivariate statistical analysis aimed at discriminating FM (n = 22) patients and controls (n = 21) from blood plasma analysis (17Caboni P. Liori B. Kumar A. Santoru M.L. Asthana S. Pieroni E. Fais A. Era B. Cacace E. Ruggiero V. Atzori L. Metabolomics analysis and modeling suggest a lysophosphocholines-PAF receptor interaction in fibromyalgia.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (25238064): e10762610.1371/journal.pone.0107626Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). According to the investigators, lysophosphocholine dominated the metabolite profile, suggesting that there may be additional potential biomarkers for FM diagnosis (17Caboni P. Liori B. Kumar A. Santoru M.L. Asthana S. Pieroni E. Fais A. Era B. Cacace E. Ruggiero V. Atzori L. Metabolomics analysis and modeling suggest a lysophosphocholines-PAF receptor interaction in fibromyalgia.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (25238064): e10762610.1371/journal.pone.0107626Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, Malatji et al. (18Malatji B.G. Meyer H. Mason S. Engelke U.F.H. Wevers R.A. van Reenen M. Reinecke C.J. A diagnostic biomarker profile for fibromyalgia syndrome based on an NMR metabolomics study of selected patients and controls.BMC Neurol. 2017; 17 (28490352): 8810.1186/s12883-017-0863-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) used NMR metabolomics to identify a diagnostic biomarker profile for FM from urine, identifying metabolites associated with indicators of pain and fatigue symptoms (succinic acid, taurine, and creatine) and perturbations in the gut microbiome (hippuric, 2-hydroxyisobutyric, and lactic acids). Vibrational spectroscopy technology currently is being developed for routine clinical use in many areas of medicine (19Eikje N.S. Aizawa K. Ozaki Y.

Vibrational (mid-IR and Raman) spectroscopy fingerprinting capabilities offer rapid, high-throughput, and nondestructive analysis of a wide range of sample types producing a characteristic chemical “fingerprint” with a unique signature profile. Raman spectroscopy offers an attractive fingerprinting technique because of the little or no sample preparation requirement, noncontact and nondestructive capabilities, and weak Raman response of water, allowing measurement in aqueous solutions and on substances enclosed in transparent containers, such as bags or vials, without opening them (26Santos M.I. Gerbino E. Tymczyszyn E. Gomez-Zavaglia A. Applications of infrared and Raman spectroscopies to probiotic investigation.Foods. 2015; 4 (28231205): 283-30510.3390/foods4030283Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, a major hurdle in biological samples has been the interference of fluorescence. Traditional Raman handheld units are equipped with visible laser excitation wavelengths, such as 532 and 785 nm, to increase the Raman scattering signal. Unfortunately, these shorter excitation wavelengths increase fluorescence background, which obscure the Raman signal. To reduce the fluorescence limitation, Raman spectrometers can be equipped with longer excitation wavelength (NIR, 830–1064 nm), but this results in diminished Raman signal intensity. To address this signal limitation, a new generation of semiconductor detectors (indium gallium arsenide array) recently became available (27Bersani D. Lottici P.P. Raman spectroscopy of minerals and mineral pigments in archaeometry.J. Raman Spectrosc. 2016; 47: 499-53010.1002/jrs.4914Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy phenomenon enhances (106–107) due to the large electromagnetic field induced by localized surface plasmon resonance by using metallic nanostructures (typically gold and silver) that are in proximity of the metal surface. Such refinements result in lower limits of detection of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in the ppb or single molecule level (28Roggo Y. Chalus P. Maurer L. Lema-Martinez C. Edmond A. Jent N. A review of near infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics in pharmaceutical technologies.J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2007; 44 (17482417): 683-70010.1016/j.jpba.2007.03.023Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Advances in instrumentation and pattern recognition techniques are making this technology ideal for rapid screening and analysis of biological samples, permitting the separation of spectra into discrete clusters that permit classification of individuals based on subtle physiological differences. Pattern recognition solves the class-membership problem (29Sjöström M. Wold S. Lindberg W. Persson J.Å. Martens H. A multivariate calibration problem in analytical chemistry solved by partial least-squares models in latent variables.Anal. Chim. Acta. 1983; 150: 61-7010.1016/S0003-2670(00)85460-4Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar) by using unsupervised and supervised methods. In unsupervised techniques, there is no information available prior to analysis in regard to group structure of the samples (30Aletaha D. Neogi T. Silman A.J. Funovits J. Felson D.T. Bingham 3rd, C.O. Birnbaum N.S. Burmester G.R. Bykerk V.P. Cohen M.D. Combe B. Costenbader K.H. Dougados M. Emery P. Ferraccioli G. et al.2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative.Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62 (20872595): 2569-258110.1002/art.27584Crossref PubMed Scopus (5572) Google Scholar). These techniques usually are applied to discover sample groupings within data, reveal any abnormal spectra in a data set, and determine the natural variation among the samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce large data sets into a smaller number of orthogonal variables called principal components (PCs), which carry the major variance of the original variables. Thus, PCA reduces the dimensionality of data sets while simultaneously retaining the information present in the data (29Sjöström M. Wold S. Lindberg W. Persson J.Å. Martens H. A multivariate calibration problem in analytical chemistry solved by partial least-squares models in latent variables.Anal. Chim. Acta. 1983; 150: 61-7010.1016/S0003-2670(00)85460-4Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Supervised classification uses a group of samples as a training set, in which the categories of each sample are known prior to analysis. Training set performance is then evaluated by comparing the predictions made by the model with the true categories of the samples used for validation (31Yu C. Gershwin M.E. Chang C. Diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus: a critical review.J. Autoimmun. 2014; 48 (24461385): 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Supervised classification methods include K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), linear discriminant analysis, partial least-squares discriminant analysis. Among the most common of the supervised techniques is SIMCA, which allows for the visualization of clustering patterns among samples (31Yu C. Gershwin M.E. Chang C. Diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus: a critical review.J. Autoimmun. 2014; 48 (24461385): 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In SIMCA, a PCA is performed on each class in the data set, and a sufficient number of principal components are retained to account for most of the variation within each class (32Bennett R.M. Friend R. Jones K.D. Ward R. Han B.K. Ross R.L. The revised fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQR): validation and psychometric properties.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2009; 11 (19664287): R12010.1186/ar2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). An important feature of SIMCA is that it only assigns an unknown sample to the class for which it has a high probability. If the residual variance of a sample exceeds the upper limit for every modeled class in the data set, the sample is not assigned to any of the classes represented in the data set. The objectives of the current study were to develop simple, rapid, sensitive, and robust methods for the diagnosis of FM based on the highly characteristic mid-IR and Raman “fingerprint” from dried blood spots of peripheral blood samples obtained by finger-stick combined with supervised pattern recognition techniques. In addition, we evaluated the identification capabilities of LC-MS/MS to assist in a metabolomics approach for biomarker elucidation and to provide information to better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of FM. The clinical characteristics of subjects with FM are shown in Table 1. Bloodspots were collected on 50 subjects (48 females, 2 males). Mean age was 45.5 ± 10.3 years. Body mass index (BMI) mean was 34.0 ± 8.4 kg/m2 with a range of 18.0–55.6 kg/m2. Mean fibromyalgia impact questionnaire revised version (FIQR) score was 59.3 ± 20.8 with a range from 33.7 to 89.5. Mean Beck depression index (BDI) was 27.1 ± 12.8 with a range from 7.0 to 56. Mean McGill pain index (MPI) was 25.9 ± 10.2. Eleven of 50 subjects with FM were antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive; however, all met ACR criteria for primary FM with no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other underlying connective tissue disorder. Concurrent medications are listed for each individual with FM in Table 2. The number of medications taken by each FM subject ranged from 1 (n = 8) to 5 (n = 1). Correlation analyses of FIQR versus BDI, FIQR versus MPI, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) versus CRP, ESR versus rheumatoid factor (RF), ESR versus cyclic citrullinated protein (CCP), and ESR versus SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) are presented in Table 3. Corresponding Pearson coefficients and p values are +0.686 and p < 0.005 (statistically significant) for the correlation between the FIQR and BDI and +0.334 and p > 0.05 for FIQR versus MPI.Table 1Demographic data for FM (n = 50), RA (n = 29), SLE (n = 23), and OA (n = 19) subjectsFMRASLEOAAge (years)45.5 ± 10.3 {44.5} [25, 68]51.5 ± 11.2 {54} [25, 70]44.9 ± 9.8 {46} [23, 59]60.4 ± 8.1 {61} [46, 74]Sex48 female, 2 male21 female, 8 male21 female, 2 male14 female, 5 maleBMI34.0 ± 8.4 {34.5} [18, 55.6]31.7 ± 9.6 {31.4} [18.8, 61.6]31.3 ± 5.9 {30.1} [21, 44.8]36.5 ± 8.5 {36.5} [22.5, 52.0]FIQR59.3 ± 20.8 {59.4} [25.1, 89.5]ESR37.5 ± 9.6 {33} [2, 93]32.6 ± 17.1 {30} [4, 67]ANA11/508/2916/23DSDNA10/23 Open table in a new ta"

Changes in protein O-GlcNAcylation regulate cellular differentiation and cell fate decisions, but how these changes affect erythropoiesis, an essential process in blood cell formation, remains unclear.

We observed that during G1E-ER4 differentiation, overall O-GlcNAc levels decrease, and physical interactions of GATA-1 with both OGT and OGA increase. RNA-Seq–based transcriptome analysis of G1E-ER4 cells differentiated in the presence of the OGA inhibitor Thiamet-G (TMG) revealed changes in expression of 433 GATA-1 target genes. ChIP results indicated that the TMG treatment decreases the occupancy of GATA-1, OGT, and OGA at the GATA-binding site of the lysosomal protein transmembrane 5 (Laptm5) gene promoter. TMG also reduced the expression of genes involved in differentiation of NB4 and HL60 human myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2905084818,"Hepatic gluconeogenesis makes a significant contribution to the pathogenesis of obesity and its related insulin resistance. Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE; also cystathionase), a principal hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-synthesizing enzyme in the liver, is involved in glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. However, the roles and precise mechanisms of CSE/H2S in obesity and its related insulin resistance remain obscure. Here we show that CSE knockout exacerbated high-fat diet—induced mouse obesity as well as its related insulin resistance. Further study elucidated that the inhibition of insulin and AMPK signaling pathways by CSE deficiency resulted in nuclear accumulation of Forkhead box protein O1 and subsequently promoted hepatic gluconeogenesis. These phenomena can be reversed by NaHS supplementation. However, in wild-type mice, NaHS treatment ameliorates high fat diet—induced obesity and metabolism disorders, indicating that maintaining an appropriate level of H2S is critical for its mutual change of positive and negative effects of obesity-associated insulin resistance. Our study reveals a double-edged sword effect and a novel mechanism for CSE/H2S in obesity associated with insulin resistance and provides evidence for CSE/H2S as a promising therapeutic potential target for obesity-related insulin resistance.—Guo, W., Li, D., You, Y., Li, W., Hu, B., Zhang, S., Miao, L., Xian, M., Zhu, Y., Shen, X.

https://openalex.org/W2904754040,"Increasing evidence shows that many transcription factors execute important biologic functions independent from their DNA-binding capacity. The NF-κB p65 (RELA) subunit is a central regulator of innate immunity. Here, we investigated the relative functional contribution of p65 DNA-binding and dimerization in p65-deficient human and murine cells reconstituted with single amino acid mutants preventing either DNA-binding (p65 E/I) or dimerization (p65 FL/DD). DNA-binding of p65 was required for RelB-dependent stabilization of the NF-κB p10O protein. The antiapoptotic function of p65 and expression of the majority of TNF-α–induced genes were dependent on p65′s ability to bind DNA and to dimerize. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel DNA sequencing experiments revealed that impaired DNA-binding and dimerization strongly diminish the chromatin association of p65. However, there were also p65-independent TNF-α-inducible genes and a subgroup of p65 binding sites still allowed some residual chromatin association of the mutants. These sites were enriched in activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding motifs and showed increased chromatin accessibility and basal transcription. This suggests a mechanism of assisted p65 chromatin association that can be in part facilitated by chromatin priming and cooperativity with other transcription factors such as AP-1.—Riedlinger, T., Liefke, R., Meier-Soelch, J., Jurida, L., Nist, A., Stiewe, T., Kracht, M., Schmitz, M.

https://openalex.org/W2904782810,"Balance of osteoclast formation is regulated by the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and extracellular negative regulators such as IFN-γ and IFN-β. However, very little is known about the intrinsic negative regulatory factors of osteoclast differentiation. Recently, the paired-box homeodomain transcription factor Pax6 was shown to negatively regulate receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-mediated osteoclast differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying this regulation is still unclear. In this study, we show that a p38 inhibitor (VX-745) up-regulates the expression of Pax6 during osteoclast differentiation. Subsequently, we found that β-catenin could bind to the proximal region of Pax6 promoter to induce its expression, and this action could be impaired by p38-induced ubiquitin-mediated degradation of β-catenin. Our results suggest that Pax6 is regulated by a novel p38/β-catenin pathway. Pax6 can further regulate the nuclear translocation of NF of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1. Our study indicates that this novel p38/β-catenin/Pax6 axis contributes to negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis. In addition, our study proposes a novel approach to treat osteoclast-related diseases through the use of VX-745 complemented with the β-catenin activator SKL2001.—Jie, Z., Shen, S., Zhao, X., Xu, W., Zhang, X., Huang B., Tang P., Qin, A., Fan, S., Xie, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2904119789,"The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a master regulator of mitosis. CPC consists of inner centromere protein (INCENP), Survivin, Borealin, and the kinase Aurora B and plays key roles in regulating kinetochore–microtubule attachments and spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. However, the role of CPC in sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by the cohesin complex, remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that Aurora B kinase activity contributes to centromeric cohesion protection partly through promoting kinetochore localization of the kinase Bub1. Interestingly, disrupting the interaction of INCENP with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) in HeLa cells selectively weakens cohesion at mitotic centromeres without detectably reducing the kinase activity of Aurora B. Thus, through this INCENP–HP1 interaction, the CPC also protects centromeric cohesion independently of Aurora B kinase activity. Moreover, the requirement for the INCENP–HP1 interaction in centromeric cohesion protection can be bypassed by tethering HP1 to centromeres or by depleting the cohesin release factor Wapl. We provide further evidence suggesting that the INCENP–HP1 interaction protects centromeric cohesion by promoting the centromere localization of Haspin, a protein kinase that antagonizes Wapl activity at centromeres.

Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which binds to INCENP or Borealin and is distributed along with the CPC to various locations throughout mitosis, can be considered the fifth subunit of the CPC.

Compared with these well-established functions, the exact role of the CPC in the regulation of sister chromatid cohesion is unclear. Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by a multiple-subunit cohesin complex composed of Smc1, Smc3, Scc1, SA2 (or SA1), and the accessory subunit Pds5B (or Pds5A) (17Nasmyth K. Haering C.H.

Phosphorylation of Sororin by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and Aurora B destabilizes its interaction with Pds5A/B and causes Wapl activation and cohesin release (33Nishiyama T. Sykora M.M.

Therefore, Aurora B kinase activity negatively regulates sister chromatid cohesion along the chromosome arms in early mitosis. In this study, we report that Aurora B kinase activity positively regulates sister chromatid cohesion at mitotic centromeres at least partly through promoting the kinetochore localization of Bub1 in human cells. Importantly, through the interaction of its INCENP subunit with HP1, the CPC also plays an Aurora B kinase activity–independent role in the protection of centromeric cohesion. To dissect the role of CPC in the regulation of sister chromatid cohesion, we depleted its scaffold subunit INCENP by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and analyzed chromosomes prepared from HeLa cells that were arrested in mitosis with the microtubule destabilizer nocodazole. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the average interkinetochore (inter-KT) distance on chromosomes prepared from INCENP-depleted cells was 23% further apart than the control (Fig. 1, A and B), which is indicative of weakened centromeric cohesion. Similarly, inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity by the small-molecule inhibitor Hesperadin (34Hauf S. Cole R.W. LaTerra S. Zimmer C. Schnapp G. Walter R. Heckel A. van Meel J. Rieder C.L.

These results indicate that, in contrast to its role in releasing cohesin from chromosome arms, Aurora B kinase activity is required to protect proper strength of sister chromatid cohesion at mitotic centromeres. We also found that inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity by Hesperadin and ZM447439 (Fig. S1C), another small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora B kinase (36Ditchfield C. Johnson V.L. Tighe A. Ellston R.

We therefore speculated that Aurora B kinase activity ensures full enrichment of Sgo1 at mitotic centromeres at least partly through promoting the kinetochore localization of Bub1 kinase. To test this hypothesis, we expressed a CENP-B (CB) fusion protein, CB-Bub1-K-GFP, in which Bub1 kinase domain is fused to the centromeric targeting domain of CENP-B (40Meppelink A. Kabeche L.

As expected, treatment of cells stably expressing CB-GFP with Hesperadin caused strong delocalization of Sgo1 from mitotic centromeres (Fig. 1, I and J). Interestingly, centromeric localization of Sgo1 was largely retained when cells stably expressing CB-Bub1-K-GFP were treated with Hesperadin, consistent with the role of Bub1-mediated H2A-pT120 in recruiting Sgo1 to centromeres. Moreover, the inter-KT distance in cells expressing CB-Bub1-K-GFP was not sensitive to Aurora B inhibition by Hesperadin (Fig. 1, K and L). Thus, the need for Aurora B kinase activity in maintaining proper inter-KT distance can be bypassed by tethering Bub1 to centromeres. These results are also consistent with the role of Sgo1 in protecting centromeric cohesion (30McGuinness B.E. Hirota T. Kudo N.R. Peters J.M. Nasmyth K.

We provide evidence that this is through regulation of lipid rafts as Lrch4 silencing reduces cell surface gangliosides, a metric of raft abundance, as well as expression and surface display of CD14, a raft-resident LPS co-receptor.

Ligation of TLRs, whether on the plasma membrane (TLR1, -2, -4, -5, and -6) or within endosomes (TLR3, -7, -8, and -9), triggers a complex series of signaling events through adaptor proteins and kinases, culminating in the activation of NF-κB and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), master transcription factors that orchestrate the innate immune response via inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. TLRs are pivotal for host defense but can also mediate inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (2Kawai T. Akira S.

Here, we introduce leucine-rich repeats and calponin homology containing protein 4 (Lrch4) as a novel accessory protein that regulates signaling by multiple TLRs. Lrch4 is predicted to be a single-pass transmembrane protein with approximately nine LRRs and a calponin homology (CH) motif in its ectodomain. It is widely expressed across murine tissues and is regulated by LPS. Lrch4 silencing attenuates cytokine induction by a wide array of TLR ligands in murine and human cells and also reduces inflammatory responses to LPS in vivo. Lrch4 co-precipitates with biotin-LPS from treated macrophages, suggesting interaction with LPS. Consistent with this, Lrch4 silencing reduces cell surface binding of LPS and alters the pattern of LPS deposition on the macrophage, reducing LPS localization to rafts. Taken together, we identify Lrch4 as a broad-spanning regulator of the innate immune response with potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory disease. We recently identified Lrch4 in a proteomic screen as a protein increased in lipid raft microdomains of macrophages upon LPS exposure, suggestive of a potential role in TLR4 signaling (13Dhungana S. Merrick B.A. Tomer K.B. Fessler M.B. Quantitative proteomics analysis of macrophage rafts reveals compartmentalized activation of the proteasome and of proteasome-mediated ERK activation in response to lipopolysaccharide.Mol. Cell.

Lrch4 (Gene ID: 231798) resides on chromosome 5 in the murine genome (7q22 in the human genome) and is predicted to have a 3,078-bp ORF (18 exons) that encodes a 680-amino acid (AA) protein (∼73 kDa) with an pI of ∼7.5. Sequence alignment using CLUSTAL (14Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G.

AA sequence-based prediction of conserved motifs (UniProt) in conjunction with transmembrane prediction (TMpred (15Hofmann K. TMBASE: a database of membrane spanning protein segments.Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) and Philius (16Reynolds S.M. Käll L. Riffle M.E. Bilmes J.A. Noble W.S. Transmembrane topology and signal peptide prediction using dynamic bayesian networks.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4 (18989393): e100021310.1371/journal.pcbi.1000213Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)) indicates that Lrch4 has an ectodomain composed of a 19 AA N-terminal signal peptide followed by nine LRRs (each 21–23 AA in length), a central disordered region, and a CH motif; this is then followed by a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a short cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). Recent revisions of the NCBI and ENSEMBL database suggest that Lrch4 has splice variants. The transcript support level is a method used by ENSEMBL to rate well-supported versus poorly supported transcript models. Three Lrch4 transcripts are identified at transcript support level 1 (i.e. all splice junctions of the transcript are supported by at least one nonsuspect mRNA). However, one of these (Lrch4-004) has incomplete 5′ and 3′ coding DNA sequences. We therefore focused on Lrch4-001 (referred to herein as variant 1) and Lrch4-002 (referred to as variant 2). Lrch4 variant 1 (680 AAs) is as described above, whereas variant 2 (649 AAs) is truncated C-terminal to the CH and omits the TMD, consistent with a soluble protein. Physiological expression of the predicted variants has not been verified to our knowledge. LRRs are 20–30-AA motifs that exist in thousands of proteins across phylogeny, typically appearing as tandem repeats that together form a solenoid-shaped domain thought to mediate protein–ligand and protein– binding (17Dolan J. Walshe K. Alsbury S. Hokamp K. O'Keeffe S. Okafuji T. Miller S.F. Tear G. Mitchell K.J. The extracellular leucine-rich repeat superfamily; a comparative survey and analysis of evolutionary relationships and expression patterns.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8 (17868438): 32010.1186/1471-2164-8-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Individual LRRs have been grouped based on sequence into seven categorical types, although the functional correlates of these categories remain unclear (18Ng A.C. Eisenberg J.M. Heath R.J. Huett A. Robinson C.M. Nau G.J. Xavier R.J. Human leucine-rich repeat proteins: a genome-wide bioinformatic categorization and functional analysis in innate immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4631-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Alignment of LRR domains between murine Lrch4 and human LRCH4 suggests a very high degree of homology (Table S1), with manual inspection indicating that the majority of murine Lrch4 LRRs fall into the “plant-specific” LRR category, as was recently reported for human Lrch4 in a genome-wide survey of LRR proteins (18Ng A.C. Eisenberg J.M. Heath R.J. Huett A. Robinson C.M. Nau G.J. Xavier R.J. Human leucine-rich repeat proteins: a genome-wide bioinformatic categorization and functional analysis in innate immunity.Proc.

Jones D.T. pGenTHREADER and pDomTHREADER: new methods for improved protein fold recognition and superfamily discrimination.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 (19429599): 1761-176710.1093/bioinformatics/btp302Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the best structural match in the protein database to the LRR domain of Lrch4 is a protein derived from the variable lymphocyte receptor of the jawless vertebrate, the hagfish. The LRR region matches well to known LRR structures, whereas there is less confidence that the N and C termini are modeled accurately. As shown in Fig. 1B, predictive modeling of Lrch4 (green) based on the hagfish protein (cyan) yields the horseshoe-shaped structure typical of LRRs. CH domains play a role in actin binding, although they may mediate additional interactions, especially when found singly rather than in tandem (20Sjöblom B. Ylänne J. Djinovic-Carugo K. Novel structural insights into F-actin-binding and novel functions of calponin homology domains.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18 (18952167): 702-70810.1016/j.sbi.2008.10.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A recent phylogenetic analysis indicated that the convergence of LRRs and CH domains in proteins (i.e. LRCH proteins) occurs rarely and only in animals, with just one protein (LRCH) in Drosophila melanogaster and four (Lrch1–4) in both Mus musculus and Homo sapiens (21Foussard H. Ferrer P. Valenti P. Polesello C. Carreno S. Payre F.

Interestingly, despite the very high degree of homology between murine Lrch4 and human LRCH4, sequence alignment reveals modest homology between murine Lrch4 and Lrch1 (35%), Lrch4 and Lrch2 (34%), and Lrch4 and Lrch3 (43%) (data not shown), suggesting divergent function among Lrch proteins. Expression profiling of transcripts for the four Lrch family members indicates that Lrch4 (detected using primers common to the two variants) is widely expressed across 14 murine tissues, with the most abundant expression in spleen, testes, thymus, intestine, and blood (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, immunoblotting of murine macrophage subcellular fractions for endogenous Lrch4 (using an antibody targeting a region common to variants 1 and 2) confirms that it is predominantly present in the membrane, with lesser expression in the cytoplasm and soluble nuclear fraction, and is detected as a single band in all fractions. Consistent results showing a single band in both RAW 264.7 and primary murine macrophage lysates were obtained with both a commercial anti-Lrch4 antibody and an anti-Lrch4 antibody raised by our laboratory. Given that only variant 1 has a predicted TMD, this finding suggests that, at the protein level, variant 1 is expressed much more highly than variant 2 within the cell. Microscopy of GFP-Lrch4 in HEK293 cells reveals staining that includes a cytoplasmic-type pattern, but formal analysis indicates a high degree of overlap with the plasma membrane stain CellMaskTM (Life Technologies) (22Gokhale N.A. Zaremba A. Janoshazi A.K. Weaver J.D. Shears S.B. PPIP5K1 modulates ligand competition between diphosphoinositol polyphosphates and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 for polyphosphoinositide-binding domains.Biochem.

By contrast, the tGFP vector (control) displays a very different distribution, largely overlapping the nuclear DAPI stain (Fig. 1E). Based on its increase in rafts in response to LPS (13Dhungana S. Merrick B.A. Tomer K.B. Fessler M.B. Quantitative proteomics analysis of macrophage rafts reveals compartmentalized activation of the proteasome and of proteasome-mediated ERK activation in response to lipopolysaccharide.Mol. Cell.

Eisenberg J.M. Heath R.J. Huett A. Robinson C.M. Nau G.J. Xavier R.J. Human leucine-rich repeat proteins: a genome-wide bioinformatic categorization and functional analysis in innate immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4631-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)—we hypothesized that Lrch4 regulates TLR4 activation by LPS. To address this, we generated two stable Lrch4 lentiviral shRNA knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophage lines in parallel with a scrambled (Scr) lentiviral shRNA control line. As shown in Fig. 2A, compared with the Scr line, both knockdown lines achieved ≥50% silencing of Lrch4 mRNA (using probes common to both variants) and protein. Although this degree of knockdown is somewhat modest, it is consistent with past reports using RNAi in macrophages and likely reflects the relatively refractory nature of macrophages to transfection/transduction (23Alper S. Laws R. Lackford B. Boyd W.A. Dunlap P. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A. Identification of innate immunity genes and pathways using a comparative genomics approach.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105 (18463287): 7016-702110.1073/pnas.0802405105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using variant-specific primers, we confirmed that both Lrch4 variants are expressed in the macrophage and that both are knocked down by Lrch4 shRNA (Fig. 2B). Of interest, LPS itself induced down-regulation of mRNA for Lrch4 variants 1 and 2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Confirming a role for Lrch4 in regulation of TLR4 signaling, both Lrch4 knockdown lines induced significantly less TNFα than the Scr line in response to two doses of LPS (Fig. 2C). A similar reduction in LPS-induced TNFα was observed in two Lrch4 disruption clones produced by CRISPR-Cas9 (Fig. 2D). Given that some accessory proteins are reported to regulate signaling by multiple TLRs (e.g. CD14, TRIL (5Lee C.C. Avalos A.M. Ploegh H.L. Accessory molecules for Toll-like receptors and their function.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 (22301850): 168-17910.1038/nri3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar)), we next tested a role for Lrch4 in additional TLR cascades. Lrch4 knockdown attenuated TNFα induction by the TLR1/2 ligand Pam3CSK4 (Fig. 2E), as well as by Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6), imiquimod (TLR7), and ODN2395 (TLR9) (Fig. S2), indicating a broad-spanning role for Lrch4 in regulating plasmalemmal and endosomal TLRs. Induction of granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by both LPS and Pam3CSK4 was also reduced in Lrch4 knockdown cells, indicating that Lrch4 regulates multiple cytokines downstream of TLR2 and TLR4 (Fig. 2E). To test Lrch4 in human cells, we next silenced endogenous Lrch4 in HEK293 cells using an siRNA approach (Fig. 2F). HEK293 cells stably expressing either TLR4/MD-2/CD14 or TLR2 were transfected with Lrch4 siRNA or Scr siRNA and then exposed to LPS or Pam3CSK4, respectively. In preliminary experiments, we found that, in response to these stimuli, these cells produced very little TNFα (data not shown); thus, we surveyed for IL-8 protein production instead, as reported by others (24Trompette A. Divanovic S. Visintin A. Blanchard C. Hegde R.S. Madan R. Thorne P.S. Wills-Karp M. Gioannini T.L. Weiss J.P. Karp C.L. Allergenicity resulting from functional mimicry of a Toll-like receptor complex protein.Nature. 2009; 457 (19060881): 585-58810.1038/nature07548Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2G, Lrch4 siRNA attenuated IL-8 induction by both ligands in HEK293 cells, providing further support that the shRNA results in macrophages are unlikely to reflect off-target effects. Confirming some selectivity for Lrch4 function, Lrch4 silencing did not affect induction of IL-8 by HEK293 cells in response to stimulation with TNFα (Fig. 2H). We next focused on Lrch4 function in the TLR4 pathway. Moving further “upstream” of cytokine protein expression, we confirmed that Lrch4 knockdown also attenuates transcript expression of TNFα and G-CSF in response to LPS (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggested that Lrch4 may regulate LPS induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines at or upstream of transcription. The TLR4 cascade bifurcates immediately downstream of the receptor into two signaling arms defined by alternate usage of the cytoplasmic adaptors, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain–containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) (1Kawai T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors and their crosstalk with other innate receptors in infection and immunity.Immunity. 2011; 34 (21616434): 637-65010.1016/j.immuni.2011.05.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). These so-called “MyD88-dependent” and “MyD88-independent” pathways lead to downstream induction of distinct cytokines, although it is thought that most cytokines likely have some input from both adaptor pathways (25Björkbacka H. Fitzgerald K.A. Huet F. Li X. Gregory J.A. Lee M.A. Ordija C.M. Dowley N.E. Golenbock D.T. Freeman M.W. The induction of macrophage gene expression by LPS predominantly utilizes Myd88-independent signaling cascades.Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 19 (15367722): 319-33010.1152/physiolgenomics.00128.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Expression profiling of MyD88-dependent (Fig. 3C) and -independent (Fig. 3D) cytokines in LPS-stimulated macrophages after Lrch4 silencing indicated a role for Lrch4 in output from both adaptor arms, consistent with it regulating the proximal TLR4 pathway. However, differences in Lrch4 dependence were noted across cytokines, with some cytokines from both adaptor pathways showing dramatic reduction in Lrch4-silenced cells (e.g. IL-10, MCP-1), whereas other cytokines showed a more modest dependence on Lrch4 (e.g. IL-1β, IP-10). Taken together, these findings suggest that Lrch4 acts upstream of the MyD88/TRIF bifurcation in the TLR4 cascade. Moving further upstream in the TLR4 cascade to confirm more directly whether Lrch4 regulates early signaling responses to LPS, we next evaluated activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3. NF-κB is activated by both an early MyD88-dependent and late MyD88-independent (TRIF-dependent) pathway after LPS, whereas IRF3 activation is generally thought to be dependent upon the TRIF pathway (26O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. The family of five: TIR-domain-containing adaptors in Toll-like receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7 (17457343): 353-36410.1038/nri2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, activation of NF-κB in macrophage nuclear isolates was attenuated in Lrch4-silenced cells at both 15 and 30 min after LPS. LPS-induced NF-κB luciferase was also reduced in Lrch4-silenced RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 4B). Finally, PO4-IRF3 was also reduced in the nuclear fraction of Lrch4-silenced macrophages (Fig. 4C), indicating that Lrch4 is required for full LPS-induced activation of IRF3. Similar results for nuclear NF-κB activation, NF-κB luciferase, and PO4-IRF3 were obtained using cells with CRISPR-Cas9–mediated disruption of Lrch4 (Fig. 4, D–F). In addition to NF-κB and IRF3, LPS is well-known to lead to the rapid activation of MAPKs that, in turn, regulate multiple downstream functions including gene expression. Activation of these kinases is thought to be regulated by both MyD88 and TRIF (26O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. The family of five: TIR-domain-containing adaptors in Toll-like receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7 (17457343): 353-36410.1038/nri2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4G, Lrch4-silenced macrophages displayed a marked reduction in LPS-induced p38 activation (phosphorylation). By contrast, JNK phosphorylation was reduced at 15 min but not at 30 min post-LPS, consistent with a delay in its activation by LPS in Lrch4-silenced cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Lrch4 regulates early signaling events in the proximal TLR4 pathway, with effects upon both MyD88 and TRIF arms, but with varying temporal effects on the MAPKs. Consistent with Lrch4 not exerting a global or indiscriminate effect upon TLR4 pathway output, we confirmed that neither silencing nor overexpression of Lrch4 altered cell surface display of TLR4 as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5A and Fig. S3, A and B); nor did Lrch4 silencing or overexpression modify TLR4 gene expression (Fig. 5B). Similarly, Lrch4 knockdown had no effect on expression of the IL-6 receptor (Fig. S3C). Aiming to test whether Lrch4 could nonetheless impact ligand capture in the TLR4 pathway, we assessed cell-surface binding of LPS. Lrch4-silenced cells exhibited a significant, albeit modest reduction in overall surface binding of LPS (Fig. 5C). More remarkably, Lrch4-silenced cells showed reduced co-localization of LPS with the specific lipid raft marker cholera toxin subunit B (CtB; a ligand for the raft ganglioside GM1) (Fig. 5, D and E) (27Yvan-Charvet L.

Together, this suggests that Lrch4 is not just required for quantitative surface capture of LPS, but more specifically for successful delivery of LPS to lipid rafts, the site where CD14 and the TLR4 receptor cluster and are thought to interact (29Triantafilou M. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. Triantafilou K. Mediators of innate immune recognition of bacteria concentrate in lipid rafts and facilitate lipopolysaccharide-induced cell activation.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115 (12045230): 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Testing more directly for a role of Lrch4 in LPS binding, we next performed a streptavidin bead pulldown after exposure of macrophages to biotin-LPS. As shown in Fig. 5G, Lrch4 was detected in the biotin-LPS pulldown (but not in cells treated with nonbiotinylated LPS, as expected), suggesting that it interacts either directly or indirectly with LPS. Lrch4 capture by biotin-LPS was effectively competed by nonbiotinylated LPS, consistent with a bona fide LPS interaction, whereas CD14 pulldown was not notably competed. This finding suggests either differing stoichiometry or avidity to"

In liver cancer, PHB1 acts as a tumor suppressor, but the mechanisms of tumor suppression are incompletely understood. Here we aimed to determine PHB1 target genes to better understand how PHB1 influences liver tumorigenesis. Using RNA-Seq analysis, we found interleukin-8 (IL-8) to be one of the most highly up-regulated genes following PHB1 silencing in HepG2 cells. Induction of IL-8 expression also occurred in multiple liver and nonliver cancer cell lines. We examined samples from 178 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and found that IL-8 mRNA levels were increased, whereas PHB1 mRNA levels were decreased, in the tumors compared with adjacent nontumorous tissues. Notably, HCC patients with high IL-8 expression have significantly reduced survival. An inverse correlation between PHB1 and IL-8 mRNA levels is found in HCCs with reduced PHB1 expression. To understand the molecular basis for these observations, we altered PHB1 levels in liver cancer cells. Overexpression of PHB1 resulted in lowered IL-8 expression and secretion. Silencing PHB1 increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB activity, induced nuclear accumulation of c-JUN and p65, and enhanced their binding to the IL-8 promoter containing AP-1 and NF-κB elements. Conditioned medium from PHB1-silenced HepG2 cells increased migration and invasion of parental HepG2 and SK-hep-1 cells, and this was blocked by co-treatment with neutralizing IL-8 antibody. In summary, our findings show that reduced PHB1 expression induces IL-8 transcription by activating NF-κB and AP-1, resulting in enhanced IL-8 expression and release to promote tumorigenesis.

Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed protein with diverse functions located in multiple cellular compartments. PHB1 was first identified as a mitochondrial chaperone that is essential for function and biogenesis of mitochondria (1Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J.

Nuclear PHB1 interacts with many proteins, including retinoblastoma and p53, where it serves as a transcriptional cofactor repressing or activating the transcriptional activities of E2F (2Choi D.

PHB1 was thought to act as a tumor suppressor because its expression was suppressed after partial hepatectomy prior to liver regeneration (5McClung J.K. Danner D.B. Stewart D.A. Smith J.R.

However, the role of PHB1 in cancer remains controversial because PHB1 is overexpressed in some cancers (6Rajalingam K. Wunder C. Brinkmann V. Churin Y. Hekman M. Sievers C. Rapp U.R. Rudel T. Prohibitin is required for Ras-induced Raf-MEK-ERK activation and epithelial cell migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7 (16041367): 837-84310.1038/ncb1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PHB1 clearly has a tumor-suppressive role in breast, gastric, and prostate cancers (7Koushyar S. Jiang W.G. Dart D.A. Unveiling the potential of prohibitin in cancer.Cancer Lett. 2015; 369 (26450374): 316-32210.1016/j.canlet.2015.09.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Liu T. Tang H. Lang Y. Liu M. Li X.

In addition, reduced PHB1 expression occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammatory condition that predisposes to colon cancer, and overexpression of PHB1 inhibits colitis-associated colon cancer tumorigenesis in mice (9Kathiria A.S.

We found that hepatic PHB1 expression is down-regulated at the mRNA level in the majority of human patients with HCC and CCA, and reduced PHB1 expression increases the growth of HCC and CCA cells and inversely correlates with tumor growth in the murine CCA model (13Fan W.

In the course of our investigation, we uncovered the finding that PHB1 negatively regulates the expression of the pro-tumorigenic interleukin-8 (IL-8) at the transcriptional level. Loss of PHB1 in multiple cancer cell lines increases the expression of IL-8, which in turn increases the migration and invasion properties of these cells. Our findings are confirmed in human HCC samples and suggest that PHB1 plays an important role in suppressing the development of liver cancers by multiple mechanisms. To identify PHB1-regulated genes, PHB1 was silenced in HepG2 cells and then subjected to RNA sequencing. Seventy-two hours of silencing of PHB1 was required to achieve efficient knockdown at the protein level, and no effect was observed on cell viability at this time (Fig. S1, A and B). After pathway enrichment analysis, genes related to cancers were the most highly altered (4.54% of genes) (Fig. 1A). Examining the up-regulated genes in the cancer pathways revealed that IL-8, platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFB1) were highly up-regulated (Fig. 1B). These findings were confirmed using real-time PCR in HepG2 cells after 72 h of PHB1 silencing (Fig. 1C). We focused our efforts on IL-8, as it is the most up-regulated gene in the cancer pathways. Silencing PHB1 also raised IL-8 mRNA levels in multiple cancer cell lines of different sources, including HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma), Huh7 (HCC), and Mz-ChA1 (biliary adenocarcinoma) (Fig. 1D and second siRNA shown in Fig. S1C). To assess the clinical relevance of PHB1 and IL-8 in HCC, the mRNA levels of PHB1 and IL-8 in 178 patients with HCC were measured. PHB1 mRNA levels were lower in HCC compared with adjacent nontumorous tissue, whereas IL-8 mRNA levels were higher (Fig. 2A). However, there was no correlation between PHB1 and IL-8 mRNA levels when all of the HCC samples were analyzed (p = 0.22) (data not shown). Because the patient samples were likely to be highly heterogeneous, we clustered the patients into three subgroups (subtypes): cluster I with elevated PHB1 but lower IL-8 mRNA levels compared with adjacent NT (58 of 178 patients), cluster II with reduced expression of PHB1 (91 of 178 patients with PHB1 mRNA levels of 28% ± 2% of adjacent NT), and cluster III with higher PHB1 and IL-8 mRNA levels compared with adjacent NT (29 of 178 patients), as shown in Fig. 2B. We examined the correlations between PHB1 and IL-8 expression in each patient subgroup and detected a significant negative correlation between PHB1 and IL-8 mRNA levels in cluster II (p = 0.02), where HCC PHB1 expression was reduced, as shown in Fig. 2C. IL-8 mRNA levels were also elevated compared with adjacent normal samples in multiple gene expression omnibus datasets of HCC (Fig. 2D). Poor patient outcome also correlated with higher IL-8 mRNA levels, as low levels had a 60% chance of survival after 2,500 days compared with a 20% chance of survival in patients with high levels (Fig. 2E). As IL-8 is a cytokine that is secreted from the cell to exert autocrine and paracrine effects on neighboring cells, we examined levels of this protein upon silencing of PHB1 in several liver cancer cell lines. Silencing PHB1 caused an increase in both the intracellular and secreted protein levels of IL-8 compared with the scramble siRNA control in HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B cell lines (Fig. 3A). Conversely, when PHB1 was overexpressed in Huh7 and Hep3B cells, IL-8 mRNA levels fell by 50–60% (Fig. 3B), whereas intracellular IL-8 protein levels dropped by 75% (Fig. 3C). A significant drop in secreted IL-8 protein (>50%) was also observed in both liver cancer cell lines (Fig. 3C). Overexpression of PHB1 was not explored in HepG2 cells, as basal IL-8 expression is very low (Fig. 3A). Previous studies have shown that p38 can regulate IL-8 mRNA stability, whereas JNK, NF-κB, and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) can transcriptionally regulate IL-8 (15Jundi K. Greene C.M. Transcription of interleukin-8: how altered regulation can affect cystic fibrosis lung disease.Biomolecules. 2015; 5 (26140537): 1386-139810.3390/biom5031386Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Gangwani M.R.

Silencing PHB1 in HepG2 cells resulted in a marked increase in the levels of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) and p38 (p-p38) but a slight increase in total JNK, whereas total p38 was unchanged. This led to a dramatic increase in the p-JNK:JNK and p-p38:p38 ratios (Fig. 4B). Both p-ERK and total ERK levels showed a slight increase so that p-ERK:ERK was unchanged (Fig. 4B). To find out whether the PHB1 silencing–mediated increase in IL-8 expression was due to known IL-8 regulators, inhibitors against p38, NF-κB, and JNK were used in combination with PHB1 silencing to see the effect on IL-8 mRNA levels. Use of any of the inhibitors had no effect on IL-8 mRNA levels when PHB1 was present. Upon PHB1 silencing, IL-8 mRNA levels increased 9-fold, which was unaffected by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. S1D). However, when either of the inhibitors against NF-κB (JSH) or JNK (SP) was used, IL-8 induction because of PHB1 silencing was reduced by 40%, but combining JSH with SP resulted in nearly complete inhibition of IL-8 induction (Fig. 4C). This supports that the effect of PHB1 silencing on IL-8 induction is mediated via JNK and NF-κB. To further elucidate JNK and NF-κB's roles in the up-regulation of IL-8, promoter luciferase reporter constructs of human IL-8 were created. The human IL-8 promoter contains both NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites. Upon silencing of PHB1, the promoter activity of both NF-κB and AP-1 increased 6- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 5A). To define which binding sites were involved in the induction of IL-8 expression, HepG2 cells were transfected with PHB1 siRNA, and the effects on the full-length IL-8 promoter (−1450/+154) or a shorter IL-8-promoter (−162/+44) that was WT or mutated in the AP-1 or NF-κB elements were measured. The full-length construct (−1450/+154) and the shorter WT construct (−162/+44) showed comparable increases in promoter activity when PHB1 was silenced, suggesting that the −162/+44 construct contains all essential elements that mediate this induction (Fig. 5B). However, the basal activity was reduced when the AP-1 binding site was mutated and was completely abolished upon mutation of the NF-κB site (Fig. 5B). Silencing PHB1 failed to increase IL-8 promoter activity when either the AP-1 or NF-κB site was mutated (Fig. 5B). To confirm the importance of NF-κB and AP-1, the levels of the p65 and c-JUN were examined in the nuclear fraction of HepG2 cells after PHB1 silencing. A 6-fold increase in c-JUN level was observed in PHB1-silenced cells as well as a 2-fold increase in p65 level (Fig. 5C). ChIP-quantitative PCR also confirmed the increase in both p65 and c-JUN binding to the IL-8 promoter when PHB1 was silenced (Fig. 5D). Elevation in the nuclear p65 level is a result of canonical NF-κB activation, as shown by early phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) and IκBα 24 h after silencing PHB1, followed by a drop in IκBα protein level at 48–72 h (Fig. 5E). Because PHB1 can act as a transcription co-factor to modulate the activity of p53, E2F, and c-MYC (2Choi D. Lee S.J. Hong S. Kim I.H. Kang S.

We found that PHB1 is unable to bind to the DNA by itself (Fig. 6B) or in the presence of p50, p65, or c-FOS (Fig. 6, C–E), but it was able to bind in the presence of c-JUN (Fig. 6F). This raises the possibility that PHB1 could also act as a co-repressor of the AP-1 site. Because PHB1 is a well-known mitochondrial chaperone, we next investigated whether mitochondrial dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be the underlying mechanism for activation of JNK and NF-κB. Mitochondrial membrane potential and both mitochondrial and total ROS were measured following 48 and 72 h of treatment with PHB1 siRNA or scramble control, and no significant change was observed in these variables (Fig. S1A–S1C). Another possibility is transforming growth factor β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which is known to activate JNK, p38, and NF-κB (18Gui T. Sun Y. Shimokado A. Muragaki Y. The roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Signal Transduct. 2012; 2012 (22363839): 28924310.1155/2012/289243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PHB1 silencing did not activate TAK1 (indicated by p-TAK1), which was only detectable in the presence of calyculin A (Fig. S2D) (19Omori E. Inagaki M. Mishina Y. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Epithelial transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is activated through two independent mechanisms and regulates reactive oxygen species.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Previous work has shown that IL-8 production from cancer cells increases the migration of adjacent cells (20Fernando R.I. Castillo M.D. Litzinger M. Hamilton D.H. Palena C. IL-8 signaling plays a critical role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human carcinoma cells.Cancer Res. 2011; 71 (21653678): 5296-530610.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0156Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To explore whether silencing of PHB1 could affect the migration of parental cells, conditioned medium (CM) from PHB1-silenced HepG2 cells was used on HepG2, a noninvasive epithelial cell line, and SK-hep-1 cells, a highly invasive human hepatic adenocarcinoma cell line with oncogenic mesenchymal stem cell features (21Eun J.R. Jung Y.J. Zhang Y. Zhang Y. Tschudy-Seney B. Ramsamooj R. Wan Y.J. Theise N.D. Zern M.A. Duan Y. Hepatoma SK Hep-1 cells exhibit characteristics of oncogenic mesenchymal stem cells with highly metastatic capacity.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (25338121): e11074410.1371/journal.pone.0110744Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both cell lines displayed an increase in cell migration using CM from PHB1-silenced HepG2 cells compared with the scramble control, which was significantly attenuated or inhibited when co-treated with a neutralizing IL-8 antibody (Fig. 7, A and B). Furthermore, the effects of CM on invasion in SK-hep-1 cells was examined, and CM from PHB1-silenced HepG2 cells increased cell invasion, which was attenuated upon co-treatment with the neutralizing IL-8 antibody (Fig. 7C). Although PHB1 is best known as a mitochondrial chaperone protein, increasing evidence shows that it has many other important functions, some of which pertain to cancer. Subcellular localization and posttranslational modifications may explain the tumor-regulatory activity of PHB1 in different cell types (14Ramani K. Mavila N. Ko K.S. Mato J.M. Lu S.C.

Our recent structural study on the monomeric RING E3 RNF38 showed that backside-bound Ub (UbB) stimulates RNF38-catalyzed Ub transfer by restricting the flexibility of UbcH5B’s α1 and α1β1-loop to stabilize the closed active RNF38 RING-UbcH5B–Ub complex, thereby enhancing the rate of catalysis (25Buetow L.

It remains unclear whether this mechanism is conserved for dimeric RING E3s. To better understand how dimeric cIAP1 RING domain (cIAP1R) activates E2∼Ub for Ub transfer and how UbB could influence this process, we present a crystal structure of cIAP1R bound to UbcH5B–Ub and UbB. Structural and biochemical analyses showed that cIAP1R forms multiple contacts with UbcH5B–Ub to stabilize it in a closed conformation. Notably, the C-terminal tail of cIAP1R functions in trans to stabilize the closed UbcH5B–Ub conformation, thereby explaining the importance of RING domain dimerization, and consistent with prior examples of dimeric RING E3s. Last, UbB restrains UbcH5B’s α1β1-loop conformation to stabilize contacts with donor Ub (i.e. Ub conjugated to UbcH5B; hereafter UbD). This interaction augments stabilization of the closed UbcH5B–Ub conformation, thereby enhancing Ub transfer. Our results reveal a conserved UbB-stimulatory mechanism for both monomeric and dimeric RING E3s in mediating UbcH5B∼Ub transfer. Previously, we showed that the addition of UbΔGG (lacking the C-terminal diglycine motif) can serve as UbB and bind to UbcH5B’s backside to stimulate UbcH5B∼Ub discharge catalyzed by the monomeric RING E3 RNF38 and dimeric RING E3 XIAP. To assess whether UbB can exert similar effects on cIAP1R-catalyzed Ub transfer, we performed single-turnover lysine discharge assays using WT and S22R UbcH5B. S22R substitution abrogates the UbB-UbcH5B interaction and was therefore used as a control (25Buetow L. Gabrielsen M. Anthony N.G. Dou H. Patel A. Aitkenhead H. Sibbet G.J. Smith B.O. Huang D.T.

UbcH5B variants were precharged with equimolar concentrations of 32P-Ub and then chased by the addition of cIAP1R alone and in the presence of UbΔGG, which cannot be charged by E1 but can still bind to the backside of UbcH5B WT. The addition of 300 μm UbΔGG stimulated the discharge of UbcH5B∼Ub but had no effect on UbcH5B S22R∼Ub (Fig. 1A), indicating that UbB stimulates cIAP1R-catalyzed Ub transfer. Our prior study showed that UbB stimulates RNF38 and XIAP-catalyzed Ub transfer by enhancing RING E3 affinity for UbcH5B–Ub by ∼5–10-fold (25Buetow L. Gabrielsen M. Anthony N.G. Dou H. Patel A.

To determine whether UbB functions in a similar manner to stimulate cIAP1R-catalyzed Ub transfer, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to investigate the effects of UbB on cIAP1R’s affinity for UbcH5B–Ub. We generated stable UbcH5B–Ub complex by mutating UbcH5B’s catalytic cysteine (Cys85) to lysine, thereby forming a stable amide linkage that mimics the thioester linkage (22Plechanovová A.

UbcH5B C85K and UbcH5B S22R C85K covalently linked to Ub (hereafter referred to as UbcH5B–Ub and UbcH5BS22R–Ub, respectively) were generated to assess the effect of backside binding. cIAP1R exhibited weak binding affinity for UbcH5B alone, but displayed ∼270-fold higher binding affinity for UbcH5B–Ub (Table 1 and Fig. S1), suggesting that UbD contributes to RING domain binding, consistent with previous observations with other RING E3s (23Dou H.

In contrast, the addition of excess UbΔGG had no effect on cIAP1R’s affinity for UbcH5BS22R–Ub, suggesting that UbB-UbcH5B interaction enhances cIAP1R’s affinity for UbcH5B–Ub.Table 1Kd values for interactions between cIAP1R, UbcH5B, UbcH5B–Ub variants, and UbImmobilized proteinAnalyteKdμmGST-cIAP1RUbcH5B223 ± 4GST-cIAP1RUbcH5B–Ub0.83 ± 0.05GST-cIAP1RUbcH5B–Ub + 0.6 mm UbΔGG0.22 ± 0.01GST-cIAP1RUbcH5BS22R–Ub0.90 ± 0.01GST-cIAP1RUbcH5BS22R–Ub + 0.6 mm UbΔGG0.99 ± 0.05GST-UbUbcH5B–Ub + excess cIAP1R13 ± 2 Open table in a new tab We showed previously that UbB binds UbcH5B–Ub with a Kd of ∼280 μm, but, in the presence of the monomeric RING E3 RNF38, the Kd improved by 20-fold (Kd of 14 μm), revealing a synergistic effect in RNF38-UbcH5B–Ub and UbB-UbcH5B binding (25Buetow L.

Similar to our prior observation, we found that Ub displayed a Kd of 13 μm for UbcH5B–Ub in the presence of cIAP1R (Table 1 and Fig. S1), suggesting that this binding synergy is conserved. To verify the improved UbB-UbcH5B interaction in the presence of cIAP1R, we performed single-turnover lysine discharge assays using 20 μm UbΔGG, which is just above the Kd of 13 μm, and showed that it was sufficient to stimulate cIAP1R-catalyzed Ub transfer (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we showed that UbcH5B S22R,F62A,P95D–Ub, a stable isopeptide conjugate that cannot bind RING E3 or UbB but can serve as the UbB source (25Buetow L. Gabrielsen M. Anthony N.G. Dou H.

https://openalex.org/W2904633293,"The epigenetic enzyme p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) belongs to the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family together with GCN5. Although its transcriptional and post-translational function is well characterized, little is known about its properties as regulator of cell metabolism. Here, we report the mitochondrial localization of PCAF conferred by an 85 aa mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) at the N-terminal region of the protein. In mitochondria, one of the PCAF targets is the isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) acetylated at lysine 180. This PCAF-regulated post-translational modification might reduce IDH2 affinity for isocitrate as a result of a conformational shift involving predictively the tyrosine at position 179. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies indicate that PCAF regulates IDH2, acting at dual level during myoblast differentiation: at a transcriptional level together with MyoD, and at a post-translational level by direct modification of lysine acetylation in mitochondria. The latter event determines a decrease in IDH2 function with negative consequences on muscle fiber formation in C2C12 cells. Indeed, a MTS-deprived PCAF does not localize into mitochondria, remains enriched into the nucleus, and contributes to a significant increase of muscle-specific gene expression enhancing muscle differentiation. The role of PCAF in mitochondria is a novel finding shedding light on metabolic processes relevant to early muscle precursor differentiation.-Savoia, M., Cencioni, C., Mori, M., Atlante, S., Zaccagnini, G., Devanna, P., Di Marcotullio, L., Botta, B., Martelli, F., Zeiher, A.

Controlled by multiple post-translational modifications, MEF2D is an effector for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN, PP2B, and PPP3). CaN-catalyzed dephosphorylation promotes the desumoylation and acetylation of MEF2D, increasing its transcriptional activity. Both MEF2D and CaN bind the scaffold protein muscle A-kinase–anchoring protein β (mAKAPβ), which is localized to the nuclear envelope, such that C2C12 skeletal myoblast differentiation and neonatal rat ventricular myocyte hypertrophy are inhibited by mAKAPβ signalosome targeting. Using immunoprecipitation and DNA-binding assays, we now show that the formation of mAKAPβ signalosomes is required for MEF2D dephosphorylation, desumoylation, and acetylation in C2C12 cells. Reduced MEF2D phosphorylation was coupled to a switch from type IIa histone deacetylase to p300 histone acetylase binding that correlated with increased MEF2D-dependent gene expression and ventricular myocyte hypertrophy. Together, these results highlight the importance of mAKAPβ signalosomes for regulating MEF2D activity in striated muscle, affirming mAKAPβ as a nodal regulator in the myocyte intracellular signaling network.

Normal AP-1 function requires proteins of the HEAT repeat–containing 5 (HEATR5) family. Although HEATR5 proteins were first identified based on their ability to interact with AP-1, the functional significance of this interaction was unknown. We used bioinformatics-based phenotypic profiling and information from genome-wide fluorescence microscopy studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify a protein, Laa2, that mediates the interaction between AP-1 and the yeast HEATR5 protein Laa1. Further characterization of Laa2 revealed that it binds to both Laa1 and AP-1. Laa2 contains a motif similar to the characterized γ-ear–binding sites found in other AP-1–binding proteins. This motif in Laa2 is essential for the Laa1–AP-1 interaction. Moreover, mutation of this motif disrupted AP-1 localization and function and caused effects similar to mutations that remove the γ-ear of AP-1. These results indicate that Laa2 mediates the interaction between Laa1 and AP-1 and reveal that this interaction promotes the stable association of AP-1 with membranes in yeast.

https://openalex.org/W2905201619,"CD34+ cells are promising for revascularization therapy, but their clinical use is limited by low cell counts, poor engraftment, and reduced function after transplantation. In this study, a collagen type I biomaterial was used to expand and enhance the function of human peripheral blood CD34+ cells, and potential underlying mechanisms were examined. Compared to the fibronectin control substrate, biomaterial-cultured CD34+ cells from healthy donors had enhanced proliferation, migration toward VEGF, angiogenic potential, and increased secretion of CD63+CD81+ extracellular vesicles (EVs). In the biomaterial-derived EVs, greater levels of the angiogenic microRNAs (miRs), miR-21 and -210, were detected. Notably, biomaterial-cultured CD34+ cells had reduced mRNA and protein levels of Sprouty (Spry)1, which is an miR-21 target and negative regulator of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Similar to the results of healthy donor cells, biomaterial culture increased miR-21 and -210 expression in CD34+ cells from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, which also exhibited improved VEGF-mediated migration and angiogenic capacity. Therefore, collagen biomaterial culture may be useful for expanding the number and enhancing the function of CD34+ cells in patients, possibly mediated through suppression of Spry1 activity by EV-derived miR-21. These results may provide a strategy to enhance the therapeutic potency of CD34+ cells for vascular regeneration.-McNeill, B., Ostojic, A., Rayner, K. J., Ruel, M., Suuronen, E. J.

https://openalex.org/W2904719818,"Hepatic insulin resistance in the setting of steatosis is attributable at least in part to the accumulation of bioactive lipids that suppress insulin signaling. The mitochondria-associated glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 (GPAT1) catalyzes the first committed step in glycerolipid synthesis, and its activity diverts fatty acids from mitochondrial β-oxidation. GPAT1 overexpression in mouse liver leads to hepatic steatosis even in the absence of overnutrition. The mice develop insulin resistance owing to the generation of saturated diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid molecular species that reduce insulin signaling by activating PKCϵ and by suppressing mTORC2, respectively. Them2, a mitochondria-associated acyl-CoA thioesterase, also participates in the trafficking of fatty acids into oxidative versus glycerolipid biosynthetic pathways. Them2-/- mice are protected against diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. To determine whether Them2 contributes to hepatic insulin resistance due to hepatic overexpression of GPAT1, recombinant adenovirus was used to overexpress GPAT1 in livers of chow-fed Them2+/+ and Them2-/- mice. Hepatic GPAT1 overexpression led to steatosis in both genotypes. In the setting of GPAT1 overexpression, glucose tolerance was reduced in Them2+/+ but not Them2-/- mice, without influencing whole-body insulin sensitivity or basal hepatic glucose production. Improved glucose tolerance in Them2-/- mice was associated with reduced PKCϵ translocation. Preserved insulin receptor activity was supported by Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt following GPAT1 overexpression in Them2-/- hepatocytes. These findings suggest a pathogenic role of Them2 in the biosynthesis of glycerolipid metabolites that promote hepatic insulin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2905277278,"Dysregulation of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in the progression of many cancers. Antibodies targeting the dimerization domains of family members EGFR and HER2 are approved cancer therapeutics, but efficacy is restricted to a subset of tumors and resistance often develops in response to treatment. A third family member, HER3, heterodimerizes with both EGFR and HER2 and has also been implicated in cancer. Consequently, there is strong interest in developing antibodies that target HER3, but to date, no therapeutics have been approved. To aid the development of anti-HER3 antibodies as cancer therapeutics, we combined antibody engineering and functional genomics screens to identify putative mechanisms of resistance or synthetic lethality with antibody-mediated anti-proliferative effects. We developed a synthetic antibody called IgG 95, which binds to HER3 and promotes ubiquitination, internalization, and receptor down-regulation. Using an shRNA library targeting enzymes in the ubiquitin proteasome system, we screened for genes that effect response to IgG 95 and uncovered the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 as a driver of IgG 95 anti-proliferative activity. RNF41 has been shown previously to regulate HER3 levels under normal conditions and we now show that it is also responsible for down-regulation of HER3 upon treatment with IgG 95. Moreover, our findings suggest that down-regulation of RNF41 itself may be a mechanism for acquired resistance to treatment with IgG 95 and perhaps other anti-HER3 antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2902328577,"We were ecstatic when our supervisors allowed us to work remotely. Friends in graduate school, we hadn't worked in the same place in years. But our lives had taken a similar turn. Paul—a scientist at a state agency at the time—was living apart from his wife on weekdays. Every Friday he'd leave his office and drive 3 hours to spend the weekend at home, but with his wife pregnant with their first child, that situation would soon become untenable. Lauren, a newly married postdoc, lived in a different state than her husband and was growing weary of long-distance romance. Our work lives revolved around computer analyses and writing, so remote work was feasible. It seemed like an ideal solution.

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

Paul, an introvert, harbored fantasies of burying himself in computer tasks, free of the noise and distractions of offices. But when he started to work from home, he struggled to maintain focus and avoid getting sucked into house chores. As Wisconsin's bitter winter took hold, snow buried his office window, and he felt closed in. Three months into his new arrangement, he learned that Lauren, an extrovert, was also working from home. He found some relief in learning that she, too, was struggling with isolation.

We weren't about to give up on remote work, but we needed better ways to cope. The two of us began to email back and forth, sharing challenges we faced and methods we'd found helpful for staying productive. After we got into the swing of things, we surveyed 16 other remote scientists to generate some tips for success.

SET REALISTIC GOALS. When you don't have a boss looking over your shoulder, you become your own taskmaster. Setting small, manageable daily tasks that contribute to your longer-term goals can help keep you on track. Make sure to hold yourself accountable, for instance by scheduling regular check-ins with a supervisor or colleague.

BE CONSISTENT. Wake up each morning, change out of your pajamas, and maintain a regular schedule. Act as if you have a job to go to—because, after all, you do.

REDUCE DISTRACTIONS. Do not let laundry, dishwashing, cleaning, and other chores consume your workday. You may also have to guard against social disruptions, as some people seem to think that if you work remotely, you can do whatever you want at any time of day.

CREATE A DISCRETE WORKSPACE. When you're working, be at work—both mentally and physically. It helps to have a separate office. If that's not possible, try to arrange your furniture in a way that distinguishes your work and nonwork space.

REWARD PRODUCTIVITY. If you are productive for an hour or two and accomplish a task, then treat yourself to a 15-minute break. Get a cup of coffee, take a walk, browse the internet, play with your dog, or do something else that you enjoy.

SEEK OUT HUMAN INTERACTION. Scientific discovery is collaborative, and it can be difficult to interact with colleagues while working from home. Get out and attend meetings and conferences. Schedule Skype calls with other scientists or communicate via Slack. Consider spending a few hours working in a social setting such as a coffee shop.

When we first started to work remotely, we suffered from feelings of entrapment and isolation. But now—3.5 years in for Paul and 2 years in for Lauren—we've learned how to manage our new arrangement so that we can be productive scientists and live in the same city as our loved ones. We're not planning on a lifetime of full-time remote work—in fact, Lauren's remote journey will be over when she starts a faculty position next month—but we have to say that remote working has its perks. For one thing, it's hard to complain about a 10-second commute.
