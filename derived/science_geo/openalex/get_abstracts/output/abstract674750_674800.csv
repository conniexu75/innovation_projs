https://openalex.org/W3164976416,"The accurate identification of urban functional areas is of great significance for optimizing urban spatial structure, rationally allocating spatial elements, and promoting the sustainable development of the city. This paper proposes a method to precisely identify urban functional areas by coupling Open Street Map (OSM) and Point of Interest (POI) data. It takes the central urban area of Hangzhou as a case study to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of the functional areas. The results show that: (1) The central urban areas of Hangzhou are divided into 21 functional areas (6 single functional areas, 14 mixed functional areas and 1 comprehensive functional area). (2) The single functional areas and the mixed functional areas show the geographical distribution characteristics of the looping stratification, which means ""Core-periphery"" differentiation is obvious, and the comprehensive functional area is relatively scattered. (3) The mixed degree of regional function with ecological function and production function is low while comprehensive functional areas are usually associated with higher potential and vitality. (4) The identification results are in great agreement with the actual situation of Hangzhou central urban area, and the method is feasible. Therefore, this paper can provide a reference for urban development planning and management."

A total of 170 adult patients were enrolled and all-cause mortality was found to be 39% (67/170). Most non-survivors were above 60 years of age (64%) while gender distribution was quite similar in both groups (males: 77% vs 78%). Most (80.6%) non-survivors came with peripheral oxygen saturation less than 93% while 95% of them had critical disease on arrival. Use of non-invasive ventilation in emergency room was higher among non-survivors (56.7%) versus survivors (26.2%). Median Interleukin-6 levels were higher among non-survivors (78.6: IQR = 33.8–49.0) compared to survivors (21.8: IQR = 12.6–36.3). Most patients in the non-survivor group (86.6%) required invasive ventilator support during hospital stay compared to 7.8% in the survivors. The median duration of ICU stay was longer for non-survivors (9: IQR = 6–12) compared to survivors (5: IQR = 3–7) days. Univariable binary logistic regression showed that age above 60 years, oxygen saturation below 93%, Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio above 5, procalcitonin above 2ng/ml, unit increase in SOFA score and arterial lactate levels were associated with mortality. We also found that a unit decrease in Pao2/FiO2 ratio and serum albumin were associated with mortality in our patients. Multivariable regression showed that age above 60 years (aOR = 3.4: 95% CI = 1.6–6.9), peripheral oxygen saturation below 93% (aOR = 3.5:95% CI = 1.6–7.7) and serum pro-calcitonin above 2ng/ml (aOR = 4.8; 95% CI = 1.9–12.2) were associated with higher odds of mortality when adjusted by month of admission. Most common cause of death was multisystem organ failure in 35 (56.6%) non-survivors while 22 (35.5%) died due to respiratory failure. Larger prospective studies are needed to further strengthen these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3164911316,"Although Parkinson disease (PD) causes profound balance impairments, we know very little about how PD impacts the sensorimotor networks we rely on for automatically maintaining balance control. In young healthy people and animals, muscles are activated in a precise temporal and spatial organization when the center of body mass (CoM) is unexpectedly moved that is largely automatic and determined by feedback of CoM motion. Here, we show that PD alters the sensitivity of the sensorimotor feedback transformation. Importantly, sensorimotor feedback transformations for balance in PD remain temporally precise, but become spatially diffuse by recruiting additional muscle activity in antagonist muscles during balance responses. The abnormal antagonist muscle activity remains precisely time-locked to sensorimotor feedback signals encoding undesirable motion of the body in space. Further, among people with PD, the sensitivity of abnormal antagonist muscle activity to CoM motion varies directly with the number of recent falls. Our work shows that in people with PD, sensorimotor feedback transformations for balance are intact but disinhibited in antagonist muscles, likely contributing to balance deficits and falls."
https://openalex.org/W3164943848,"Background/purpose An increased prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Western countries. Both intestinal inflammation and metabolic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD-associated NAFLD. The burden of NAFLD is not clear in the Asian population. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of NAFLD and liver fibrosis in a cohort of Taiwanese patients with IBD. Methods From January to December 2019, patients with IBD who underwent ultrasound examination were enrolled. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were measured with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) using FibroScan. Patients with a history of excessive alcohol or recent steroid use were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results A total of 81 consecutive patients were enrolled and included in the analysis (45 with ulcerative colitis, 36 with Crohn’s disease). The median age was 42 years old. The patients were classified in terms of body mass index as normal weight (54.3%), underweight (11.1%), overweight (28.4%), and obese (6.2%). The mean CAP increased to 162.22 dB/m in the underweight group, 210.86 dB/m in the normal weight group, 260.7 dB/m in the overweight group, and 274.0 dB/m in the obese group. NAFLD was observed in 29.6% of the patients, 1.2% of which had significant fibrosis. Increased body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–1.62) and older age at IBD diagnosis (OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1–1.11) was found to be associated with the presence of NAFLD. Conclusion In this study, the prevalence of NAFLD was lower (29.6%) in IBD patients than in the Western population. Higher BMI and older age were associated with NAFLD in our study."
https://openalex.org/W3165496212,"India's Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) is the world's largest health assurance scheme providing health cover of 500,000 INR (about USD 6,800) per family per year. It provides financial support for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization expenses to about 500 million of India's poorest households through various insurance models with care delivered by public and private empanelled providers. This study undertook to describe the provider empanelment of PM-JAY, a key element of its functioning and determinant of its impact.We carried out secondary analysis of cross-sectional administrative program data publicly available in PM-JAY portal for 30 Indian states and 06 UTs. We analysed the state wise distribution, type and sector of empanelled hospitals and services offered through PM-JAY scheme across all the states and UTs.We found that out of the total facilities empanelled (N = 20,257) under the scheme in 2020, more than half (N = 11,367, 56%) were in the public sector, while 8,157 (40%) facilities were private for profit, and 733 (4%) were private not for profit entities. State wise distribution of hospitals showed that five states (Karnataka (N = 2,996, 14.9%), Gujarat (N = 2,672, 13.3%), Uttar Pradesh (N = 2,627, 13%), Tamil Nadu (N = 2315, 11.5%) and Rajasthan (N = 2,093 facilities, 10.4%) contributed to more than 60% of empanelled PMJAY facilities: We also observed that 40% of facilities were offering between two and five specialties while 14% of empanelled hospitals provided 21-24 specialties.A majority of the hospital empanelled under the scheme are in states with previous experience of implementing publicly funded health insurance schemes, with the exception of Uttar Pradesh. Reasons underlying these patterns of empanelment as well as the impact of empanelment on service access, utilisation, population health and financial risk protection warrant further study. While the inclusion and regulation of the private sector is a goal that may be served by empanelment, the role of public sector remains critical, particularly in underserved areas of India."
https://openalex.org/W3164751138,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and may therefore be a suitable population for COVID-19 vaccine trials. We conducted a survey to evaluate willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials in a population of HCWs at three hospitals in Uganda.The survey was conducted between September and November 2020. Using a standardised questionnaire, data were collected on socio-demographics, previous participation in health research, COVID-19 information sources, underlying health conditions, and willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Data were analysed descriptively and a binomial generalised linear model with a log link function used to investigate factors associated with unwillingness to participate.657 HCWs (female, 63%) were enrolled with a mean age of 33 years (Standard Deviation, 10). Overall willingness-to-participate was 70.2%. Key motivating factors for participation were: hope of being protected against COVID-19 (81.1%), altruism (73.3%), and the opportunity to get health care (26.0%). Selected hypothetical trial attributes reduced willingness-to-participate as follows: weekly-quarterly study visits over a 12-month period (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); provision of approximately 50ml of blood at each study visit (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); risk of mild-moderate local adverse reactions (70.2%-60.3%, P<0.001); chance of receiving candidate vaccine or placebo (70.2%-56.9%, P<0.001); and delay of pregnancy [Overall, 70.2%-57.1% P<0.001); Female, 62.8%-48.4% (P = 0.002); Male, 82.5%-71.5% (P = 0.003)]. Collectively, these attributes reduced willingness-to-participate from [70.2%-42.2% (P<0.001) overall; 82.5%-58.1% (P<0.001) in men; 62.8%-32.6% (P<0.001) in women]. Among individuals that were unwilling to participate, the commonest barriers were concerns over vaccine safety (54.6%) and fear of catching SARS-CoV-2 (31.6%). Unwillingness to participate was associated with being female (aRR 1.97, CI 1.46-2.67, P<0.001) and having university or other higher-level education (aRR 1.52, CI 1.05-2.2, P = 0.026).Willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials among HCWs in Uganda is high but may be affected by vaccine trial requirements and concerns about the safety of candidate vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3126617840,"Background In order to manage the COVID-19 systemic inflammatory response, it is important to identify clinicopathological characteristics across multiple cohorts. Methods The aim of the present study was to compare the 4C mortality score, other measures of the systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in two consecutive cohorts of patients on admission with COVID-19. Electronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17/3/2020–1/5/2020) and (cohort 2: 18/5/2020–6/7/2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. Results Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p&lt;0.001), more likely to be female (p&lt;0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p&lt;0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p&lt;0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p&lt;0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). In cohort 2, age &gt;70 (p&lt;0.05), male gender (p&lt;0.05), COPD (p&lt;0.05), cognitive impairment (p&lt;0.05), frailty (p&lt;0.001), delirium (p = 0.001), CRP&gt;150mg/L (p&lt;0.05), albumin &lt;30 g/L (p&lt;0.01), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p&lt;0.05), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p&lt;0.001), low haematocrit (p&lt;0.01), elevated PT (p&lt;0.05), sodium &lt;133 mmol/L (p&lt;0.01) elevated urea (p&lt;0.001), creatinine (p&lt;0.001), glucose (p&lt;0.05) and lactate (p&lt;0.001) and the 4C score (p&lt;0.001) were associated with 30-day mortality. In multivariate analysis, greater frailty (CFS&gt;3) (OR 11.3, 95% C.I. 2.3–96.7, p&lt;0.05), low albumin (&lt;30g/L) (OR 2.5, 95% C.I. 1.0–6.2, p&lt;0.05), high NLR (≥3) (OR 2.2, 95% C.I. 1.5–4.5, p&lt;0.05) and the 4C score (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1.0–5.6, p&lt;0.05) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality. Conclusion In addition to the 4C mortality score, frailty score and a low albumin were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality in two consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

https://openalex.org/W3165647869,"Few studies have compared patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). We investigated and compared PROMs between propensity score-matched primary and revision THA in an Asian cohort.The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score, satisfaction score, and Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) were compared between 110 primary and 110 revision THAs after propensity score matching. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine which factors, including patients' demographics, indication for revision, and pre-operative PROMs, were associated with post-operative PROMs in the revision THA cohort.The revision THA cohort demonstrated significantly lower post-operative OHS, UCLA activity score, and satisfaction score (10% decrease on average) than those in the primary THA cohort (P < .05). The difference in SF-12 mental component summary measure (MCS) between the two cohorts was statistically insignificant (P = .24). In multivariate analysis for the revision THA cohort, lower post-operative UCLA activity score was significantly associated with higher BMI and lower pre-operative UCLA activity score (P < .05).Revision THA was associated with a modest but significant decrease in physical PROMs as compared with primary THA. Pre-operative UCLA activity score significantly affected the post-operative physical outcome measures in the revision THA cohort. However, post-operative SF-12 MCS was comparable between the primary and revision THA cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3164379821,"Shigellosis, is a leading cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and related mortality in young children in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Knowledge on naturally acquired immunity can support the development of Shigella candidate vaccines mostly needed in LMICs. We aimed to quantify Shigella-specific antibodies of maternal origin and those naturally acquired in Zambian infants.Plasma samples collected from infants at age 6, 14 and 52-weeks were tested for Shigella (S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.At 6 weeks infant age, the IgG geometric mean titres (GMT) against S. sonnei (N = 159) and S. flexneri 2a (N = 135) LPS were 311 (95% CI 259-372) and 446 (95% CI 343-580) respectively. By 14 weeks, a decline in IgG GMT was observed for both S. sonnei to 104 (95% CI 88-124), and S. flexneri 2a to 183 (95% CI 147-230). Both S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a specific IgG GMT continued to decrease by 52 weeks infant age when compared to 6 weeks. In 27% and 8% of infants a significant rise in titre (4 fold and greater) against S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei LPS, respectively, was detected between the ages of 14 and 52 weeks. IgA levels against both species LPS were very low at 6 and 14 weeks and raised significantly against S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei LPS in 29% and 10% of the infants, respectively.In our setting, transplacental IgG anti-Shigella LPS is present at high levels in early infancy, and begins to decrease by age 14 weeks. Our results are consistent with early exposure to Shigella and indicate naturally acquired IgG and IgA antibodies to S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei LPS in part of infants between 14 and 52 weeks of age. These results suggest that a potential timing of vaccination would be after 14 and before 52 weeks of age to ensure early infant protection against shigellosis."
https://openalex.org/W3164042621,"To understand healthcare professionals' experiences and perceptions of nurses' potential or ideal roles in pharmaceutical care (PC).Qualitative study conducted through semi-structured in-depth interviews.Between December 2018 and October 2019, interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals of 14 European countries in four healthcare settings: hospitals, community care, mental health and long-term residential care.In each country, pharmacists, physicians and nurses in each of the four settings were interviewed. Participants were selected on the basis that they were key informants with broad knowledge and experience of PC.All interviews were conducted face to face. Each country conducted an initial thematic analysis. Consensus was reached through a face-to-face discussion of all 14 national leads.340 interviews were completed. Several tasks were described within four potential nursing responsibilities, that came up as the analysis themes, being: 1) monitoring therapeutic/adverse effects of medicines, 2) monitoring medicines adherence, 3) decision making on medicines, including prescribing 4) providing patient education/information. Nurses' autonomy varied across Europe, from none to limited to a few tasks and emergencies to a broad range of tasks and responsibilities. Intended level of autonomy depended on medicine types and level of education. Some changes are needed before nursing roles can be optimised and implemented in practice. Lack of time, shortage of nurses, absence of legal frameworks and limited education and knowledge are main threats to European nurses actualising their ideal role in PC.European nurses have an active role in PC. Respondents reported positive impacts on care quality and patient outcomes when nurses assumed PC responsibilities. Healthcare professionals expect nurses to report observations and assessments. This key patient information should be shared and addressed by the interprofessional team. The study evidences the need of a unique and consensus-based PC framework across Europe."
https://openalex.org/W3164165053,"The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia is largely attributed to a four-day mass gathering held in Sri Petaling from February 27, 2020, which contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. Starting from March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model disease dynamics before and after intervention which is inferred based on data. Related statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implementation within a short time period. The models and methodology used provided important insights into the nature of local transmissions to decision makers in the Ministry of Health, Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W3165206281,"Rockfish are an important component of West Coast fisheries and California Current food webs, and recruitment (cohort strength) for rockfish populations has long been characterized as highly variable for most studied populations. Research efforts and fisheries surveys have long sought to provide greater insights on both the environmental drivers, and the fisheries and ecosystem consequences, of this variability. Here, variability in the temporal and spatial abundance and distribution patterns of young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfishes are described based on midwater trawl surveys conducted throughout the coastal waters of California Current between 2001 and 2019. Results confirm that the abundance of winter-spawning rockfish taxa in particular is highly variable over space and time. Although there is considerable spatial coherence in these relative abundance patterns, there are many years in which abundance patterns are very heterogeneous over the scale of the California Current. Results also confirm that the high abundance levels of YOY rockfish observed during the 2014-2016 large marine heatwave were largely coastwide events. Species association patterns of pelagic YOY for over 20 rockfish taxa in space and time are also described. The overall results will help inform future fisheries-independent surveys, and will improve future indices of recruitment strength used to inform stock assessment models and marine ecosystem status reports."
https://openalex.org/W3164029009,"Individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF), the discrete frequency with the highest power value in the alpha oscillation range of the electroencephalogram, is a stable neurophysiological marker and is closely associated with various cognitive functions, including aspects of attention and working memory. However, the relationship between IAPF and attentional performance as well as the effects of engaging attention on IAPF are unknow. Here, we examined whether IAPF values were associated with attentional performance by evaluating accuracy during the performance of a multiple object tracking (MOT) task, a well-established paradigm for investigating goal-driven attention in dynamic environments, and whether engagement in the task affected IAPF values. In total, 18 elite players and 20 intermediate players completed the study. Resting electroencephalogram recordings were obtained for 120 s while players kept their eyes open and an additional 120 s while players' eyes were closed, before and again after performing the MOT task. Tracking accuracy in the MOT task and IAPF values before and after the MOT task were analyzed. As expected, tracking accuracies were higher in elite players than in intermediate-level players. Baseline IAPF values were significantly and positively correlated with the accuracy of target tracking in the MOT task. IAPF values were higher in elite than intermediate players in both the eyes open and closed conditions and both before and after MOT task performance. Interindividual IAPF values did not differ before and after the MOT task. These findings indicate that IAPF is a stable marker, without intraindividual changes associated with engagement in the MOT task. Elite players had higher IAPF values and exhibited more accurate MOT performance than intermediate-level players; thus, baseline IAPF values may be useful to predict attentional performance in the MOT task among athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3164146468,"The question of whether and how changes to population health impact on economic growth has been actively studied in the literature, albeit with mixed results. We contribute to this debate by reassessing-and extending-[1], one of the most influential studies. We include a larger set of countries (135) and cover a more recent period (1990-2014). We also account for morbidity in addition to mortality and adopt the strategy of providing bounding sets for the effects of interest rather than point estimates. We find that reducing mortality and disability adjusted life years (DALYs), a measure which combines morbidity and mortality, promotes per capita GDP growth. The magnitude of the effect is moderate, but non negligible, and it is similar for mortality and DALYs."
https://openalex.org/W3164700527,"Microbial communities of animals play a role in health and disease, including immunocompromised conditions. In the northeastern United States, cold-stunning events often cause endangered Kemp's ridley turtles (Lepidochelys kempii) to become stranded on beaches in autumn. These sea turtles are admitted to rehabilitation facilities when rescued alive and are presumed immunocompromised secondary to hypothermia. To better understand the role that microbes play in the health of cold-stunned sea turtles, we characterized the oral and cloacal microbiome from Kemp's ridley turtles at multiple timepoints during rehabilitation, from admission to pre-release, by using Illumina sequencing to analyze the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial communities were distinct between body sites and among turtles that survived and those that died. We found that clinical parameters such as presence of pneumonia or values for various blood analytes did not correlate with oral or cloacal microbial community composition. We also investigated the effect of antibiotics on the microbiome during rehabilitation and prior to release and found that the type of antibiotic altered the microbial community composition, yet overall taxonomic diversity remained the same. The microbiome of cold-stunned Kemp's ridley turtles gradually changed through the course of rehabilitation with environment, antibiotics, and disease status all playing a role in those changes and ultimately the release status of the turtles."
https://openalex.org/W3164089163,"Seasonal influenza vaccines are often ineffective because they elicit strain-specific antibody responses to mutation-prone sites on the hemagglutinin (HA) head. Vaccines that provide long-lasting immunity to conserved epitopes are needed. Recently, we reported a nanoparticle-based vaccine platform produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) for targeting linear and helical protein-based epitopes. Here, we illustrate its potential for building broadly protective influenza vaccines. Targeting known epitopes in the HA stem, neuraminidase (NA) active site, and M2 ectodomain (M2e) conferred 50–75% survival against 5LD 50 influenza B and H1N1 challenge; combining stem and M2e antigens increased survival to 90%. Additionally, protein sequence and structural information were employed in tandem to identify alternative epitopes that stimulate greater protection; we report three novel HA and NA sites that are highly conserved in type B viruses. One new target in the HA stem stimulated 100% survival, highlighting the value of this simple epitope discovery strategy. A candidate influenza B vaccine targeting two adjacent HA stem sites led to &gt;10 4 -fold reduction in pulmonary viral load. These studies describe a compelling platform for building vaccines that target conserved influenza epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W3165764875,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) often co-exists with hypertension. As increasing age affects baroreflex sensitivity, it loses its ability to reduce blood pressure when lying down. Therefore, supine hypertension may be an important indicator of baroreflex function. This study examines (i) the association between OH and future falls in community-dwelling older adults and (ii) if these associations persist in those with co-existing OH and baseline hypertension, measured supine and seated. Data from 1500 community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) were used. Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure was measured using digital photoplethysmography during an active stand procedure with OH defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥20 mmHg and/or ≥10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) within 3 minutes of standing. OH at 40 seconds (OH40) was used as a marker of impaired early stabilisation and OH sustained over the second minute (sustained OH) was used to indicate a more persistent deficit, similar to traditional OH definitions. Seated and supine hypertension were defined as SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg. Modified Poisson models were used to estimate relative risk of falls (recurrent, injurious, unexplained) and syncope occurring over four year follow-up. OH40 was independently associated with recurrent (RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.02,1.65), injurious (RR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.13,1.79) and unexplained falls (RR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.13,2.13). Sustained OH was associated with injurious (RR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.18,2.05) and unexplained falls (RR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.06,2.50). OH and co-existing hypertension was associated with all falls outcomes but effect sizes were consistently larger with seated versus supine hypertension. OH, particularly when co-existing with hypertension, was independently associated with increased risk of future falls. Stronger effect sizes were observed with seated versus supine hypertension. This supports previous findings and highlights the importance of assessing orthostatic blood pressure behaviour in older adults at risk of falls and with hypertension. Observed associations may reflect underlying comorbidities, reduced cerebral perfusion or presence of white matter hyperintensities."

https://openalex.org/W3164313075,"In mammals, the pigment molecule pheomelanin confers red and yellow color to hair, and the intensity of this coloration is caused by variation in the amount of pheomelanin. Domestic dogs exhibit a wide range of pheomelanin intensity, ranging from the white coat of the Samoyed to the deep red coat of the Irish Setter. While several genetic variants have been associated with specific coat intensity phenotypes in certain dog breeds, they do not explain the majority of phenotypic variation across breeds. In order to gain further insight into the extent of multigenicity and epistatic interactions underlying coat pheomelanin intensity in dogs, we leveraged a large dataset obtained via a direct-to-consumer canine genetic testing service. This consisted of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data and owner-provided photos for 3,057 pheomelanic mixed breed and purebred dogs from 63 breeds and varieties spanning the full range of canine coat pheomelanin intensity. We first performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,149 of these dogs to search for additional genetic variants that underlie intensity variation. GWAS identified five loci significantly associated with intensity, of which two (CFA15 29.8 Mb and CFA20 55.8 Mb) replicate previous findings and three (CFA2 74.7 Mb, CFA18 12.9 Mb, CFA21 10.9 Mb) have not previously been reported. In order to assess the combined predictive power of these loci across dog breeds, we used our GWAS data set to fit a linear model, which explained over 70% of variation in coat pheomelanin intensity in an independent validation dataset of 908 dogs.

To study the involvement of M1/M2 cytokine expression of adipose tissue in the regulatory mechanisms of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and insulin resistance in diabetes, stromal vascular fractions (SVFs) were purified from inguinal adipose tissue of diabetic (Leprdb/db) and non-diabetic (Lepr+/+) mice followed by analysis of M1/M2 cytokine expression. SVFs of Leprdb/db mice exhibited increased TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL2, and DPP4 mRNA expression but decreased IL-10 mRNA expression. Plasma from Leprdb/db mice induced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL2, and DPP4 mRNA expression and plasma from Lepr+/+ mice induced IL-10 mRNA expression in SVFs from Leprdb/db mice. Injection of Lepr+/+ plasma into the adipose tissue of Leprdb/db mice decreased mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL2, and DPP4 and protein expression of pJNK and DPP4 in SVFs, reduced mRNA expression of ICAM, FMO3, IL-1β, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6, and DPP4 and protein expression of ICAM, FMO3, and DPP4 in liver, and suppressed mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and DPP4 in Kupffer cells. Plasma from Leprdb/db mice did not induce M1 cytokine expression in SVFs from Leprdb/db-Jnk1-/- mice. Altogether, we demonstrate that diabetes induces M1 but decreases M2 cytokine expression in adipose tissue. Diabetic plasma-induced M1 expression is potentially through pJNK signaling pathways. Non-diabetic plasma reverses M1/M2 cytokine expression, plasma CCL2 levels, DPP4 activity, and Kupffer cell activation in diabetes. Our results suggest M1/M2 cytokine expression in adipose tissue is critical in diabetes-induced DPP4 activity, liver inflammation, and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3164016757,"While time in targeted blood glucose range (TIR) 70-140 mg/dL is a known factor associated with mortality in critically ill patients, it remains unclear whether TIR is associated with 28-day mortality under the glycemic control with a less tight target glucose range of 70-180 mg/dL. We aimed to examine whether TIR 70-180 mg/dL was associated with 28-day mortality.This is a retrospective cohort study using data from a tertiary care center in Japan collected from January 2016 through October 2019. We included adult patients (aged ≥20 years) admitted to the ICU. We excluded patients 1) with diabetic ketoacidosis patients, 2) discharged within 48 hours, 3) with repeated ICU admissions. We calculated TIR 70-180 mg/dL using the measured blood glucose values (≥3 times per day). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. We examined the association between TIR and 28-day mortality using a logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models with a stratification by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5%. Additionally, we repeated the analyses using the TIR category to assess the optimal TIR. For the sensitivity analysis, we repeated the primary analysis using TIR during the first three days from ICU admission.Of 1,230 patients, the median age was 72 years, 65% were male, and 250 patients (20%) had HbA1c ≥6.5% on admission. In patients with HbA1c <6.5%, TIR <80% was associated with an increased risk of 28-day mortality, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.88 (95%CI: 1.36-2.61). Likewise, when using 10% incremental TIR as a categorical variable, lower TIR was associated with a worse 28-day mortality compared with TIR ≥90% (e.g., adjusted OR of TIR <60%, 3.62 [95%CI 2.36-5.53]). Similar associations were found in the analyses using Cox proportional hazards model and using TIR during the first three days. By contrast, in patients with HbA1c ≥6.5%, there was no consistent association of TIR with 28-day mortality.We found that lower TIR 70-180 mg/dL was associated with a higher 28-day mortality in critically ill patients with HbA1c <6.5%, whereas there was no consistent association in patients with HbA1c ≥6.5%."

Structural validity was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis and a hypothesis testing approach. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega. Measurement invariance analysis was applied with an age-matched American sample.The single-factor structure fit the awareness subscale (RMSEA = .036, CFI = .983, TLI = .982). Autonomic reactivity (ANSR) was well-described by supra- and sub-diaphragmatic subscales (RMSEA = .041, CFI = .984, TLI = .982). All subscales were positively correlated (r range: .50-.56) and had good internal consistency (McDonald's Omega range: .86-.92, Cronbach's alpha range: .88-.91). Measurement invariance analysis for the Awareness model showed significant results (p<0.001) in each step (weak, strong and strict) whereas the ANSR showed significant results (p<0.001) only for the strong and strict steps.Our results support the Italian version of the BPQ as having consistent psychometric properties in comparison with other languages."

In addition, dysfunction of osteoblasts can lead to the progression of osteoporosis. Circular (circ)RNAs are involved in various types of diseases, including osteoporosis. Moreover, it has been reported that hsa_circ_0001275 expression is upregulated in osteoporosis. However, the effects of hsa_circ_0001275 on the growth of osteoblasts remain unclear.In the present study, the gene and protein expression levels in hFOB1.19 cells were detected via reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. In addition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium nodules were examined by ALP and alizarin red staining, respectively. Cell proliferation was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assay were used to confirm the association among hsa_circ_0001275, microRNA (miR)-377 and CDKN1B.DEX-induced hFOB1.19 cell growth inhibition was significantly reversed by silencing hsa_circ_0001275. Moreover, DEX significantly increased ALP activity and calcium nodules in hFOB1.19 cells, while this effect was significantly reversed in the presence of hsa_circ_0001275 small interfering RNA. In addition, miR-377 was sponged by hsa_circ_0001275 and CDKN1B was directly targeted by miR-377 in hFOB1.19 cells. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of hsa_circ_0001275 knockdown on osteoporosis was notably reversed by miR-377 antagomir.The data demonstrated that knockdown of hsa_circ_0001275 reversed DEX-induced osteoblast growth inhibition via activation of the miR-377/CDKN1B axis. Therefore, this study might shed new lights on the treatment of osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W3164546337,"Osteocytes remodel the perilacunar matrix and canaliculi. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is characterized by elevated serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), leading to decreased 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) production and hypophosphatemia. Bones from mice with XLH (Hyp) have enlarged osteocyte lacunae, enhanced osteocyte expression of genes of bone remodeling, and impaired canalicular structure. The altered lacuno-canalicular (LCN) phenotype is improved with 1,25D or anti-FGF23 antibody treatment, pointing to roles for 1,25D and/or phosphate in regulating this process. To address whether impaired 1,25D action results in LCN alterations, the LCN phenotype was characterized in mice lacking the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in osteocytes (VDRf/f;DMP1Cre+). Mice lacking the sodium phosphate transporter NPT2a (NPT2aKO) have hypophosphatemia and high serum 1,25D levels, therefore the LCN phenotype was characterized in these mice to determine if increased 1,25D compensates for hypophosphatemia in regulating LCN remodeling. Unlike Hyp mice, neither VDRf/f;DMP1Cre+ nor NPT2aKO mice have dramatic alterations in cortical microarchitecture, allowing for dissecting 1,25D and phosphate specific effects on LCN remodeling in tibial cortices. Histomorphometric analyses demonstrate that, like Hyp mice, tibiae and calvariae in VDRf/f;DMP1Cre+ and NPT2aKO mice have enlarged osteocyte lacunae (tibiae: 0.15±0.02μm2(VDRf/f;DMP1Cre-) vs 0.19±0.02μm2(VDRf/f;DMP1Cre+), 0.12±0.02μm2(WT) vs 0.18±0.0μm2(NPT2aKO), calvariae: 0.09±0.02μm2(VDRf/f;DMP1Cre-) vs 0.11±0.02μm2(VDRf/f;DMP1Cre+), 0.08±0.02μm2(WT) vs 0.13±0.02μm2(NPT2aKO), p<0.05 all comparisons) and increased immunoreactivity of bone resorption marker Cathepsin K (Ctsk). The osteocyte enriched RNA isolated from tibiae in VDRf/f;DMP1Cre+ and NPT2aKO mice have enhanced expression of matrix resorption genes that are classically expressed by osteoclasts (Ctsk, Acp5, Atp6v0d2, Nhedc2). Treatment of Ocy454 osteocytes with 1,25D or phosphate inhibits the expression of these genes. Like Hyp mice, VDRf/f;DMP1Cre+ and NPT2aKO mice have impaired canalicular organization in tibia and calvaria. These studies demonstrate that hypophosphatemia and osteocyte-specific 1,25D actions regulate LCN remodeling. Impaired 1,25D action and low phosphate levels contribute to the abnormal LCN phenotype observed in XLH."
https://openalex.org/W3165073663,"The two most essential factors for mobile self-organizing networks applicable to drones are reliability and stability. In harsh communication environments, such as mountainous regions and natural disasters, the use of satellites and terrestrial communication stations has severe time delays due to the high speed of UAVs, resulting in frequent communication interruptions with UAVs. Therefore, UAVs need to establish self-organizing networks for communication and information sharing. High-speed movement will lead to rapid changes in the network topology, resulting in established links being in an unstable connection state and even frequent routing errors, thus preventing the establishment of stable communication links. In order to improve the communication quality of UAVs under high-speed movement, we propose a dynamic source routing protocol based on path reliability and monitoring repair mechanism (DSR-PM). The model performs data transmission by filtering the best reliability path. The link state information is monitored during transmission and broken links are repaired in time to ensure the communication stability and reliability of the links and improve the data transmission efficiency. We simulated the approach in NS2 software and the simulation results show that the DSR-PM protocol effectively reduces parameters such as overhead, packet loss and delay, improves network throughput, and provides better communication performance."
https://openalex.org/W3165403311,"Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. The current treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea relies on the use of antibacterial agents. However, recurrences are frequent. The main virulence factors of C. difficile are two secreted cytotoxic proteins toxin A and toxin B. Alternative research exploring toxin binding by resins found a reduced rate of recurrence by administration of tolevamer. Hence, binding of exotoxins may be useful in preventing a relapse provided that the adsorbent is innocuous. Here, we examined the toxin binding capacity of G-PUR®, a purified version of natural clinoptilolite-tuff. Our observations showed that the purified clinoptilolite-tuff adsorbed clinically relevant amounts of C. difficile toxins A and B in vitro and neutralized their action in a Caco-2 intestinal model. This conclusion is based on four independent sets of findings: G-PUR® abrogated toxin-induced (i) RAC1 glucosylation, (ii) redistribution of occludin, (iii) rarefaction of the brush border as visualized by scanning electron microscopy and (iv) breakdown of the epithelial barrier recorded by transepithelial electrical resistance monitoring. Finally, we confirmed that the epithelial monolayer tolerated G-PUR® over a wide range of particle densities. Our findings justify the further exploration of purified clinoptilolite-tuff as a safe agent in the treatment and/or prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W3164066451,"The diverse biology and ecology of marine organisms may lead to complex patterns of intraspecific diversity for both neutral and adaptive genetic variation. Sebastes mentella displays a particular life-history as livebearers, for which existence of multiple ecotypes has been suspected to complicate the genetic population structure of the species. Double digest restriction-site associated DNA was used to investigate genetic population structure in S . mentella and to scan for evidence of selection. In total, 42,288 SNPs were detected in 277 fish, and 1,943 neutral and 97 tentatively adaptive loci were selected following stringent filtration. Unprecedented levels of genetic differentiation were found among the previously defined ‘shallow pelagic’, ‘deep pelagic’ and ‘demersal slope’ ecotypes, with overall mean F ST = 0.05 and 0.24 in neutral and outlier SNPs, respectively. Bayesian computation estimated a concurrent and historical divergence among these three ecotypes and evidence of local adaptation was found in the S . mentella genome. Overall, these findings imply that the depth-defined habitat divergence of S . mentella has led to reproductive isolation and possibly adaptive radiation among these ecotypes. Additional sub-structuring was detected within the ‘shallow’ and ‘deep’ pelagic ecotypes. Population assignment of individual fish showed more than 94% agreement between results based on SNP and previously generated microsatellite data, but the SNP data provided a lower estimate of hybridization among the ecotypes than that by microsatellite data. We identified a SNP panel with only 21 loci to discriminate populations in mixed samples based on a machine-learning algorithm. This first SNP based investigation clarifies the population structure of S . mentella , and provides novel and high-resolution genomic tools for future investigations. The insights and tools provided here can readily be incorporated into the management of S . mentella and serve as a template for other exploited marine species exhibiting similar complex life history traits."
https://openalex.org/W3164273820,"Background To prevent the viral transmission from higher infected to lower infected area, controlling the vehicular traffic, consequently public movement on roads is crucial. Containment strategies and local cognition regarding pandemic might be helpful to control vehicular movement. This study aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of containment strategies and local cognition for controlling traffic volume during COVID-19 pandemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Method Six containment strategies were considered to explore their influence on traffic condition, including declaration of general holiday, closure of educational institution, deployment of force, restriction on religious gathering, closure of commercial activities, and closure of garments factories. Newspaper coverage and public concern about COVID-19 were considered as local cognition in this research. The month of Ramadan as a potential event was also taken into account considering it might have an impact on the overall situation. Average daily journey speed ( ADJS ) was calculated from real-time traffic data of Google Map to understand the vehicular traffic scenario of Dhaka. A multiple linear regression method was developed to comprehend the findings. Results The results showed that among the containment strategies, declaration of general holiday and closure of educational institutions could increase the ADJS significantly, thereby referring to less traffic movement. Besides, local cognition could not significantly affect the traffic condition, although the month of Ramadan could increase the ADJS significantly. Conclusion It is expected that these findings would provide new insights into decision-making and help to take appropriate strategies to tackle the future pandemic situation."

The objectives of this interdisciplinary study were: a) to understand the emic representations of the good life in rural and urban Senegal and; b) to compare the levels and determinants of satisfaction with life between these two populations. This study was carried out in Dakar and in a very isolated rural area in the North East of Senegal: the sylvo-pastoral zone of Ferlo. A total of six focus groups were conducted for the qualitative phase, while the quantitative phase was conducted on representative samples of the populations living in Dakar (N = 1000) and Téssékéré (N = 500). Our results indicate that, against all expectations, life satisfaction is better in the Senegalese Ferlo than in the capital, Dakar. This difference may be the joint result of less meaningful social comparisons and a relationship with nature as a source of stress restoration in rural areas. However, the lifeworld of the rural Fulani of the Ferlo is being undermined by global climatic disturbances, which imposes rapid adaptations of pastoralism; otherwise this activity, that is not only subsistence but also identity-based, may disappear."
https://openalex.org/W3165090843,"Scaling is a ubiquitous concept in agricultural research in the global south as donors require their research grantees to prove that their results can be scaled to impact upon the livelihoods of a large number of beneficiaries. Recent studies on scaling have brought critical perspectives to the rather technocratic tendencies in the agricultural innovations scaling literature. Drawing on theoretical debates on spatial strategies and practical experience of agricultural innovation scaling in Ethiopia, this paper adds to the current debate on what constitutes scaling and how to overcome critical scaling constraints. The data for the paper came from a qualitative assessment using focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and document analysis on scaling work done in Ethiopia by a USAID-funded research for development project. The paper concludes with four broad lessons for the current understating of agricultural innovation scaling. First, scaling of agricultural innovations requires a balanced focus on technical requirements and associated social dynamics surrounding scaling targets, actors involved and their social relations. Second, appreciating the social dynamics of scaling emphasizes the fact that scaling is more complex than a linear rolling out of innovations towards diffusion. Third, scaling may not be strictly planned; instead, it might be an extension of the innovation generation process that relies heavily on both new and long-term relationships with key partners, trust, and continuous reflection and learning. Fourth, the overall implication of the above three conclusions is that scaling strategies need to be flexible, stepwise, and reflective. Despite the promises of flourishing scaling frameworks, scaling strategies it would appear from the Africa RISING experience that, if real impact is to be achieved, approaches will be required to be flexible enough to manage the social, processual and emergent nature of the practice of scaling."

The current study examines the mediation effect of sleep duration on the relationship between SC and cognitive decline in Chinese older adults.A cross-sectional study of 955 community-dwelling aged 60 or over was conducted. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE), self-report sleep duration questionnaire, and social capital scales were administered during the face-to-face survey. The Bootstrap methods PROCESS program is employed to test the mediation model.After controlling for covariates, both social cohesion and social interaction were positively correlated with the MMSE score (p<0.001), and social cohesion was negatively correlated with sleep duration (p = 0.009); On the contrary, sleep duration was negatively correlated with MMSE score (p<0.001). Linear regression analysis showed social cohesion was positively associated with the MMSE score (β = 0.16, p = 0.005), while sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline (β = -0.72, p<0.001). Sleep duration has mediated the relationship between social cohesion and cognitive decline (explaining 21.7% of the total variance).Social capital negatively associated with the risk of cognitive decline in this Chinese population, and sleep duration may partly explain this relationship. It may be a suggestive clue to identify those at a higher risk of progressing to cognitive impairment. Further prospective study in need to confirm this finding due to the cross-sectional design."

A total of 108 composite soil samples (3 treatments * 6 replications * 3 bund zones * 2 depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm) were collected for analysis and determination of the Organic Carbon fraction (OC) and Nitrogen fraction (N). OC was determined using Walkley and Black method while N was determined using the Kjeldahl digestion, distillation and titration method. The result indicated that farmland treated with LSB-6 years has insignificantly higher SOC (98.43±11.55 Mg ha-1) and TN (9.37±1.10 Mg ha-1) stock than control SOC (93.01±13.51 Mg ha-1) and TN (9.28±1.60 Mg ha-1) stock. Likely, farmland treated with LSB-6 years has insignificantly higher SOC and TN stock than farmland treated with LSB-3 years SOC (96.61±11.45 Mg ha-1) stock. With respect to the age of LSB, farmland treated with LSB-6 years accumulated more SOC stock (5.83%) than control.

In addition, the impact of artificially enhancing the early reflection magnitude by 6dB and of removing the direct component while equalizing the loudness was investigated. Listening test results for different textures, ranging from a flat wall to a staircase, were assessed using a 2 Alternative-Forced-Choice (2AFC) method, in which 14 sighted, untrained participants were indicating 2 equally perceived stimuli out of 3 presented stimuli. The average performance of the listening subjects to discriminate between different textures was found to be significantly higher for walls at 5m distance, without overlap between the reflected and direct sound, compared to the same walls at 0.8m distance. Enhancing the reflections as well as removing the direct sound were found to be beneficial to differentiate textures. This finding highlights the importance of forward masking in the discrimination process. The overall texture discriminability was found to be larger for the walls reflecting with a higher spectral coloration."

Furthermore, energy crops are vital to significantly impact the State's large and burgeoning need for sustainable fuels. Among crops amenable to be grown in California to support fuel production, agave pose a particularly promising prospect, given their drought tolerance and high productivity on marginal land in a State prone to drought and limited water resources. This study focuses on measuring compositional profiles of wild A. deserti and cultivated A. americana, two agaves native to California, to elucidate their potential for biological conversion to fuels that can help meet the huge State need for low-carbon transportation. Results from this study indicate that these two California agave species can be rich in fructans, ranging from 96-314 g/L of equivalent fructose and glucose in their leaf bases. In addition, structural and water-soluble sugar contents exceeding 63 wt.% show that these plants are amenable to fermentation to ethanol and other biofuels. Moreover, because the low K-lignin content of agave leaf bases bagasse of only about 12-18 wt.% suggests low recalcitrance and the negligible acid insoluble ash content should facilitate pretreatment prior to fermentations, the agave species native to the State hold considerable promise as potential biofuel feedstocks."

Two theoretical accounts—benevolent sexism as role justification and benevolent sexism as a mating strategy—suggest the possibility of a positive and bidirectional association. Gender disparities in childrearing could prompt inequality-justifying endorsement of benevolent sexism and/or endorsing benevolent sexism could promote traditional gender roles that facilitate having more children. We assessed the bidirectional associations between individuals’ number of children and their endorsement of benevolent sexism over a two-year period in a large national panel sample of New Zealanders ( N = 6,017). Zero-inflated structural equation modeling indicated that having a greater number of children was associated with stronger endorsement of benevolent sexism two years later, but no evidence emerged for the reverse direction. This study illustrated ways to tentatively test predictions of theoretical accounts on sexism and identified new, though small, evidence for the role justification perspective."

Remission of proteinuria and hematuria were defined as proteinuria <0.3 g/gCr and urine red blood cells (RBC) <5 / high power field (HPF) on three consecutive urinalyses obtained during an observation period of ≥6 months.Thirty-eight (61.3%) patients had remission of hematuria, 24 (38.7%) had remission of proteinuria, and 19 (30.6%) had remission of both. Remission rates increased in patients with proteinuria <0.5 g/g Cr at diagnosis. The median time to remission of hematuria was 2.8 years and that of proteinuria was 2.6 years. Patients who showed renal function decline (defined as 30% decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] from baseline) were older, had significantly lower eGFR, and higher proteinuria at diagnosis. Two patients with preserved renal function and normal proteinuria at diagnosis experienced renal function decline. Renal function did not decline within 3 years of diagnosis in patients with proteinuria <1 g/gCr at diagnosis.Relatively high rates of spontaneous remission were observed. Remission of both hematuria and proteinuria were frequent within 3 years after diagnosis, and renal function was well preserved during this period.

Nor have such demographic spread of spirometric measures been considered in studies comparing VO2peak between COPD phenotypes characterized by degree of emphysema. We aimed to assess the association of FEV1Z-score with VO2peak in COPD (n = 186) and investigate whether this association differs between emphysema (E-COPD) and non-emphysema (NE-COPD) phenotypes. Corresponding assessments using standardized percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) were performed for comparison. Additionally, phenotype related differences in VO2peak were compared using FEV1Z-score and ppFEV1 as alternative expressions of FEV1. E-COPD and NE-COPD were defined by transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide below and above lower limits of normal (LLN), respectively. The associations were assessed in linear regression models. One unit reduction in FEV1Z-score was associated with 1.9 (95% CI 1.4, 2.5) ml/kg/min lower VO2peak. In stratified analyses, corresponding estimates were 2.2 (95% CI 1.4, 2.9) and 1.2 (95% CI 0.2, 2.2) ml/kg/min lower VO2peak in E-COPD and NE-COPD, respectively. The association did not differ statistically by COPD phenotype (p-value for interaction = 0.153). Similar estimates were obtained in analyses using standardized ppFEV1. Compared to NE-COPD, VO2peak was 2.2 (95% CI 0.8, 3.6) and 2.1 (95% CI 0.8, 3.5) ml/kg/min lower in E-COPD when adjusted for FEV1Z-score and ppFEV1, respectively. In COPD, FEV1Z-score is positively associated with VO2peak. This association was stronger in E-COPD but did not differ statistically by phenotype. Both the association of FEV1 with VO2peak and the difference in VO2peak comparing COPD phenotypes seems independent of sex, age and height related variance in FEV1. Mechanisms leading to reduction in FEV1 may contribute to lower VO2peak in E-COPD."
https://openalex.org/W3164037934,"We introduce CurmElo, a forced-choice approach to producing a preference ranking of an arbitrary set of objects that combines the Elo algorithm with novel techniques for detecting and correcting for (1) preference heterogeneity induced polarization in preferences among raters, and (2) intransitivity in preference rankings. We detail the application of CurmElo to the problem of generating approximately preference-neutral identifiers, in this case four-letter and five-letter nonsense words patterned on the phonological conventions of the English language, using a population of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. We find evidence that human raters have significant non-uniform preferences over these nonsense words, and we detail the consequences of this finding for social science work that utilizes identifiers without accounting for the bias this can induce. In addition, we describe how CurmElo can be used to produce rankings of arbitrary features or dimensions of preference of a set of objects relative to a population of raters."
https://openalex.org/W3164693617,"In arid and semiarid shrublands, water availability directly influences ecosystem properties. However, few empirical tests have determined the association between particular soil and hydrology traits with biodiversity and ecosystem biomass at the local scale.We tested if plant species richness (S) and aboveground biomass (AGB) were associated with soil and topographic properties on 36 plots (ca. 12.5 m2) in 17 hectares of chaparral in the Mediterranean-climate of Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California, México. We used close-to-the-ground aerial photography to quantify sky-view cover per species, including all growth forms. We derived an elevation model (5 cm) from other aerial imagery. We estimated six soil properties (soil water potential, organic matter content, water content, pH, total dissolved solids concentration, and texture) and four landscape metrics (slope, aspect, elevation, and topographic index) for the 36 plots. We quantified the biomass of stems, leaves, and reproductive structures, per species.86% of AGB was in stems, while non-woody species represented 0.7% of AGB but comprised 38% of S (29 species). Aboveground biomass and species richness were unrelated across the landscape. S was correlated with aspect and elevation (R = 0.53, aspect P = 0.035, elevation P = 0.05), while AGB (0.006-9.17 Kg m-2) increased with soil water potential and clay content (R = 0.51, P = 0.02, and P = 0.04). Only three species (11% of total S) occupied 65% of the total plant cover, and the remaining 26 represented only 35%. Cover was negatively correlated with S (R = -0.38, P = 0.02). 75% of AGB was concentrated in 30% of the 36 plots, and 96% of AGB corresponded to only 20% of 29 species.At the scale of small plots in our studied Mediterranean-climate shrubland in Baja California, AGB was most affected by soil water storage. AGB and cover were dominated by a few species, and only cover was negatively related to S. S was comprised mostly by uncommon species and tended to increase as plant cover decreased."
https://openalex.org/W3165089167,"Generally, in real decision-making, all the pieces of information are used to find the optimal alternatives. However, in many cases, the decision-makers (DMs) only want ""how good/bad a thing can become."" One possibility is to classify the alternatives based on minimum (tail) information instead of using all the data to select the optimal options. By considering the opportunity, we first introduce the value at risk (VaR), which is used in the financial field, and the probabilistic interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (PIVHFS), which is the generalization of the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (PHFS). Second, deemed value at risk (DVaR) and reckoned value at risk (RVaR) are proposed to measure the tail information under the probabilistic interval-valued hesitant fuzzy (PIVHF) environment. We proved that RVaR is more suitable than DVaR to differentiate the PIVHFEs with example. After that, a novel complete group decision-making model with PIVHFS is put forward. This study aims to determine the most appropriate alternative using only tail information under the PIVHF environment. Finally, the proposed methods' practicality and effectiveness are tested using a stock selection example by selecting the ideal stock for four recently enrolled stocks in China. By using the novel group decision-making model under the environment of PIVHFS, we see that the best stock is E4 when the distributors focus on the criteria against 10% certainty degree and E1 is the best against the degree of 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% using the DVaR method. On the other hand when RVaR method is used then the best alternative is E4 and the worst is E2 against the different certainty degrees. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with the existing process is presented under the PHF environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3165152487,"Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, and ~30% of breast cancer patients succumb to metastasis, highlighting the need to understand the mechanisms of breast cancer progression in order to identify new molecular targets for treatment. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) has been shown to be upregulated in patients with breast cancer, and several studies have suggested its involvement in breast cancer progression and/or metastasis, mostly based on cell studies. In this work we evaluated the role of SK1 in breast cancer development and metastasis using a transgenic breast cancer model, mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle tumor-antigen (MMTV-PyMT), that closely resembles the characteristics and evolution of human breast cancer. The results show that SK1 deficiency does not alter tumor latency or growth, but significantly increases the number of metastatic lung nodules and the average metastasis size in the lung of MMTV-PyMT mice. Additionally, analysis of Kaplan-Meier plotter of human disease shows that high SK1 mRNA expression can be associated with a better prognosis for breast cancer patients. These results suggest a metastasis-suppressing function for SK1 in the MMTV-PyMT model of breast cancer, and that its role in regulating human breast cancer progression and metastasis may be dependent on the breast cancer type."
https://openalex.org/W3165289760,"We investigated the efficacy of pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of bone marrow involvement (BMinv) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients.This was a retrospective study of data from a previous study (NCT02733887). We included 171 patients who underwent bone marrow biopsy (BMB) and bone marrow smear (BMS), pelvic MRI, and whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) from January 2016 to December 2019 at a single center. BMB/BMS and whole-body PET/CT results were used as reference standards against which we calculated the diagnostic value of pelvic MRI for BMinv in DLBCL patients. A chi-square test was used to compare detection rates, and a receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate diagnostic value of pelvic MRI. Propensity-score matching was performed according to clinical information, and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients.The BMinv detection rate of pelvic MRI (42/171) was higher (P = 0.029) than that of BMB/BMS (25/171), and similar to that of PET/CT (44/171; P = 0.901). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of pelvic MRI were 83.33%, 98.37%, 94.15%, 95.24%, and 93.80%, respectively. Median PFS values were as follows: BMB/BMS-positive, 17.8 months vs. BMB/BMS-negative, 26.9 months (P = 0.092); PET/CT-positive, 24.8 months vs. PET/CT-negative, 33.0 months (P = 0.086); pelvic MRI-positive, 24.9 months vs. pelvic MRI-negative, 33.1 months (P<0.001). Median OS values were as follows: BMB/BMS-positive, 22.3 months vs. BMB/BMS-negative, 29.8 months (P = 0.240); PET/CT-positive, 27.9 months vs. PET/CT-negative, 33.9 months (P = 0.365); pelvic MRI-positive, 27.3 months vs. pelvic MRI-negative, 35.8 months (P = 0.062).Pelvic MRI is effective for detecting BMinv in DLBCL patients, providing a more accurate indication of PFS than BMB/BMS and PET/CT do. It may ultimately be used to improve the accuracy of clinical staging, guide patient treatment, and evaluate prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3165453569,"Asthma is the most common non-communicable pulmonary condition, affecting prepubertal boys more often than girls. This study explored how maternal and perinatal risk factors are linked to poorly controlled childhood asthma in a sex dependent manner. This single centre study was performed at a metropolitan teaching hospital in Western Sydney, Australia, using electronical obstetric records from 2000 to 2017 and electronical pediatric records from 2007 to 2018. The data of 1694 children with complete entries were retrospectively analysed. Risk factors for multiple hospital admission for asthma were selected by backward-eliminated Poisson regression modelling. Selection stability of these parameters was independently confirmed using approximated exhaustive search. Sex-specific regression models indicated that most notably parity (RR[95%CI] for parity = 3; 1.85[1.22-2.81]), birth length z-score (1.45[1.23-1.70]) and birth weight z-score (0.77[0.65-0.90]) contributed to multiple asthma admissions in girls, while boys were affected most prominently by maternal BMI (e.g. BMI 35-39.9; 1.92[1.38-2.67]) and threatened preterm labor (1.68[1.10-2.58]). Allergic status was a risk factors for both boys and girls (1.47[1.18-1.83] and 1.46[1.13-1.89]). Applying ROC analysis, the predictive modelling of risk factors for hospital admissions showed an incremental increase with an AUC of 0.84 and 0.75 for girls and boys respectively for >3 hospital admissions. Multiple hospital admissions for asthma are associated with maternal and perinatal risk factors in a sex and birth order dependent manner. Hence, prospective risk stratification studies aiming to improve childhood asthma control are warranted to test the clinical utility of these parameters. Furthermore, the influence of the early in utero environment on male-female differences in other communicable and non-communicable respiratory conditions should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3165744912,"Paediatric global antibiotic guidelines are inconsistent, most likely due to the limited pharmacokinetic and efficacy data in this population. We investigated factors underlying variation in antibiotic dosing using data from five global point prevalence surveys.Data from 3,367 doses of the 16 most frequent intravenous antibiotics administered to children 1 month-12 years across 23 countries were analysed. For each antibiotic, we identified standard doses given as either weight-based doses (in mg/kg/day) or fixed daily doses (in mg/day), and investigated the pattern of dosing using each strategy. Factors underlying observed variation in weight-based doses were investigated using linear mixed effects models. Weight-based dosing (in mg/kg/day) clustered around a small number of peaks, and all antibiotics had 1-3 standard weight-based doses used in 5%-48% of doses. Dosing strategy was more often weight-based than fixed daily dosing for all antibiotics apart from teicoplanin, which had approximately equal proportions of dosing attributable to each strategy. No strong consistent patterns emerged to explain the historical variation in actual weight-based doses used apart from higher dosing seen in central nervous system infections, and lower in skin and soft tissue infections compared to lower respiratory tract infections. Higher dosing was noted in the Americas compared to the European region.Antibiotic dosing in children clusters around a small number of doses, although variation remains. There is a clear opportunity for the clinical, scientific and public health communities to consolidate behind a consistent set of global antibiotic dosing guidelines to harmonise current practice and prioritise future research."
https://openalex.org/W3164837628,"High-frequency image-guided radiotherapy (hfIGRT) is ubiquitous but its benefits are unproven. We examined the cost effectiveness of hfIGRT in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We selected stage III NSCLC patients ≥66 years old who received definitive radiation therapy from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results-Medicare database. Patients were stratified by use of hfIGRT using Medicare claims. Predictors for hfIGRT were calculated using a logistic model. The impact of hfIGRT on lung toxicity free survival (LTFS), esophageal toxicity free survival (ETFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and cost of treatment was calculated using Cox regressions, propensity score matching, and bootstrap methods.Of the 4,430 patients in our cohort, 963 (22%) received hfIGRT and 3,468 (78%) did not. By 2011, 49% of patients were receiving hfIGRT. Predictors of hfIGRT use included treatment with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) (OR = 7.5, p < 0.01), recent diagnosis (OR = 51 in 2011 versus 2006, p < 0.01), and residence in regions where the Medicare intermediary allowed IMRT (OR = 1.50, p < 0.01). hfIGRT had no impact on LTFS (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.86-1.09), ETFS (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.93-1.18), CSS (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84-1.04), or OS (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87-1.04). Mean radiotherapy and total medical costs six months after diagnosis were $17,330 versus $15,024 (p < 0.01) and $71,569 versus $69,693 (p = 0.49), respectively.hfIGRT did not affect clinical outcomes in elderly patients with stage III NSCLC but did increase radiation cost. hfIGRT deserves further scrutiny through a randomized controlled trial."
https://openalex.org/W3165173226,"Post-cardiac arrest (CA) syndrome is heterogenous in their clinical presentations and outcomes. This study aimed to explore the transition and stability of subphenotypes (profiles) of CA treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).Clinical features of CA patients on day 1 and 3 after ICU admission were modeled by latent transition analysis (LTA) to explore the transition between subphenotypes over time. The association between different transition patterns and mortality outcome was explored using multivariable logistic regression.We identified 848 eligible patients from the database. The LPA identified three distinct subphenotypes: Profile 1 accounted for the largest proportion (73%) and was considered as the baseline subphenotype. Profile 2 (13%) was characterized by brain injury and profile 3 (14%) was characterized by multiple organ dysfunctions. The same three subphenotypes were identified on day 3. The LTA showed consistent subphenotypes. A majority of patients in profile 2 (72%) and 3 (82%) on day 1 switched to profile 1 on day 3. In the logistic regression model, patients in profile 1 on day 1 transitioned to profile 3 had worse survival outcome than those continue to remain in profile 1 (OR: 20.64; 95% CI: 6.01 to 70.94; p < 0.001) and transitioned to profile 2 (OR: 8.42; 95% CI: 2.22 to 31.97; p = 0.002) on day 3.The study identified three subphenotypes of CA, which was consistent on day 1 and 3 after ICU admission. Patients who transitioned to profile 3 on day 3 had significantly worse survival outcome than those remained in profile 1 or 2."
https://openalex.org/W3165330244,"In Ethiopian Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention program one of the focusing areas is prevention of mother-to-child transmission and decreasing morbidity and mortality among those who already acquired it. However, the needs and the sexual behavior of children who acquired HIV perinatally was not given due attention. Therefore, we conducted this study with the aim of exploring the lived experiences of youth who acquired HIV perinatally to contribute to HIV prevention and control program.We conducted a qualitative study using a phenomenological approach from March to May 2018 among 16 purposively selected youth who were infected with HIV vertically and receive ART services at Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. They were recruited based on their willingness after obtaining written informed consent and assent. Data were audio taped, transcribed verbatim in Amharic and later translated to English, and coded using Open Code version 4.02 software. Findings were summarized under four themes by applying interpretative phenomenological analysis.Seven males and nine females, aged 16 to 22 years have participated in the study. These youth reported as they had support from families and ART clinics, while pill-load, and fear of stigma are some of challenges they have faced, especially majorities don't want to disclose their status because of fear of stigma and discrimination. Half of them have ever had sexual relations usually with a seronegative partner and most of these had their first sex in their17-18 years of age. Unsafe sex was common among them where four girls reported to have had unprotected sex with their seropositive or seronegative sexual partners. Most wish to have purposeful life and love mate of the same serostatus but also fear they may remain alone.Youth who had acquired HIV from parents are challenged due to their serostatus and were not sure what type of life they may have in the future. They were also not comfortable in disclosing their serostatus and also engaged in unsafe sexual relation. This calls for an urgent intervention among HIV infected youth and their families; health care providers, and young people in general to halt HIV transmission. Special attention should be given on sexual behavior of all young people (10-24) and in disclosure of HIV status to children and life skills education to cop-up with stigma and discrimination."
