https://openalex.org/W2054647437,"Water frost absorptions have been detected in the infrared reflectivities of Jupiter's Galilean satellites JII (Europa) and JIII (Ganymede). We have determined the percentage of frost-covered surface area to be 50 to 100 percent for JII, 20 to 65 percent for JIII, and possibly 5 to 25 percent for JIV (Callisto). The leading side of JIII has 20 percent more frost cover than the trailing side, which explains the visible geometric albedo differences between the two sides. The reflectivity of the material underlying the frost on JII, JIII, and JIV resembles that of silicates. The surface of JI (Io) may be covered by frost particles much smaller than those on JII and JIII."

The distribution, together with trade routes suggested by topography and documentary sources, suggests efficient waterborne transport and competition between sources for the lowland market."
https://openalex.org/W1969380275,"Dipodomys microps climbs into shrubs and harvests leaves of the halophyte Atriplex confertifolia throughout the year. The epidermal vesicles of these leaves are high in electrolyte concentration, but the specialized photosynthetic parenchyma which is arranged concentrically about the vascular bundles is low in electrolytes and high in starch. The lower incisors of D. microps are broad, flattened anteriorly, and chisel-shaped (unlike those of other kangaroo rats, which are rounded and awl-shaped) and are used to shave off the hypersaline, peripheral tissue of the leaves so that the inner tissue can be eaten. This atypical feeding behavior should minimize the reliance of D. microps on the unpredictable seed crops of desert annuals, and also favor its coexistence with other species of Dipodomys, which are primarily granivorous."

https://openalex.org/W2021242751,"The discussion of fuzzy sets indicates that set theory should be extended to make it more suitable for the development of algebraic structures with wider applications. Stochastic optimization, a synthesis of the three areas of continuum mathematics, is a rapidly growing field particularly in the context of control theory. Applications of discrete mathematics have found a rich outlet in graph theory, particularly in the social sciences. However, there remains a wide gap between the sophisticated activities that are required for the development of optimum policies and the more difficult and intractable problems of organizational structures and performance."

In response to this review, the original suggestion is somewhat amplified and clarified by its author."
