https://openalex.org/W1991101760,"IT is known that the spherical aberration of electron lenses sets a limit to the resolving power of electron microscopes at about 5 A. Suggestions for the correction of objectives have been made ; but these are difficult in themselves, and the prospects of improvement are further aggravated by the fact that the resolution limit is proportional to the fourth root of the spherical aberration. Tnus an improvement of the resolution by one decimal wotild require a correction of the objective to four decimals, a practically hopeless task. The spherical aberration of electron lenses has long been the bane of electron microscopy. Enter Dennis Gabor in 1948 with a proposal for an 'electron interference microscope', which did not rely on traditional optical principles. Instead, interference between the illuminating and scattered electron wavefronts was used to record a three-dimensional representation of the object under investigation. This principle is now known as holography."

Not all these questions are obviously important, nor would their answers be useful—but we want them answered. Thomas Wright in 1601 said, ""Nothing is so curious and thirsty after knowledge of dark and obscure matters as the nature of man""—of scientific men especially, he might have said."

https://openalex.org/W2001928234,"TUBOCUBARINE chloride is a bis-tetrahydroiso-quinoline alkaloid containing two quaternary nitrogen atoms1, and its extraordinary potency in blocking neuromuscular transmission, compared with that of simple quaternary ammonium salts, might conceivably be due in part to the presence of two such cat ionic groups at some optimal distance apart. With this in mind, we have prepared and tested for curarelike activity a number of simple bis-quaternary ammonium salts in which the nitrogen atoms were separated by polymethylene chains of different lengths."
https://openalex.org/W2028185745,"THE heart-wood of western red cedar (Thuja plicata Don.), which possesses a low specific gravity and is very resistant towards decay, has been examined by Anderson and Sherrard1. The steam distillate of this wood furnished an acid, C10H12O2, termed dehydroperillic acid, showing low toxicity, and a very toxic ‘phenol', m.p. 82°, of the same composition. For dehydroperillic acid they suggest the formula (I), but the structure of the compound of m.p. 82° was not elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W1974012038,"IN 1944 it was suggested1 that the primary net process in the action of penetrating radiations (γ-rays, X-rays, etc.) on the water molecule consists in its splitting in the following way: which presumably takes place by way of the formation of H2O+ and H2O—. All the known chemical effects in aqueous solutions can be interpreted on this basis1,2, which furthermore permits an adequate description of the biological effects of radiations3,4. Recently, Dainton5 found that acrylonitrile in dilute aqueous solution on irradiation by X-rays or γ-rays shows polymerization, which he attributed to the action of primarily formed hydroxyl radicals (according to the above scheme) in view of the fact that these radicals are known to initiate polymerizations6."

https://openalex.org/W1966684831,"DURING a study of a diphtheroid bacterium (not yet identified, but temporarily labelled Q) it has been found that the slight growth on nutrient agar can be abolished by adding 0·2 per cent charcoal to the agar. Growth on charcoal-agar could be restored by adding excess of oleic, linoleic or linolenic acids. Experiments in synthetic media showed that the organism requires these unsaturated fatty acids as growth factors."

https://openalex.org/W2015344358,"THE identification of the products of hydrolysis of a methylated polysaccharide composed of many different sugar residues is a tedious and difficult task, especially when the polysaccharide is available only in small quantities. We have found., however, that many of the methylated sugars can be readily separated and identified on the paper chromatogram, using the same apparatus and solvents as described for the separation of the simple sugars1,2. The chromatogram is allowed to run until the solvent has advanced about 40 cm. from the starting line. The paper is then dried and sprayed with ammoniacal silver nitrate, and on warming, the positions of the sugars are indicated by brown spots (except in the case of tetramethylfructopyranose, which reduces ammoniacal silver nitrate only very slightly). As a standard, we use tetramethyl D-glucose, which moves rapidly on the chromatogram. The distance the sugar travels is measured from the starting line to the centre, not the edge, of the sugar spot, since the size of the spot and its leading edge vary with the concentration of sugar solution used. The figure RG given in the accompanying table refers to the ratio between the distance the sugar travels and the distance through which the tetramethyl D-glucose has moved. (We use this in preference to the RF value, which tends to vary with the distance the sugar has advanced from the starting line.)"

https://openalex.org/W2988656773,"THE haemoglobin of the fœtus and the new-born child and the haemoglobin of older children and adult people can be distinguished by their different resistance against 0·1 N sodium hydroxide. At pH 12 normal haemoglobin is denatured very rapidly, whereas foetal haemoglobin is denatured only slowly. By using this difference in denaturating-rate, it is possible to calculate the amounts of foetal and later haemoglobin present in small samples of blood1. A normal new-born child has only fœtal haemoglobin. During the early months after birth, this haemoglobin is gradually replaced by later haemoglobin, at a rate of a little less than 1 per cent a day, so that after 120 days normally all foetal haemoglobin has disappeared. In prematurely born babies, later haemoglobin appears only at the time that the child ought to have been born2."

https://openalex.org/W1998948647,"IT has previously been reported that the xanthine oxidase content of mouse brain is markedly increased during infection with yellow fever and other viruses1,2, and evidence was adduced which suggested that this rise of enzyme activity was not fortuitous but was causally related to the growth of virus in the tissue. The possibility of the virus particles themselves having xanthine oxidase activity was excluded by the demonstrable lack of parallelism between enzyme activity and the amount of virus in the brain. Recent work reported here shows that the extra enzyme is not obtained from other parts of the body, and demonstrates that synthesis of xanthine oxidase takes place during virus infection."

https://openalex.org/W2019548839,"IN a recent communication from this Laboratory1, it was shown that unstable heavy nuclei are sometimes emitted during the explosive disintegrations produced in photographic plates by the passage of cosmic radiation. In some cases., these unstable particles, after being brought to rest in the emulsion, give rise to two particles of equal range, emitted in opposite directions. The characteristic tracks thus produced were referred to as ‘hammer tracks'; and it was suggested that they are due to the emission of a nucleus of Li8 during the disintegration, for this nucleus is known to suffer β-decay with a period of 0·88 sec.2, and simultaneously to decompose into two α-particles. Twenty-eight examples of this process have now been observed in this Laboratory, and it has been possible to establish the correctness of the original interpretation of the phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W2015562412,"SEX habit in plants is known to be controlled by genetic factors, although subject to environmental iluctuations. Poole and Grimball1, working on the inheritance of certain new sex forms in Cucumis melo, a member of the Cucurbitacese, have reported that the hermaphrodite form is genetically a double recessive to monoecious, and in F2 populations from crosses between them the following phenotypic ratio was obtained—9 monoecious : 3 andromoncecious : 3 gynomoncecious : 1 hermaphrodite. The gynomoncecious type was, however, susceptible to environmental fluctuation, giving rise occasionally to gynoecious and trimoncecious forms. On the basis of these results they have designated the several sex forms in their material as follows : monoecious (AG), andromoncecious (aG), gynomonoecious (Ag) and hermaphrodite (ag)."

They have studied also the action of diluted formalin, which seems to be somewhat similar. Many workers have observed that preservation in saline affects the Rh-positive cells in the same way and recommend the use of fresh suspensions when performing Rh-testing."

We found that, if a small amount of dimethylaniline is added, the formation of the hetero-polymer product is prevented and the yield of the crystalline adduct was as high as 60 per cent. We have confirmed the structure previously proposed1 and our work led further to the determination of the steric configuration of the compound."

https://openalex.org/W2048846849,"IT is well known that iron, present in glasses as an impurity, has a most important effect in reducing their transmission of ultra-violet radiation. Of both theoretical and practical importance is the exact quantitative effect, at various wave-lengths, of iron in both the ferrous and ferric condition and in glasses of various compositions. On this question the most authoritative work known to me is that of D. Starkie and W. E. S. Turner1 who, unlike other authors, quoted precise chemical compositions, including ferrous and ferric iron contents, together with complete transmission data. Curve P. 131 in the graph is taken from their work and shows that a soft soda glass containing 0·01 per cent of iron oxide cut off completely at ˜ 2650 A., the iron in the glass being practically all in the ferrous condition. With the same percentage iron content, but practically all in the ferric condition, the same glass cut off at even longer wave-lengths (˜ 2675 A.). Starkie and Turner studied a glass containing so little as 0·005 per cent iron oxide, and concluded by extrapolation that a glass completely without iron would cut off at ˜ 2230 A."

The precise date of its foundation is usually given as April 7, 1348, the day on which Charles, as King of Bohemia, issued his charter setting out the reasons for the institution of a seat of higher learning in the Czech capital. Until 1355, when the Carolinum was ready, tuition had to be given in religious buildings and in private houses that had previously served as Latin schools. The original building, enlarged and renovated, still serves for important University functions and was used for some of this year‘s ceremonies. For the general gatherings use was made of the large Vladislav Hall of the Hradčany Castle, which is capable of seating several thousands."
