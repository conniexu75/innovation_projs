https://openalex.org/W1926371675,"To identify the GTP-binding site of catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) from pigeon erythrocyte membranes photoreactive GTP derivatives have been synthesized. One of them, P”-(4-azidoanilido)-PI-5’-guanosine triphosphate, proved to be a potent activator of particulate and soluble adenylate cyclase which binds with high affinity (K,,ss 3.3 x lo-’ M) and competes effectively with guanyl-5’yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) for the same binding site. Photoactivation of [“‘PIPJ-(4-azidoanilidoj-PI-5’-GTP-labeled membranes resulted in covalent incorporation of label into four major proteins with M, = 86,000, 52,000, 42,000, and 23,000, whereas in Lubrol PX-solubilized membranes only the GTP-binding proteins with M, = 42,000 and 23,000 were covalently labeled, although soluble adenylate cyclase preparations were stimulated by guanylnucleotides to about the same extent as membranous preparations. The bulk of the nucleotide binding sites, >95%, could be separated from adenylate cyclase without loss of activity by centrifugation of solubilized membranes through a sucrose density gradient, whereas most of the M, = 42,000 GTP-binding protein remained associated with adenylate cyclase activity. Detergent-solubilized adenylate cyclase preparations were inactivated on contact with a GTP-Sepharose affinity matrix. Inactivation was due to dissociation of the adenylate cyclase complex into two protein fractions, one of which contained the guanylnucleotide-binding sites. Reactivation occurred on recombination of the fraction released from GTP-Sepharose with Gpp(NH)p or GTP with the fraction not adsorbed to GTP-Sepharose. Furthermore, guanylnucleotide-binding proteins from pigeon erythrocyte membranes reactivated rabbit myocardial adenylate cyclase preparations depleted of binding proteins. Reconstitution experiments with GTP-binding fractions obtained from isoproterenol-treated membranes suggested that the characteristic synergistic amplification of hormone action by guanylnucleotides is mediated via the guanyl nucleotide binding protein. Guanylnucleotide-binding proteins could also be"

https://openalex.org/W1998043729,Hair samples from 31 learning disabled and 22 normal children were analyzed for content of 14 elements. Significant group differences were determined and a discriminant function was completed which separated the groups with 98 per cent accuracy. Elevated lead and cadmium content in the learning disabled group is viewed as being of particular importance.

https://openalex.org/W1536116198,"The D-glucose facilitated diffusion system of human erythrocytes has been studied extensively in whole cells and ghosts (see Jung, 1975) but has largely resisted attempts to identify the protein involved. Several workers have used binding of D-glucose or inhibitors to approach the problem. Studies with the affinity label, D-glucosylisothiocyanate (Taverna and Langdon, 1973) indicated that D-glucose protected against the labeling of two proteins of molecular weight 100,000 and 75,000. Another approach using the enhancement by D-glucose of labeling by 1-fluoro-2, 4 dinitrobenzene indicated a protein of molecular weight 180,000 (Jung and Carlson, 1975). Noncovalent binding of cytochalasin B (Lin and Spudich, 1974) or D-glucose (Kahlenberg, 1976) to ghosts treated with 2, 3-dimethylmaleic anhydride or NaI indicated that the membranes contained the glucose transport protein. These membrane residues contained bands 3, 4.5, 7 and glycoproteins PAS 1–4 (nomenclature according to Steck, 1974)."

https://openalex.org/W159115069,"Heterogeneous nuclear RNA (HnRNA) is associated with a set of specialized RNA-binding proteins. Mild ribonuclease digestion of intact HnRNA-protein complexes released 15 S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles containing poly(A) and its associated protein and 40 S RNP particles containing most of the HnRNA sequences. Highly purified 40 S RNP particles have been obtained from rat liver by centrifugation of nuclear extracts on sucrose density gradients and isopycnic banding on Metrizamide density gradients. These RNP preparations contain 27% of the total HnRNA sequences of rat liver, and appear homogeneous when viewed in negative contrast in the electron microscope and by centrifugation studies using velocity sedimentation in sucrose density gradients or isopyenic banding in density gradients of cesium salts. Analysis of the proteins in the rat liver 40 S RNP particles by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the 40 S RNP particle is composed of 12 major protein components with molecular weights ranging from 29,000 to 42,000 which accounted for 75% of the total protein mass and 13 minor protein components with molecular weights greater than 42,000. The proteins in the 29,000 to 42,000 group were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography. The amino acid compositions of the purified protein fractions were strikingly similar and shared several unusual features that distinguish these HnRNA-associated proteins, as a group, from the histones and the non-hi&one chromosomal proteins. Each of the RNP proteins have basic charge characteristics (p1 greater than 8.0) high glycine (25 mol %), low cysteine, and little detectable methionine. Like the histones, the HnRNP proteins are subject to extensive postsynthetic modification. We have identified the unusual amino acid NC, NC (CH,),-L-arginine in acid hydrolysates of some of the RNP proteins and shown that this amino acid"

https://openalex.org/W2087940942,"THE possibility that cadmium may be an environmental pollutant has caused concern because it has toxic effects on many animal species including man, rat, rabbit, chicken, quail, and pigeon1–4. The occurrence of cadmium in wildlife is not unusual and samples of marine species taken from around the British coast contain low levels (less than 0.5 mg per kg in fish and less than 2 mg per kg in most shellfish); however, levels of up to 93 mg per kg were present in limpets, Patellasp., collected from areas of natural mineralisation or industrial sources of cadmium5. Seabirds generally contain higher residues than marine invertebrates. For example, Anderlini et al.6 examined the amounts of nine metals in the livers of seven Antarctic and Pacific seabird species and noted that the maximum mean cadmium residue occurred in 10 ashy petrels Oceanodroma homochroa collected from their breeding grounds in California (mean residue was 53.2±20.5 mg per kg). Parslow et al.7 found up to 22.3 mg per kg dry wt cadmium in livers of eight puffins Fratercula arctica collected live from various British breeding colonies. It was suggested that pelagic birds might contain higher residues than coastal living species because a single fulmar Fulmarus glacialis examined by them contained 159 mg per kg cadmium. Anderlini et al. concluded that there was a correlation between increased concentration of cadmium in birds and exposure to industrial influences. Parslow et al. did not attempt to explain the residues they found in puffins, but Bourne8 concluded that individual birds were becoming increasingly contaminated through feeding near areas of local pollution around the British coast. It is debatable whether cadmium should be regarded as a pollutant to seabirds. We report here the occurrence of cadmium residues in the tissues of apparently healthy, breeding seabirds which are considerably higher than any previously found. More important, we conclude that the cadmium has a natural rather than an industrial origin, since we have found high cadmium residues in a marine insect, Halobates, which is widely distributed in tropical regions far from sources of industrial cadmium. This insect is only one example of the sources from which birds obtain their cadmium residues."

https://openalex.org/W80263978,"The sequence complexity and frequency distribution of adult rat pancreas polyadenylated RNAs and the changes in these pancreas transcripts during development have been analyzed by means of complementary DNA-RNA hybridization analysis. The following results were obtained. (a) An abundant set of pancreas polyadenylate# RNAs hybridizes with 90% of pancreas cDNA (the copy of aduit rat pancreas polyadenylated RNA), comprises ahout 2%) of total pancreas RNA, has a sequence complexity of about 2 x 10’ nucleotides, and is largely tissue specific. These and other data imply that these RNAs code primarily for pancreas-specific secretory prateins. (b) A less abundant set of pancreas RNAs hybridizes with HTC cell cl)NA (the copy of HTC cell polyadenylated RNA), comprises about 0.03% of total pancreas RNA, has a sequence complexity of at least 3 x lo” nucleotides, and is more frequent in rapidly proliferating tissues (HTC cells and embryonic pancreas) than in the adult pancreas. (c) In contrast to the pancreas, the relatively undifferentiated HTC cell does not contain a predominant set of polyadenylated RNAs of low complexity. (d) Moderate concentrations of RNAs complementary to pancreas cl)NA are present in pancreatic rudiments at 14 days of gestation when levels of pancreas-specific proteins are low. Between 14 and 20 days of gestation, the concentration of these RNAs increases several hundred-fold in the embryonic pancreas, in parallel with the increased rate of synthesis of pancreas-specific proteins. (e) Pancreas cL)NA hybridizes in situ primarily to the regions of acinar cells actively synthesizing secretory proteins. The very favorable signalto-noise ratio of the technique indicates that it will be useful for detecting low amounts of pancreas-specific RNAs early in development."

https://openalex.org/W1603751205,"A thiol:protein disulfide oxidoreductase which degrades insulin into its A and B chains has been purified to homogeneity from bovine liver. The initial extraction procedure used 1% Triton X-100, which increased the soluble insulin degrading activity 100 to 800% as a result of solubilizing a membrane-associated enzyme. The criteria for homogeneity of the isolated protein include sodium dodecyl sulfate and disc gel electrophoresis. Characterization of the homogeneous protein by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation indicates that a single protein is present which has a mass of 60,000 daltons. A single amino-terminal end group and molecular weight estimation by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicated that the thiol:protein disulfide oxidoreductase consists of a single polypeptide chain. The pure enzyme was also examined by gel filtration chromatography and has an apparent molecular weight of 92,000. The amino acid composition and carbohydrate content were also determined. The carbohydrate analysis demonstrated the presence of D-mannose, D-galactose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose, and N-acetylneuraminic acid which comprise a total of 12% by weight of the isolated protein."

https://openalex.org/W1587270268,"Concanavalin A (Con A) binds specifically to rat liver chromatin. The extent of binding is directly proportional to both chromatin and concanavalin A concentration. It is reversible and inhibited by specific sugars for which concanavalin A has a binding site. Scatchard analysis reveals the presence of one type of Con A-binding site, with an apparent dissociation constant of 3 X 10(-7) M. A maximum of 10 pmol of Con A binds to 10 microgram of chromatin, indicating an average of one binding site/1400 base pairs of DNA. To identify the polypeptide chains which contain Con A-binding sites, chromosomal proteins were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Con A receptors were localized by incubating the gel in 125I-Con A and subsequent autoradiography. Three major polypeptide bands which bind Con A were identified among the nonhistone chromosomal proteins. The apparent molecular weights of these glycoproteins are 135,000, 125,000, and 69,000. We suggest that lectins may serve as probes for the study of the organization of specific components in chromatin."

The animals were killed after 2 h and various sphingolipids were isolated and purified. These lipids were further fractionated into subgroups depending on their fatty acid content (nonhydroxy or alpha-hydroxy, shorter chain or longer chain), 3H/14C ratios obtained in ceramides, cerebrosides, and sphingomyelins containing different fatty acids from the injected material were much higher than the initial ratio. This observation indicates that a replacement of the fatty acid occurred in the injected ceramide. Comparison of the 3H/14C ratios of the cerebrosides and sphingomyelin in a specific fatty acid group with the ratios of the corresponding ceramide indicated that most of these lipids were derived directly from the ceramide. The 3H/14C ratio of the hydroxycerebroside obtained from cerebronyl sphingosine-injected brain was nearly twice the ratio of the injected material. In addition to these lipids, considerable radioactivity was incorporated into an unknown nonpolar material in the brains which had been injected with [1-14C]lignoceroyl or [1-14C]palmitoyl [1-3H]sphingosine. This material was tentatively identified as ceramide fatty acid ester. The 3H/14C ratio of the ester was identical to that of the injected material."

https://openalex.org/W82555866,"Rabbit liver microsomes catalyzed the formation of 2-O-alpha-D-mannosyl-D-mannose when incubated with GDP-mannose and free D-mannose. Formation of the disaccharide required the addition of divalent metal ions and was inhibited by EDTA and guanosine nucleotides. An enzyme present in the microsomal preparation transferred mannose from GDP-mannose to an endogenous lipid and to exogenous dolichol-P resulting in the formation of a product tentatively identified as dolichol-P-mannose. Formation of the mannosyl-lipid was also metal ion-dependent and was inhibited by EDTA and guanosine nucleotides. A second enzyme in the preparation catalyzed mannosyl transfer from dolichol-P-mannose to free mannose resulting in the formation of 2-O-alpha-D-mannosyl-D-mannose. Transfer from the mannosyl-lipid required the addition of Triton X-100 but was metal ion-independent. The time course of the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to the endogenous lipid and to the exogenous saccharide acceptor suggested that the mannosyl-lipid was an intermediate in the formation of the mannobiose. Other evidence, such as similar requirements for divalent metals, inhibition by guanosine nucleotides, and acceptor specificity, also supported the involvement of a mannosyl-lipid as an intermediate in the formation of alpha-1,2-mannosyl-mannose linkages by rabbit liver microsomes."

D-[3-3H]- and D-[4-3H]glucose 6-phosphate were converted at approximately the same rate as that of unlabeled substrate. In the case of testis enzyme, storage as a frozen solution further lowered the rate with D-[5-3H]glucose 6-phosphate as substrate. When the reaction was run in [3H]water, no 3H appeared in myo-inositol 1-phosphate but a small amount was recovered in substrate isolated from the final reaction mixture. These data support the involvement of carbon 5 of D-glucose 6-phosphate in the mechanism proposed for this conversion."

X-cells with mature latencies were found as early as 21 days. Y-cells did not have adult latencies at 40 days. The early development of some X-cells may be due to differential rates of fiber myelination and synaptic maturation within the lateral geniculate nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W1521840369,"The inhibition of bovine adrenal estrogen sulfotransferase has been studied utilizing representative androgens and estrogens with structural changes in rings A, B, and D. These investigations have shown oxygen functions in positions 3, 16, or 17 to be required for the binding of estrogens or androgens to the enzyme. 5alpha-Androstanes (all transfused rings) are weak noncompetitive inhibitors and bind more tightly than the 5beta isomers (cis-fused A and B rings). The competitive inhibition observed with the estrogens does not require a free 3-phenolic hydroxyl, however, groups larger than 3-methoxy limit binding. While the product, estrone sulfate, is not inhibitory, phosphate esters on positions 3- or 17beta or a sulfate moiety on the 17beta-hydroxyl group of estrogens slightly inhibit the enzyme. The stacking of adenine (in adenosine 3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate) with the A ring of estrogens is postulated for the enzyme-bound transition state. This structure, which facilitates the hydrogen bonding between the 6-amino group of adenine and the 4-nitro, 4-bromo, or 6-keto substituents on estrogens, readily explains the unusual substrate and inhibitory properties of these compounds. Certain of these estrogen derivatives, which possess little or no hormonal activity, are efficient inhibitors of estrogen sulotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1569665539,"The uptake of macromolecular markers by fluid pinocytosis in the rat yolk sac was inhibited by glucagon, with half-maximal effect at a hormone concentration of approximately 3 X 10(-8) M. Glucagon had no effect on the cellular distribution of the marker subsequent to its uptake. Rates of uptake promptly returned to normal when the yolk sacs were transferred from a glucagon-containing to a glucagon-free medium. Epinephrine also inhibited, but only at much higher concentrations. The effect of the latter was augmented by theophylline. Insulin (10(-6) M) had no effect when added alone or with an inhibitory level of glucagon (10(-7) M). The presumption that the hormone effect was mediated by cyclic AMP was supported by the findings that the cellular levels of cyclic AMP were elevated in the presence of glucagon and that dibutyryl cyclic AMP could replace glucagon as an effective inhibitor. The conclusion that the hormone effect was on uptake rather than on subsequent regurgitation was based on the linearity of accumulation in both the presence and absence of glucagon and the inability of glucagon to stimulate loss of invertase from preloaded cells. Colchicine and vinblastine also inhibited uptake. This finding and those of others which are discussed suggest the possibility that effects of cyclic nucleotides on certain cell functions may involve their regulation of microtubular status."

Because of the historical importance of liquid crystals of cholesteryl esters1 and the biological importance of cholesterol, we are reporting here some observations on the properties of this gel. Liquid crystals of cholesterol with fatty alkanols (C12–C18) are known2,3, but have not been reported for smaller alcohols. The transparent gel of cholesterol and isopropanol seems to be stable at 4 °C for concentrations of 4.6–5.3% (w/w) cholesterol. At higher concentrations and temperatures (up to 10.2% at 22 °C), the transparent gel can be observed for a day or more, then white ‘snowflakes’ appear throughout the gel and grow slowly into a translucent or opaque mass. On warming, the transparent gels liquify, and the translucent gels seem to go directly to the liquid state. The transparent gel is unstable to vigorous shaking; samples with less than 5.5% cholesterol liquify then return to the transparent gel state on standing at 4 °C. Samples with larger concentrations form the translucent or opaque state on shaking and do not return to the transparent state over a period of several weeks. Observations of the transparent gel under a polarising microscope at room temperature showed the sample to be mostly isotropic with some small points of optical activity."
