https://openalex.org/W4282838915,"The Omicron, or Pango lineage B.1.1.529, variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) carries multiple spike mutations with high transmissibility and partial neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape. Vaccinated individuals show protection against severe disease, often attributed to primed cellular immunity. We investigated T and B cell immunity against B.1.1.529 in triple BioNTech BNT162b2 messenger RNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) with different SARS-CoV-2 infection histories. B and T cell immunity against previous variants of concern was enhanced in triple-vaccinated individuals, but the magnitude of T and B cell responses against B.1.1.529 spike protein was reduced. Immune imprinting by infection with the earlier B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant resulted in less durable binding antibody against B.1.1.529. Previously infection-naïve HCWs who became infected during the B.1.1.529 wave showed enhanced immunity against earlier variants but reduced nAb potency and T cell responses against B.1.1.529 itself. Previous Wuhan Hu-1 infection abrogated T cell recognition and any enhanced cross-reactive neutralizing immunity on infection with B.1.1.529."
https://openalex.org/W4282558403,"Abstract Drug addiction is a public health crisis for which new treatments are urgently needed. In rare cases, regional brain damage can lead to addiction remission. These cases may be used to identify therapeutic targets for neuromodulation. We analyzed two cohorts of patients addicted to smoking at the time of focal brain damage (cohort 1 n = 67; cohort 2 n = 62). Lesion locations were mapped to a brain atlas and the brain network functionally connected to each lesion location was computed using human connectome data ( n = 1,000). Associations with addiction remission were identified. Generalizability was assessed using an independent cohort of patients with focal brain damage and alcohol addiction risk scores ( n = 186). Specificity was assessed through comparison to 37 other neuropsychological variables. Lesions disrupting smoking addiction occurred in many different brain locations but were characterized by a specific pattern of brain connectivity. This pattern involved positive connectivity to the dorsal cingulate, lateral prefrontal cortex, and insula and negative connectivity to the medial prefrontal and temporal cortex. This circuit was reproducible across independent lesion cohorts, associated with reduced alcohol addiction risk, and specific to addiction metrics. Hubs that best matched the connectivity profile for addiction remission were the paracingulate gyrus, left frontal operculum, and medial fronto-polar cortex. We conclude that brain lesions disrupting addiction map to a specific human brain circuit and that hubs in this circuit provide testable targets for therapeutic neuromodulation."

https://openalex.org/W4282591735,"Single-cell RNA sequencing studies have suggested that total mRNA content correlates with tumor phenotypes. Technical and analytical challenges, however, have so far impeded at-scale pan-cancer examination of total mRNA content. Here we present a method to quantify tumor-specific total mRNA expression (TmS) from bulk sequencing data, taking into account tumor transcript proportion, purity and ploidy, which are estimated through transcriptomic/genomic deconvolution. We estimate and validate TmS in 6,590 patient tumors across 15 cancer types, identifying significant inter-tumor variability. Across cancers, high TmS is associated with increased risk of disease progression and death. TmS is influenced by cancer-specific patterns of gene alteration and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity as well as by pan-cancer trends in metabolic dysregulation. Taken together, our results indicate that measuring cell-type-specific total mRNA expression in tumor cells predicts tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W4282570172,"Abstract Cerebral organoids exhibit broad regional heterogeneity accompanied by limited cortical cellular diversity despite the tremendous upsurge in derivation methods, suggesting inadequate patterning of early neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we show that a short and early Dual SMAD and WNT inhibition course is necessary and sufficient to establish robust and lasting cortical organoid NSC identity, efficiently suppressing non-cortical NSC fates, while other widely used methods are inconsistent in their cortical NSC-specification capacity. Accordingly, this method selectively enriches for outer radial glia NSCs, which cyto-architecturally demarcate well-defined outer sub-ventricular-like regions propagating from superiorly radially organized, apical cortical rosette NSCs. Finally, this method culminates in the emergence of molecularly distinct deep and upper cortical layer neurons, and reliably uncovers cortex-specific microcephaly defects. Thus, a short SMAD and WNT inhibition is critical for establishing a rich cortical cell repertoire that enables mirroring of fundamental molecular and cyto-architectural features of cortical development and meaningful disease modelling."
https://openalex.org/W4282582236,"Abstract Human naive pluripotent stem cells have unrestricted lineage potential. Underpinning this property, naive cells are thought to lack chromatin-based lineage barriers. However, this assumption has not been tested. Here we define the chromatin-associated proteome, histone post-translational modifications and transcriptome of human naive and primed pluripotent stem cells. Our integrated analysis reveals differences in the relative abundance and activities of distinct chromatin modules. We identify a strong enrichment of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-associated H3K27me3 in the chromatin of naive pluripotent stem cells and H3K27me3 enrichment at promoters of lineage-determining genes, including trophoblast regulators. PRC2 activity acts as a chromatin barrier restricting the differentiation of naive cells towards the trophoblast lineage, whereas inhibition of PRC2 promotes trophoblast-fate induction and cavity formation in human blastoids. Together, our results establish that human naive pluripotent stem cells are not epigenetically unrestricted, but instead possess chromatin mechanisms that oppose the induction of alternative cell fates."
https://openalex.org/W4282580030,"Fast, high-throughput methods for measuring the level and duration of protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are needed to anticipate the risk of breakthrough infections. Here we report the development of two quantitative PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell activation. The assays are rapid, internally normalized and probe-based: qTACT requires RNA extraction and dqTACT avoids sample preparation steps. Both assays rely on the quantification of CXCL10 messenger RNA, a chemokine whose expression is strongly correlated with activation of antigen-specific T cells. On restimulation of whole-blood cells with SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, viral-specific T cells secrete IFN-Œ≥, which stimulates monocytes to produce CXCL10. CXCL10 mRNA can thus serve as a proxy to quantify cellular immunity. Our assays may allow large-scale monitoring of the magnitude and duration of functional T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2, thus helping to prioritize revaccination strategies in vulnerable populations. The T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is detected by a PCR assay on whole blood."
https://openalex.org/W4282549516,"Congenital heart diseases often involve maldevelopment of the evolutionarily recent right heart chamber. To gain insight into right heart structure and function, we fine-tuned deep learning models to recognize the right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery, measuring right heart structures in 40,000 individuals from the UK Biobank with magnetic resonance imaging. Genome-wide association studies identified 130 distinct loci associated with at least one right heart measurement, of which 72 were not associated with left heart structures. Loci were found near genes previously linked with congenital heart disease, including NKX2-5, TBX5/TBX3, WNT9B and GATA4. A genome-wide polygenic predictor of right ventricular ejection fraction was associated with incident dilated cardiomyopathy (hazard ratio, 1.33 per standard deviation; P = 7.1 × 10-13) and remained significant after accounting for a left ventricular polygenic score. Harnessing deep learning to perform large-scale cardiac phenotyping, our results yield insights into the genetic determinants of right heart structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W4282542838,"Unlike cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma (UM) is characterized by mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 and remains a fatal disease because there is essentially no effective targeted therapy or immunotherapy available. We report the discovery of the copper ionophore elesclomol as a GNAQ/11-specific UM inhibitor. Elesclomol was identified in a differential cytotoxicity screen of an in-house tool compound library, and its in vivo pharmacological efficacy was further confirmed in zebrafish and mouse UM models. Mechanistically, elesclomol transports copper to mitochondria and produces a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) in GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells, which selectively activates LATS1 kinase in the Hippo signaling pathway and consequently promotes YAP phosphorylation and inhibits its nuclear accumulation. The inactivation of YAP downregulates the expression of SNAI2, which in turn suppresses the migration of UM cells. These findings were cross validated by our clinical observation that YAP activation was found specifically in UM samples with a GNAQ/11 mutation. Furthermore, addition of binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, to elesclomol increased its synthetic lethality to GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells, thereby overriding drug resistance. This effect was confirmed in an orthotopic xenograft model and in a patient-derived xenograft model of UM. These studies reveal a novel mechanistic basis for repurposing elesclomol by showing that copper homeostasis is a GNAQ/11-specific vulnerability in UM. Elesclomol may provide a new therapeutic path for selectively targeting malignant GNAQ/11-mutant UM."
https://openalex.org/W4282588100,"Red light penetrates deep into mammalian tissues and has low phototoxicity, but few optogenetic tools that use red light have been developed. Here we present MagRed, a red light–activatable photoswitch that consists of a red light–absorbing bacterial phytochrome incorporating a mammalian endogenous chromophore, biliverdin and a photo-state-specific binder that we developed using Affibody library selection. Red light illumination triggers the binding of the two components of MagRed and the assembly of split-proteins fused to them. Using MagRed, we developed a red light–activatable Cre recombinase, which enables light-activatable DNA recombination deep in mammalian tissues. We also created red light–inducible transcriptional regulators based on CRISPR–Cas9 that enable an up to 378-fold activation (average, 135-fold induction) of multiple endogenous target genes. MagRed will facilitate optogenetic applications deep in mammalian organisms in a variety of biological research areas. A photoswitch based on a bacterial phytochrome enables optogenetic manipulations using red light."
https://openalex.org/W4282923437,"Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) is an anaerobic bacterial species involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition of vaginal dysbiosis associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. GV strains are categorized into four clades, characterized by a different ability to produce virulence factors, such as sialidase. We investigated the distribution of GV clades and sialidase genes in the vaginal ecosystem of a cohort of pregnant women, assessing the correlations between GV clades and the whole vaginal microbiome. A total of 61 Caucasian pregnant women were enrolled. Their vaginal swabs, collected both at the first and third trimester of pregnancy, were used for (i) evaluation of the vaginal status by Nugent score, (ii) vaginal microbiome profiling by 16S rRNA sequencing, (iii) detection and quantification of GV clades and sialidase A gene by qPCR assays. DNA of at least one GV clade was detected in most vaginal swabs, with clade 4 being the most common one. GV clade 2, together with the presence of multiple clades (>2 simultaneously), were significantly associated with a BV condition. Significantly higher GV loads and sialidase gene levels were found in BV cases, compared to the healthy status. Clade 2 was related to the major shifts in the vaginal microbial composition, with a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in several BV-related taxa. As the number of GV clades detected simultaneously increased, a group of BV-associated bacteria tended to increase as well, while Bifidobacterium tended to decrease. A negative correlation between sialidase gene levels and Lactobacillus, and a positive correlation with Gardnerella, Atopobium, Prevotella, Megasphaera, and Sneathia were observed. Our results added knowledge about the interactions of GV clades with the inhabitants of the vaginal microbiome, possibly helping to predict the severity of BV and opening new perspectives for the prevention of pregnancy-related complications."

One of the Study 19 inclusion criteria was forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥80% of predicted (≥80%p). Therefore, the study provided no information on edaravone efficacy in subjects with FVC <80%p. In Study 19, 24-week, double-blind treatment was followed by open-label treatment where all subjects received edaravone. At 24 weeks, some subjects had FVC <80%p (FVC24 <80%p). This allowed for post-hoc assessment of the effects of edaravone in subgroups of subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p.To address the question of the efficacy of edaravone in ALS patients with FVC <80%p.Post-hoc analysis of Study 19 comparing edaravone efficacy at week 48 in subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p.With edaravone treatment, subjects in both the FVC24 ≥80%p and the FVC24 <80%p subgroups experienced a reduction in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score loss vs placebo subjects through week 48. For the FVC24 ≥80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -7.63 for edaravone-edaravone vs -9.69 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 2.05 (P = .034; 95% CI: 0.16, 3.94). For the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -10.26 for edaravone-edaravone vs -15.20 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 4.94 (P = .0038; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.25). Linear regression analysis indicated that, in the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, there was a notable change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R score-vs-time graph after the start of edaravone treatment.ALS subjects in the Study 19 placebo arm had a slowing in disease progression, even when edaravone was added with an FVC of <80%p prior to starting edaravone. A randomized, placebo-controlled study is needed to validate these post-hoc findings."
https://openalex.org/W4282577837,"Regenerating pancreatic β-cells is a potential curative approach for diabetes. We previously identified the small molecule CID661578 as a potent inducer of β-cell regeneration, but its target and mechanism of action have remained unknown. We now screened 257 million yeast clones and determined that CID661578 targets MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MNK2), an interaction we genetically validated in vivo. CID661578 increased β-cell neogenesis from ductal cells in zebrafish, neonatal pig islet aggregates and human pancreatic ductal organoids. Mechanistically, we found that CID661578 boosts protein synthesis and regeneration by blocking MNK2 from binding eIF4G in the translation initiation complex at the mRNA cap. Unexpectedly, this blocking activity augmented eIF4E phosphorylation depending on MNK1 and bolstered the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, which is necessary for both hypertranslation and β-cell regeneration. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a targetable role of MNK2-controlled translation in β-cell regeneration, a role that warrants further investigation in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4282824015,"Several countries have started mass vaccination programs to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. With an R naught value of 2 to 3, about 70% of the population needs to be immunized to achieve herd immunity. This study aimed to investigate the reasons for acceptance or refusal of COVID-19 vaccines among the Malaysian population.An exploratory, descriptive qualitative design was performed. The cross-sectional survey used a non-probability convenient sampling technique to recruit the respondents, who were required to answer an open-ended question: Either ""If you are willing to get the vaccine, please state your reason"" or ""If you are not willing to get vaccinated, please state your reason."" The survey also included questions on demography such as age, gender, and place of residence. According to the Health Belief Model, the data was transcribed, translated, and analyzed: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barrier, and cues for action.A total of 1091 respondents who completed the online survey comprised 685 (62.8%) females, 406 (37.2%) males, with a mean age of 38.16 (SD = 16.44). The majority (81.1%) were willing to get vaccinated. Thematic analysis showed that most respondents perceived that the vaccine is safe, effective, protective and will provide herd immunity. Barriers to vaccination include unknown long-term side effects, rapid vaccine production, inadequate information and concerns regarding halal status. Cues to vaccination included individual desire, social responsibility, economic concerns and wait-and-see behavior.The public should be well informed about the vaccine, its efficacy, side effects, and halal status to increase vaccine acceptability and achieve herd immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4282549610,"While many germline cancer risk variants have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the mechanisms by which these variants operate remain largely unknown. Here we used 406 cancer ATAC-Seq samples across 23 cancer types to identify 7,262 germline allele-specific accessibility QTLs (as-aQTLs). Cancer as-aQTLs had stronger enrichment for cancer risk heritability (up to 145 fold) than any other functional annotation across seven cancer GWAS. Most cancer as-aQTLs directly altered transcription factor (TF) motifs and exhibited differential TF binding and gene expression in functional screens. To connect as-aQTLs to putative risk mechanisms, we introduced the regulome-wide associations study (RWAS). RWAS identified genetically associated accessible peaks at >70% of known breast and prostate loci and discovered new risk loci in all examined cancer types. Integrating as-aQTL discovery, motif analysis and RWAS identified candidate causal regulatory elements and their probable upstream regulators. Our work establishes cancer as-aQTLs and RWAS analysis as powerful tools to study the genetic architecture of cancer risk. Allelic imbalance analysis applied to ATAC-Seq data from 23 cancer types identifies 7,262 allele-specific accessibility quantitative trait loci, which are enriched for cancer risk heritability and altered transcription factor binding motifs."
https://openalex.org/W4282934574,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in dynamic alterations of the microenvironment at the lesion site, which inevitably leads to neuronal degeneration and functional impairment. The destruction of the spinal vascular system leads to a significant deterioration of the milieu, which exacerbates inflammatory response and deprives cells of nutrient support in the lesion. Limited endogenous angiogenesis occurs after SCI, but the cellular events at the lesion site during this process are unclear so far. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on spinal cord tissues of rats at different time points after SCI. After clustering and cell-type identification, we focused on vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which play a pivotal role in angiogenesis, and drew the cellular and molecular atlas for angiogenesis after SCI. We found that microglia and macrophages promote endogenous angiogenesis by regulating EC subsets through SPP1 and IGF signaling pathways. Our results indicate that immune cells promote angiogenesis by regulating specific subsets of vascular ECs, which provides new clues for exploring SCI intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4282914820,"Dental treatments have been limited to emergency care in many countries worldwide due to the global rapid spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Fear of contracting the disease in dental clinics has also altered the pattern of dental visits and self-medication. The present study compared self-medication with antibiotics (SMA) and the pattern of dental visits before and after the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic in a referral dental clinic in the north of Iran.The data for the present cross-sectional study was collected from 756 patient records retrieved from the archives of the Faculty Clinic of Rasht School of Dentistry during two separate periods: before the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-November 2019 to mid-February 2020, and after the pandemic emergence from mid-April to mid-July 2020. In addition to demographic variables namely age, gender, and place of residence of patients, their smoking status, chief complaint, and SMA were also extracted from patient records. The Chi-square test and binary logistic regression models with 95% confidence interval served for statistical analysis.In total, 756 patient records (412 records from the pre-pandemic period and 344 records from the post-pandemic period) were evaluated. SMA was significantly more prevalent after the pandemic compared to that before pandemic (OR = 3.39, 95% CI = 2.43-4.73, P<0.001). The number of patients who smoke significantly decreased after the pandemic by 6.6% compared to that in pre-pandemic period. Dental pain, pus discharge, and abscess as the chief complaints of patients were significantly more prevalent during the post-pandemic period; while, dental checkups, tooth hypersensitivity, and esthetic dental problems were significantly more frequent as the chief complaints of patients during the pre-pandemic period.There is indication that during the COVID-19 pandemic, SMA and prevalence of acute dental problems in patients have increased. With regard to the consequences of SMA, there is a need to raise public awareness on this matter."
https://openalex.org/W4282936032,"Introduction Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, COVID-19 has changed the medical landscape. International recommendations for localized prostate cancer (PCa) include deferred treatment and adjusted therapeutic routines. Materials and methods To longitudinally evaluate changes in PCa treatment strategies in urological and radiotherapy departments in Germany, a link to a survey was sent to 134 institutions covering two representative baseline weeks prior to the pandemic and 13 weeks from March 2020 to February 2021. The questionnaire captured the numbers of radical prostatectomies, prostate biopsies and case numbers for conventional and hypofractionation radiotherapy. The results were evaluated using descriptive analyses. Results A total of 35% of the questionnaires were completed. PCa therapy increased by 6% in 2020 compared to 2019. At baseline, a total of 69 radiotherapy series and 164 radical prostatectomies (RPs) were documented. The decrease to 60% during the first wave of COVID-19 particularly affected low-risk PCa. The recovery throughout the summer months was followed by a renewed reduction to 58% at the end of 2020. After a gradual decline to 61% until July 2020, the number of prostate biopsies remained stable (89% to 98%) during the second wave. The use of RP fluctuated after an initial decrease without apparent prioritization of risk groups. Conventional fractionation was used in 66% of patients, followed by moderate hypofractionation (30%) and ultrahypofractionation (4%). One limitation was a potential selection bias of the selected weeks and the low response rate. Conclusion While the diagnosis and therapy of PCa were affected in both waves of the pandemic, the interim increase between the peaks led to a higher total number of patients in 2020 than in 2019. Recommendations regarding prioritization and fractionation routines were implemented heterogeneously, leaving unexplored potential for future pandemic challenges."

Globally, scabies affects more than 200 million people at any time. It remains one of the commonest skin diseases seen in developing countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of scabies among school-age children in Central Armachiho district, Northwest Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August to September 2020. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 850 study populations. Data was checked for its completeness, coded, and entered by using EPI-INFO version 7 and exported to the SPSS version 20 for analysis. A Binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify the determinants of scabies. Crude odds ratio (COR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI were used as measurements for the associations. P-values <0.005 were considered significant.Prevalence of scabies among the 850 participants studied was 10.82% (95% CI: 8.7-12.9). Contact history with confirmed scabies patient (AOR = 5.28,95% CI: 2.96-9.44), child not attending school (AOR = 3.08, 95% CI;1.45-6.54), rarely changing clothes (AOR = 2.43,95% CI: 1.27-4.62), sleeping on the floor (AOR = 4.11, 95% CI:1.95-8.67), bed sharing; (AOR = 3.38, 95% CI:2.86-6.15), rarely washing cloth: (AOR = 5.08,95% CI:2.75-9.36), living with internally displaced people; (AOR,95% CI: 3.47 (1.30-9.24) and using only water to wash hands; (AOR = 3.18,95% CI:1.74-5.80) had a statistically significant association with scabies infestation among school-age children.The current study found nearly one out of ten school-age children had scabies. Not attended school, contact history with confirmed scabies patient, not washing cloth, infrequent changing clothes, bedding sharing, sleeping on the floor, living with internally displaced people, and only using water for handwashing practice were the independent predictors for the occurrence of scabies. Health education better to given to the parents or caregivers about the washing of clothing, changing clothes at least once per week, and avoid physical contact with known scabies cases."
https://openalex.org/W4282915542,"COVID-19 has got us to face a new situation where, for the lack of ready-to-use vaccines, it is necessary to support vaccination with complex non-pharmaceutical strategies. In this paper, we provide a novel Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming formulation for fine-grained optimal intervention planning (i.e., at the level of the single day) against newborn epidemics like COVID-19, where a modified SIR model accounting for heterogeneous population classes, social distancing and several types of vaccines (each with its efficacy and delayed effects), allows us to plan an optimal mixed strategy (both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) that takes into account both the vaccine availability in limited batches at selected time instants and the need for second doses while keeping hospitalizations and intensive care occupancy below a threshold and requiring that new infections die out at the end of the planning horizon. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, we analyze a case study for Italy with realistic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4282922297,"Non-vitamin K direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is effective for prevention of embolic events in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. However, the effectiveness and safety of DOAC in AF patients who have bioprosthetic heart valve (BPHV) is largely unknown.We retrospectively identified patients with AF and BPHV, using the diagnostic code and medical device and surgery information from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, between 2013 and 2018. A 1:2 propensity score-matched cohort (n = 724 taking warfarin; n = 362 taking DOAC) was constructed and analyzed for the primary clinical outcome, a composite of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism. Important secondary outcomes included major bleeding, all-cause death, and the net clinical outcome, defined as a composite of all embolic events, major bleeding, and death.The mean age was 78.9±6.8 years old, and 45% (n = 489) were male. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.7±1.4. DOAC was non-inferior to warfarin for preventing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-2.34), major bleeding (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.32-2.03) and all-cause death (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.73-1.63). As for the net clinical outcome, DOAC was also similar to warfarin (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76-1.47). These outcomes were not different in various subgroups analyzed.In this nationwide Korean AF population with a BPHV, DOAC was at least as effective and safe as warfarin for the prevention of systemic embolic events. These results suggest that DOAC may be an excellent alternative to warfarin in AF patients with BPHV."
https://openalex.org/W4282926973,"The impacts of climate change are evident in the agriculture sector globally. These impacts are more severe and pronounced in a mountainous country like Nepal due to the high reliance on agro-economy and subsistence-based livelihoods by smallholder farmers that increase vulnerability and risks. Several ecosystem-based adaptation measures have proved to build the adaptive capacity of both agro-ecosystems and smallholder farmers by offering simple and affordable technologies however, these are yet to be prioritized by policy and programs for scaling. In this paper, we provide science-based evidence to traditionally used practices, such as jholmal (locally prepared bio-fertilizer and pesticides) and straw mulching by comparing their efficacy in terms of yield and reduction in disease pest infestation. The study was conducted in Kavre district of Nepal during 2017 and 2018 using participatory on-farm field trials for jholmal and straw mulching designed separately with Randomized Complete Block Design for selected vegetable crops like bitter gourd and tomato. The application of jholmal showed significant increase in bitter gourd yield both at the foothill and hilltop sites compared to the farmer's business usual practice (in 2017 and 2018, bitter gourd yield increased by 30.5% and 31.1% in foothill, while 26.6% and 28.7% in hilltops respectively). Further, a significant reduction on fruit infestation was observed in jholmal treated plots. Similarly, there was increase in tomato yield when straw mulch was used compared to the non-mulched trials (in 2017 and 2018, tomato yield increased by 16.5% and 20.3% respectively). These findings suggest that traditionally used practices have scientific basis and offer simple, affordable and climate friendly practices to improve the health of agro-ecosystem while supporting smallholder farmers to adapt to adverse impacts of climate change and build socio-ecological resilience. These practices can be also customized depending on the local context for wider adoption and scaling across Nepal and elsewhere as ecosystem-based adaptation measures for smallholder farmers."
https://openalex.org/W4282933897,"Whether there are sex differences in hemodynamic profiles among people with elevated blood pressure is not well understood and could guide personalization of treatment.We described the clinical and hemodynamic characteristics of adults with elevated blood pressure in China using impedance cardiography. We included 45,082 individuals with elevated blood pressure (defined as systolic blood pressure of ≥130 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of ≥80 mmHg), of which 35.2% were women. Overall, women had a higher mean systolic blood pressure than men (139.0 [±15.7] mmHg vs 136.8 [±13.8] mmHg, P<0.001), but a lower mean diastolic blood pressure (82.6 [±9.0] mmHg vs 85.6 [±8.9] mmHg, P<0.001). After adjusting for age, region, and body mass index, women <50 years old had lower systemic vascular resistance index (beta-coefficient [β] -31.7; 95% CI: -51.2, -12.2) and higher cardiac index (β 0.07; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.09) than men of their same age group, whereas among those ≥50 years old women had higher systemic vascular resistance index (β 120.4; 95% CI: 102.4, 138.5) but lower cardiac index (β -0.15; 95% CI: -0.16, -0.13). Results were consistent with a propensity score matching sensitivity analysis, although the magnitude of the SVRI difference was lower and non-significant.

https://openalex.org/W4282913134,"Meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is still a disease of great impact on Public health, which requires immediate diagnosis and treatment. However, the culture of clinical specimens is often negative and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) must be performed with isolated strains. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has high sensitivity and specificity, produces faster results to identify the pathogen, and it can also be an important tool to identify resistance antibiotic genes earlier than AST, especially in the absence of an isolated strain. This study developed a multiplex qPCR assay, using SYBR Green as a nonspecific dye, to detect antibiotic resistance genes to predict pneumococcal susceptibility/resistance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from meningitis patients. From 2017 to 2020, CSF samples were cultured and analyzed by qPCR to detect the main three bacteria causing meningitis. Isolated and reference strains were applied in SYBR Green qPCR multiplex to detect pbp2b, ermB, and mef genes, and the results were compared with the AST. Pneumococcal-positive CSF samples (lytA-positive gene) without isolated strains were also tested to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in the region from 2014 to 2020. From the received 873 CSF samples; 263 were cultivated, 149 were lytA-positive in the qPCR, and 25 produced viable isolated pneumococci strains, which were evaluated by AST. Melting temperature for each gene and the acceptance criteria were determined (pbp2b: 78.24-79.86; ermB: 80.88-82.56; mef: 74.85-76.34 ºC). A total of 48/51 strains presented a genetic profile in agreement with the AST results. Resistant strains to erythromycin and clindamycin were ermB-positive, and two were also mef-positive, indicating both resistance mechanisms were present. In the retrospective study of the genetic profile of resistance, 82 lytA-positive CSF samples plus 4 strains were applied in the SYBR Green qPCR multiplex: 51% of samples presented the wild genotype (pbp2b positive and ermB/mef negative); 15% were negative for all the three evaluated, indicating pneumococci resistant to penicillin; and 17% represented the multidrug-resistant pneumococci (pbp2b negative and ermB positive or pbp2b negative and ermB and mef positive). Therefore, SYBR Green qPCR multiplex proved to be a reliable tool to identify resistance genes in S. pneumoniae and would be less expensive than multiplex qPCR using specific probes. This could be easily introduced into the routine of diagnostic laboratories and provide a strong presumption of pneumococcal resistance, especially in the absence of isolated strains."

The viral load test was done using Abbott m2000sp/rt analyzer. Data was entered into Microsoft excel and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to compare HIV RNA viral load mean difference between different time to plasma separation, storage, freeze-thawing cycles and dilution levels. Post-hoc analysis was employed to locate the place of significant differences. P value less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance while viral RNA level of 0.5 log copies/ml was used to determine clinical significance.There was significant HIV-1 RNA viral load log mean difference between plasma separation time at 6 hours (hrs) and 24hrs (p<0.001). There was also significant HIV-1 RNA viral load log mean difference between plasma tested within 6hrs and those stored at 2-8°C for 15 days (p = 0.006), and between plasma stored at 2-8°C for 6 days versus 15 days (p<0.001). There was significant log mean difference between plasma that was exposed to fourth cycle of freeze-thawing after storage at -20°C when compared with plasma tested within 6hrs (p = 0.013).Plasma separated at 24hrs, stored at 2-8°C for 15 days or freeze-thawed for four cycles had significant effect on HIV viral load level. However, the differences were not clinically significant at a cut-off viral load level of 0.5 log copies/ml. Avoiding delays to plasma separation beyond 24 hrs, storing at 2-8°C for 15 days and freeze-thawing for no more than 4 cycles is recommended to improve the result quality."

This study aims to validate the Indonesian version of the Ten-item Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGDT-10) and conduct a latent class analysis of gamers among the youth. An online survey was conducted between October and December 2020 at two universities in Depok and Jakarta, Indonesia. In total, 1233 respondents (62.6% female and 20.3±1.90 years old) gave valid responses and played video games. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the unidimensional structure of the scale. Cronbach's alpha was 0.72 and composite reliability was 0.92. The latent class analysis yielded three distinct classes of gamers. The continuation and negative consequences were highly distinctive for the group at high risk of IGD (class 3). Deception had the lowest endorsement rate (41.7%); while, the continuation domain had the highest endorsement, 91.2%. The IGD prevalence estimate was 1.90% among the respondents. Approximately 70.2% of the gamers did not show IGD symptoms. The adapted Indonesian IGDT-10 was demonstrated as valid and reliable among Indonesian youths. Consistent with previous studies, the deception domain had a low endorsement rate. The detected IGD rates were comparable to the global range. The majority of the current sample disclosed no symptoms; however, a considerable proportion would benefit from early preventive measures."

Although some recent studies have investigated the association between the two diseases, studies that examined the association between stroke, depression, and QoL are rare, with large-scale national-level studies lacking. We aimed to investigate the association between depression and QoL in stroke patients.Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) IV-VII conducted in 2008-2018 were used, and 45,741 adults who were aged >40 years and had no missing data for stroke and depression were included in the analysis. The participants were first grouped by prevalence of stroke, and further divided by prevalence of depression.The overall prevalence of stroke was 3.2%, and the incidence was 9% higher in men than in women. Multiple logistic regression was performed after adjusting for demographic factors, health-related factors, and disease-related factors. The results confirmed that the stroke group with depression had a lower overall health-related quality of life, measured using EQ-5D, score compared to the stroke group without depression (-0.15). Moreover, the concurrent stroke and depression treatment group had the highest OR of 7.28 (95% CI 3.28-16.2) for the anxiety/depression domain.Depression was strongly associated with QoL in stroke patients. This association was more evident in stroke patients undergoing treatment for depression. Thus, clinical approaches that take QoL into consideration are needed for stroke patients with depression."
https://openalex.org/W4282932043,"Few children meet physical activity recommendations, partly due to the prevalence of screen-based sedentary activities. Active video game (AVG) play produces light to moderate physical activity. Yet, providing children access to AVG does not increase physical activity, possibly because children who play AVG may also tend towards sedentary screen-based activities. How multiple days of AVG play influences children's choice of other activities is not yet known.To examine how AVG influences children's physical activity, sedentary screen-based activities, and other alternative activities.Sedentary children (N = 49) played AVG 3 times/week and sedentary video games (SVG) ad libitum for 6 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of ad libitum play of both AVG and SVG. Participants wore an activity monitor for 7 days and completed a 24-hour activity recall on 4 randomly selected days at baseline, week 6, and week 10.AVG play increased during the intervention (p < 0.01). Light activity and SVG play both decreased baseline to 10 weeks (p = 0.006) and 6 to 10 weeks (p = 0.017). Non-SVG sedentary behavior increased from baseline to 10 weeks (p = 0.005) and 6 to 10 weeks (p = 0.007).

https://openalex.org/W4282935018,"In older adults, the quantitative decline of the quadriceps femoris is associated with the augmentation of difficulty in the execution of a stand-up task. However, it is unclear whether the cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of individual thigh muscles differ between older adults who can stand up from a 40-cm-height chair on a single leg and those who cannot. To investigate this, the present study determined the CSAs of individual mid-thigh muscles in 67 Japanese women aged 60–77 years by using a magnetic resonance imaging method. Participants were asked to stand up from a 40-cm-height chair on a single leg, and those who could and could not stand up without leaning back and maintain a standing posture for 3 seconds on a single leg were allocated into the successful group (SG, n = 40) and unsuccessful group (USG, n = 27), respectively. Only the CSA of the adductors (sum of the adductor longus and adductor magnus) was significantly smaller in USG compared to SG. When CSA was expressed relative to the two-third power of body mass, the values for the four heads of the quadriceps femoris and biceps femoris long head, as well as the adductors, were significantly lower in USG than in SG. The current results indicate that in terms of the value relative to body mass, the reduced CSAs of the adductors and biceps femoris long head, as well as the four heads of the quadriceps femoris, are associated with the failure of attempts to stand up from a 40-cm-height chair on a single leg in older women. This may be due to the anatomical function of the two muscle groups, which contributes to hip extension movement involved in transitioning from a sitting position to a standing position during the stand-up task."
https://openalex.org/W4282937587,"The objective of the study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of bundled devices (BDs) versus standard devices (SDs) for the prevention of unscheduled peripheral venous catheter (PVC) removal due to complication from a French investigator-initiated, open-label, single center, randomized-controlled, two-by-two factorial trial (CLEAN-3 study). A 14-day time non homogeneous semi-markovian model was performed to be fitted to longitudinal individual patient data from CLEAN-3 database. This model includes five health states and eight transitional events; a base case scenario, two scenario analyses and bootstrap sensitivity analyses were performed. The cost-effectiveness criterion was the cost per patient with unscheduled PVC removal avoided. 989 adult (age≥18 years) patients were analyzed to compare the BDs group (494 patients), and the SDs group (495 patients). The assessed intervention was a combination of closed integrated catheters, positive displacement needleless-connectors, disinfecting caps, and single-use prefilled flush syringes compared with the use of open catheters and three-way stopcocks for treatment administration. For the base case scenario, an unscheduled 1 st PVC removal before discharge was significantly more frequent in the SDs group (235 patients (47.5%) in the SDs group and 172 patients (34.8%) in the BDs group, p = 0.00006). After adjustment for 1 st catheter time, the number of patients with unscheduled PVC removal per day was of 16 (95%CI: 15; 18) patients (out of 100) in the BDs group and of 26 (95%CI: 24; 28) patients (out of 100) in the SDs group. The mean cost per patient (adjusted on catheter-time) was of €144 (95%CI: €135-€154) for patients in the SDs group versus €102 (95%CI: €95-€109) for patients in the BDs group; the mean saving per patient was of €42 (95%CI: €32-€54). As a consequence, the assessed BDs strategy was less costly and more effective than the SDs strategy. Trail registration: CLEAN-3 study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03757143 ."
https://openalex.org/W4282939287,"Background Low birth weight (LBW) is defined as a birth weight less than 2500 g. It is an important predictor of early neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term health outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for low birth weight in Marrakech Morocco. Methods A retrospective based case-control study was conducted from July 2018 to July 2019. 462 mother infant pairs (231 low birth weight babies as cases and 231 normal birth weights as controls) were included in the study. Data were collected through face to face interview using a structured and pretested questionnaire. The collected data were managed with Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with low birth weight at p-value &lt; 0.05 with their respective odds ratios and 95% confidence interval. Results The univariate analysis revealed the effect of the following determinants on the LBW: rural residence, father’s age, father’s professional activity, consanguinity, family type, mother’s low educational level, and mother’s intense physical activity. After the multivariate analysis, the risk factors identified were: rural residence (P = 0.017), father’s professional activity (temporarily working) (P = 0.000), absence of the consanguinity link (P = 0.016), and mother’s intense physical activity (P = 0.014). Conclusion Results show father’s professional activity (temporarily working), rural residence, absence of the consanguinity link and mother’s intense physical activity are independent predictors of low birth weight. The current findings add substantially to the growing literature on the influence of parent’s socio-demographic and cultural factors on LBW in resource-constrained settings and provide empirical data for public health interventions to reduce low birth weight."
https://openalex.org/W4282942603,"Global climate change is having a significant effect on agriculture by causing greater precipitation variability and an increased risk of drought. To mitigate these effects, it is important to identify specific traits, adaptations, and germplasm that improve tolerance to soil water deficit. Local varieties, known as landraces, have undergone generations of farmer-mediated selection and can serve as sources of variation, specifically for tolerance to abiotic stress. Landraces can possess local adaptations, where accessions adapted to a particular environment will outperform others grown under the same conditions. We explore adaptations to water deficit in chile pepper landraces from across an environmental gradient in Mexico, a center of crop domestication and diversity, as well in improved varieties bred for the US. In the present study, we evaluated 25 US and Mexico accessions in a greenhouse experiment under well-watered and water deficit conditions and measured morphological, physiological, and agronomic traits. Accession and irrigation regime influenced plant biomass and height, while branching, CO 2 assimilation, and fruit weight were all influenced by an interaction between accession and irrigation. A priori group contrasts revealed possible adaptations to water deficit for branching, CO 2 assimilation, and plant height associated with geographic origin, domestication level, and pepper species. Additionally, within the Mexican landraces, the number of primary branches had a strong relationship with precipitation from the environment of origin. This work provides insight into chile pepper response to water deficit and adaptation to drought and identifies possibly tolerant germplasm."

https://openalex.org/W4282927464,"Recently, researchers have proposed four superordinate emotion beliefs that supposedly influence emotion regulation and emotion reactivity. Two of these proposed emotion beliefs are captured in the cognitive mediation beliefs questionnaire (CMBQa), namely stimulus-response (S-R) generation beliefs and cognitive mediation (C-M) change beliefs. The remaining two proposed emotion beliefs, C-M generation beliefs and S-R change beliefs, are yet to be operationalised in psychometric form. It is important to validate measurement for all four emotion beliefs in order for them to be used in research and practice. The current paper reports the development and initial validity testing of the CMBQb (studies 1-3), which concerns only C-M generation beliefs and S-R change beliefs, and then tests the four-factor structure of the combined CMBQa (S-R generation, C-M change) and CMBQb (C-M generation, S-R change): the CMBQc (study 4). Some support was found for the four-factor structure of the CMBQc, with factor analyses revealing good fit to the data with a four-factor solution. Also, scores indicating greater C-M generation and change beliefs, and lower S-R generation and change beliefs, were related to more adaptive, and less maladaptive, emotion regulation tendencies. In addition, there was some evidence that greater C-M change beliefs, and lower S-R generation and change belief, were related to better affective and emotion reactivity outcomes. Implications of the CMBQc for research and practice are discussed within the context and emotion regulation science, and cognitive behavioural psychotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4282930277,"This study aims to investigate the binding potential of chemical compounds of Senna in comparison with the experimentally tested active phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 protein targets to assist in prevention of infection by exploring multiple treatment options. The entire set of phytochemicals from both the groups were subjected to advanced computational analysis that explored functional molecular descriptors from a set of known medicinal-based active therapeutics followed by MD simulations on multiple SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. Our findings manifest the importance of hydrophobic substituents in chemical structures of potential inhibitors through cross-validation with the FDA-approved anti-3CL pro drugs. Noteworthy improvement in end-point binding free energies and pharmacokinetic profiles of the proposed compounds was perceived in comparison to the control drug, vizimpro. Moreover, the identification of common drug targets namely; AKT1, PTGS1, TNF, and DPP4 between proposed active phytochemicals and Covid19 using network pharmacological analysis further substantiate the importance of medicinal scaffolds. The structural dynamics and binding affinities of phytochemical compounds xanthoangelol_E, hesperetin, and beta-sitosterol reported as highly potential against 3CL pro in cell-based and cell-free assays are consistent with the computational analysis. Whereas, the secondary metabolites such as sennosides A, B, C, D present in higher amount in Senna exhibited weak binding affinity and instability against the spike protein, helicase nsp13, RdRp nsp12, and 3CL pro . In conclusion, the results contravene fallacious efficacy claims of Senna tea interventions circulating on electronic/social media as Covid19 cure; thus emphasizing the importance of well-examined standardized data of the natural products in hand; thereby preventing unnecessary deaths under pandemic hit situations worldwide."

There is great need for predictive biomarkers associated with overall survival (OS) and clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that circulating metabolic, inflammatory, and immune molecules have potential as predictive biomarkers for AML patients who receive HCT treatment. This retrospective study was designed with an exploratory approach to comprehensively characterize immune, inflammatory, and metabolomic biomarkers. We identified patients with AML who underwent HCT and had existing baseline plasma samples. Using those samples (n = 34), we studied 65 blood based metabolomic and 61 immune/inflammatory related biomarkers, comparing patients with either long-term OS (≥ 3 years) or short-term OS (OS ≤ 1 years). We also compared the immune/inflammatory response and metabolomic biomarkers in younger vs. older AML patients (≤30 years vs. ≥ 55 years old). In addition, the biomarker profiles were analyzed for their association with clinical outcomes, namely OS, chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), infection and relapse. Several baseline biomarkers were elevated in older versus younger patients, and baseline levels were lower for three markers (IL13, SAA, CRP) in patients with OS ≥ 3 years. We also identified immune/inflammatory response markers associated with aGVHD (IL-9, Eotaxin-3), cGVHD (Flt-1), infection (D-dimer), or relapse (IL-17D, bFGF, Eotaxin-3). Evaluation of metabolic markers demonstrated higher baseline levels of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines (AC) in older patients, association with aGVHD (lactate, long-chain AC), and cGVHD (medium-chain AC). These differentially expressed profiles merit further evaluation as predictive biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4282934593,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common poignant endocrine disorder affecting women, posing a close association with metabolic syndrome and obesity. Existing literature characterizes PCOS with deranged levels of several adipokines and myokines. CTRP15 is a paralogue of adiponectin, mainly expressed by skeletal muscles, and plays a key role in insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism. In the current study, we aim to determine the circulating levels of CTRP15 and evaluate its association with cardiometabolic and inflammatory parameters in PCOS women. This case-control study included 120 PCOS patients (60 Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and 60 infertile (inf) PCOS) and 60 healthy non-PCOS controls. Serum levels of hs-CRP were measured by commercial kits, while serum levels of adiponectin and CTRP15 were determined using the ELISA technique. Serum levels of CTRP15 were significantly elevated in PCOS-RPL and PCOS-inf subgroups when compared to controls (94.80 ± 27.08 and 87.77 ± 25.48 vs. 54.78 ± 15.45, both P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, serum adiponectin was considerably lower in the PCOS group and subgroups (P &lt; 0.001), while serum hs-CRP, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and free testosterone were significantly higher when compared to the non-PCOS group (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, CTRP15 closely associated with FSH, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, and BMI. These results highlight a possible involvement of CTRP15 in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The elevated levels of CTRP15 might be a compensatory mechanism for the metabolic dysregulations (excess adiposity, insulin resistance, metaflammation) associated with the syndrome. Nevertheless, future studies are necessary to unravel the underlying mechanism."

However, understanding of gender stereotype endorsement in gender diverse adolescents—those who identify as transgender, nonbinary, and/or gender nonconforming—is limited. Gender diverse adolescents’ experiences with gender raise the question of whether they endorse gender stereotypes with the same frequency as cisgender adolescents. In this study, we investigated three primary research questions: (1) if gender diverse (N = 144) and cisgender (N = 174) adolescents (13–17 years) and their parents (N = 143 parents of gender diverse adolescents, N = 160 parents of cisgender adolescents) endorse gender stereotypes; (2) whether these groups differed from one another in their endorsement of gender stereotypes; and (3) whether parents’ gender stereotyping was related to either their adolescents’ stereotyping and/or their adolescents’ predictions of their parents’ stereotyping. We found (1) that participants showed low amounts of stereotyping; (2) there were no significant differences between gender stereotype endorsement in gender diverse and cisgender adolescents (or between their parents), though parents endorsed stereotypes slightly less than adolescents; and (3) there was a small positive association between adolescents’ stereotyping and their parents’ gender stereotyping. We discuss the limitations of our methods, and the possibility that rates of explicit stereotype endorsement may be changing over time."
https://openalex.org/W4282935006,"Riverine macrophytes form distinct species groups. Their occurrence is determined by environmental gradients, e.g. in terms of physico-chemistry and hydromorphology. However, the ranges of environmental variables discriminating between species groups (“discriminatory ranges”) have rarely been quantified and mainly been based on expert judgement, thus limiting options for predicting and assessing ecosystem characteristics. We used a pan-European dataset of riverine macrophyte surveys obtained from 22 countries including data on total phosphorus, nitrate, alkalinity, flow velocity, depth, width and substrate type. Four macrophyte species groups were identified by cluster analysis based on species’ co-occurrences. These comprised Group 1) mosses, such as Amblystegium fluviatile and Fontinalis antipyretica , Group 2) shorter and pioneer species such as Callitriche spp., Group 3) emergent and floating species such as Sagittaria sagittifolia and Lemna spp., and Group 4) eutraphent species such as Myriophyllum spicatum and Stuckenia pectinata . With Random Forest models, the ranges of environmental variables discriminating between these groups were estimated as follows: 100–150 μg L -1 total phosphorus, 0.5–20 mg L -1 nitrate, 1–2 meq L -1 alkalinity, 0.05–0.70 m s -1 flow velocity, 0.3–1.0 m depth and 20–80 m width. Mosses were strongly related to coarse substrate, while vascular plants were related to finer sediment. The four macrophyte groups and the discriminatory ranges of environmental variables fit well with those described in literature, but have now for the first time been quantitatively approximated with a large dataset, suggesting generalizable patterns applicable at regional and local scales."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the variation in the morpho-agronomic characteristics of three native maize races, Tuxpeño, Olotillo × Tuxpeño and Ratón × Tepecintle, cultivated in different AS in a tropical climate of Veracruz, Mexico, as well as its association with microclimatic conditions. In 2019, experiments were established in the localities La Gloria and La Luisa, Veracruz, where the three maize races are cultivated, in a randomized complete block design with three replications in a 3 × 4 factorial scheme (three native maize races and three AS arrrays, plus monoculture). Ten morpho-agronomic variables were recorded in each experiment and were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA; Tukey's post-hoc test, all p ≤ 0.05) and principal component analysis (PCA). Six morpho-agronomic characteristics showed significant differences for the race × system interaction. Consistently standing out both in the Myroxylon with 2.8 m × 2.0 arrays and in the monoculture was the Olotillo × Tuxpeño race, as there were no variations (p ≥ 0.05) in 50% of its morpho-agronomic characteristics. The first three PCs explained 87.7% of the cumulative variance, determined by five variables of the ears, three of the grain and plant height, which were associated with temperature; therefore, the microclimatic conditions of the studied ASs are associated with the morpho-agronomic characteristics of the native maize races. The results show that ASs could be a strategy for the conservation and use of native corn germplasm and could allow the diversification of sustainable production for rural farmers."

In this direction, this study addresses the following problems. First, the performances of the Weiszfeld, tree-seed, and whale optimization algorithms are compared, which is the first of its kind in the literature. Second, a new approach that tests the importance parameters' effectiveness in searching for an optimum transportation facility location with emergency equipment and staff is proposed. The Weiszfeld algorithm finds viable solutions with compact data, but it may not handle big data. In contrast, the flexibility of the tree-seed and whale optimization algorithm is literally an advantage when the number of parameters and variables increases. Therefore, there is a notable need to directly compare those algorithms' performances. If we do, the significance of extending the number of parameters with multiple weightings is appraised. According to the results, the Weiszfeld algorithm can be an almost flexible technique in continuous networks; however, it has reasonable drawbacks with discrete networks, while the tree-seed and whale optimization algorithms fit such conditions. On the other hand, these three methods do not show a fluctuating performance compared to one another based on the locating transportation facilities, and thus they deliver similar performance. Besides, although the value of accuracy is high with the application of the conventional technique Weiszfeld algorithm, it does not provide a significant performance accuracy advantage over the meta-heuristic methods."

Here we describe SHIMS 3.0, using ultra-long nanopore reads to augment the Illumina data from SHIMS 2.0 assemblies and resolve internally repetitive structures. This greatly minimizes the need for manual finishing of Illumina-based draft assemblies, allowing a small team with no prior finishing experience to sequence challenging targets with high accuracy. This protocol proceeds from clone-picking to finished assemblies in 2 weeks for about $80 (USD) per clone. We recently used this protocol to produce reference sequence of structurally complex palindromes on chimpanzee and rhesus macaque X chromosomes. Our protocol provides access to structurally complex regions that would otherwise be inaccessible from whole-genome shotgun data or require an impractical amount of manual effort to generate an accurate assembly."
