Self-renewal capacity declines with age, partly because of increasing expression of the tumor suppressor p16Ink4a. We discovered that the Hmga2 transcriptional regulator is highly expressed in fetal neural stem cells but that expression declines with age. This decrease is partly caused by the increasing expression of let-7b microRNA, which is known to target HMGA2. Hmga2-deficient mice show reduced stem cell numbers and self-renewal throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems of fetal and young-adult mice but not old-adult mice. Furthermore, p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression were increased in Hmga2-deficient fetal and young-adult stem cells, and deletion of p16Ink4a and/or p19Arf partially restored self-renewal capacity. let-7b overexpression reduced Hmga2 and increased p16Ink4a/p19Arf expression. Hmga2 thus promotes fetal and young-adult stem cell self-renewal by decreasing p16Ink4a/p19Arf expression. Changes in let-7 and Hmga2 expression during aging contribute to the decline in neural stem cell function. Stem cells persist throughout life in diverse tissues by undergoing self-renewing divisions.

Changes in let-7 and Hmga2 expression during aging contribute to the decline in neural stem cell function. Stem cells self-renew throughout life in numerous tissues, including the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems (Kruger et al., 2002Kruger G.M. Mosher J.T. Bixby S. Joseph N. Iwashita T.

Declines in stem cell function within aging tissues are partially caused by increasing p16Ink4a expression. p16Ink4a generally cannot be detected in fetal and young-adult tissues but is induced in a variety of aging tissues (Zindy et al., 1997Zindy F.

Increasing p16INK4a expression decreases forebrain progenitors and neurogenesis during ageing.Nature. 2006; 443: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). However, it remains uncertain what regulates this change in p16Ink4a expression in old tissues and what mechanisms act in fetal and young-adult stem cells to increase their self-renewal relative to old-adult stem cells. Consistent with the changes in stem cell function with age, different transcriptional programs regulate stem cell self-renewal at embryonic, fetal-neonatal, and adult stages. Fetal and neonatal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) depend on Sox17 for their maintenance, whereas adult HSCs do not, demonstrating the existence of a distinct fetal-neonatal self-renewal program (Kim et al., 2007Kim I.

Bmi-1-deficient mice are born with normal numbers of stem cells but exhibit postnatal self-renewal defects that lead to the depletion of adult stem cells (Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003Lessard J.

Other transcriptional regulators are also required by postnatal but not fetal stem cells (Hock et al., 2004aHock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Schindler J.W. Saleque S. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H.

This raises the question of whether all stage-specific transcriptional regulators of self-renewal cluster into temporally distinct embryonic, fetal-neonatal, and postnatal-adult programs. Bmi-1 promotes the self-renewal of postnatal stem cells largely by repressing the expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf (Bruggeman et al., 2005Bruggeman S.W. Valk-Lingbeek M.E. van der Stoop P.P.

Sherr C.J. Tumor suppression by Ink4a-Arf: Progress and puzzles.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). p19Arf promotes p53 activity, also slowing cell-cycle progression or inducing cellular senescence. Bmi-1 represses p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression within postnatal stem cells (Molofsky et al., 2003Molofsky A.V. Pardal R. Iwashita T. Park I.K. Clarke M.F. Morrison S.J. Bmi-1 dependence distinguishes neural stem cell self-renewal from progenitor proliferation.Nature. 2003; 425: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). However, p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression increase in aging stem cells despite ongoing Bmi-1 expression (Molofsky et al., 2006Molofsky A.V. Slutsky S.G. Joseph N.M. He S. Pardal R. Krishnamurthy J. Sharpless N.E. Morrison S.J. Increasing p16INK4a expression decreases forebrain progenitors and neurogenesis during ageing.Nature. 2006; 443: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In addition to contributing to the decline in stem cell function with age, p16Ink4a, and perhaps p19Arf, may also contribute to diseases of aging (Sharpless and DePinho, 2007Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. How stem cells age and why this makes us grow old.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that adult stem cell maintenance critically depends upon transcriptional mechanisms that repress p16Ink4a and p19Arf; however, these studies also raise important questions. Do fetal stem cells have different mechanisms to repress p16Ink4a/p19Arf? Why do old-adult stem cells express higher levels of p16Ink4a and p19Arf than young-adult stem cells? Hmga2 is a member of the high-mobility group A (HMGA) family that encodes a small, chromatin-associated protein that has no intrinsic transcriptional activity but can modulate transcription by altering chromatin structure (Reeves, 2001Reeves R. Molecular biology of HMGA proteins: hubs of nuclear function.Gene. 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Hmga2 is widely expressed in undifferentiated cells during embryogenesis, but expression becomes more restricted as fetal development progresses (Zhou et al., 1995Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Mutation responsible for the mouse pygmy phenotype in the developmentally regulated factor HMGI-C.Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, Hirning-Folz et al., 1998Hirning-Folz U. Wilda M. Rippe V. Bullerdiek J. Hameister H. The expression pattern of the Hmgic gene during development.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 23: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hmga2 is rarely detected within normal adult tissues but is expressed by a variety of benign and malignant tumors (Schoenmakers et al., 1995Schoenmakers E.F. Wanschura S. Mols R. Bullerdiek J. Van den Berghe H. Van de Ven W.J. Recurrent rearrangements in the high mobility group protein gene, HMGI-C, in benign mesenchymal tumours.Nat.

Cancer. 2007; 7: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that let-7 family microRNAs are important negative regulators of Hmga2 expression: loss of the let-7 binding sites in Hmga2 increases Hmga2 expression and promotes tumorigenesis (Lee and Dutta, 2007Lee Y.S.

Hmga2−/− mice exhibit a dwarf phenotype (Zhou et al., 1995Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Mutation responsible for the mouse pygmy phenotype in the developmentally regulated factor HMGI-C.Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of truncated (let-7-insensitive) HMGA2 in mice increases body size and the incidence of certain tumors (Arlotta et al., 2000Arlotta P. Tai A.K. Manfioletti G. Clifford C. Jay G. Ono S.J. Transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of the high mobility group I-C protein develop adiposity and an abnormally high prevalence of lipomas.J. Biol.

Melillo R.M. et al.HMGA2 induces pituitary tumorigenesis by enhancing E2F1 activity.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 459-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It has not yet been tested whether Hmga2 regulates somatic stem cell function. In a full-genome analysis, Hmga2 was the only gene that we found to be preferentially expressed by stem cells and that showed a progressive decline in expression with age. This decline in Hmga2 expression inversely correlated with increasing let-7b expression during aging, and deletion of the let-7 binding sites in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of Hmga2 was required for overexpression of Hmga2 in stem cells from old mice. Hmga2 increased the self-renewal of fetal and young-adult stem cells relative to old-adult stem cells by negatively regulating p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression in fetal and young-adult, but not old-adult, stages. The requirement for Hmga2 in fetal and young-adult stem cells, along with the requirement for Bmi-1 in adult stem cells, demonstrates there are overlapping transcriptional mechanisms to prevent the expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf in stem cells. Such pathways are temporally regulated by changes in let-7b and Hmga2 expression to allow p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression in aging stem cells. We reasoned that genes that regulate changes in stem cell function with age might show progressive changes in their expression in stem cells with age. In a prior study, we identified 26 genes that were more highly expressed by fetal HSCs than by young-adult HSCs (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Morrison S.J. Spatial differences in hematopoiesis but not in stem cells indicate a lack of regional patterning in definitive hematopoietic stem cells.Dev. Biol. 2005; 283: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined these genes by quantitative (real-time) PCR (qPCR) and with additional microarray data sets (data not shown) to identify genes that fit two additional criteria. First, we identified genes that remained detectably expressed by young-adult HSCs but declined significantly further in expression in old-adult HSCs (>3-fold, p < 0.01). Second, we identified genes that were more highly expressed in HSCs as compared to all CD45+ hematopoietic cells. Only one gene in a full-genome analysis met all of these criteria: Hmga2 (Figures 1A and 1B). To test whether this unusual expression pattern is observed in other tissues, we examined Hmga2 expression in CNS stem and progenitor cells by performing qPCR on cells from embryonic day (E)14.5 telencephalon, postnatal day (P)0 lateral ventricle ventricular zone (VZ), P30 lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ), P360 SVZ, and P720 SVZ (locations in which neural stem and progenitor cells reside within the forebrain). We again observed declining Hmga2 expression with age (Figure 1C). Hmga1 did not exhibit a similar change in expression with age by either microarray analysis in HSCs (data not shown) or by qPCR in CNS progenitors (Figure 1C). Hmga2 was also expressed at higher levels in CNS stem and progenitor cells as compared to differentiated cells by qPCR (Figure 1D), western blot (Figure 1E), and in situ hybridization (Figure 1F). We confirmed the decline in Hmga2 expression with age in neural stem and progenitor cells by both western blot (Figure 1E) and in situ hybridization (Figure 1F): Hmga2 expression was extinguished in the SVZ of old mice by every technique. The declining Hmga2 expression with age contrasted with the increasing expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf with age in stem and progenitor cells (Figure 1C). These data raised the possibility that Hmga2 might contribute to the increased stem cell function in fetal and young-adult mice as compared to old-adult mice. To assess Hmga2 function, we examined Hmga2-deficient mice (Zhou et al., 1995Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Mutation responsible for the mouse pygmy phenotype in the developmentally regulated factor HMGI-C.Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier reports (Benson and Chada, 1994Benson K.F. Chada K. Mini-mouse: Phenotypic characterization of a transgenic insertional mutant allelic to pygmy.Genet. Res. 1994; 64: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 1995Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Mutation responsible for the mouse pygmy phenotype in the developmentally regulated factor HMGI-C.Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), Hmga2 deficiency led to significant (p < 0.01) growth retardation that was evident by birth and that remained evident throughout adult life (Figures S1A–S1F available online). The brains of adult Hmga2−/− mice were also significantly (p < 0.01) smaller than the brains of littermate controls (Figures S1G and S1H). Despite this growth retardation, we detected no premature death among Hmga2−/− mice. To assess whether Hmga2 regulates changes in stem cell function during aging, we elected to focus on neural stem cells from the CNS and PNS because these stem cell populations exhibit clear declines in frequency, mitotic activity, and neurogenesis in vivo during aging (Kruger et al., 2002Kruger G.M. Mosher J.T. Bixby S. Joseph N. Iwashita T. Morrison S.J. Neural crest stem cells persist in the adult gut but undergo changes in self-renewal, neuronal subtype potential, and factor responsiveness.Neuron. 2002; 35: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, Molofsky et al., 2006Molofsky A.V. Slutsky S.G. Joseph N.M. He S. Pardal R. Krishnamurthy J. Sharpless N.E. Morrison S.J. Increasing p16INK4a expression decreases forebrain progenitors and neurogenesis during ageing.Nature. 2006; 443: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). We cultured CNS stem cells from the forebrain of Hmga2−/− mice and littermate controls to test whether Hmga2 was required for normal neural stem cell function (Figure 2A). The percentage of dissociated cells that was capable of forming multipotent neurospheres did not differ between Hmga2−/− and wild-type telencephalon at E11.5 or E14.5 but was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the Hmga2−/− P0 VZ and P49–56 SVZ as compared to littermate controls (Figure 2B). Hmga2+/− cells performed similarly to wild-type cells in this assay (data not shown), so cells from wild-type littermates were used as controls in subsequent experiments. To minimize fusion between neurospheres, we cultured cells at very low density in nonadherent cultures (<1 cell/μl of medium) and then transferred them to adherent secondary cultures to determine the fraction of neurospheres capable of multilineage differentiation. Fetal and adult Hmga2−/− neurospheres were significantly smaller (p < 0.05) than wild-type neurospheres and gave rise to significantly fewer multipotent secondary neurospheres (p < 0.01) upon subcloning (Figures 2A and 2B). These data suggest that Hmga2 is not required for the formation of stem cells during embryonic development but that Hmga2−/− deficiency reduces self-renewal potential throughout fetal development and young adulthood, reducing stem cell frequency by birth and even further by adulthood. To test whether Hmga2 is required for stem cell function in other tissues, we examined neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) from the guts of Hmga2−/− mice and littermate controls. NCSCs give rise to the enteric nervous system within the gut during fetal development and then persist throughout adult life in the gut wall (Kruger et al., 2002Kruger G.M. Mosher J.T. Bixby S. Joseph N. Iwashita T. Morrison S.J. Neural crest stem cells persist in the adult gut but undergo changes in self-renewal, neuronal subtype potential, and factor responsiveness.Neuron. 2002; 35: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the PNS, the frequency of cells capable of forming multipotent neurospheres also did not differ between Hmga2−/− guts and littermate controls at E14.5 but was significantly reduced in Hmga2−/− guts at P0 and P49–56 compared to littermate controls (p < 0.05; Figure S2B). The Hmga2−/− neurospheres were also significantly smaller (p < 0.01) and gave rise to fewer secondary multipotent neurospheres (p < 0.05) upon subcloning at all stages examined (Figure S2B). Hmga2 was thus required to maintain normal neural stem cell self-renewal and frequency throughout the PNS and CNS. The reduced self-renewal of Hmga2-deficient CNS stem cells was associated with significantly reduced proliferation within stem cell colonies (p < 0.05; Figures 2C and 2F) but no detectable effect on cell death, whether this was assessed on the basis of activated caspase-3 staining (Figure 2D) or nuclear morphology (Figure 2E; cell death was rare in all colonies). In the PNS, Hmga2 deficiency also led to the formation of smaller colonies with a lower frequency of dividing cells (Figures S2C–S2E). These data suggest that Hmga2 promotes neural stem cell self-renewal by promoting division. To assess whether the reduced self-renewal of Hmga2−/− neural stem cells could be rescued by Hmga2 overexpression, we infected P0 VZ cells from an Hmga2−/− mouse with a dual-promoter lentivirus expressing Hmga2 and GFP, or control virus lacking Hmga2 (GFP-only). After infection, the cells were subcloned into secondary cultures to form neurospheres. GFP-only vector did not affect the diameter or self-renewal of neurospheres as compared to uninfected neurospheres within the same cultures (Figure 2G). In contrast, Hmga2 overexpression significantly increased the diameter and self-renewal of neurospheres as compared to both uninfected neurospheres within the same cultures and GFP-only neurospheres (p < 0.05; Figure 2G). Hmga2 overexpression can thus rescue the self-renewal defect in Hmga2−/− neural stem cells. To assess the effect of Hmga2 deficiency on neural stem cell differentiation, we adherently cultured cells from the P0 VZ at clonal density. We first examined multilineage colonies 7 days after plating. Hmga2−/− colonies showed no signs of premature differentiation as only rare cells expressed neuronal or astrocytic markers in either Hmga2−/− or wild-type colonies and no cells expressed the oligodendrocyte marker O4 (Figure 3A). We cultured cells for another 7 days in medium that promotes differentiation and observed similar multilineage differentiation to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in Hmga2−/− and wild-type CNS stem cell colonies (Figure 3B). Similar results were observed in NCSC colonies (data not shown). Indeed, the vast majority of neurospheres cultured from the CNS and PNS at all stages of development underwent multilineage differentiation irrespective of Hmga2 genotype (Figure S3). Hmga2 deficiency therefore does not affect the ability of neural stem cells to undergo multilineage differentiation. However, adherent stem cell colonies, like neurospheres, were significantly smaller in the absence of Hmga2 (Figure 3A). We examined proliferation in the SVZ of young-adult mice by administering a pulse of BrdU. Hmga2−/− mice exhibited a significantly lower overall rate of proliferation in the SVZ in vivo (p < 0.01; Figure 3C). This was consistent with the reduced proliferation within Hmga2−/− CNS stem cell colonies in culture (Figure 2F) and the reduced brain size of Hmga2−/− mice (Figures S1G and S1H). The P0 VZ was also slightly but significantly thinner in Hmga2−/− mice than in littermate controls (Figure 3D), consistent with the reduced stem cell frequency (Figure 2B) and overall mitotic activity (Figure 3C) in these mice. In the PNS, we counted the number of myenteric plexus neurons per transverse section through the distal ileum. Defects in NCSC self-renewal, such as those observed in the absence of Bmi-1, lead to a reduction in the number of neurons per section (Molofsky et al., 2003Molofsky A.V. Pardal R. Iwashita T.

Young-adult Hmga2−/− mice also had significantly fewer neurons per section than did littermate controls (p < 0.01; Figures 3E and 3F). Hmga2−/− mice exhibit phenotypes in vivo consistent with reduced proliferation by CNS and PNS neural stem cells. We examined the effect of Hmga2 deficiency on the proliferation of restricted neuronal progenitors (that make neuron-only colonies) and restricted glial progenitors (that make glia-only colonies) in adherent cultures at clonal density. Whether these restricted progenitors were cultured from the E14.5 telencephalon, the P0 VZ, or the P49–56 SVZ, the size and frequency of CNS neuron-only colonies and glia-only colonies were unaffected by Hmga2 deficiency (Figures 4A–4D). The same was true in the PNS (Figures 4E–4H). These results contrast with the reduced size of multilineage stem cell colonies from the CNS (Figure 2) and PNS (Figure S2) in the absence of Hmga2 in both adherent and nonadherent cultures. Hmga2 therefore does not promote the proliferation of all cells but rather is preferentially required for the self-renewal of stem cells. Since Hmga2 expression declines in SVZ cells as p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression increase during aging (Figure 1C), we wondered whether Hmga2 might promote neural stem cell self-renewal by negatively regulating p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression. We examined p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression by qPCR in CNS and PNS neurospheres cultured from Hmga2−/− mice and littermate controls. p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression increased significantly in CNS (Figure 5A) and PNS (Figure 5B) neurospheres from E14.5, P0, and P49–56 Hmga2−/− mice as compared to littermate controls. Fetal neurospheres showed the greatest increase in p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression in the absence of Hmga2. Importantly, there was no effect of Hmga2 deficiency on p16Ink4a or p19Arf expression by neurospheres cultured from old (P570–600) mice, consistent with our failure to detect Hmga2 expression in neural stem and progenitor cells from old mice (Figure 1). The same trends were evident at the protein level by western blot in CNS (Figure 5C) and PNS (Figure 5D) neurospheres. p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression levels therefore increase in Hmga2−/− CNS stem and progenitor cells from fetal and young-adult but not old-adult mice. To ensure that Hmga2 also negatively regulates p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression in CNS stem and progenitor cells in vivo, we performed western blots on E14.5 telencephalon cells, P49–56 SVZ cells, and P570–600 SVZ cells from Hmga2−/− mice and littermate controls.

However, how signal is transduced from agrin to MuSK remains unclear. We report that LRP4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein, is expressed specifically in myotubes and binds to neuronal agrin. Its expression enables agrin binding and MuSK signaling in cells that otherwise do not respond to agrin. Suppression of LRP4 expression in muscle cells attenuates agrin binding, agrin-induced MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, and AChR clustering. LRP4 also forms a complex with MuSK in a manner that is stimulated by agrin. Finally, we showed that LRP4 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in agrin-stimulated muscle cells. These observations indicate that LRP4 is a coreceptor of agrin that is necessary for MuSK signaling and AChR clustering and identify a potential target protein whose mutation and/or autoimmunization may cause muscular dystrophies.

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a cholinergic synapse that conveys signals from motor neurons to muscle cells. It has served as an informative model of synaptogenesis because of its simplicity and accessibility (Sanes and Lichtman, 1999Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W.

Burden S.J. et al.Agrin acts via a MuSK receptor complex.Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). A hypothetical molecule, myotube-associated specificity component (MASC), was proposed to serve as a binding partner for agrin to transduce signals to MuSK (Glass et al., 1996aGlass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K.

Despite extensive studies, the identity of this coreceptor of agrin remains unclear. LRP4 (or MEGF7, for multiple epidermal growth factor [EGF]-like domain 7) is a member of the LDLR family, and contains a large extracellular N-terminal region that possesses multiple EGF repeats and LDLR repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal region without an identifiable catalytic motif (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson E.B.

Remarkably, LRP4 is required for NMJ formation as well as the development of the limb, lung, kidney, and ectodermal organs (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson E.B. Hammer R.E. Herz J.

Anderson K.V. Niswander L.A. LDL-receptor-related protein 4 is crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction.Development. 2006; 133: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mice lacking LRP4 die at birth with deficits that resemble the phenotype observed in MuSK mutant mice (Weatherbee et al., 2006Weatherbee S.D. Anderson K.V. Niswander L.A. LDL-receptor-related protein 4 is crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction.Development. 2006; 133: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The phenotypic similarity suggested that LRP4 plays a role in MuSK signaling (Weatherbee et al., 2006Weatherbee S.D. Anderson K.V. Niswander L.A. LDL-receptor-related protein 4 is crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction.Development. 2006; 133: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms of how LRP4 regulates NMJ formation remain unclear. Here we provide evidences that LRP4 functions as a coreceptor of agrin. LRP4 is expressed specifically in myotubes and is concentrated at the NMJ. The extracellular domain of LRP4 binds to neuronal, but not muscle, agrin. LRP4 also interacts with MuSK in a manner enhanced by agrin. Suppression of LRP4 expression attenuated agrin binding activity, agrin-induced MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, and AChR clustering in muscle cells. LRP4 expression, on the other hand, reconstitutes agrin binding and MuSK activation by agrin in cells that would otherwise not respond to agrin. These observations identify LRP4 as a key component of the receptor complex of agrin. Because neuronal agrin binds only to myotubes, but not myoblasts (Glass et al., 1996bGlass D.J. DeChiara T.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK is required for neuromuscular junction formation and is a functional receptor for agrin.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 435-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we characterized the expression of LRP4 in developing myotubes. C2C12 myoblasts were switched to fusion medium to induce muscle differentiation. Under these conditions, myotubes began to form 48 hr after medium switch (Luo et al., 2002Luo Z. Wang Q. Zhou J.

Developing myotubes were collected and LRP4 expression was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-LRP4 antibody. As shown in Figure 1A, LRP4 was barely detectable in myoblasts, but its expression gradually increased as myotubes matured. As a control, expression of MuSK, whose expression was known to be regulated by muscle differentiation (Glass et al., 1996bGlass D.J. DeChiara T.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M.

These results indicate that LRP4, like MuSK, is expressed in well-differentiated myotubes, but not myoblasts. Next, we investigated LRP4 distribution in vivo by staining muscle sections with anti-LRP4 antibody. The immunoreactivity of LRP4, as well as that of MuSK, showed a pattern of labeling similar to that of rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (R-BTX) that labels AChRs (Figures 1B), suggesting that LRP4, like MuSK, is enriched at the NMJ. This notion was supported by results from immunoblot analysis of LRP4 expression in muscles. Hemidiaphragms were divided into three regions: the central, narrow region, where NMJs are enriched, as the synaptic region; the region close to ligaments to the ribs as the nonsynaptic region; and the middle in between. The AChR was enriched in the synaptic, but not nonsynaptic, region (Figure 1C). In agreement with results of immunostaining, LRP4 was readily detectable in the synaptic region where AChRs were enriched. However, little, if any, LRP4 was found in the nonsynaptic region. Together these results demonstrated that LRP4 is specifically expressed in myotubes and is enriched at the NMJ, suggesting a role of LRP4 in NMJ formation. Next, we determined whether agrin binds to LRP4. A secreted form of neuronal agrin, Flag-nAgrin, was generated that comprised the C terminus of neuronal agrin fused with the Flag epitope, and a secreted form of LRP4 (i.e., LRP4N-Myc), which consisted of the LRP4 extracellular domain tagged by the Myc epitope, was generated also. Flag-nAgrin was immobilized on beads and incubated with LRP4N-Myc. As shown in Figure 2A, LRP4N-Myc was precipitated with neuronal agrin, suggesting that the two proteins interact in solution. In contrast, Flag-nAgrin did not precipitate MuSKect-Myc, which consisted of the extracellular region of the kinase (Figure 2B); this was in agreement with previous findings that agrin and MuSK do not directly bind to each other (Glass et al., 1996aGlass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. et al.Agrin acts via a MuSK receptor complex.Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Moreover, Flag-nAgrin did not interact with LRP6N-Myc, which comprised Myc-tagged extracellular domain of LRP6, a homologous member of the LRP family whose extracellular structural organization resembles that of LRP4 (Figure 2C). As a control, LRP6N-Myc was able to interact with Wnt-1-HA when the two proteins were incubated together (Figure 2D), indicating proper folding and specific binding of LRP6N-Myc. Furthermore, LRP4N-Myc did not coprecipitate with Wnt-1-HA (Figure 2E), suggesting that the two proteins do not interact. These results demonstrate that agrin binds specifically to the extracellular domain of LRP4, but not that of MuSK or LRP6; on the other hand, Wnt-1 interacts with LRP6, but not LRP4. In support of this notion, the extracellular domain of LRP4 was able to neutralize neuronal agrin and thus prevent it from stimulating MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation and AChR clustering (Figure S1 available online). To determine whether the interaction is direct, we produced recombinant agrins, nAgrin-AP and mAgrin-AP, which contained the C-terminal region of neuronal and muscle agrin, respectively. They were fused with the heat-insensitive human placental isozyme of alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Flanagan and Cheng, 2000Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins for molecular characterization and cloning of receptors and their ligands.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). The activity of the AP recombinant proteins was tested in AChR cluster assays. As shown in Figure 3B, nAgrin-AP was able to stimulate AChR clustering in C2C12 myotubes, indicating proper folding of the recombinant neuronal agrin protein. In contrast, mAgrin-AP or AP alone had little effect on AChR clustering. Next, we characterized the binding activity of the AP proteins to muscle cells by in-cell assays as described in the Experimental Procedures. AP binding to myoblasts or myotubes was minimal (Figure 3C). mAgrin-AP binding to myoblasts was higher than that of AP alone, presumably because myoblasts express alpha-dystroglycan, with which muscle agrin is known to interact (Bowe et al., 1994Bowe M.A. Deyst K.A.

The mAgrin-AP binding to myotubes was higher in comparison with that to myoblasts because alpha-dystroglycan expression was increased during muscle differentiation. nAgrin-AP binding to myoblasts was similar to that of mAgrin-AP (Figure 3C). However, nAgrin-AP binding was significantly higher in myotubes than in myoblasts (Figure 3C), in agreement with earlier reports (Glass et al., 1996aGlass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C.

These results demonstrate the differential abilities of recombinant muscle and neuronal agrins in binding to myotubes. Having established that nAgrin-AP was able to bind to myotubes and stimulate AChR clustering, we next characterized the interaction between LRP4 and nAgrin-AP. LRP4N-Myc was purified and immobilized on plates and incubated with purified nAgrin-AP. After washing, the AP activity bound to immobilized LRP4N-Myc was assayed by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In comparison with control (AP alone), there was a significant increase in AP activity when nAgrin-AP was incubated with LRP4N-Myc (Figure 3D), suggesting direct interaction between the two proteins, i.e., interaction independent of a third protein. Quantitatively, the interaction between neuronal agrin and LRP4 was dose-dependent, saturable, and of high affinity (Kd values of 0.5 ± 0.053 nM) (Figures 3E and 3F). This affinity is comparable to that of LRP6 for Dkk1 and Dkk2 (0.1–0.5 nM) (Bafico et al., 2001Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A.

In contrast, muscle agrin, which lacks four and eight amino acid inserts at the Y and Z sites, respectively (Figure 3A), and is 1000 times less potent than neuronal agrin in stimulating AChR clusters (Gesemann et al., 1995Gesemann M.

Agrin released by motor neurons induces the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions.Neuron. 1992; 8: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), did not appear to bind to LRP4 (Figure 3D). The binding of LRP4N-Myc to muscle agrin was minimal even at high concentrations (Figure 3E). Together, these results suggest LRP4 binds specifically to neuronal agrin with high affinity. These results also indicate that LRP4 binds to neuronal, but not muscle, agrin in a manner that is concentration dependent, saturable, and of high affinity. To determine whether agrin binds to LRP4 in vivo, we expressed exogenous LRP4 in C2C12 myoblasts that, unlike myotubes, do not bind neuronal agrin (Glass et al., 1996aGlass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. et al.Agrin acts via a MuSK receptor complex.Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) (Figure 3C). Myoblasts were transfected with full-length LRP4 or the empty vector (as control). Intact transfected myoblasts were incubated with AP alone, nAgrin-AP, or mAgrin-AP. The AP activity bound to the cell surface was measured in situ after heat inactivation of endogenous AP. As shown in Figures 4A and 4B, when incubated with AP alone, control and LRP4-transfected myoblasts show no difference in AP activity. However, nAgrin-AP binding to LRP4-transfected myoblasts was significantly higher in comparison with control, indicating that LRP4 enables myoblasts to interact with neuronal agrin. By contrast, transfection of MuSK had no consistent effect on binding to nAgrin-AP, in agreement with earlier observations that agrin does not bind to MuSK (Glass et al., 1996aGlass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. et al.Agrin acts via a MuSK receptor complex.Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). In addition to myoblasts, HEK293 cells were able to bind to nAgrin-AP after LRP4 transfection (Figure 4C). The in situ binding activity generated by transfected LRP4 had the following characteristics. First, it was dose dependent. An increase in LRP4 expression in transfected HEK293 cells led to higher nAgrin-AP binding activity (Figure 4C). Probably due to rate-limiting surface integration of overexpressed LRP4, nAgrin-AP binding was not further increased in cells transfected with 2 μg of DNA. Earlier studies have reported that overexpressed LRP4 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (Obermoeller-McCormick et al., 2001Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Li Y. Osaka H. FitzGerald D.J. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. Dissection of receptor folding and ligand-binding property with functional minireceptors of LDL receptor-related protein.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notice that the blot in Figure 4C reveals total, but not surface, LRP4. Second, LRP4 binding was specific for neuronal agrin because the amount of mAgrin-AP bound to transfected myoblasts and HEK293 cells was minimal, and not concentration dependent (Figures 4A–4C). Notice that mAgrin-AP, like nAgrin-AP, also contained the AP and the Myc and His tags. Inability of mAgrin-AP to bind to LRP4-transfected cells indicated that binding to LRP4 did not involve the AP or tags. Third, the binding activity was LRP4 specific. Expression of LRP5, another member of the LRP family (Herz and Bock, 2002Herz J. Bock H.H. Lipoprotein receptors in the nervous system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 405-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), did not increase agrin binding in transfected cells (Figure 4D). Finally, nAgrin-AP binding was similar between cells transfected with LRP4 alone and those cotransfected with LRP4 and MuSK (Figures 4A and 4B), indicating that the neuronal agrin binding activity is mainly contributed by LRP4, although LRP4 and MuSK could interact in muscle cells (see below). Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of LRP4 to reconstitute ag"

Fundamental questions remain regarding the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which generalization takes place. Prior data suggest that generalization may stem from inference-based processes at the time of generalization. By contrast, generalization may emerge from mnemonic processes occurring while premise events are encoded. Here, participants engaged in a two-phase learning and generalization task, wherein they learned a series of overlapping associations and subsequently generalized what they learned to novel stimulus combinations. Functional MRI revealed that successful generalization was associated with coupled changes in learning-phase activity in the hippocampus and midbrain (ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra). These findings provide evidence for generalization based on integrative encoding, whereby overlapping past events are integrated into a linked mnemonic representation. Hippocampal-midbrain interactions support the dynamic integration of experiences, providing a powerful mechanism for building a rich associative history that extends beyond individual events.

Hippocampal-midbrain interactions support the dynamic integration of experiences, providing a powerful mechanism for building a rich associative history that extends beyond individual events. Memory is essential to behavior, enabling organisms to draw on past experience to guide choices and actions. Extensive evidence suggests that the hippocampus encodes experiences (events) into long-term memory as separated, discrete representations (Kirwan and Stark, 2007Kirwan C.B. Stark C.E.

Conjunctive representations in learning and memory: principles of cortical and hippocampal function.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 311-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Such discrete encoding provides a mechanism for remembering specific details of single events. However, experiences often overlap in their content, presenting opportunities for generalizing across them. It has been proposed that effective generalization may depend on integrating discrete experiences into a rich, cohesive representation (Eichenbaum, 2000Eichenbaum H. A cortical-hippocampal system for declarative memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, Gluck and Myers, 1993Gluck M.A. Myers C.E. Hippocampal mediation of stimulus representation: a computational theory.Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 491-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A fundamental question concerns whether, and how, such integration takes place. One approach to examining generalization is to train an organism on separate events that share common elements (e.g., A–B and B–C) and then test whether the organism demonstrates knowledge about the relation between the elements that were not directly experienced together (e.g., A and C) (Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997Dusek J.A.

Gabrieli J.D. Hippocampal contribution to the novel use of relational information in declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Extant data from this type of paradigm indicate that animals and humans generalize, and that this ability depends on the hippocampus (Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997Dusek J.A. Eichenbaum H.

Gabrieli J.D. Hippocampal contribution to the novel use of relational information in declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Specification of the hippocampal mechanisms that enable such generalization is central to understanding how decisions are guided by past experience. One possible mechanism by which knowledge may be generalized across discrete experiences is through logical inference at test (e.g., Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997Dusek J.A. Eichenbaum H. The hippocampus and memory for orderly stimulus relations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Greene et al., 2006Greene A.J. Gross W.L.

Indeed, generalization is often thought to depend on transitive or associative inference (Greene et al., 2006Greene A.J. Gross W.L. Elsinger C.L. Rao S.M. An FMRI analysis of the human hippocampus: inference, context, and task awareness.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2006; 18: 1156-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Heckers et al., 2004Heckers S.

Gabrieli J.D. Hippocampal contribution to the novel use of relational information in declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). On this view, the hippocampus contributes to generalization by supporting the novel and flexible expression of memories on which inferences rest (Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993Cohen N.J. Eichenbaum H. Memory, amnesia, and the hippocampal system. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1993Google Scholar, Eichenbaum, 2000Eichenbaum H. A cortical-hippocampal system for declarative memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, Preston et al., 2004Preston A.R. Shrager Y. Dudukovic N.M. Gabrieli J.D. Hippocampal contribution to the novel use of relational information in declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). That is, the hippocampus stores and enables flexible retrieval of discrete memories that afford an inference about the relation between multiple elements, even when this relation is not directly encoded in memory. Consistent with this view, functional imaging studies in humans have demonstrated greater hippocampal activation when subjects make memory judgments about pairs of items (e.g., A–C) whose relationship was mediated through an element (i.e., B) common to two separate associations (i.e., A–B and B–C) (Greene et al., 2006Greene A.J. Gross W.L. Elsinger C.L. Rao S.M. An FMRI analysis of the human hippocampus: inference, context, and task awareness.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2006; 18: 1156-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Heckers et al., 2004Heckers S. Zalesak M. Weiss A.P. Ditman T. Titone D. Hippocampal activation during transitive inference in humans.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, Preston et al., 2004Preston A.R. Shrager Y. Dudukovic N.M. Gabrieli J.D. Hippocampal contribution to the novel use of relational information in declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). While prior observations provide evidence for inference-based generalization, here we report evidence for an alternative mechanism—integrative encoding—through which generalization can emerge. By this view, the hippocampus contributes to the integration of distinct episodes into a linked network of mnemonic associations. The dynamic construction of integrated memories—posited to occur as overlapping episodes are experienced—enables direct retrieval of knowledge about the relation between multiple elements that, while not directly experienced, are nevertheless encoded in memory (Eichenbaum, 2000Eichenbaum H. A cortical-hippocampal system for declarative memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Thus, at test, generalization is not a reconstructive inference-based process based on flexible retrieval of multiple memories but rather is a direct expression of knowledge encoded in memory as a synthesis of information across multiple experiences. Motivated by computational theories and neurophysiological data that suggest that the hippocampus dynamically shifts between encoding and retrieval states (Hasselmo and McClelland, 1999Hasselmo M.E. McClelland J.L. Neural models of memory.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Hasselmo et al., 1995Hasselmo M.E. Schnell E. Barkai E. Dynamics of learning and recall at excitatory recurrent synapses and cholinergic modulation in rat hippocampal region CA3.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5249-5262PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that encountering an event that has feature overlap with a previously encoded event can trigger retrieval of memory for the past event, and that this, in turn, can lead to encoding of the two discrete events into an integrated representation. Such integrative encoding would allow direct storage in memory of the relation between two elements that were not experienced together. According to this perspective, subsequent responses to generalization probes can be based on the direct retrieval of a stored integrative memory, such that generalization is essentially the same as retrieval of a previously experienced event, rather than a slower, more effortful process of inference. Notably, this notion of alternating encoding and retrieval as a mechanism for integrating memories was proposed as early as 1923 by Richard Semon (Schacter, 2001aSchacter D.L. Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory. Psychology Press, Philadelphia, PA2001Google Scholar). However, little is known about whether and how such mnemonic integration occurs. Neurochemical modulation is thought to be essential in driving dynamic shifts between encoding and retrieval in the hippocampus (Hasselmo et al., 1995Hasselmo M.E. Schnell E. Barkai E. Dynamics of learning and recall at excitatory recurrent synapses and cholinergic modulation in rat hippocampal region CA3.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5249-5262PubMed Google Scholar). While previous work emphasizes cholinergic modulation from the basal forebrain, here we propose that the midbrain dopamine system plays a key role in modulating hippocampal mechanisms necessary for crossepisode integration. This perspective is guided by three observations. First, the hippocampus is innervated by dopamine projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain (Gasbarri et al., 1994Gasbarri A. Packard M.G. Campana E. Pacitti C. Anterograde and retrograde tracing of projections from the ventral tegmental area to the hippocampal formation in the rat.Brain Res.

The projections of the ventral tegmental area and adjacent regions: a combined fluorescent retrograde tracer and immunofluorescence study in the rat.Brain Res. Bull. 1982; 9: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Second, dopamine release in the hippocampus modulates hippocampal plasticity (Frey et al., 1990Frey U. Schroeder H. Matthies H. Dopaminergic antagonists prevent long-term maintenance of posttetanic LTP in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices.Brain Res. 1990; 522: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Morris et al., 2003Morris R.G.

D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation increases the magnitude of early long-term potentiation at CA1 hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7478-7486PubMed Google Scholar); indeed, both midbrain activation (Wittmann et al., 2005Wittmann B.C. Schott B.H. Guderian S. Frey J.U. Heinze H.J. Duzel E. Reward-related FMRI activation of dopaminergic midbrain is associated with enhanced hippocampus-dependent long-term memory formation.Neuron. 2005; 45: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and interaction between hippocampus and midbrain (Adcock et al., 2006Adcock R.A. Thangavel A. Whitfield-Gabrieli S. Knutson B. Gabrieli J.D. Reward-motivated learning: mesolimbic activation precedes memory formation.Neuron. 2006; 50: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) have been shown to facilitate encoding of individual episodes. Third, midbrain dopamine neurons are most responsive under circumstances in which predictions are violated (Lisman and Grace, 2005Lisman J.E. Grace A.A. The hippocampal-VTA loop: controlling the entry of information into long-term memory.Neuron. 2005; 46: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5400) Google Scholar); we argue that prediction violation is precisely what happens when an organism encounters an episode that contains elements that overlap with a previously encoded episode (Kumaran and Maguire, 2006Kumaran D. Maguire E.A. An unexpected sequence of events: mismatch detection in the human hippocampus.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e424Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). That is, when encountering an overlapping element, this overlap leads to retrieval of prior episodic details that mismatch the details of the present event. Collectively, these observations led us to predict that integrative encoding across experiences is supported by a cooperative interaction between the hippocampus and midbrain dopamine regions. Notably, when considered from the perspective of the putative hippocampal-VTA loop (Lisman and Grace, 2005Lisman J.E. Grace A.A. The hippocampal-VTA loop: controlling the entry of information into long-term memory.Neuron. 2005; 46: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), this functional prediction about the relationship between midbrain activation and learning is distinct from that of the established view of midbrain dopamine neurons in modulating corticostriatal “habit” learning. This latter view rests on extensive findings demonstrating that midbrain dopamine neurons respond when reward predictions are violated (Schultz, 1998Schultz W. The phasic reward signal of primate dopamine neurons.Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Specifically, a large body of research indicates that reinforcement learning depends on midbrain dopamine neurons and their striatal (caudate and putamen) targets (Aron et al., 2004Aron A.R.

From the perspective of current theories of reinforcement learning, midbrain dopamine regions would not be expected to contribute to crossevent generalization, and midbrain activation would not be expected to couple with that in the hippocampus. However, if, as we hypothesize, midbrain dopamine regions interact with the hippocampus to support generalization, then midbrain activation is predicted to couple with that in the hippocampus and to correlate with generalization performance. Such outcomes would add to a growing body of evidence indicating a broader role for this system in learning and memory by modulating the hippocampus, in addition to the striatum (Adcock et al., 2006Adcock R.A.

To summarize, we hypothesized that (1) generalization stems from integrative encoding that occurs while experiencing events that partially overlap with previously encoded events, (2) that such integrative encoding depends on both the hippocampus and midbrain dopamine regions, and (3) that greater hippocampal-midbrain engagement during integrative encoding enables rapid behavioral generalization in the future. To test these predictions, 24 participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while engaged in an associative learning and generalization task (Figure 1; Collie et al., 2002Collie A.

First, in the present study, rather than being blocked (Greene et al., 2006Greene A.J. Gross W.L. Elsinger C.L. Rao S.M.

Gabrieli J.D. Hippocampal contribution to the novel use of relational information in declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), here the trained associations were intermixed, much as occurs in everyday life where overlapping experiences are temporally intermixed. By intermixing the presentation of associations with overlapping content multiple times, we sought to allow more opportunity for integration during learning. Second, while transitive inference paradigms typically entail hierarchically organized stimuli (e.g., A > B, B > C, C > D, D > E; generalize to B?D probe), which may encourage the articulation of a logical, rational structure of elements at the time of test, here we used a generalization paradigm that involved arbitrary, overlapping associations between elements, which is more characteristic of the overlap in elements that are encountered in daily episodic experiences. During the initial phase of the task, participants learned a series of face-scene associations that were structured to include partial overlap across associative pairs, providing an opportunity for integrative encoding. On each trial, participants learned to associate a face with a scene by choosing which of two scenes went with the face and receiving feedback (Figure 1A). While each face-scene association was learned individually, there was partial overlap across events, such that pairs of faces were associated with a common scene (e.g., F1–S1; F2–S1). In addition to learning the F1–S1 and F2–S1 associations, participants were concurrently trained on a second association for one of the faces (i.e., F1–S2; Figure 1A). Thus, the initial learning phase consisted of three different types of stimulus combinations that contained partial overlap (F1–S1; F2–S1; F1–S2). To the extent that the overlap between F1–S1 and F2–S1 elicits crossevent integration during learning, we expected that the additional learning of the F1–S2 association would lead F2 to also become associated with S2 (Collie et al., 2002Collie A.

Over the course of learning, participants were trained with 24 face-scene associations that followed this structure (F1 through F24; S1 through S24).

Normal nervous system function requires that neurons maintain a constant overall activity level and maintain a balance between the relative strength of individual synapses. Constant neural activity levels are achieved by synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity (Davis, 2006Davis G.W.

In synaptic scaling, all synapses of a neuron are modified concurrently in a multiplicative fashion with greater synaptic adjustment to stronger synapses, thereby preserving the relative synaptic weights of the overall circuit (Thiagarajan et al., 2005Thiagarajan T.C.

Several signaling pathways have been shown to mediate various forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the mammalian central nervous system and the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. A decrease in neuronal activity, for instance, has been shown to decrease the ratio of α/β-CaMKII protein in neurons, likely by upregulating transcription of β-CaMKII (Thiagarajan et al., 2002Thiagarajan T.C.

At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, homeostatic synaptic growth is regulated by TGF-β, a synaptically released growth factor (Sweeney and Davis, 2002Sweeney S.T. Davis G.W.

In addition to these neuron/muscle-autonomous factors, glia-derived factors such as the cytokine TNFα were demonstrated to control synaptic strength and to influence homeostatic synaptic plasticity (Beattie et al., 2002Beattie E.C. Stellwagen D. Morishita W. Bresnahan J.C. Ha B.K. Von Zastrow M. Beattie M.S. Malenka R.C.

Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). One particularly well-characterized form of homeostatic plasticity is the increase in synaptic strength induced by chronic blockade of neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the NMDA receptor antagonist APV. A series of recent studies indicate that this form of homeostatic plasticity is mediated by the local synthesis and synaptic insertion of homomeric GluR1 receptors, which results in an increase of synaptic glutamate receptor response as manifested in an enhanced amplitude of unitary spontaneous miniature EPSCs (Ju et al., 2004Ju W.

During development, all-trans retinoic acid (RA) regulates gene transcription by binding to retinoic acid receptor (RAR) proteins, which are well-characterized transcription factors of the nuclear receptor family. In the nervous system, RA signaling is involved in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. Increasing evidence indicates that RA signaling may also play an important role in the mature brain (Lane and Bailey, 2005Lane M.A. Bailey S.J. Role of retinoid signalling in the adult brain.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Specifically, RA is rapidly synthesized in various regions of the adult brain (Dev et al., 1993Dev S. Adler A.J. Edwards R.B. Adult rabbit brain synthesizes retinoic acid.Brain Res. 1993; 632: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Deficiencies in retinoid metabolism and signaling cause impaired synaptic plasticity and learning (Chiang et al., 1998Chiang M.Y. Misner D. Kempermann G. Schikorski T. Giguere V. Sucov H.M. Gage F.H.

Role of retinoid signalling in the adult brain.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that RA may have a role in the postmitotic properties of neurons, a recent study suggested that RA induces spine formation in cultured neurons by binding to a novel, cell surface-exposed variant of the RA-receptor RARα (Chen and Napoli, 2008Chen N. Napoli J.L. All-trans-retinoic acid stimulates translation and induces spine formation in hippocampal neurons through a membrane-associated RARalpha.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here, we report that RA is a potent regulator of synaptic strength in cultured neurons and brain slices. We demonstrate that activity blockade—which induces homeostatic plasticity—strongly stimulates neuronal RA synthesis. We also show that RA rapidly increases synaptic strength and that activity-dependent synaptic upscaling occludes the subsequent RA-induced increase in synaptic strength. In addition, knocking down RARα expression in neurons using shRNA blocked both RA-induced and activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling. Direct activation of RARα with a selective agonist mimics the effect of RA, indicating the essential involvement of RARα in homeostatic plasticity. In our experiments, the synaptic effect of RA is independent of the formation of new dendritic spines, but instead operates by stimulating the synthesis and insertion of new postsynaptic glutamate receptors in existing synapses. Our results thus suggest that RA functions as a synaptic signal that operates via RARα during homeostatic plasticity to upregulate synaptic strength by increasing the size of the postsynaptic glutamate receptor response. We examined synaptic transmission in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from 5–7 day in vitro (DIV) cultured slices. Two hours after the addition of RA (1 μM) to the culture media, a significant increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude was observed in comparison to DMSO-treated neurons (Figures 1A and 1B). The mEPSC frequency was not changed by RA treatment. The rapid time course of the RA effect on synaptic transmission was somewhat surprising, raising the question whether we could observe a similar phenomenon in dissociated cultured neurons. Indeed, a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude was induced in primary cultured hippocampal neurons as early as an hour after a 30 min treatment with RA (Figure 1C). Similar to the results from cultured slices, this RA-induced increase in synaptic transmission did not involve an increase in mEPSC frequency (Figures 1F), suggesting a postsynaptic mechanism. Analysis of the mEPSC amplitude distributions after DMSO or RA treatments showed that the RA-induced increase in synaptic strength was multiplicative, rather than additive (Figures 1D and 1E; compare green dots with dashed line in 1D), reminiscent of synaptic scaling induced by reduced network activity (Thiagarajan et al., 2005Thiagarajan T.C. Lindskog M. Tsien R.W. Adaptation to synaptic inactivity in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G.

A recent report suggested that RA induces rapid spine formation by a mechanism that involves activation of the RA-receptor RARα exposed on the cell surface (Chen and Napoli, 2008Chen N. Napoli J.L. All-trans-retinoic acid stimulates translation and induces spine formation in hippocampal neurons through a membrane-associated RARalpha.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, we observed no increase in spine density upon RA treatment (Figures 1G and S1), consistent with the lack of change in mEPSC frequency. Thus, at least under our conditions, RA causes a functional change in existing synapses without a major induction of new spines and synapses. Intrigued by the synaptic upscaling induced by RA, we next directly asked whether RA is involved in activity blockade-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity. To test this question, we applied citral, an inhibitor of retinol dehydrogenase (ROLDH) (Di Renzo et al., 2007Di Renzo F. Broccia M.L. Giavini E. Menegola E.

Role of retinoid signalling in the adult brain.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (Ju et al., 2004Ju W. Morishita W. Tsui J. Gaietta G. Deerinck T.J. Adams S.R. Garner C.C. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Malenka R.C. Activity-dependent regulation of dendritic synthesis and trafficking of AMPA receptors.Nat.

Miniature neurotransmission stabilizes synaptic function via tonic suppression of local dendritic protein synthesis.Cell. 2006; 125: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), we found that blocking neuronal activity with TTX and APV for 24 hr induced a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude in cultured neurons (Figure 2A). This increase was blocked by addition of citral (Figure 2A). Moreover, we blocked RA synthesis with 4-(diethylamino)-benzaldehyde (DEAB), an inhibitor of retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH) (Russo et al., 1988Russo J.E. Hauguitz D. Hilton J. Inhibition of mouse cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase by 4-(diethylamino)benzaldehyde.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1639-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the enzyme that catalyzes the next step oxidation from ROLDH and converts all-trans retinal into RA. Similar to citral, DEAB completely blocked synaptic scaling induced by activity blockade (Figure 2B). These results suggest that RA synthesis is required for activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling. If activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling is mediated by RA signaling, it should occlude further scaling effects induced by direct RA treatment. In both hippocampal slice and primary cultures, the homeostatic increase in synaptic strength induced by blocking neuronal activity with TTX and APV for 24 hr, as manifested in a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude in pyramidal neurons, occludes the subsequent action of RA treatment (1 μM, 2 hr for slice cultures, 30 min for primary cultures) (Figures 2C and 2D). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that RA is critically involved in homeostatic synaptic plasticity. The intriguing possibility that activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling is mediated by RA signaling led us to examine whether RA synthesis can be regulated in an activity-dependent manner. Retinoids are stored intracellularly as retinyl ester, which are converted to retinol when needed. Retinol is then metabolized to RA (Lane and Bailey, 2005Lane M.A. Bailey S.J. Role of retinoid signalling in the adult brain.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The oxidation that directly generates RA from retinal is catalyzed by retinal dehydrogenases (RALDHs) (Figure 3A). High levels of RALDH1 mRNA and protein are detected in fully differentiated hippocampal neurons, indicating that RA can be directly synthesized in neurons (Figures 3A and S2) (Wagner et al., 2002Wagner E.

Cortex. 2002; 12: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To examine whether activity blockade enhances RA levels in neurons, we employed a retinoic acid response element (RARE)-based reporter system that has been widely used in vivo and in vitro to detect RA (Suzuki et al., 2006Suzuki T.

We generated a reporter construct containing three copies of the DR5 variant of the retinoic acid response element (direct repeat with 5 bp of spacing) and a GFP reporter gene (3xDR5-RARE-GFP) to monitor RA production in cultured neurons (Figure 3B). The detection system was validated in HEK293 cells in which direct RA treatment induced a robust increase in GFP when transiently transfected with the 3xDR5-RARE-GFP reporter (Figures S3A and S3B). We transfected neurons at 13 DIV with 3xDR5-RARE-GFP and examined the GFP fluorescence intensity after 6 hr. Compared to the untreated condition, treatment with TTX and APV for 24 hr dramatically increased the expression of the GFP reporter, while a control GFP construct lacking the RARE regulatory sequence showed no change in expression (Figures 3C and 3D). Interestingly, blocking neuronal activity with TTX alone for 24 hr, a protocol that induces a mechanistically distinct form of synaptic scaling (Sutton et al., 2006Sutton M.A. Ito H.T. Cressy P.

To further validate that the increased GFP reporter expression reflects synthesis of RA in neurons, we examined the effect of the RA synthesis blocker DEAB on reporter expression. DEAB, added to the neurons together with TTX and APV, reduced the GFP-reporter signal in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 3C and 3E). At a concentration of 10 μM, which blocked synaptic scaling induced by TTX + APV (Figure 2B), DEAB completely blocked RA synthesis, as indicated by a lack of significant increase in reporter expression (Figure 3E). It is worth noting that even with the highest DEAB concentration (100 μM), which presumably completely blocked RA synthesis, the GFP reporter expression levels were comparable to those found in mock-treated neurons, indicating that at basal conditions (no activity blockade), the ambient RA level in neurons is very low. To rule out the possibility that the observed increase in the GFP reporter expression was caused by activity-dependent changes in the neuron's general transcriptional and/or translational activity acting on the reporter and to directly test whether RA can act as a diffusible signal acting on neighboring cells (i.e., function in a cell-non-autonomous manner), we repeated the RA detection experiment using HEK293 cells transfected with the 3xDR5-RARE-GFP reporter. An hour after transfection, HEK293 cells were coplated with neurons. A significant increase in GFP expression in the HEK293 cells was observed as early as 8 hr after the onset of TTX and APV treatment in comparison to the mock-treated group, and the difference was retained 24 hr after onset of the activity blockade (Figures 3F and 3G). Treating HEK293 cells directly with TTX + APV for 24 hr did not affect 3xDR5-RARE-GFP reporter expression (Figure S4A). In addition, a control GFP construct lacking the RARE sequence did not show expression differences under these conditions (Figures 3G). Although the HEK293 cells plated directly on neurons were able to detect increased RA levels in TTX- and APV-treated neurons, conditioned media collected from neuronal cultures that had been treated with TTX and APV for 24 hr did not increase 3xDR5-RARE-GFP reporter expression in HEK293 cells (Figure S4B). The lack of free RA in the conditioned media was probably due to its lipophilic and labile nature. Taken together, these results demonstrate that blocking neuronal activity by the TTX and APV treatment strongly increases RA levels in neurons and that RA acts locally in these neurons and in surrounding cells. The selective increase of mEPSC amplitude but not frequency by RA treatment and the lack of an effect of RA on spine density suggest that RA acts postsynaptically to enhance synaptic strength in existing synapses. To examine whether RA increases synaptic transmission by increasing postsynaptic AMPA receptor function, we stained the cell surface of neurons treated with DMSO (vehicle) or 1 μM RA for surface-expressed GluR1 and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits (Figures 4A). Indeed, RA significantly increased the surface levels of GluR1, but not of GluR2 (Figure 4B). We also examined surface GluR1 expression levels with surface protein biotinylation. Either RA or TTX + APV treatment alone significantly increased the surface GluR1 level (Figures 4C and 4D). However, application of both treatments together did not produce additional enhancement (Figures 4C and 4D), consistent with our electrophysiological results demonstrating that activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling occludes RA-induced increase in synaptic transmission (Figures 2C and 2D). The selective increase in GluR1 surface expression by RA suggests that homomeric GluR1 receptors are inserted during RA-induced synaptic scaling. Activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling is mediated by homomeric GluR1 receptors and can be blocked by philanthotoxin-433 (PhTx), a blocker of homomeric AMPA receptors lacking the GluR2 subunit (Ju et al., 2004Ju W.

Indeed, the RA-induced increase in mEPSC amplitude was reversed by bath application of 5 μM PhTx in dissociated cultures (Figures 4E and 4F) and in hippocampal slice cultures (Figure 4G), indicating that RA-induced synaptic insertion of homomeric GluR1 receptors is responsible for the observed scaling effect. In contrast, basal synaptic transmission was not affected by PhTx (Figure S5), which is consistent with the notion that AMPA receptors supporting basal synaptic transmission are GluR2-containing heteromeric receptors. Activity blockade-induced, in particular, TTX- and APV-induced, synaptic scaling requires dendritic protein translation (Ju et al., 2004Ju W. Morishita W. Tsui J. Gaietta G. Deerinck T.J. Adams S.R.

To test whether RA induces an increase in postsynaptic GluR1, we investigated whether RA-induced synaptic scaling depends on gene transcription or translation. The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (40 μM) blocked the RA-induced increase in mEPSC amplitude in both hippocampal slice cultures (Figure 5A) and dissociated cultures (Figures 5B). Moreover, the increase in surface GluR1 expression by RA treatment was also completely prevented by anisomycin or cycloheximide (100 μM; see Figure 5C). By contrast, the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (50 μM) failed to block the effects of RA on mEPSC amplitude or on surface GluR1 expression (Figures 5A–5C). Thus, RA regulates synaptic transmission by a translation-dependent but transcription-independent mechanism. Combining in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we found that GluR1 mRNA was present in neuronal dendrites (Figure 6A), consistent with previous reports (Grooms et al., 2006Grooms S.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2032640722,"Homologous recombination (HR) is an important conserved process for DNA repair and ensures maintenance of genome integrity. Inappropriate HR causes gross chromosomal rearrangements and tumorigenesis in mammals. In yeast, the Srs2 helicase eliminates inappropriate recombination events, but the functional equivalent of Srs2 in higher eukaryotes has been elusive. Here, we identify C. elegans RTEL-1 as a functional analog of Srs2 and describe its vertebrate counterpart, RTEL1, which is required for genome stability and tumor avoidance. We find that rtel-1 mutant worms and RTEL1-depleted human cells share characteristic phenotypes with yeast srs2 mutants: lethality upon deletion of the sgs1/BLM homolog, hyperrecombination, and DNA damage sensitivity. In vitro, purified human RTEL1 antagonizes HR by promoting the disassembly of D loop recombination intermediates in a reaction dependent upon ATP hydrolysis. We propose that loss of HR control after deregulation of RTEL1 may be a critical event that drives genome instability and cancer."

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergo dramatic changes in morphology, cell cycle, and gene expression as they differentiate into defined cell types (Kim et al., 2008Kim J. Chu J. Shen X. Wang J.

Since eukaryotic genomes are intimately associated with histone proteins to form chromatin, this physiologically-relevant structure must be remodeled as part of a large-scale mechanism to achieve rapid and drastic changes in gene expression (Arney and Fisher, 2004Arney K.L. Fisher A.G. Epigenetic aspects of differentiation.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4355-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Gan et al., 2007Gan Q. Yoshida T. McDonald O.G. Owens G.K.

For example, undifferentiated ESCs typically display increased physical plasticity and less compacted chromatin than their differentiated counterparts (Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev.

Physical plasticity of the nucleus in stem cell differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15619-15624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). ESCs also undergo radical changes in gene expression as they differentiate, conveniently providing markers of “stemness” whose expression dramatically decreases (e.g., Oct 3/4) as differentiation progresses. Such changes suggest that cells undergo a significant reorganization of their genome during the differentiation process and that, moreover, this transition must be carefully regulated in order for the cell to differentiate properly and adopt a specific lineage. Recent studies have shown that histone covalent modification patterns change significantly upon ESC differentiation (Giadrossi et al., 2007Giadrossi S. Dvorkina M. Fisher A.G. Chromatin organization and differentiation in embryonic stem cell models.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For example, core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are largely deacetylated upon differentiation and histone deacetylase activity may be required for ESC differentiation (Lee et al., 2004Lee J.H. Hart S.R. Skalnik D.G. Histone deacetylase activity is required for embryonic stem cell differentiation.Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments have also identified specific genes and/or genomic regions that change their “epigenetic signature” upon differentiation (Azuara et al., 2006Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Spivakov M. Jorgensen H.F. John R.M. Gouti M. Casanova M. Warnes G. Merkenschlager M. et al.Chromatin signatures of pluripotent cell lines.Nat.

Despite a wealth of emerging data describing changing patterns of epigenetic signatures during ESC differentiation, very little is known about the mechanisms used to achieve such change. Several possible mechanisms for removing the more stable histone modifications, e.g., lysine methylation, include enzymatic demethylation, histone replacement, and regulated histone proteolysis (Bannister and Kouzarides, 2004Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Histone methylation: recognizing the methyl mark.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities have been identified that carry out the first two mechanisms (Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002Ahmad K. Henikoff S.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, Shi et al., 2004Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Histone demethylation mediated by the nuclear amine oxidase homolog LSD1.Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar) and there is precedence for controlled histone H3-specific proteolysis (Allis et al., 1980Allis C.D. Bowen J.K. Abraham G.N. Glover C.V.

Virol. 1990; 64: 748-756PubMed Google Scholar); however, to our knowledge, specific, regulated, endogenous proteolysis has not been well documented in mammalian cells. Here, we show that ESCs employ regulated histone proteolysis in order to change their “epigenetic signature” upon differentiation. Furthermore, we have identified Cathepsin L as a developmentally-regulated histone H3 protease and demonstrated that its activity may be modulated by the modification of the histone tail itself. Taken together, our studies reveal unsuspected nuclear functions of this family of cysteine proteases in histone and stem cell biology and suggest that controlled histone proteolysis may be part of a mechanism for introducing variation into the chromatin polymer. To survey changes in histone proteins and their modifications during mouse ESC differentiation, we used immunoblotting to probe whole-cell extracts (WCEs) with various histone antibodies. When probing with specific histone H3 antibodies (e.g., the H3 general C-terminal, H3K27me2, and H3K27me1 antibodies), we observed reproducibly a faster migrating band in samples taken at time points corresponding to days 2 and 3 postinduction with retinoic acid (RA). Notably, this band was observed using an H3 general antibody generated against the C terminus of histone H3 (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online), but not with an H3 general antibody generated against the first six N-terminal amino acids (Figure S1). The faster migrating H3 species was also observed when probing immunoblots with an H3-K27me2 antibody (Figure 1A); in contrast, it was not recognized when replicate immunoblots were probed with the H3-K4me3 antibody (Figure 1A). Taken together, the results of these experiments suggested that an extreme amino-terminal fragment of H3 was missing in the faster-migrating H3 sub-band. We then asked if the H3 sub-band was chromatin associated. Micrococcal-digested chromatin was prepared by standard methods (Wysocka et al., 2001Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Loss of HCF-1-chromatin association precedes temperature-induced growth arrest of tsBN67 cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) from both undifferentiated ESCs and ESCs undergoing differentiation with RA, and soluble mononucleosomes were probed with the H3 general antibody. As shown in Figure 1B, the faster migrating H3 band was seen in the undigested chromatin pellet as well as in the solubilized mononucleosomes derived from differentiating cells, but not the chromatin isolated from undifferentiated ESCs (Figure 1B). We next asked if the appearance of the faster migrating H3 species was dependent on the methods employed to trigger ESC differentiation. To address this question, ESCs were differentiated using three different methods: monolayer differentiation with RA, monolayer differentiation by withdrawal of leukemic inhibitory factor (LIF), and embryoid body formation (EB formation) by cell aggregation. As shown in Figure 1C (upper panels), the time course for expression of pluripotency marker Oct3/4 differs for each of the induction methods employed, suggesting differences in the timing and progression of differentiation. Timing of the appearance of the faster migrating H3 band was also dependent on the method used to induce ESC differentiation (lower panels), suggesting that this event is also dependent on the progress of differentiation. The faster migrating H3 was observed at days 2 and 3 post-RA-induction during monolayer differentiation (Figure 1A and Figure 1C, left), but delayed until day 5 following withdrawal of LIF (Figure 1C, middle), the latter correlating with the similarly delayed decrease of Oct3/4. During EB formation, the faster migrating H3 species appeared early and then peaked between days 8 and 12 (Figure 1C, right), suggesting a slower and more complex differentiation progression. We chose to use monolayer differentiation with RA for subsequent experiments in order to minimize differences in the timing and heterogeneity of differentiation. To determine the nature of the faster migrating H3 sub-species, histones were extracted from differentiating ESC nuclei 3 days post-RA-induction and separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, C8 column, data not shown). Fractions containing the H3 sub-band were pooled and further resolved by RP-HPLC (C18 column), and the resulting fractions were screened by immunoblot as shown in Figure 2A (left). We then subjected C18-RP-HPLC fractions containing the H3 sub-band to two separate sequencing methods. First, equal amounts of fractions 52–54 were pooled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to immunoblot; the material in each of in the two sub-bands labeled by asteriks was then subjected to Edman degradation (Figure 2A, right). Although multiple amino acids were released during each cycle for both samples, the observed data strongly suggested that the top and bottom sub-bands contained sequences derived from cleavage following residues A21 and K27, respectively, in the N-terminal tail of H3. Second, to define in greater detail the peptide sequences and posttranslational modifications present in the faster migrating H3 species, additional sample from fraction 54 (Figure 2A) was digested with GluC to produce N-terminal H3-fragments ending in E50 and the resulting peptides were then analyzed by MS. Spectra recorded detected six, highly-modified, truncated, N-terminal, histone H3-peptides beginning at residues T22, K23, A24, A25, K27, and S28 (Figure 2B, right). Relative abundances of the six peptides suggest that the preferred cleavage sites are C-terminal to A21 and K23. These results suggest that the primary H3 cleavage site is between amino acids 21 and 22 of the amino terminus (Figure 2C, H3.cs1) and that the final cleavage site is between amino acids 27 and 28. Notably, the list of cleavage sites detected by MS contains the two sites detected by Edman degradation (asterisks). In addition, new mass spectrometric methods using a combination of electron transfer dissociation/proton transfer charge reduction and accurate mass measurements were employed to characterize the modification patterns on the proteolyically cleaved H3 (Coon et al., 2005Coon J.J. Ueberheide B. Syka J.E. Dryhurst D.D. Ausio J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Protein identification using sequential ion/ion reactions and tandem mass spectrometry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Long-distance combinatorial linkage between methylation and acetylation on histone H3 N termini.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2086-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the data reveal that the cleaved H3 subspecies has a distinct covalent modification profile, suggesting that the H3 sub-band may be preferentially marked, before or after proteolytic processing, with a specific epigenetic signature (Figures 2C and S2). Specifically, marks of both “active” (e.g., H3K23Ac and H3K36me) and “silent” transcription (e.g., H3K27me) were reproducibly detected on a single GluC-digested peptide derived from the proteolytically processed H3 fragment. Moreover, all six of the truncated peptides contained Ala at position 31, revealing that the cleaved H3 peptide is H3 isoform H3.2, not H3.3. Although noncleaved H3.3 peptide was detected in the same RP-HPLC fraction as the cleaved H3 species, cleaved H3.3 was not detected. Since H3.2 and H3.1 elute in two separate peaks, we cannot definitively conclude that H3.2 is preferentially cleaved over H3.1, however significantly less H3 cleavage was detected in peak 2 (H3.1) than in peak 1 (H3.2 + H3.3) by immunoblotting. Although it is unclear how this particular pattern of modifications and H3 isoform affect the mechanism of proteolysis, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that that regulation via posttranslational modification of the substrate and/or isoform preference may regulate the proteolytic processing (see Figure 7). Also detected in fraction 54 (Figure 2A) were highly modified forms for three of the most abundant, complementary, N-terminal fragments generated by proteolytic cleavage of H3 (Figure 2B, left). The detection of these intact, complementary cleavage products indicates that the cleavage sites mapped above are the result of endopeptidase activity alone. Posttranslational modifications detected on these three N-terminal peptides again include marks of both “active” (e.g., H3K14Ac) and “silent” transcription (e.g., H3K9me) as seen on the C-terminal fragments (Figure S2). These findings support the conclusion that a small fraction of total histone H3.2 undergoes highly specific endoproteolytic cleavage during ESC differentiation that may be regulated by unique patterns of covalent modifications. To identify and characterize the putative H3 protease(s), we first established an in vitro H3 cleavage assay. Undifferentiated or differentiating ESCs were harvested and their proteins extracted; these lysates were then incubated with C-terminally 6xHIS tagged, full-length recombinant histone H3 (rH3-HIS), and the reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting with HIS-HRP antibody (Figure 3A). Although this assay has the potential to detect any N-terminal H3 cleavage, chromatin isolated from differentiating ESCs at the time point when in vivo cleavage was observed (∼3 days + RA) consistently possessed strong in vitro H3 cleavage activity that reproduced the size difference of the endogenously cleaved H3 (Figure 3B). To better ensure that the cleaved H3 product observed in our in vitro cleavage assay was physiologically relevant, we generated an antibody that recognized the primary site of H3 cleavage, H3.cs1 (Figure 2C; see Experimental Procedures and Figure S4 for details on antibody generation and characterization). Our results indicated that this antibody (“H3.cs1”) was specific for the primary site of in vivo generated H3 cleavage product (A21/T22) and was not sensitive to the acetylation status of H3K23 (see characterization by ELISA and immunoblotting in Figure S4). Importantly, the H3.cs1 antibody fails to react with full length H3 and its signal is highly enriched at the same time point at which we detect an H3 sub-band using the H3-general or H3 K27me2 antibodies during our standard RA-induced ESC differentiation time course (Figure S4B). We then used both the HIS-HRP antibody and the H3.cs1 antibody in the above H3 cleavage assay to follow the biochemical enrichment of H3 protease activity in nuclear extract derived from differentiating ESCs. We fractionated nuclear extract (Figure 3C) and detected two peaks of putative H3 cleavage activity by both the HIS-HRP antibody and the H3.cs1 antibody (Figure 3D). We then subjected two activity-containing fractions (#22 and 23, Figure 3D) and an adjacent nonactivity-containing fraction (#20) to MS analysis. Four peptides were detected for the cysteine protease Cathepsin L in both activity-containing fractions 22 and 23, yet none of these peptides were detected in the neighboring nonactivity containing fraction 20 (Figure S5 for details). To validate this identification further, we used a commercially available antibody to screen for the presence of Cathepsin L in the hydroxyapatite fractions (mCathL, Figure 3E). Importantly, reactivity with mCathL correlates well with the detection of H3 cleavage activity in the fractions aligned above (compare Figure 3D to 3E). Cathepsin L is known to exist in three forms: a proenzyme running at ∼37 kD, a single chain intermediate at ∼30 kD, and a double chain mature form at ∼25 kD and ∼5 kD (Ishidoh et al., 1998Ishidoh K. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Hirose M. Watanabe S. Sato N. Kominami E. Multiple processing of procathepsin L to cathepsin L in vivo.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The pro form must be cleaved to become active, whether by self-cleavage or by another enzyme (Turk et al., 2000Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Lysosomal cysteine proteases: more than scavengers.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar); in contrast, both the “intermediate” and “mature” forms have been shown to be active (Mason et al., 1989Mason R.W. Wilcox D. Wikstrom P. Shaw E.N. The identification of active forms of cysteine proteinases in Kirsten-virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts by use of a specific radiolabelled inhibitor.Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The hydroxyapatite fractions of the stronger peak of activity (∼21–25) correlate with the detection of the mature form of Cathepsin L by immunoblot (Figure 3E, marked by asterisk), while the weaker activity fractions (∼13–15) correlate closely with the detection of the intermediate form of Cathepsin L (Figure 3E, marked by dot). This correlation not only supports a causal relationship between the presence of Cathepsin L and the H3 cleavage activity, but also helps to explain the difference in elution and activity between the two peaks of H3 cleavage activity generated by the hydroxyapatite chromatography. To validate further the identification of Cathepsin L as a histone H3 protease, we tested our enriched fractions with different classes of protease inhibitors in our H3 cleavage assay. As shown in Figure 4A, adding increasing amounts of serine protease inhibitor AEBSF produced a modest reduction in cleavage activity at a high concentration (20 mM), but not at the lower concentrations tested (2 mM and 10 mM). However, when using the cysteine protease inhibitor E64, all cleavage was abolished at even the lowest concentration tested (10 μM). Noting the strong inhibition of H3 cleavage activity by E64, an irreversible inhibitor that binds covalently to its substrate and has been shown to inhibit Cathepsin L (see Figure S6 and Barrett et al., 1982Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. L-trans-Epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) and its analogues as inhibitors of cysteine proteinases including cathepsins B, H and L.Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), we then took advantage of a commercially available E64-bound resin to test whether it could precipitate Cathepsin L from our active hydroxyapatite fractions and, subsequently, remove the soluble H3 cleavage activity. Both E64 bound and control resins were added to fractions 20 (in which little to no H3 cleavage activity detected) and 23 (in which strong H3 cleavage activity was detected), incubated to allow binding and potential inhibition, and then pelleted by centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was subsequently tested for H3 cleavage activity. As expected, E64 resin successfully removed H3 cleavage activity from fraction 23, while control resin did not (Figure 4B, top). Importantly, as shown using the cleavage-site specific H3.cs1 antibody, the activity removed by the E64 resin included the specific A21/T22 cleavage site activity. We then eluted any bound proteins from the E64 and control resins and probed the eluates for the presence of Cathepsin L. As hypothesized, mCathL was detected on the +E64 resin that had been incubated with fraction 23, but not on control resin nor on resin incubated with fraction 20 (Figure 4B, bottom). As a control, we also analyzed the above eluates by immunoblotting with an antibody to another cathepsin family member, Cathepsin B, but did not detect any immunoreactive species (data not shown). Taken together, the loss of activity from solution paired with the presence of Cathepsin L protein bound to the corresponding +E64 resin strongly suggests a causal relationship between this cysteine protease and the primary H3 protease activity characterized above (H3.cs1). Cathepsin L is also known to preferentially cleave proteins that contain hydrophobic residues in their P2 position (two residues N-terminal from the cleaved bond, as originally defined (Schechter and Berger, 1967Schechter I. Berger A. On the size of the active site in proteases. I. Papain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar)), specifically leucine and phenylalanine (Rawlings and Barrett, 2007Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. MEROPS: The peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 36: 320-325Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar, Rawlings et al., 2008Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. MEROPS: the peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Importantly, and in keeping with this characteristic, the sequence surrounding the primary H3 cleavage site (A21/T22) mapped from ES cells by both MS and Edman degradation (Figure 2C, solid line) includes a leucine at the P2 position (L20). To verify the significance of this leucine in the H3 sequence and support the identification of Cathepsin L in fraction 23, we mutated it (L20V, L20E & L20W) as well as neighboring residues and tested the mutated recombinant proteins in our H3 cleavage assay (Figure 4C). Although the more conservative L20V mutant showed little change in H3 cleavage, L20E and L20W mutants completely abolished H3 cleavage as assayed by both the HIS and H3.cs1 antibodies (top panels). Moreover, the loss of H3 cleavage upon mutation of L20, compared to little or no loss of signal upon mutation of neighboring residues (K18 or A21), suggests that L20 is particularly important to the enzymatic activity in fraction 23. Together, this mutational analysis also supports the identification of Cathepsin L as the enzyme responsible for the histone H3 cleavage characterized in the above in vitro assays. Interestingly, mutating K23 to either S or Q also had a significant effect on the H3 cleavage activity (Figure 4C, bottom panels). Although no difference was seen in H3 cleavage by assaying with HIS, these mutations greatly diminished the cleavage site recognized by the H3.cs1 antibody, suggesting a possible role for this residue in regulating the precision of H3 proteolysis by Cathepsin L. It is interesting to note that none of the N-terminal peptides identified by MS were acetylated at K23 while C-terminal peptides acetylated at K23 were consistently detected (Figure S2). Together, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that the acetylation of K23 may serve to inhibit cleavage at certain sites. Although there is previous evidence that Cathepsin L and its activity exists in the cell nucleus of MEFs (Goulet et al., 2004Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. A cathepsin L isoform that is devoid of a signal peptide localizes to the nucleus in S phase and processes the CDP/Cux transcription factor.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we set out to document this nuclear localization in ESCs using a biochemical approach: we isolated chromatin and then solubilized it by micrococcal nuclease digestion as described above (Figure 1C). As shown by probling with Cathepsin L antibody, Cathepsin L was indeed associated with chromatin fragments released by nuclease digestion (Figure 4D). Importantly, chromatin association only begins to appear upon differentiation and is not apparent in undifferentiated ES cells. We note as well that the mature form of Cathepsin L (marked by asterisk) was enriched over the full length (hash) or intermediate (dot) forms. To further validate the identification of Cathepsin L as an H3 protease, we tested recombinant mouse Cathepsin L enzyme in our H3 cleavage assay (Figure 5). Since Cathepsin L displays optimal activity at the more acidic pH of the lysosome (i.e., ∼pH 5, (Barrett et al., 2003Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, 2 addition edn. Academic Press, 2003Google Scholar)), and since we suspected that Cathepsin L is acting within the nucleus at a higher pH (∼pH 7–8), we tested the recombinant enzyme in both pH environments. Importantly, recombinant mouse Cathepsin L was able to cleave recombinant histone H3 at both pH 5.5 and pH 7.5. Moreover, the recombinant enzyme cleaved H3 and created the specific epitope recognized by the cleavage site-specific H3.cs1 antibody (Figure 5A). To further characterize the sites of proteolytic cleavage, we analyzed the reaction products of rCathepsin L and rH3-HIS by MS. Importantly, MS analysis revealed that the six sites of cleavage mapped in the endogenous H3 samples (Figure 2) were also produced by rCathepsin L in vitro (Figure 5B). Summed ion currents for all charge states of the unmodified sequences were employed to estimate the relative abundances of the six peptides beginning with the indicated residues as follows: T22 > K23, A24, and S28 > A25 and K27. The most abundant site of cleavage in vitro was between A21 and T22, the same site that was shown to be most abundant in the MS analysis of endogenous histone H3. In addition, the relative abundances of the in vivo H3 cleavage sites and those produced by Cathepsin L in vitro are highly correlative. One exception is cleavage between residues K27 and S28, which is more abundant in the in vitro assay compared to that mapped from in vivo samples (the latter shows a preference for cleavage between residues R26/K27 over K27/S28). We speculate that the presence of histone modifications in vivo play a role in regulating the preferred cleavage site of Cathepsin L, particularly at sites surrounding H3K27, which was shown to be preferentially methylated on cleaved H3 by both immunoblot and MS analysis (Figures 1A and S2). Also observed in both reactions are five of the six complementary N-terminal peptides generated by rCathepsin L cleavage of H3 (left), and their abundances correlated with that of their C-terminal counterparts. Taken together, the above data support the conclusion that Cathepsin L is capable of generating all of the histone H3.2 fragments observed at day 3 following induction of ESC differentiation by retinoic acid. We then wanted to test other cathepsin family members in the H3 cleavage assay. We chose to test rCathepsin B, one of the most abundant lysosomal proteases, and rCathepsin K, which is reported to have a significant preference for leucine in the P2 pos"

Many animals respond differentially to light of different wavelengths; for example, most flying insects exhibit positive phototactic responses but prefer ultraviolet (UV) to visible light, whereas zebrafish are strongly phototactic to ultraviolet/blue and red light but weakly to green (Menzel, 1979Menzel R.

Neurosci. 2005; 22: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Unlike true color vision, which distinguishes light of different spectral compositions (hues) independently of their intensities, spectral preferences are strongly intensity dependent and innate, probably reflecting each species' ecophysiological needs. Thus, water fleas (Daphnia magna) avoid harmful UV but are attracted to green light, which characterizes abundant food sources (Storz and Paul, 1998Storz U.C. Paul R.J. Phototaxis in water fleas (Daphnia magna) is differently influenced by visible and UV light.J. Comp. Physiol. [A]. 1998; 183: 709-717Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Daylight is rich in UV, so flying insects' preference for UV over visible light is probably related to the so-called open-space response, the attraction toward open, bright gaps and away from dim, closed sites (Goldsmith, 1961Goldsmith T.H. The Color Vision of Insects. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1961Google Scholar, Hu and Stark, 1977Hu K.G. Stark W.S. Specific receptor input into spectral preference in Drosophila.J. Comp. Physiol. 1977; 121: 241-252Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The receptor mechanisms for spectral preferences have been well studied in flying insects, especially in Drosophila (Heisenberg and Buchner, 1977Heisenberg M. Buchner E. The role of retinula cell types in visual behavior of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. 1977; 117: 127-162Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Two or more photoreceptor types with distinct spectral responses are required to detect different wavelengths of light, and mutant flies lacking UV-sensing photoreceptors exhibit aberrant preference for green light (Hu and Stark, 1977Hu K.G. Stark W.S. Specific receptor input into spectral preference in Drosophila.J. Comp. Physiol. 1977; 121: 241-252Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the postreceptoral mechanisms of spectral preference are entirely unknown. Furthermore, it is not clear how spectral preference is related to true color vision. Color-mixing experiments suggest that color vision and spectral preference are independent in honeybees (Menzel and Greggers, 1985Menzel R. Greggers U. Natural phototaxis and its relationship to colour vision in honeybees.J. Comp. Physiol. 1985; 157: 311-321Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, however, spectral preference experiments have revealed that the phototactic response toward UV is significantly enhanced by the presence of visible light, suggesting a “color” contrast effect in spectral preference behavior (Schümperli, 1973Schümperli R.A. Evidence for colour vision in Drosophila melanogaster through spontaneous phototactic choice behaviour.J. Comp. Physiol. 1973; 86: 77-94Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Fischbach, 1979Fischbach K.F. Simultaneous and successive colour contrast expressed in “slow” phototactic behaviour of walking Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 130: 161-171Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Identifying and characterizing the neural circuits that process chromatic information is the first step to understanding the postreceptoral mechanisms of spectral preference and, thus, color vision. With recent advances in genetic techniques that manipulate neuronal function, Drosophila has re-emerged as a model system for studying neural circuits and functions. In particular, the Gal4/UAS expression system combined with the temperature-sensitive allele of shibire makes it possible to examine the behavioral consequences of reversibly inactivating specific subsets of neurons (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Such interventions allow direct comparisons between the connections of a neuron and its function, thereby establishing causality (reviewed in Luo et al., 2008Luo L. Callaway E.M. Svoboda K. Genetic dissection of neural circuits.Neuron. 2008; 57: 634-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The Drosophila visual system comprises the compound eye and four successive optic neuropils (lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate; Figure 1A). The compound eye itself has some 750 ommatidia populated by two types of photoreceptors. The outer photoreceptors R1–R6, which are in many ways equivalent to vertebrate rod cells, express Rh1 opsin (O'Tousa et al., 1985O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.L. The Drosophila ninaE gene encodes an opsin.Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), respond to a broad spectrum of light (Hardie, 1979Hardie R.C. Electrophysiological analysis of fly retina. I: Comparative properties of R1–6 and R 7 and 8.J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 129: 19-33Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and are thus presumed to be achromatic. The inner photoreceptor neurons R7 and R8 have complex opsin expression patterns (reviewed in Mikeladze-Dvali et al., 2005Mikeladze-Dvali T. Desplan C. Pistillo D. Flipping coins in the fly retina.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 69: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); R7s express one of two UV-sensitive opsins, Rh3 and Rh4, while, beneath R7, the R8s coordinately express blue-sensitive Rh5 or green-sensitive Rh6 opsins (Salcedo et al., 1999Salcedo E. Huber A. Henrich S. Chadwell L.V. Chou W.H. Paulsen R. Britt S.G.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10716-10726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The achromatic R1–R6 channel mediates motion detection (Heisenberg and Buchner, 1977Heisenberg M. Buchner E.

Desplan C. Heisenberg M. Motion vision is independent of color in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4910-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). R1–R6 innervate the lamina, where the achromatic channel input diverges to three or more pathways mediated by three types of lamina neurons, L1–L3. Their synaptic connections have been analyzed exhaustively at the electron microscopic (EM) level (Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991Meinertzhagen I.A. O'Neil S.D.

Synaptic organisation in the fly's optic lamina: few cells, many synapses and divergent microcircuits.Prog. Brain Res. 2001; 131: 53-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic dissection indicates that these three pathways serve different functions in motion detection and orientation (Rister et al., 2007Rister J. Pauls D. Schnell B. Ting C.Y. Lee C.H. Sinakevitch I. Morante J. Strausfeld N.J. Ito K. Heisenberg M. Dissection of the peripheral motion channel in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster.Neuron. 2007; 56: 155-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Much like vertebrate cones, R7 and R8 photoreceptors are thought to constitute chromatic channels that are functionally required for spectral preference behaviors (Heisenberg and Buchner, 1977Heisenberg M. Buchner E. The role of retinula cell types in visual behavior of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. 1977; 117: 127-162Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The axons of R7 and R8 penetrate the lamina and directly innervate the distal medulla, where, until now, their synaptic connections have been completely unknown. The medulla, the largest and most heavily populated optic neuropil, is organized into strata (M1–M10) and columns (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989Fischbach K.F. Dittrich A.P.

Anat. 1972; 124: 561-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in a manner reminiscent of the mammalian cortex. All visual information converges upon the distal strata of the medulla; the axons of R7 and R8 directly innervate strata M6 and M3, respectively, while L1–L3 transmit information from the R1–R6 channel to multiple medulla strata (M1/M5, M2, and M3, respectively). Terminals of those R7, R8, and L1–L3 that view a single point in visual space innervate a single medulla column (Meinertzhagen, 1976Meinertzhagen I.A. The organization of perpendicular fibre pathways in the insect optic lobe.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 274: 555-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and there establish a retinotopic pixel. Previous Golgi studies have revealed about 60 morphologically distinct types of medulla neurons (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989Fischbach K.F. Dittrich A.P. The optic lobe of Drosophila melangaster. I. A Golgi analysis of wild-type structure.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 441-475Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Each arborizes in a stereotypic pattern within specific strata of the medulla and projects an axon to a distinct stratum of the medulla, lobula, or lobula plate. The distinct morphological forms of different types of medulla neurons reflect, at least in part, their diverse patterns of gene expression (Morante and Desplan, 2008Morante J. Desplan C. The color-vision circuit in the medulla of Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although it is widely presumed that the medulla incorporates key neural substrates for processing color and motion information, little is known about its synaptic circuits and their functions. EM analyses of synaptic circuits have not been possible because of the complexity of this neuropil, while electrophysiological investigations are technically challenging because of the small size of neurons. In this study, we investigate the chromatic visual circuits in the medulla. Using a combination of transgenic and histological approaches, we identify the first-order interneurons in the medulla that receive direct synaptic inputs from the chromatic channels R7 and R8. We then subdivide these neurons based on their use of neurotransmitters and gene expression patterns. By systematically inactivating and restoring the activity of specific neuron subtypes, we identify the neurons that are necessary and sufficient to drive a fly's phototactic preference to UV. Previous electrophysiological and histological studies have demonstrated that Drosophila photoreceptor neurons are histaminergic (Hardie, 1987Hardie R.C. Is histamine a neurotransmitter in insect photoreceptors?.J. Comp. Physiol. [A]. 1987; 161: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Sarthy, 1991Sarthy P.V. Histamine: a neurotransmitter candidate for Drosophila photoreceptors.J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that R7 and R8 photoreceptors provide the predominant histamine-immunoreactive input to the medulla (Pollack and Hofbauer, 1991Pollack I.

Two ionotropic histamine-gated channels, Ort (ora transientless; HisCl2) and HisCl1, have been identified (Gengs et al., 2002Gengs C. Leung H.T. Skingsley D.R. Iovchev M.I. Yin Z. Semenov E.P.

Hardie R.C. Distinct roles for two histamine receptors (hclA and hclB) at the Drosophila photoreceptor synapse.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutants for ort exhibit defects in motion detection and their electroretinograms (ERGs), indicating that Ort is required to transmit R1–R6 input to the first-order interneurons (Gengs et al., 2002Gengs C. Leung H.T. Skingsley D.R. Iovchev M.I. Yin Z. Semenov E.P. Burg M.G. Hardie R.C. Pak W.L. The target of Drosophila photoreceptor synaptic transmission is a histamine-gated chloride channel encoded by ort (hclA).J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42113-42120Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test whether Ort is required for visually guided behavior, we first examined flies' phototaxis toward either UV or green light in preference to dark (see Experimental Procedures for details). This phototactic response is mediated primarily by the more sensitive, broad-spectrum photoreceptors, R1–R6, although R7 cells also contribute to UV, but not green, phototaxis under the light-adapted condition (Figures 2C and 2D, and Figures S1A and S1B available online; Fischbach, 1979Fischbach K.F. Simultaneous and successive colour contrast expressed in “slow” phototactic behaviour of walking Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 130: 161-171Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that wild-type flies exhibited stronger phototaxis toward UV than toward green light by approximately one order of magnitude and that light adaptation, when compared with dark adaptation, reduced the sensitivity to UV and green light by approximately two orders of magnitude (Figure 2A). In contrast, strong transallelic combination ort1/ortUS2515 mutant flies exhibited much weaker phototaxis toward either UV or green light (by about three and two orders of magnitude, respectively) as compared with wild-type. In negative geotaxis assays, ort mutants exhibited no apparent motor defects (Figure S1C), suggesting that their reduced phototaxis was not a motor system defect but rather a visual deficit. In addition, the ort mutation affected UV phototaxis more severely than green phototaxis. We speculate that Ort plays a role in relaying signals from UV-sensing R7s to their first-order interneurons and that HisCl1 may participate in phototaxis, especially toward green light. To assess whether Ort is required to transmit chromatic input mediated by R7 and R8, we used a quantitative spectral preference assay. This spectral preference assay tests the phototaxis toward UV in preference to green (see Experimental Procedures for details) and depends on R7, but not significantly on R1–R6, function (Figures 2E and 2G; Jacob et al., 1977Jacob K.G. Willmund R. Folkers E. Fischbach K.F. Spatz H.Ch. T-maze phototaxis of Drosophila melanogaster and several mutants in the visual systems.J. Comp.

Simultaneous and successive colour contrast expressed in “slow” phototactic behaviour of walking Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 130: 161-171Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This behavior depends on the circuit comparing UV and green light and likely reflects salience of UV and green lights rather than a simple linear summation of their phototactic responses. We found that wild-type flies preferred short-wavelength UV to longer-wavelength green light in an intensity-dependent fashion (Figure 2E). In contrast, homozygous null ort1 mutants and strong transallelic combination ort1/ortUS2515 mutants (as well as other allelic combinations ortP306/ortUS2515 and ort1/ortP306; data not shown) all exhibited reduced UV preference. Over five orders of magnitude in the ratio of UV/green intensities, the proportion of ort mutant flies that chose UV was significantly lower than that for wild-type flies (Figure 2E). To quantify the UV preference, we determined the isoluminance point, the UV/green intensity ratio at which flies found light of either wavelength equally “attractive,” and used the negative logarithm of the intensity ratio as a measure of UV attractiveness (AttrUV/G; Figure 2H). The UV attractiveness for ort mutants (AttrUV/G = 0.47 ± 0.50 for ort1 and 0.79 ± 0.22 for ort1/ortUS2515; mean ± SD) was significantly lower than that for wild-type flies (AttrUV/G = 2.52 ± 0.23) but higher than that for sevenless mutants (AttrUV/G = −0.88 ± 0.64), which lack UV-sensing R7s entirely (Tomlinson and Ready, 1986Tomlinson A. Ready D.F. Sevenless: A cell-specific homeotic mutation of the Drosophila eye.Science. 1986; 231: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (p < 0.00001, Student's t test; Figures 2E and 2H). Given that ort null mutants still exhibited phototaxis, we examined whether the other histamine receptor, HisCl1, might have contributed to UV preference. We found that HisCl1134 null mutants exhibited UV preference indistinguishable from the wild-type (p > 0.1). In contrast, strong allelic combination HisCl1134 ort1/HisCl1134 ortP306 double mutants showed weak phototaxis toward green light (data not shown), while double-null HisCl1134 ort1 mutants, like the phototransduction mutant NorpA, failed to discriminate between wavelengths in the UV and green (Figure 2E). We conclude that Ort is essential for optimal UV preference, while HisCl1 plays, at most, a minor and partially redundant role. We note that double-null HisCl1134 ort1 mutants were not entirely blind and still exhibited very weak fast phototaxis (data not shown), suggesting that there might be residual synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and the first-order interneurons despite the absence of these two known histamine receptors. We reasoned that the first-order interneurons must express the histamine receptor Ort in order to respond to their inputs from histaminergic R7 and R8 terminals. To identify these first-order interneurons, we determined the ort promoter region using comparative genomic sequence analysis (Odenwald et al., 2005Odenwald W.F. Rasband W. Kuzin A. Brody T. EVOPRINTER, a multigenomic comparative tool for rapid identification of functionally important DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14700-14705Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the ort locus, we found four blocks of noncoding sequence that are highly conserved among 12 species of Drosophila (Figure S2A). The first three sequence blocks (designated C1–C3) are localized to the intergenic region and the first intron and are, therefore, likely to contain critical cis elements (Figures 1E and S2A). We generated ort-promoter constructs driving Gal4 or LexA::VP16, designating these ortC1-3-Gal4 and ortC1-3-LexA::VP16. Both driver systems drove expression patterns in identical subsets of neurons in the lamina, medulla cortices, and in the deep C and T neurons of the lobula complex (Figures 1B–1D), except that ortC1-3-Gal4 drove somewhat patchy expression with lower intensity (data not shown). The fourth block of conserved sequences, located at 3′UTR, contains putative microRNA-binding sites (Figure S2A) and, as examined in ortC1-4-Gal4, did not drive expression in additional cells (data not shown), suggesting that it does not contain critical cis elements. Overall, the expression patterns of these ort promoter constructs resembled previously published ort expression patterns from in situ hybridization (Witte et al., 2002Witte I. Kreienkamp H.J. Gewecke M. Roeder T. Putative histamine-gated chloride channel subunits of the insect visual system and thoracic ganglion.J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We also performed comparative genomic sequence analysis for the HisCl1 locus and identified two blocks of highly conserved sequence (C1 and C2), located in the first introns of the HisCl1 gene and its neighboring gene (CG17360) (Figure S2B). We generated a HisCl1-Gal4 construct that included these conserved sequences (Figure S3A). We found that HisCl1-Gal4 drove strong expression in the lamina epithelial glia cells (as recently also reported by Pantazis et al., 2008Pantazis A. Segaran A. Liu C.H. Nikolaev A. Rister J. Thum A.S. Roeder T. Semenov E. Juusola M. Hardie R.C. Distinct roles for two histamine receptors (hclA and hclB) at the Drosophila photoreceptor synapse.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and in medulla cells that are not well characterized (Figures S3B–S3D). This result is consistent with previous EM data that lamina epithelial glia enwrap each cartridge and are postsynaptic to R1–R6 (Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991Meinertzhagen I.A. O'Neil S.D. Synaptic organization of columnar elements in the lamina of the wild type in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 305: 232-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Insofar as both the behavioral requirement and expression pattern indicate that Ort, but not HisCl1, plays a critical role in the visual system, we focused on Ort in the following analyses. We next examined whether using the ort-promoter Gal4 drivers to express Ort was sufficient to rescue the visual behavioral defects in ort mutants. We found that ortC1-4-Gal4-driven Ort expression restored a preference for UV (AttrUV/G = 2.25 ± 0.34) in ort mutants to the wild-type level (2.52 ± 0.23; Figures 2F and 2H). Since Ort, but not HisCl1, is also required in lamina neurons for normal ERG and motion detection responses (Figures S4B and S4C; Gengs et al., 2002Gengs C. Leung H.T. Skingsley D.R. Iovchev M.I. Yin Z. Semenov E.P. Burg M.G. Hardie R.C. Pak W.L. The target of Drosophila photoreceptor synaptic transmission is a histamine-gated chloride channel encoded by ort (hclA).J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42113-42120Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Rister et al., 2007Rister J. Pauls D. Schnell B. Ting C.Y. Lee C.H. Sinakevitch I. Morante J. Strausfeld N.J. Ito K. Heisenberg M. Dissection of the peripheral motion channel in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster.Neuron. 2007; 56: 155-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we examined the rescued flies for these functions too. We found that expressing Ort in ort mutants using ortC1-3-Gal4 restored, at least qualitatively, the “on” and “off” transients of the ERG, which report transmission in the lamina (Coombe and Heisenberg, 1986Coombe P.E. Heisenberg M. The structural brain mutant Vacuolar medulla of Drosophila melanogaster with specific behavioral defects and cell degeneration in the adult.J. Neurogenet. 1986; 3: 135-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as the optomotor behavior (Figures S4B–S4D). These findings are consistent with the observation that ort-Gal4 drove reporter expression in lamina neurons L1–L3 (Figure S4A). In contrast, expressing Ort in lamina neurons L1 and L2 using an L1/L2-specific driver (L1L2-A-Gal4) rescued both the ERG, at least qualitatively, and optomotor defects (Figures S4B and S4D), but not the UV preference (AttrUV/G = 0.41 ± 0.23; Figures 2F and 2H), of ort mutants. Thus, the actions of the ort-Gal4 drivers recapitulated the endogenous Ort expression pattern in the first-order interneurons of R1–R6 and R7. We next examined whether the Ort-expressing neurons were required for UV preference and motion detection. We found that ortC1-4-Gal4 or ortC1-3-LexA::VP16 driving a temperature-sensitive allele of shibire, shits1, so as to block synaptic transmission in specific neurons (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), significantly reduced the UV attractiveness at nonpermissive, but not permissive, temperatures (AttrUV/G = 0.78 ± 0.14 at 33°C and 2.92 ± 0.33 at 22°C for ortC1-4; Figures 2G and 2H; AttrUV/G = 0.65 ± 0.20 at 33°C and 2.22 ± 0.40 for ortC1-3; data not shown; p < 0.0001). This reduction was smaller than that caused by inactivating the R7s alone (AttrUV/G = −1.36 ± 0.22 at 33°C and 2.49 ± 0.65 at 22°C; Figures 2G and 2H). These results suggest that Ort-expressing neurons might mediate both UV and green phototaxis, presumably by relaying R7 and R8 channel signals, although we cannot rule out the existence of an ort-independent UV-sensing pathway (see Figure 5 and Discussion). Similarly, inactivating Ort-expressing neurons abolished the flies' ability to detect motion (Figure S4D). Thus, we may conclude that Ort-expressing neurons are required for both spectral preference and motion detection. To identify the Ort-expressing neurons that could be synaptic targets of the R7 and R8 channels, we employed a single-cell mosaic technique based on the flip-out genetic method previously described (Wong et al., 2002Wong A.M. Wang J.W. Axel R. Spatial representation of the glomerular map in the Drosophila protocerebrum.Cell. 2002; 109: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In this system, we used the ortC1-3-Gal4 flies that also carried the transgenes UAS > CD2,y+ > CD8-GFP and hs-Flp. The flipase activity induced by brief heat-shock at the second- or third-instar larval stages excised the FLP-out cassette in small random populations of cells, thereby allowing Gal4 to drive the expression of the CD8-GFP marker. From more than 1000 brain samples, we examined 459 clones of transmedulla neurons, the projection neurons that arborize in the medulla and project axons to the lobula. To identify the exact medulla and lobula strata in which these processes extended, we screened expression patterns of a series of known cell-adhesion molecules and found three useful stratum-specific markers, FasIII, Connectin, and Capricious (Figure S5; Shinza-Kameda et al., 2006Shinza-Kameda M"
https://openalex.org/W2137274405,"Spontaneous waves of activity propagating across large cortical areas may play important roles in sensory processing and circuit refinement. However, whether these waves are in turn shaped by sensory experience remains unclear. Here we report that visually evoked cortical activity reverberates in subsequent spontaneous waves. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging in rat visual cortex shows that following repetitive presentation of a given visual stimulus, spatiotemporal activity patterns resembling the evoked response appear more frequently in the spontaneous waves. This effect is specific to the response pattern evoked by the repeated stimulus, and it persists for several minutes without further visual stimulation. Such wave-mediated reverberation could contribute to short-term memory and help to consolidate the transient effects of recent sensory experience into long-lasting cortical modifications.

Such wave-mediated reverberation could contribute to short-term memory and help to consolidate the transient effects of recent sensory experience into long-lasting cortical modifications. An essential prerequisite for perception and cognition is the ability of neural circuits to sustain the representation of a sensory event for some period of time after the event occurs. Such sustained neural representation may underlie short-term perceptual memory such as iconic memory (Averbach and Sperling, 1961Averbach E. Sperling G. Short term storage of information in vision.in: Cherry C. Information Theory. Butterworth, London1961: 196-211Google Scholar) and priming (Tulving and Schacter, 1990Tulving E. Schacter D.L. Priming and human memory systems.Science. 1990; 247: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Hebb postulated that reverberating activity in cell assemblies could serve as a mechanism for short-term memory and help induce stable circuit modifications underlying long-term memory (Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley, New York1949Google Scholar). Although this conjecture has been highly influential, there has been little direct evidence for reverberating activity in early sensory circuits. In the neocortex, spontaneous activity in the absence of sensory input often exhibits nonrandom spatiotemporal patterns (Abeles and Gerstein, 1988Abeles M. Gerstein G.L.

Correlated neuronal activity and visual cortical development.Neuron. 2000; 27: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also suggested that many spontaneous activity patterns correspond closely to sensory-evoked responses (Kenet et al., 2003Kenet T. Bibitchkov D. Tsodyks M. Grinvald A. Arieli A. Spontaneously emerging cortical representations of visual attributes.Nature. 2003; 425: 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the spatiotemporal properties of spontaneous activity can be shaped by sensory experience. However, little is known about how sensory stimulation affects spontaneous activity and what the time courses of these effects are. In this study, we used voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging (Grinvald and Hildesheim, 2004Grinvald A. Hildesheim R. VSDI: a new era in functional imaging of cortical dynamics.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 874-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneous and evoked activity in the visual cortex of anesthetized rats. We found that both spontaneous and visually evoked activity manifest as propagating waves (Benucci et al., 2007Benucci A. Frazor R.A. Carandini M. Standing waves and traveling waves distinguish two circuits in visual cortex.Neuron. 2007; 55: 103-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2007Xu W. Huang X. Takagaki K. Wu J.Y. Compression and reflection of visually evoked cortical waves.Neuron. 2007; 55: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, following repetitive presentation of a given visual stimulus, the evoked activity pattern reverberated in the subsequent spontaneous waves for several minutes. Such a rapid, stimulus-induced modification of spontaneous activity in an early sensory circuit could contribute to short-term memory and facilitate long-term perceptual learning. We used VSD imaging to measure the spontaneous and evoked patterns of activity in rat visual cortex (Figure 1A) (see Experimental Procedures). In the absence of visual stimulation, spontaneous activity was initiated at random locations at a frequency of 0.5–4 Hz and propagated as waves across several millimeters of the cortical surface (Figure 1B, upper panel; see also Movie S1 available online). These waves propagated in various directions (Figure 1B, white lines) with a mean speed of 16 ± 4.3 mm/s (SD; Figure 1D), comparable to the spontaneous waves observed in several sensory cortical areas in vivo (Ferezou et al., 2006Ferezou I.

We also measured the cortical responses to a set of visual stimuli, each of which was a bright square (15°–20° visual angle) briefly flashed (50 ms) at one of nine positions in the contralateral visual field (Figure 1A). Each stimulus also evoked a wave of activity (Figure 1B, lower panel; Movie S2) (Benucci et al., 2007Benucci A. Frazor R.A. Carandini M.

However, unlike the spontaneous waves with random initiation sites and variable propagation directions (Figure 1B; Figure 2A), the evoked waves were much more reproducible. For each of the nine stimulus positions, the wave was initiated at a fixed cortical location organized retinotopically (Figure 1C), and the propagation path (Figure 1B, white lines) was highly reproducible across trials (Figure S1).Figure 2Effect of Repeated Visual Stimulation at a Given Position on Spontaneous WavesShow full caption(A) Spontaneous waves immediately before and after training (10.24 s/session).

Error bars indicate ±SEM. Consistent with a previous finding in the visual cortex (Kenet et al., 2003Kenet T. Bibitchkov D. Tsodyks M. Grinvald A. Arieli A. Spontaneously emerging cortical representations of visual attributes.Nature. 2003; 425: 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), some of the spontaneous waves resembled visually evoked responses (Figure 2A, indicated by single and double arrowheads). This similarity could reflect the intrinsic cortical connectivity or the long-term impact of previous visual experience. We wondered whether repeated visual stimulation could leave an immediate memory trace in the subsequent spontaneous activity. We presented 50 flashes (0.6 Hz) at one of the nine stimulus positions (referred to as the “training stimulus”) and compared the spontaneous waves before and after the training with respect to their similarity to the training-evoked wave. Immediately after the training, we found an increase in the number of spontaneous waves that resembled the training-evoked wave in their initiation site and propagation path (Figures 2A and 2B). As shown in the population summary in Figure 2C, training induced a significant increase in the proportion of spontaneous waves with initiation sites close to that of the evoked wave (<600 μm, p < 0.005, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 30). To further quantify the similarity between the spontaneous and evoked waves, we used the evoked wave as a spatiotemporal template and computed the correlation coefficients (CCs) between the spontaneous activity and this template. A spontaneous wave was considered to be a “match” to the evoked template if the CC was above a given threshold (Figure S2; Experimental Procedures). When we compared the percentage of matched spontaneous waves before and after training, we found a significant increase over a range of CC thresholds (Figure 2D). At a threshold of 0.5, the percentage of matched waves increased from 37.5% to 49.5% (a difference of 12.0% ± 4.2%, SEM, p < 0.02, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 30). In contrast, control analyses using spatially randomized or rotated (by 180°) spontaneous activity (“surrogate data”) showed no significant increase in the percentage of matches at any CC threshold (Figures S3A and S3B; p > 0.4, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Thus, the observed increase in the percentage of matched waves cannot be accounted for by nonspecific changes in the amplitude, frequency, or spatial extent of the propagation of spontaneous waves, since these changes would all be preserved in the spatially rotated surrogate data. Such an effect of repeated visual stimuli on spontaneous cortical activity is reminiscent of the notion of network reverberation (Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley, New York1949Google Scholar, Lorente de No, 1938Lorente de No R. Analysis of the activity of the chains of internuncial neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1938; 1: 207-244Google Scholar), in which activity patterns evoked by sensory stimuli continue to reverberate in the neural circuits after termination of the stimulus. We also tested the effects of more complex training stimuli (natural images and moving bars) on the subsequent spontaneous activity. The natural images contained luminance patterns that are more complex and spatially distributed than the flashed squares, while the moving bars swept across a large area of the visual field with different temporal structure from both the flashed squares and natural images (Experimental Procedures). Both types of stimuli evoked propagating waves of activity that were qualitatively similar to those elicited by the flashed square stimuli (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure S4). After training, we also found similar changes in the subsequent spontaneous activity (Figures 3C and 3D). At a CC threshold of 0.5, the increases in the percentage of matches were 10.2% ± 4.2% (p < 0.03, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 38) for natural images and 7.7% ± 3.3% (p < 0.04, n = 49) for moving bars. This suggests that the reverberation effect is not limited to simple, spatially localized stimuli but is general to a broad range of visual inputs. To serve as a potential mechanism for short-term memory, an important requirement for the reverberating activity is its specificity to the recent sensory stimulus. We thus tested whether repeated stimulation at one position also resulted in an increase in the percentage of matches to the responses elicited by stimuli at other positions. Since in some cases the response patterns evoked by different stimuli were similar (e.g., Figure 4A, middle and right panels in top row), which could mask the stimulus specificity of the effect, we first measured the dissimilarity between each untrained template and the trained template as 1−CC(Templatetrained,Templateuntrained) (Figure 4B). We then plotted the change in the percentage of matches between the spontaneous waves and each evoked template as a function of its dissimilarity to the trained template. As shown in Figure 4C, we found increases in the percentage of matches for some of the untrained templates, but this effect decreased with the dissimilarity to the trained template, reaching baseline at a dissimilarity of 0.8. Thus, the effect of training does not spread to untrained templates that are dissimilar to the trained template. Moreover, when we presented the same number of flashes but randomly distributed over the nine positions, we found no significant increase in the percentage of matches between the spontaneous waves and any of the evoked templates (Figure S3C; p > 0.2, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 19). Together, these results indicate that the reverberation effect is specific to the repeated stimulus and is not a general consequence of recent visual stimulation. Finally, we examined the time course for the induction and persistence of the effect. Figure 5A shows the increase in the percentage of matches immediately after training as a function of the number of training flashes. The magnitude of the effect increased with the number of repeats. To measure the persistence of the effect, we measured the increase in the number of matches at different time periods following training. As shown in Figure 5B, following 50 flashes, the effect decayed with a time constant of 0.8 min and reached baseline within ∼3 min. Increasing the amount of training to 125 flashes did not significantly augment the initial magnitude of the effect, but it increased the decay time constant to 14.4 min. Thus, the reverberation effect can last for several minutes, with its persistence depending on the amount of training. In this study, we found that repeated visual stimulation causes a significant increase in the percentage of spontaneous waves that are similar to the cortical response evoked by the training stimulus. This effect is specific to the training stimulus, and it lasts for several minutes after training, consistent with the notion of reverberating activity in neuronal circuits (Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley, New York1949Google Scholar, Lorente de No, 1938Lorente de No R. Analysis of the activity of the chains of internuncial neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1938; 1: 207-244Google Scholar). Reactivation of learning-related neural activity, thought to contribute to memory consolidation, has been demonstrated in the hippocampus (Louie and Wilson, 2001Louie K.

Margoliash D. Song replay during sleep and computational rules for sensorimotor vocal learning.Science. 2000; 290: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) during sleep. Our study shows that visual stimuli can leave an immediate trace in the spontaneous activity in the first stage of cortical processing. Given its specificity (Figure 4) and time course (Figure 5B), such reverberation provides a potential mechanism for learning effects such as short-term visual memory (Phillips, 1974Phillips W.A. Distinction between sensory storage and short-term visual memory.Percept. Psychophys. 1974; 16: 283-290Crossref Scopus (678) Google Scholar) and visual priming (Tulving and Schacter, 1990Tulving E. Schacter D.L. Priming and human memory systems.Science. 1990; 247: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). A related phenomenon has been described recently in cat V1 using single-unit recordings (Yao et al., 2007Yao H. Shi L. Han F. Gao H. Dan Y. Rapid learning in cortical coding of visual scenes.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in which the temporal patterns of spontaneous activity of individual cells were found to become more similar to the visually evoked response after repeated stimulation. In the current study, VSD imaging of cortical population activity revealed that spontaneous and visually evoked activity manifest as waves (Figure 1) and that the increased similarity between the spontaneous and evoked activity after repeated stimulation is at least partly due to a shift in the initiation sites of the spontaneous waves toward that of the training-evoked wave (Figure 2C). These observations provide important clues to the mechanisms for cortical reverberation. Furthermore, whereas the temporal reverberation demonstrated in the previous study occurred periodically at the repetition rate of the training stimulus (Yao et al., 2007Yao H. Shi L. Han F. Gao H. Dan Y. Rapid learning in cortical coding of visual scenes.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the effect observed in the current study is not periodic, thus representing a more general form of reverberation. In addition to the mammalian visual cortex, reactivation of odorant-evoked spatial activity patterns has been shown in the honeybee antennal lobe using Ca2+ imaging (Galan et al., 2006Galan R.F. Weidert M. Menzel R. Herz A.V. Galizia C.G. Sensory memory for odors is encoded in spontaneous correlated activity between olfactory glomeruli.Neural Comput. 2006; 18: 10-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This suggests that reverberation exists in multiple sensory modalities in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Of course, a significant limitation of all of these studies is that they were performed in anesthetized animals. It would be important for future studies to examine the contributions of these reactivated patterns in early sensory areas to perception and cognition in awake behaving animals. The observed changes in spontaneous cortical activity could reflect changes in the earlier stages of the visual pathway (the retina and thalamus) and/or within the visual cortex. At the cellular level, the reverberation may be mediated by short-term changes in synaptic efficacy (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar) or in the intrinsic membrane properties (Zhang and Linden, 2003Zhang W. Linden D.J. The other side of the engram: experience-driven changes in neuronal intrinsic excitability.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 885-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) of the neurons activated by the repeated visual stimulation. Some of these modifications can last for hundreds of seconds, comparable to the time course of the reverberation (Figure 5). In particular, changes in these cellular properties at the initiation site of the evoked template may increase the probability of initiation of the spontaneous waves at this location (Figure 2C), which could in turn affect the wave trajectory. Although in this study we examined the reverberation effect with limited sets of training stimuli, the above mechanisms could also support reverberation of more complex visual experience by operating on neurons and synapses that are preferentially activated by other features of the stimuli (e.g., orientations of local edges). The reverberation effect may also involve longer-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity since the correlated activation of a large number of neurons during waves is likely to be conducive to long-term synaptic modifications (Bi and Poo, 2001Bi G. Poo M. Synaptic modification by correlated activity: Hebb's postulate revisited.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 139-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, Weliky, 2000Weliky M. Correlated neuronal activity and visual cortical development.Neuron. 2000; 27: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this context, the relatively short persistence of the reverberation effect may reflect depotentiation or dedepression caused by the ongoing spontaneous activity in the cortex (Zhou and Poo, 2004Zhou Q. Poo M.M. Reversal and consolidation of activity-induced synaptic modifications.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 378-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that increasing the number of training stimuli markedly prolonged the duration of the effect (Figure 5), suggesting that recurring visual stimuli can convert transient reverberations into more stable cortical modifications. In fact, reverberation of the evoked activity patterns is likely not only to reflect the stimulus-induced circuit modifications but also to take part in their consolidation. Long-term strengthening of the connections within specific cell assemblies may explain the spontaneous occurrence of activity patterns that resemble sensory-evoked responses even in the absence of training (Kenet et al., 2003Kenet T. Bibitchkov D. Tsodyks M. Grinvald A. Arieli A. Spontaneously emerging cortical representations of visual attributes.Nature. 2003; 425: 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). These spontaneous reactivations may in turn improve cortical response reliability in future encounters with familiar stimuli (Galan et al., 2006Galan R.F. Weidert M. Menzel R"
https://openalex.org/W1982183474,"The α-pyrone antibiotic myxopyronin (Myx) inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, through a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches, we show that Myx interacts with the RNAP “switch region”—the hinge that mediates opening and closing of the RNAP active center cleft—to prevent interaction of RNAP with promoter DNA. We define the contacts between Myx and RNAP and the effects of Myx on RNAP conformation and propose that Myx functions by interfering with opening of the RNAP active-center cleft during transcription initiation. We further show that the structurally related α-pyrone antibiotic corallopyronin (Cor) and the structurally unrelated macrocyclic-lactone antibiotic ripostatin (Rip) function analogously to Myx. The RNAP switch region is distant from targets of previously characterized RNAP inhibitors, and, correspondingly, Myx, Cor, and Rip do not exhibit crossresistance with previously characterized RNAP inhibitors. The RNAP switch region is an attractive target for identification of new broad-spectrum antibacterial therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2039502252,"Impaired degradation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides could lead to Abeta accumulation, an early trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD). How Abeta-degrading enzymes are regulated remains largely unknown. Cystatin C (CysC, CST3) is an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B (CatB), a recently discovered Abeta-degrading enzyme. A CST3 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of late-onset sporadic AD. Here, we identified CysC as the key inhibitor of CatB-induced Abeta degradation in vivo. Genetic ablation of CST3 in hAPP-J20 mice significantly lowered soluble Abeta levels, the relative abundance of Abeta1-42, and plaque load. CysC removal also attenuated Abeta-associated cognitive deficits and behavioral abnormalities and restored synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Importantly, the beneficial effects of CysC reduction were abolished on a CatB null background, providing direct evidence that CysC regulates soluble Abeta and Abeta-associated neuronal deficits through inhibiting CatB-induced Abeta degradation."

Reelin is essential for the stereotypical inside-out sequential lamination of the neocortex, but the molecular mechanisms of its action still remain unclear. Here we show that regulation of Notch activity plays an important part in Reelin-signal-dependent neuronal migration. We found that Reelin-deficient mice have reduced levels of the cleaved form of Notch intracellular domain (Notch ICD) and that loss of Notch signaling in migrating neurons results in migration and morphology defects. Further, overexpression of Notch ICD mitigates the laminar and morphological abnormalities of migrating neurons in Reeler. Finally, our in vitro biochemical studies show that Reelin signaling inhibits Notch ICD degradation via Dab1. Together, our results indicate that neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex requires a Reelin-Notch interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1979783832,"Kinetochores of mitotic chromosomes are coupled to spindle microtubules in ways that allow the energy from tubulin dynamics to drive chromosome motion. Most kinetochore-associated microtubule ends display curving ""protofilaments,"" strands of tubulin dimers that bend away from the microtubule axis. Both a kinetochore ""plate"" and an encircling, ring-shaped protein complex have been proposed to link protofilament bending to poleward chromosome motion. Here we show by electron tomography that slender fibrils connect curved protofilaments directly to the inner kinetochore. Fibril-protofilament associations correlate with a local straightening of the flared protofilaments. Theoretical analysis reveals that protofilament-fibril connections would be efficient couplers for chromosome motion, and experimental work on two very different kinetochore components suggests that filamentous proteins can couple shortening microtubules to cargo movements. These analyses define a ring-independent mechanism for harnessing microtubule dynamics directly to chromosome movement."

Transcriptional analyses indicate that the system is encoded by an 11-gene operon, up-regulated 4.0-fold during growth on cholesterol versus on pyruvate. Growth of RHA1 on cholesterol and uptake of radiolabeled cholesterol both required expression of genes in the mce4 operon encoding two permeases plus eight additional proteins of unknown function.

This uptake system was also essential for growth of RHA1 on β-sitosterol, 5-α-cholestanol, and 5-α-cholestanone. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that all mce4 loci in sequenced genomes are linked to steroid metabolism genes. Thus, we predict that all Mce4 systems are steroid transporters.

The transport function of the Mce4 system is consistent with proposed roles of cholesterol and its metabolism in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. The mce genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have garnered much interest due to their demonstrated role in pathogenesis, although the function of these genes remains unclear. The first mce gene, now known as mce1A, was discovered when a DNA fragment cloned from M. tuberculosis into a noninvasive Escherichia coli strain enabled uptake of the latter bacterium by nonphagocytic mammalian epithelial (HeLa) cells and facilitated its phagocytosis by macrophages (1Arruda S. Bomfim G. Knights R. Huimabyron T. Riley L.W. Science. 1993; 261: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A subsequent study showed that coating latex beads with the protein encoded by mce1A facilitated uptake of the beads by HeLa cells, and so the gene was designated mce for mammalian cell entry (2Chitale S. Ehrt S. Kawamura I. Fujimura T. Shimono N. Anand N. Lu S. Cohen-Gould L. Riley L.W. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The genome sequence of M. tuberculosis revealed four loci (mce1–4), each containing two yrbE genes followed by six mce genes (3Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D.

Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2005; 85: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and Mce1A was localized to the surface of M. tuberculosis cells (2Chitale S. Ehrt S. Kawamura I. Fujimura T. Shimono N. Anand N. Lu S. Cohen-Gould L. Riley L.W. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The capacity to facilitate uptake by HeLa cells was further narrowed to a small region of the MceA1 protein (2Chitale S. Ehrt S. Kawamura I. Fujimura T. Shimono N. Anand N. Lu S. Cohen-Gould L. Riley L.W. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Casali N. Konieczny M. Schmidt M.A. Riley L.W. Infect.

Coating beads with either Mce3A or Mce3E also facilitated such uptake (7El-Shazly S. Ahmad S. Mustafa A.S. Raja Al-Attiyah R. Krajci D. J. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 56: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas coating beads with Mce2A failed to do so (2Chitale S. Ehrt S. Kawamura I. Fujimura T. Shimono N. Anand N. Lu S. Cohen-Gould L. Riley L.W. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that some of the Mce proteins might interact with host cells and play a role in uptake of M. tuberculosis by host cells. However, direct evidence for this function of Mce proteins is lacking. Mutational studies also support the involvement of Mce proteins in pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. One genome-wide screen suggested that disruption of mce1 and mce4 genes causes early and late growth defects, respectively, in mice (8Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), and these phenotypes were confirmed with mce1D and yrbE4A deletion mutants, respectively (8Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl.

Another genome-wide screen suggested that disruption of yrbE4A impairs macrophage infection (11Rosas-Magallanes V. Stadthagen-Gomez G. Rauzier J. Barreiro L.B. Tailleux L. Boudou F. Griffin R. Nigou J. Jackson M. Gicquel B. Neyrolles O. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and a yrbE4A deletion mutant was severely impaired in replication in interferon γ-activated macrophages (10Pandey A.K. Sassetti C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4376-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Disruption of any one of yrbE1B, mce2A, and mce3A genes in M. tuberculosis increased survival of intratrachaelly infected mice (12Gioffre A. Infante E. Aguilar D. de la Paz Santangelo M. Klepp L.

Similarly, deletion of nearly entire mce3 or mce4 operons increased long term survival of mice following low dose aerosol infection, and the latter deletion also decreased bacterial burdens of the mice (13Senaratne R.H. Sidders B. Sequeira P. Saunders G. Dunphy K. Marjanovic O. Reader J.R. Lima P. Chan S. Kendall S. McFadden J. Riley L.W. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 57: 164Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, an mce1A deletion was hypervirulent in mice (14Shimono N. Morici L. Casali N. Cantrell S. Sidders B. Ehrt S. Riley L.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15918-15923Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, mce mutant strains have phenotypes generally supporting the involvement of these genes in pathogenesis, but the mutants exhibited disparate virulence phenotypes in different assays. Analysis of genome sequences indicated that diverse actinobacteria, including members of Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Streptomyces, harbor mce loci (15Casali N. Riley L.W. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16McLeod M.M. Warren R.L. Hsiao W. W.L. Araki N. Myhre M. Fernandes C. Miyazawa D. Wong W. Lillquist A.L. Wang D. Dosanjh M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15582-15587Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Moreover, PCR-based assays revealed the existence of mce4 loci in 11 of 20 Mycobacterium spp. screened (17Haile Y. Caugant D.A. Bjune G. Wiker H.G. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 33: 125-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actinobacteria with mce loci include both pathogens and free-living bacteria, strongly suggesting that the function of these genes is not limited to virulence. Bioinformatic analyses (15Casali N. Riley L.W. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Tekaia F. Gordon S.V. Garnier T. Brosch R. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Tuber. Lung Dis. 1999; 79: 329-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) indicated that the yrbE genes of all mce loci encode transmembrane proteins with similarity to permease components of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 2The abbreviations used are:ABCATP-binding cassetteRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRDCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideBCGBacille de Calmette et Guèrin transporters. The hallmark of ABC transporters is an ATPase with highly conserved features. Some mce loci include genes encoding such ATPases, which belong to the Mkl family, a subset of ABC transporter ATPases (15Casali N. Riley L.W. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Further, all actinobacteria containing mce loci were found to also contain genes encoding Mkl ATPases, usually not proximal to the mce loci. Based on genetic interaction mapping and mutagenesis, Joshi et al. (9Joshi S.M. Pandey A.K. Capite N. Fortune S.M. Rubin E.J. Sassetti C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11760-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the Mce1 and Mce4 proteins in M. tuberculosis are both functionally linked to a single Mkl ATPase (MceG), encoded by a gene not linked to either the mce1 or the mce4 loci. These observations strongly suggest that mce loci encode a novel type of ABC transporter. However, direct evidence for this transport function has not been demonstrated. ATP-binding cassette reverse transcription-PCR dicyclohexylcarbodiimide Bacille de Calmette et Guèrin Many mce loci also include two or four genes downstream of the yrbE-mce genes (14Shimono N.

The latter genes have been referred to as mce-associated (mas) genes (15Casali N. Riley L.W. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); however, there is already precedent for using Mas to denote mycocerosic acid synthase of M. tuberculosis (19Mathur M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so we will simply refer to the latter genes in mce loci as additional mce genes (i.e. mce4HI). We previously found that the mce4 locus of Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 was among a large cluster of genes up-regulated during growth on cholesterol (20van der Geize R. Heuser T. Hara H. Wilbrink M.H. Yam K. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Davies J.E. Dijkhuizen L. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that RHA1 mutants with deletions of either the supAB genes (homologous to yrbE4AB genes; Δsup) or the mce4ABCDEF genes (Δmce4AF) lost the ability to grow on cholesterol. These findings led us to hypothesize that the Mce4 system of RHA1 functions in cholesterol uptake. Because the mce4 locus of M. tuberculosis is also clustered with cholesterol metabolism genes homologous to those in RHA1, we hypothesized the same function for the Mce4 systems in both organisms. Consistent with this, Pandey and Sassetti (10Pandey A.K. Sassetti C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4376-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) recently showed that an M. tuberculosis yrbE4A disruption mutant is impaired in mineralization of C-4 of cholesterol, assimilation of C-26 of cholesterol, and growth with cholesterol as a substrate. In the present study, we used mutational analysis and a direct assay of cholesterol uptake to conclusively determine the role of the Mce4 system of RHA1 in steroid uptake. We also used bioinformatic analysis to assess the role of Mce4 systems in other actinobacteria. Bacterial Growth—R. jostii RHA1 was grown at 30 °C on a shaker on defined Goodies medium (21Bauchop T. Elsden R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 23: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) plus either 10 mm pyruvate or 2 mm of a steroid substrate. Cholesterol was from Sigma-Aldrich, and other steroids were from Steraloids (Newport, RI). Biomass was estimated on the basis of total protein measured by disrupting cells with hot alkaline lysis and using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. PCR—Nucleic acids were extracted, and RNA was purified as described previously (20van der Geize R. Heuser T. Hara H. Wilbrink M.H. Yam K. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Davies J.E. Dijkhuizen L. Mohn W.W.

Quantitative PCR was done using TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems), and gene expression differences were calculated as described previously (20van der Geize R. Heuser T. Hara H. Wilbrink M.H. Yam K.

Primer and probe sequences are in supplemental Table S1. PCR conditions for reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and RT-quantitative-PCR assays were: 95 °C for 5 min and then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 66 °C (PCR 1) or 59 °C (PCR 2–10) for 40 s, 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension at 72 °C was for 7 min before holding at 4 °C. Gene Deletion and Complementation—The mce4H-mce4I-ro04706 genes of R. jostii RHA1 were deleted (Δmce4HI) using the sacB counter selection system essentially as described (22van der Geize R.

Sequences of all oligonucleotides used are in supplemental Table S1. Oligonucleotides ro04706-F and ro04706-R were used to amplify and clone a 1.8-kb region downstream of the three genes of RHA1, comprised of the last 13 codons and the stop codon of ro04706, into SmaI-digested pK18mobsacB, yielding pK18-Ro04706. Oligonucleotides ro04704-F and ro04704-R were used to amplify the upstream region of the three genes. The obtained 1.8-kb PCR product, composed of the first 20 codons including the start codon of ro04704, was cloned into pGEM-T. A double digestion with NcoI (blunt-ended with Klenow) and SpeI was performed on the resulting plasmid, and the liberated fragment was cloned into BamHI (blunt-ended with Klenow) and SpeI double-digested pK18-Ro04706, resulting in pK18-Ro04704-06 used for mce4H-mce4I-ro04706 gene deletion. The deletion was verified by PCR using oligonucleotides ro04704-06-F with ro04704-06-R and ro04704contr-F with ro04706contr-R, matching sequences flanking the targeted three genes. The supA-supB gene deletion (Δsup) and the mceH-mceI gene deletion (Δmce4HI) were complemented, resulting in the strains Δsup-C and Δmce4HI-C, respectively, as follows. The supA-supB genes were amplified using primers ro04696-F and ro04797-R. The resulting 1636-bp amplicon was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned in pTip-QC2 (23Nakashima N. Tamura T. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 86: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), yielding pTip-supAB. Similarly, the mce4H and mce4I genes were amplified using primers ro04704ex-F and ro04705ex-R. The resulting 1267-bp amplicon was subcloned, digested with BspHI and HindIII, and ligated into NcoI/HindIII-digested pTip-QC1 (23Nakashima N. Tamura T. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 86: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), yielding pTip-mce4HI. The pTip-supAB and pTip-mceHI plasmids were introduced into the Δsup strain and the Δmce4HI strain, respectively, by electroporation. A “vector control” strain without the supA-supB genes (ΔsupV) was also produced by electroporating Δsup with pTip-QC2. Cholesterol Uptake Assay—Cholesterol uptake was measured in resting cell suspensions. Cells were grown to mid-log phase on pyruvate, washed twice, and suspended at a cell density of 900 mg of protein/liter (A600 = 13.3) in Goodies buffer. Aliquots of 0.05 ml Goodies medium were placed in 4-ml vials, and [4-14C]cholesterol (53 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added from an ethanol stock solution. Aliquots of 0.05 ml of cell suspensions were added to the vials for a final cell density of 450 mg of protein/liter. The vials were incubated with shaking for 5 min at room temperature. Cholesterol uptake was stopped by diluting the suspensions with 1.0 ml of ice-cold buffer, collecting the cells on a 0.22-μm Millipore nitrocellulose filter (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario), washing the cells with 10 ml of 5! Tween 20 (Fisher) and then with 10 ml of 50! ethanol, and finally, with 10 ml of 5! Tween 20. The filters were placed in Beckman Ready-Safe scintillation mixture (Beckman Coulter) and counted in a Beckman LS-600IC scintillation counter to determine the amount of cholesterol taken up by the cells. The rate of uptake was found to be constant for greater than 5 min, and there was a linear relationship between uptake rate and cell biomass over a cell density range of 69–1375 mg of protein/liter. Where indicated, 60 mm sodium azide, 2.0 mm dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), or 10 mm sodium orthovanadate was added to cell suspensions 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled cholesterol. Steady-state kinetic parameters were analyzed using the least squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (24Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The mce4 Locus—The RHA1 mce4 locus has the typical gene arrangement of other mce loci and appears to be an operon (Fig. 1). As reported previously (15Casali N. Riley L.W. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), orthologous mce4 loci occur in Nocardia farcinica (IFM 10152), Mycobacterium bovis (AF2122/97), Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (k-10), Mycobacterium smegmatis (MC2 155), and M. tuberculosis (H37Rv and other strains). We also found mce4 loci in M. avium (104), M. bovis BCG (Bacille de Calmette et Guèrin), Mycobacterium marinum (M), Mycobacterium ulcerans (Agy99), and Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (PYR-1). The mce4 gene products of RHA1 have the greatest similarity to their respective orthologs in N. farcinica. The sup genes of the RHA1 mce4 locus are orthologs of yrbE4 genes in other mce4 loci. The RHA1 mce4 locus has the conserved configuration of two yrbE (sup) plus eight mce genes found in all known mce4 loci. However, the mce4 locus of RHA1 is unique in that mce4I is followed by two additional genes. The first of these genes, ro04706, is only two nucleotides downstream of mce4I and encodes a hypothetical protein with an N-terminal region similar to the conserved domain of the substrate-binding site of ketosteroid isomerases (Pfam family PF02136). The second of these genes, ro04707, encodes a protein with similarity to the conserved domain of the 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase family (Pfam family PF01073). Both of these genes appear to have orthologs in all of the above strains, but none of those orthologs is closely linked to mce4 loci. The orthologs in H37Rv are Rv2042c and Rv0139, respectively, which are not closely linked to the large steroid metabolism gene cluster of H37Rv. However, Rv0139 is part of a large regulon that also includes the steroid metabolism genes and mce4 genes of H37Rv (25Kendall S.L. Withers M. Soffair C.N. Moreland N.J. Gurcha S. Sidders B. Frita R. ten Bokum A. Besra G.S. Lott J.S. Stoker N.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 684-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The four genes upstream of supA (yrbE4A) are conserved in all of the above organisms and putatively encode a 3-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase, a ferredoxin and two acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. The fifth gene upstream of supA (yrbE4A) is conserved in all the above organisms, except N. farcinica, and putatively encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase. In RHA1, the 11 genes from supA through ro04706 are closely spaced (Fig. 1), with maximum intergenic regions of 20 bases and with six of the predicted genes overlapping the following ones by four nucleotides. Putative transcriptional promoters were found upstream of hsd4A, supA, and ro04707, but none were found within the 11-gene mce4 cluster, suggesting co-transcription of that cluster. This conclusion was further supported by RT-PCR analysis, which detected transcripts including intergenic regions within this cluster. Seven of the 10 intergenic regions were assayed, and all were detected. Transcripts including the intergenic regions on either side of the 11-gene cluster were also detected, suggesting some level of transcription through those regions. We used expression of the supA gene as a proxy for expression of mce4 locus genes in an RT-quantitative-PCR assay. The supA gene was up-regulated 4.0-fold during growth on cholesterol, relative to during growth on pyruvate. Together, the above results strongly suggest that the 11-gene mce4 cluster is co-transcribed and regulated as an operon. The results do not preclude the existence of additional smaller transcripts within the region nor larger transcripts including additional flanking genes. Like other mce4 loci, that of RHA1 is not proximal to a gene encoding an Mlk family ATPase. However, the RHA1 genome includes two genes, ro01974 and ro02744, encoding ATPases orthologous to MceG, the Mlk ATPase gene of M. tuberculosis. Both of these RHA1 genes are associated with other mce loci of RHA1. One or both of these ATPases may function in the RHA1 Mce4 system. Growth Phenotypes of Mutants—We made an unmarked, inframe deletion mutant of the mce4HI-ro04706 genes (Δmce4HI) in RHA1 (Fig. 1). Like the previous Δsup and Δmce4AF deletion mutants (20van der Geize R. Heuser T. Hara H. Wilbrink M.H. Yam K. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Davies J.E. Dijkhuizen L. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), the Δmce4HI mutant completely lost the ability to grow on cholesterol (Fig. 2A). We constructed two complementation strains to confirm that deleted genes were the cause of the mutant phenotypes. The Δsup-C complementation strain consists of the Δsup mutant with plasmid pTip (23Nakashima N. Tamura T. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 86: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) containing supAB. The Δsup-C strain partially regained the ability to grow on cholesterol. An “empty vector” control strain (Δsup-V), consisting of the Δsup mutant with plasmid pTip, could not grow on cholesterol. Given this complementation and the complete inability of the Δmce4AF and Δmce4HI deletion mutants to grow on cholesterol, it is clear that the Δsup deletion did not have a polar effect preventing expression of the downstream genes. The unmarked, in-frame Δmce4AF and Δmce4HI deletion mutants are also very unlikely to have polar effects. The Δmce4HI-C complementation strain consists of the Δmce4HI mutant with plasmid pTip (23Nakashima N. Tamura T. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 86: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) containing mce4HI, but not ro04706. The Δmce4HI-C strain also partially regained the ability to grow on cholesterol. This indicates that the last gene of the mce4 operon, ro04706, is not essential for growth on cholesterol. Overall, the above results demonstrate that each group of genes, supAB, mce4ABCDEF, and mce4HI, encode one or more proteins essential for growth on cholesterol. Cholesterol Uptake—The role of the Mce4 system in cholesterol uptake was directly examined by measuring cholesterol uptake by wild-type RHA1 and the mutant strains. We assayed uptake of 14C-labeled cholesterol by resting cell suspensions. Attempts to use cholesterol-induced cells were unsuccessful as cholesterol used for induction could not be washed from the cells, making it impossible to control the concentration and specific activity of cholesterol in the assay. However, uninduced RHA1 cells grown on pyruvate had measurable cholesterol uptake activity. Uptake followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and exhibited a low Km (0.6 ± 0.1 μm) for cholesterol (Fig. 3A). Uptake activity was abolished by preincubation of cells with the respiratory inhibitor, sodium azide, or either of two ATPase inhibitors, DCCD and vanadate, indicating that uptake is energy-dependent, and more specifically, ATP-dependent (Fig. 3B). The intended effect of DCCD in RHA1 is supported by previous studies (26Agarwal N. Kalra V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Parrish N.M. Ko C.G. Hughes M.A. Townsend C.A. Dick J.D. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2004; 54: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that have shown that DCCD inhibits proton-driven ATPases of mycobacteria that are phylogenetically related, and physiologically similar, to RHA1. Further, the consistent effect of these two, mechanistically distinct ATPase inhibitors strongly indicates that they indeed inhibited the ATPase. The maximum specific uptake activity for the uninduced cells was 15 ± 2 μm/min/mg of protein, but we predict a higher rate for induced cells. The Δsup, Δmce4AF, and Δmce4HI strains had no measurable cholesterol uptake activity (Fig. 3B). These uptake phenotypes are entirely consistent with the growth phenotypes of the mutants. Moreover, the Δsup-C and Δmce4HI-C complementation strains had wild-type cholesterol uptake activity. These phenotypes are consistent with the growth phenotypes, but it is interesting that complementation is more complete in the uptake assay. The explanation for this difference in degree of complementation may be the use of uninduced cells for the uptake assay. Thus, expression of the supAB and mce4HI genes from pTip may be sufficient for uninduced uptake activity but may not be sufficient for maximal growth on cholesterol. These results clearly indicate that products of the mce4 genes are part of a cholesterol uptake system. Uptake of Other Steroids—Wild-type RHA1 and the three deletion mutants were additionally tested for growth on a range of steroids and related compounds. RHA1 was able to grow on 4-androstene-3,17-dione, 5-α-cholestanol, 5-α-cholestanone, cholic acid, progesterone, and β-sitosterol, but not on cholcalciferol, cholestane, ergocalciferol, ergosterol, estradiol, or hydrocortisone. The Δsup, Δmce4AF, and Δmce4HI mutants also lost the ability to grow on β-sitosterol (Fig. 4), 5-α-cholestanol, and 5-α-cholestanone (not shown). Cholesterol, 5-α-cholestanol, 5-α-cholestanone, and β-sitosterol have very similar structures. The deletion mutants were unaffected in growth on 4-androstene-3,17-dione, cholic acid, and progesterone, which differ notably from the above four compounds in having shorter, polar side chains. These results indicate that the Mce4 system takes up cholesterol, 5-α-cholestanol, 5-α-cholestanone, and β-sitosterol. One or more other systems likely transport 4-androstene-3,17-dione, cholic acid, and progesterone, but we cannot exclude the possibility that the Mce4 system also transports the latter three compounds. Association of mce4 Genes with Steroid Metabolism Genes—To obtain evidence that Mce4 systems are involved in steroid uptake in other bacteria, we searched available genome sequences with mce4 loci for genetically linked steroid metabolism genes. We searched for homologs of the RHA1 kshA gene, hsaADCB, and hsaEGF gene clusters. These genes encode most of the steps involved in degradation of rings A and B of the steroid nucleus to citric acid cycle intermediates. We previously found that, although the gene order varied in the genomes of RHA1 versus H37Rv, these genes were all in the region upstream of the mce4 loci of both genomes, with the hsaADCB and hsaFGE putative operons conserved in both organisms (20van der Geize R. Heuser T. Hara H. Wilbrink M.H. Yam K. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Davies J.E. Dijkhuizen L. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2068628710,"Recently, we identified a novel signaling pathway involving Epac, Rap, and phospholipase C (PLC)ϵ that plays a critical role in maximal β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) stimulation of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in cardiac myocytes. Here we demonstrate that PLCϵ phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolytic activity and PLCϵ-stimulated Rap1 GEF activity are both required for PLCϵ-mediated enhancement of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and that PLCϵ significantly enhances Rap activation in response to βAR stimulation in the heart. Downstream of PLCϵ hydrolytic activity, pharmacological inhibition of PKC significantly inhibited both βAR- and Epac-stimulated increases in CICR in PLCϵ+/+ myocytes but had no effect in PLCϵ–/– myocytes. βAR and Epac activation caused membrane translocation of PKCϵ in PLCϵ+/+ but not PLCϵ–/– myocytes and small interfering RNA-mediated PKCϵ knockdown significantly inhibited both βAR and Epac-mediated CICR enhancement. Further downstream, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) inhibitor, KN93, inhibited βAR- and Epac-mediated CICR in PLCϵ+/+ but not PLCϵ–/– myocytes. Epac activation increased CamKII Thr286 phosphorylation and enhanced phosphorylation at CamKII phosphorylation sites on the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) (Ser2815) and phospholamban (Thr17) in a PKC-dependent manner. Perforated patch clamp experiments revealed that basal and βAR-stimulated peak L-type current density are similar in PLCϵ+/+ and PLCϵ–/– myocytes suggesting that control of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, rather than Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, is the target of regulation of a novel signal transduction pathway involving sequential activation of Epac, PLCϵ, PKCϵ, and CamKII downstream of βAR activation.

In primary astrocytes isolated from PLCϵ+/+ and PLCϵ–/– mice, multiple G protein-dependent upstream signals rely critically on PLCϵ-dependent generation of IP3 and diacylglycerol (9Citro S. Malik S. Oestreich E.A. Radeff-Huang J. Kelley G.G. Smrcka A.V. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 15543-15548Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We recently discovered a surprising role for PLCϵ regulation downstream of the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) in cardiac myocytes (10Wang H. Oestreich E.A. Maekawa N. Bullard T.A. Vikstrom K.L. Dirksen R.T. Kelley G.G. Blaxall B.C. Smrcka A.V. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Compared with normal mice, PLCϵ–/– mice exhibit reduced left ventricular developed pressure in response to strong βAR stimulation (10Wang H. Oestreich E.A. Maekawa N. Bullard T.A. Vikstrom K.L. Dirksen R.T. Kelley G.G. Blaxall B.C. Smrcka A.V. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This deficit results from a decrease in isoproterenol (Iso)-dependent stimulation of electrically evoked Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in single ventricular cardiac myocytes. βAR stimulation increases cardiac Ca2+ release in a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism through phosphorylation of multiple targets of the cardiac excitability and Ca2+ handling machinery (11Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a PKA-independent, PLCϵ-mediated pathway that contributes to maximal Iso-dependent enhancement of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in cardiac myocytes (12Oestreich E.A. Wang H. Malik S. Kaproth-Joslin K.A. Blaxall B.C. Kelley G.G. Dirksen R.T. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5488-5495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and explains the decreased βAR function in PLCϵ–/– mice. This novel pathway requires cAMP-dependent activation of the RapGEF, Epac (13Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), which subsequently stimulates Rap-dependent activation of PLCϵ. Here, we establish a mechanistic link between PLCϵ activity and CICR by showing that Epac/Rap/PLCϵ-mediated enhancement of CICR in the heart requires both PLCϵ-PIP2 hydrolytic and PLCϵ-RapGEF activities and that downstream of PLCϵ, both PKCϵ and CamKII are required for Epac-dependent enhancement of Ca2+ release. In addition, voltage clamp experiments reveal that Iso-dependent activation of the Epac/PLCϵ pathway in the heart does not significantly alter Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels indicating that Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is the ultimate target of this pathway. Isolation of Cardiac Myocytes—Adult ventricular cardiomyocytes (AVM) were isolated from male, 4–6-month-old wild type or PLCϵ–/– mice (C57/B6 background) as previously described (10Wang H. Oestreich E.A. Maekawa N. Bullard T.A. Vikstrom K.L. Dirksen R.T. Kelley G.G. Blaxall B.C. Smrcka A.V. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection. Hearts were excised and digested by Langendorff perfusion using either Liberase Blendzyme I (Roche) or a mixture of collagenase A and D (Roche). Cells were plated on laminin (BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips or 35-mm tissue culture dishes in minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 μm blebbistatin (Sigma) to prevent contractile activity. Transduction of AVM with Adenovirus—Adenoviruses were prepared using the AdEasy system (Stratagene) with the murine cytomegalovirus promoter used to drive expression of YFP, PLCϵ wild type, PLCϵH1460L, PLCϵΔCDC25, or PLCϵK2150E. For wild type and domain mutant PLCϵ adenoviruses, a second murine cytomegalovirus promoter was used to drive the expression of YFP. Adult AVM were isolated and adhered to laminin-coated coverslips for 2-h pre-infection. Plating media were removed and replaced with fresh media containing 300 multiplicity of infection of YFP control, wild type PLCϵ, or PLCϵ domain mutant adenovirus. After 2 h, the virus was removed and fresh media were added to the cells. The appearance of YFP fluorescence was used to determine the percentage of cells transduced at 24 h post-infection. PLC message was measured by semiquantitative PCR and protein was detected by Western blotting. PCR—For detection of PLCϵ mRNA in PLCϵ–/– AVMs transduced with either wild type or domain mutant PLCϵ adenovirus constructs, total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturers recommendations. The Superscript III RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) was used with 100 ng of total RNA template for reverse transcriptase-PCR with mouse PLCϵ primers 5′-ACCCTGCGGTAAATGTTCTG-3′ and 5′-ATGTGAATTCCGTGCTACCC-3′ to yield a 300-bp product. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers 5′-CAACGGGAAGCCCATCACCAT-3′ and 5′-CCTTGGCAGCACCAGTGGATGC-3′ yielding a 350-bp product was used as control. Reverse transcriptase was performed for 30 min at 42 °C followed by incubation at 94 °C for 2 min. The PCR parameters were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 45 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The number of PCR cycles was 30 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 35 for PLCϵ. Electrically Evoked Ca2+ Transients—Electrically evoked Ca2+ transients were measured as previously described (10Wang H. Oestreich E.A. Maekawa N. Bullard T.A. Vikstrom K.L. Dirksen R.T. Kelley G.G.

For each experiment, data were collected in the absence of agonist for 5–15 cells to determine naïve Ca2+ transient amplitude. 1 μm Isoproterenol and 10 μm cpTOME were prepared in control Ringer solution (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and locally perfused for 20 s followed by 60 s of electrical stimulation (20 ms, 8 V, 0.5–1 Hz, 60 s) in the continued presence of agonist. Pharmacological Inhibition of PKC, IP3 Receptors, and CamKII—To determine the effect of PKC inhibition on electrically evoked Ca2+ transient amplitude, cells were pre-treated for 5 min with 1 μm bisindolylmaleimide-1 (BIM) (Calbiochem), a broad specificity PKC inhibitor, followed by constant perfusion of BIM in the presence of 1 μm Iso or 10 μm 8-4-(chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′, 5′-monophosphate (cpTOME). For IP3 receptor inhibition, cells were pretreated with 20 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) for 5 min followed by constant perfusion of 2-APB in the presence of 1 μm Iso. For CamKII inhibition, cells were pretreated with 1 μm KN93 (or inactive KN92) for 30 min followed by constant perfusion of KN93 in the presence of 1 μm Iso or 10 μm cpTOME. PKC Translocation—AVM were isolated as described and plated at a density of 50,000 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish in serum-free minimal essential medium culture supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 μm blebbistatin. After 2 h, the media were changed to remove dead cells and debris. Cells were treated with 1 μm Iso for 30 s or 10 μm cpTOME for 3 min in a 37 °C incubator. Following treatment, dishes were placed immediately on ice and media and agonist were removed. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were scraped into a lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 μm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μm NaVO4, and protease inhibitors) and probe sonicated. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to pellet the membrane fraction. The membrane pellet was washed two times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and then re-suspended in sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol (1.42 m), and 0.25% bromphenol blue). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for specific PKC isoforms. PKCϵ and PKCα antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) was used at 1:1000. PKC siRNA—PKCϵ-specific and CY3-labeled negative control siRNAs (Ambion) were reconstituted at 100 pm. Wild type AVM were isolated as before and media were changed prior to transfection. For each siRNA, 600 pmol was added to 600 μl of Opti-MEM. In a separate tube, 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was added to 600 μl of Opti-MEM. After 5 min, siRNA and Lipofectamine tubes were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The 200 pmol of the siRNA mixture was then added to each 35 mm dish of AVM. Efficiency of transfection was determined by fluorescence microscopy of AVM transfected with CY3-labeled negative control siRNA. Cells transfected with PKCϵ-specific siRNA or negative control siRNA were harvested in sample buffer at 24, 36, or 48 h post-transfection. Knockdown of PKCϵ protein was determined by quantitative Western blotting. Western Blotting Phosphorylation Analysis—Phospho-Thr286 CamKII (1:1000) and total CamKII specific (1:1000) antibodies were from Santa Cruz, Phospho-Thr17 PLB (1:6000), Phospho-Ser16 PLB (1:6000), and total PLB (1:6000) antibodies were from Badrilla. Phospho-Ser2815 RyR2 antibody (1:2000) was kindly provided by Xander Wherens, Baylor College of Medicine, and total RyR2 antibody (1:2000) was from Affinity Bioreagents. Perforated Patch Clamp—Briefly, individual AVM adhered to laminin-coated dishes were preloaded with 5 μm fluo-4 AM for 30 min at 37 °C in a Ringer solution. Myocytes were then washed 2 times with an external Ca2+ current recording solution containing: 140 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.005 mm blebbistatin, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Patch clamp electrodes had a pipette resistance of 1–2 megohms when backfilled with internal solution containing: 135 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Ca2+ currents and transients were elicited using 200-ms test pulses from –50 to +70 mV in 10-mV increments delivered at 10-s intervals (0.1 Hz). Peak L-type Ca2+ current magnitude was normalized to total cell capacitance (pA/pF), plotted as a function of membrane potential (Vm), and fitted according to Equation 1, I=Gmax×(Vm−Vrev)/(1+exp[(VG1/2−Vm)kG])(Eq. 1) where Gmax is the maximal L-channel conductance, Vm is the test potential, VG1/2 is the voltage of half-maximal activation of Gmax, Vrev is the extrapolated reversal potential, and kG is a slope factor. The kinetics of Ca2+ current inactivation was described by fitting the inactivation phase to the following single exponential function using Equation 2, I(t)=A[exp(−t/τinact)]+C(Eq. 2) where I(t) is the current at time t after the depolarization, A is the amplitude of the inactivating component of current, τinact is the time constant of inactivation, and C represents the steady-state non-inactivating component of current. Ca2+ transients recorded during each test pulse were expressed as ΔF/F, where F represents baseline fluorescence and ΔF represents the fluorescence change from baseline. Rap and Ras Activation—Hearts were excised from 4–6-month-old PLCϵ+/+ or PLCϵ–/– mice, cannulated through the aorta, perfused in the presence or absence of 1 μm isoproterenol for 10 min, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Heart lysates were prepared by Polytron in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 in 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. 1 mg of heart lysate was incubated with GST-tagged fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 788–884 of human RalGDS-Rap-GTP binding domain or 1–149 of human Raf-1-Ras GTP binding domain bound to glutathione-agarose in heart lysis buffer. Following incubation, beads were harvested by centrifugation, the supernatant removed, and beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer. After washing, beads were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 4× SDS-sample buffer, resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Statistics—Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student’s t test and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. To determine the relative roles of PLCϵ-RapGEF and PLC activities in the regulation of cardiac Ca2+ handling, we transduced freshly isolated PLCϵ–/– myocytes with adenoviruses directing expression of either wild type PLCϵ or mutants of PLCϵ previously shown to eliminate PLC hydrolytic activity (PLCϵH1460L) (3Lopez I. Mak E.C. Ding J. Hamm H.E. Lomasney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), RapGEF activity (PLCϵΔCDC25), or Rap (and other small GTPases) binding to the RA2 domain (PLCϵK2150E) (1Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Based on PCR analysis of PLCϵ transcripts, all constructs were expressed to similar levels 24 h after transduction (Fig. 1B). Western blots of extracts from AVM infected with the PLCϵ mutant viruses indicate that the mutations do not affect expression of PLCϵ (Fig. 1C). Electrically evoked Ca2+ transients in transduced myocytes were then assessed in the presence or absence of either the βAR agonist isoproterenol (1 μm) or the direct Epac activator cpTOME (10 μm). As previously observed (12Oestreich E.A. Wang H. Malik S. Kaproth-Joslin K.A. Blaxall B.C. Kelley G.G. Dirksen R.T. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5488-5495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), isoproterenol-dependent enhancement of electrically evoked Ca2+ release was significantly increased 24 h after transduction of wild type PLCϵ in PLCϵ–/– AVM (Fig. 1D). Wild type PLCϵ expression also restored the 2-fold increase in evoked Ca2+ transient amplitude in response to Epac activation with cpTOME (Fig. 1E). In contrast, PLCϵ–/– AVM transduced with either PLCϵH1460L or PLCϵK2150E failed to respond to cpTOME and showed no increase in isoproterenol responsiveness compared with YFP control (Fig. 1, C–E) (supplemental Fig. S1). These results confirm that direct stimulation of PLCϵ hydrolytic activity by binding of a Ras family GTPase (likely Rap1) to the PLCϵ RA2 domain is required for maximal βAR-mediated increases in electrically evoked SR Ca2+ release. PLCϵ–/– AVM transduced with PLCϵΔCDC25, the RapGEF-deficient PLCϵ mutant, failed to exhibit increased responsiveness to either isoproterenol or cpTOME (Fig. 1, D and E) (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that PLCϵ-RapGEF activity is also required for the proper execution of the Epac/PLCϵ pathway during βAR-mediated regulation of SR Ca2+ release. We have previously shown that the Rap GEF deletion, PLCϵΔCDC25, does not significantly affect intrinsic PIP2 hydrolysis activity (9Citro S. Malik S. Oestreich E.A. Radeff-Huang J. Kelley G.G. Smrcka A.V. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 15543-15548Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The inability of a RapGEF-deficient mutant of PLCϵ to rescue cpTOME and maximal isoproterenol-stimulated enhancement of CICR in PLCϵ–/– AVM suggests that Rap activation downstream of βAR stimulation is at least partially dependent on PLCϵ. Lysates prepared from control and Iso-perfused hearts of PLCϵ–/– or PLCϵ+/+ mice were analyzed for activated Rap (RapGTP) by pulldown with GST-RalGDS and activated Ras (RasGTP) by pulldown with GST-Raf-1-RBD. A significant increase in active Rap over basal levels was observed in lysates from Iso-treated PLCϵ+/+ myocytes (Fig. 2, left). In lysates prepared from PLCϵ–/– mice, detectable Rap activation was not observed under either basal or Iso-treated conditions (Fig. 2, right). On the other hand, similar levels of Ras activation were observed under basal and Iso-treated conditions in hearts from both PLCϵ+/+ and PLCϵ–/– mice. Total Rap and Ras levels were identical between PLCϵ–/– and wild type heart lysates. Together, these results are consistent with previous in vitro findings that PLCϵ acts specifically as a GEF for Rap, but not Ras (2Jin T.G. Satoh T. Liao Y. Song C. Gao X. Kariya K. Hu C.D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30301-30307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 results in generation of IP3 and diacylglycerol and the subsequent activation of Ca2+ release through IP3 receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and/or PKC activation, respectively. A definitive role for IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in EC coupling in cardiac myocytes has not been identified despite intensive investigation (14Woodcock E.A. Matkovich S.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 107: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Type 2 IP3 receptors are the predominant IP3R isoform present in the heart. Analysis of type 2 IP3R knock-out mice indicates that the type 2 IP3 receptor is not required for βAR enhancement of Ca2+ release in atrial cardiac myocytes, but is important for endothelin-dependent regulation of Ca2+ release (15Li X. Zima A.V. Sheikh F. Blatter L.A. Chen J. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To assess the potential role of IP3 in our cells, we compared electrically evoked Ca2+ after treatment with the IP3 receptor inhibitor, 2-APB (20 μm). 2-APB treatment did not alter either the Iso (Fig. 3A) or cpTOME (data not shown) responsiveness, supporting conclusions of previous studies that IP3 receptors do not directly contribute to Iso-dependent enhancement of CICR. To test for PKC involvement in the βAR and Epac responses, electrically evoked Ca2+ transients in the presence or absence of isoproterenol were compared in AVM pretreated with 1 μm BIM, a broad specificity PKC inhibitor. BIM treatment significantly inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated enhancement of SR-Ca2+ release in wild type AVM (Fig. 3B, left). In addition, BIM treatment abolished the increase in electrically evoked Ca2+ transient amplitude observed following direct activation of Epac with cpTOME (Fig. 3C). However, BIM treatment did not alter Iso stimulation of electrically evoked Ca2+ transients in PLCϵ–/– myocytes (Fig. 3B, right) or baseline evoked transients (data not shown). These results indicate that the effects of BIM are specific to the PLCϵ-dependent pathway downstream of βAR stimulation and implicate PKC activation in this pathway. There are 11 distinct isoforms of PKC, four of which are consistently detected in cardiac myocytes: α, βII, δ, and ϵ (16Dorn II, G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). To determine whether a specific isoform of PKC is activated downstream of PLCϵ, we monitored translocation of specific PKC isoforms to the particulate fraction following treatment of freshly isolated PLCϵ+/+ and PLCϵ–/– cardiac myocytes with either isoproterenol or cpTOME. Western blot analysis of the particulate fraction of wild type cardiac myocytes revealed a specific increase in PKCϵ in the membrane fraction in response to both isoproterenol and cpTOME treatment relative to nontreated control (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PKCα did not translocate to the membrane fraction in response to isoproterenol. In PLCϵ–/– AVM, neither isoproterenol nor cpTOME triggered translocation of PKCϵ to the membrane (if anything a small decrease in PKCϵ at the membrane was observed), placing PKCϵ downstream of the βAR/Epac/Rap/PLCϵ pathway. To further test the role of PKCϵ downstream of the Epac/Rap/PLCϵ pathway, wild type AVM were transfected with either PKCϵ-specific siRNA or a CY3-labeled negative control siRNA. Transfection efficiency was nearly 100% (supplemental Fig. S2) and Western blot analysis revealed that PKCϵ (but not PKCα) protein levels were knocked down by at least 95% at 36 h post-transfection (Fig. 4B). PKCϵ protein levels were not substantially decreased in cells transfected with the negative control siRNA at all time points monitored (24, 36, and 48 h). Electrically evoked Ca2+ transients were monitored 36 h after transfection of wild type AVM with either PKCϵ or negative control siRNAs. Baseline electrically evoked Ca2+ transients were not different between control and PKCϵ siRNA-treated AVM. On the other hand, peak Ca2+ transient amplitude in the presence of isoproterenol was significantly inhibited and cpTOME responses abolished (Fig. 4C) in AVM treated with PKCϵ siRNA. These data are consistent with results obtained following pharmacological PKC inhibition with BIM (Fig. 3, B and C) and Iso/cpTOME-dependent PKCϵ membrane translocation (Fig. 4A), indicating that PKC acts downstream of PLCϵ and specifically implicates PKCϵ as the relevant PKC isoform involved. A recent report demonstrated that CamKII is activated following Epac stimulation with cpTOME in rat cardiac myocytes, however, the mechanism for CamKII activation by Epac was not determined (17Pereira L. Metrich M. Fernandez-Velasco M. Lucas A. Leroy J. Perrier R. Morel E. Fischmeister R. Richard S. Benitah J.P. Lezoualc'h F. Gomez A.M. J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). PKC has also been shown to activate CamKII in rat ventricular myocytes (18O-Uchi J. Komukai K. Kusakari Y. Obata T. Hongo K. Sasaki H. Kurihara S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9400-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and CamKII is directly phosphorylated at Thr286 by PKC in vitro (19Waxham M.N. Aronowski J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined if CamKII activation is required for Iso- and Epac-dependent enhancement of CICR, and if it is downstream of PKC. Iso- and cpTOME-induced enhancement of electrically evoked Ca2+ transients in wild type AVM were determined in the absence and presence of KN93, a specific CamKII inhibitor. KN93, but not the control compound KN92, attenuated Iso-induced enhancement of evoked release (Fig. 5A) and completely blocked cpTOME-induced enhancement (Fig. 5B). Co-treatment with BIM and KN93 did not further diminish the response to isoproterenol relative to treatment with either compound alone (data not shown). Additionally, KN93 had no effect on the Iso response in PLCϵ–/– AVM (Fig. 5A) or on baseline evoked transients (data not shown), supporting specific involvement of CamKII in the PLCϵ-dependent pathway. To determine whether CamKII activation was dependent on PKC, wild type cardiac myocytes were treated with either isoproterenol or cpTOME alone or in the presence of BIM and CamKII phosphorylation at Thr286 was measured by Western blotting (Fig. 5C). Both isoproterenol and cpTOME treatment increased CamKII phosphorylation at Thr286 relative to nontreated control. The cpTOME-dependent increase was blocked in the presence of BIM and the Iso-dependent increase was partially blocked by BIM. These data support the conclusion that the Epac/PLCϵ pathway can control CamKII activation in a PKCϵ-dependent, Ca2+-independent manner. That the Iso-dependent increase in phosphorylation was only partially blocked suggests that there are multiple mechanisms for CamKII activation downstream of Iso, one o"

Here we investigate the function of SirT1 in human chondrocytes derived from osteoarthritic patients. Elevation of SirT1 protein levels or activity in these chondrocytes led to a dramatic increase in cartilage-specific gene expression, whereas a reduction in SirT1 levels or activity significantly lowered cartilage gene expression. SirT1 associated with the cartilage-specific transcription factor Sox9, enhancing transcription from the collagen 2(α1) promoter in a Sox9-dependent fashion. Consistent with this association, SirT1 was targeted to the collagen 2(α1) enhancer and promoter, which in turn recruited the coactivators GCN5, PGC1α, and p300. This led to elevated marks of active chromatin within the promoter; that is, acetylated histone K9/K14 and histone H4K5 as well as trimethylated histone H3K4. Finally, alterations in the NAD salvage pathway enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase led to changes in NAD levels, SirT activity, and cartilage-specific gene expression in human chondrocytes. SirT1, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, and NAD may, therefore, provide a positive function in human cartilage by elevating expression of genes encoding cartilage extracellular matrix.

SirT1, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, and NAD may, therefore, provide a positive function in human cartilage by elevating expression of genes encoding cartilage extracellular matrix. Transcriptional control over cartilage-specific gene expression plays a critical role in maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype (1Lefebvre V. Smits P. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2005; 75: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Much effort has, therefore, gone into the characterization of chondrocyte-specific transcription factors such as Sox9, -5, and -6 (28Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that other factors such as chromatin-modifying enzymes play important roles in controlling cartilage-specific gene expression. Chromatin-modifying enzymes, which include the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 2The abbreviations used are: HAThistone acetyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseNAMnicotinamideqPCRquantitative PCRNAMPTnicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseLSDleast significant differenceOAosteoarthriticIPimmunoprecipitate 2The abbreviations used are: HAThistone acetyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseNAMnicotinamideqPCRquantitative PCRNAMPTnicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseLSDleast significant differenceOAosteoarthriticIPimmunoprecipitate and the histone deacetylases (HDACs) can act as potent transcriptional coactivators and corepressors, respectively, for a variety of genes (2Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). HATs modify the core histones through acetylation of lysine residues, thereby relaxing chromatin for transcription initiation and elongation (3Hasan S. Hottiger M.O. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HDACs remove the acetyl groups, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (4Ruijter A. Gennip A. Caron H.N. Kemp S. Kuilenburg A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Additionally, acetylation and deacetylation of transcription factors provide another level of regulation over gene expression (2Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar).In some contexts HDACs are more sensitive to environmental or developmental cues than the HATs and can provide a regulatory role in transcription. In this regard, HDACs have been demonstrated to control both cell proliferation and differentiation through the deacetylation of transcription factors, cytoplasmic proteins, and histones (5Johnstone R.W. Licht J.D. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 13-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 6McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although HDACs are critically involved in diverse biological processes, their function in chondrocyte biology and cartilage diseases have only recently been explored. Recent work indicates that inhibition of HDACs reduces the expression of matrix metalloproteinase in chondrocytes and fibroblasts (7Young D.A. Lakey R.L. Pennington C.J. Jones D. Kevorkian L. Edwards D.R. Cawston T.E. Clark I.M. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2005; 7: 503-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, therefore, inhibits arthritis progression in animal models (8Chung Y.L. Lee M.Y.

Yamana J. Yamamura M. Ninomiya Y. Inoue H. Asahara H. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3365-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that HDAC4, a Class II enzyme, plays a critical role in the onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy during endochondral ossification (10Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzi C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2004; 119: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). It would appear then that HDACs regulate genes involved in both inflammation and chondrocyte differentiation. Given that there are more than 18 HDAC genes distributed in at least four different classes, it is likely that multiple HDACs will affect the growth, differentiation, and survival of chondrocytes via transcriptional regulation of cartilage-specific genes.Of particular interest with regard to cartilage biology are the NAD-dependent Class III HDACs comprised of SirT1–7. Within this group SirT1 has been extensively studied and is known to play a crucial part in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and organism longevity (11Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 12Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Class III HDACs yield nicotinamide (NAM) and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose from NAD in the process of deacetylation. NAM thereby becomes a potent feedback inhibitor of SirT1 by binding to a unique site within the enzyme (11Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 12Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). NAD can be generated from NADH via intracellular dehydrogenase reactions as well as by oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly, the NAD salvage pathway also plays a role in de novo production of NAD (13Terkeltaub R. Johnson K. Murphy A. Ghosh S. Mitochondrion. 2002; 1: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Through this pathway NAM regenerates NAD through the action of two salvage pathway enzymes, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyltransferase (14Rongvaux A. Andris F. Van Gool F. Leo O. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Yang H. Lavu S. Sinclair D.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2006; 41: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because NAMPT is known to have a rate-limiting affect on NAD production (16Revollo J.R. Körner A. Mills K.F. Satoh A. Wang T.

These salvage pathway enzymes have been known to extend cellular life span, likely through their indirect effect on SirT1 activity (15Yang H. Lavu S. Sinclair D.A. Exp.

Because nothing is known of the role SirT1, NAMPT, and NAD play in chondrocyte biology, we have explored their functions in chondrocytes derived from knee joints of osteoarthritic patients. The results obtained here show that SirT1 participates in the activation of cartilage-specific gene expression and is dependent on the NAD/NAMPT pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Cell Culture, and Transfections—Nicotinamide and resveratrol were purchased from Sigma.

Human chondrocytes were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), reduced serum media. 293 cells were transfected using ProFection calcium phosphate kit (Promega) and in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.Human chondrocytes were isolated from the knees of osteoarthritic patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, supplied by the National Disease Research Interchange, Philadelphia, PA. Isolation was carried out according to Derfoul et al. (39Derfoul A. Miyoshi A.D. Freeman D.E. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 646-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 10-cm2 tissue culture dishes at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/dish and were grown to confluence (passage 0 or P0). In our hands cartilage marker gene expression was maintained until about passage 4 at which time it declined. Thus, our experiments herein utilized chondrocytes up to passage 4 (P4). Monolayer cultures of human chondrocytes were maintained as previously described by Derfoul et al. (39Derfoul A. Miyoshi A.D. Freeman D.E. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 646-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).All transfection experiments were initiated on 50% confluent monolayer cultures. If not otherwise indicated, chondrocyte transfections were carried out using the Amaxa Nucleofector technology (Gaithersburg, MD) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.Plasmids, Retroviral Infection, and Selection of Cell Lines—The retroviral expression plasmids, pHanPuro, pHanPuro-SirT1, and pHanPuro-SirT1-M(H355Y) were gifts of Dr. Vittorio Sartorelli (24Fulco M.

Puromycin-resistant (1 μg/ml) colonies were pooled from each infection condition and used in the subsequent experiments.NAD Assay—The NAD levels were measured using a BioVision NAD assay kit according to manufacturers instructions (Biovision, Mountain View, CA). NAD levels were calculated according to the equivalent protein quantity (μg protein) per data point.SirT Activity Assay—SirT activity was determined using a BIOMOL assay (Plymouth Meeting, PA) was used according to manufacturers instructions, based on Borra et al. (41Borra M.T. Smith B.C. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17187-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 1 μm trichostatin A was added to the cell cultures 1 h before harvesting to block the class I, II, and IV HDACs. Whole cell extracts were then generated as described below with the addition of 1 μm trichostatin A. The extracts were added (15 μl) to an opaque multiwell plate with 1 μm trichostatin A and 1 mm acetylated Fluor-de-Lys substrate. As a negative control, 10 mm NAM was also added to some extracts. The extracts were then swirled for 20 min at room temperature, and the reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of a developer solution supplemented with 1 μm trichostatin A and 10 mm NAM (final concentrations). The plate was read after a 10-min incubation at room temperature using a multiwell fluorometer (excitation 360 nm, emission 460 nm). A standard curve was generated using a deacetylated substrate Fluor-de-Lys (ranging from 1 to 40 μm). Experimental values are presented as pmol of converted substrate/μg of protein/min. The negative controls (10 mm NAM) were subtracted from each treatment to give the final values.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analyses—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out utilizing the EZ-ChIP kit (Upstate Millipore, Boston, MA), according to the manufacturers guidelines. After ChIP, DNA was extracted using a Qiaquick spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR reactions were carried out using ProofStart PCR kit (Qiagen).RT-PCR Analysis—RNeasy RNA purification columns (Qiagen) were used to isolate RNA; 300 ng of RNA per reaction was subjected to a one-step semiquantitative RT-PCR procedure (Invitrogen). Gels supplemented with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide were subjected to densitometry using ImageJ Software. Values were normalized to GAPDH. Primer sequences and the predicted size of the PCR products are presented in supplementary Data (Table 1). RT-PCR was performed in triplicates on two experimental repetitions (n = 6).Real-time PCR reactions were carried out using 10 ng of cDNA and Syber Green mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), as previously described by Derfoul et al. (39Derfoul A. Miyoshi A.D. Freeman D.E. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 646-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses were performed using Bio-Rad iCycler software. Primers are specified in supplemental Table 1. For an additional control we tested each set of experiments for expression of nonlineage specific genes (collagen 1 (α1), fibronectin, NFκB (p65); supplemental Figs. A–H).Protein Analysis and Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein extracts and immunoblotting procedures were carried out according to Perkins et al. (42Perkins G.L. Derfoul A. Ast A. Hall D.J. Differentiation. 2005; 73: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytology are specified in supplemental Table 2.Immunohistochemical Analyses—Monolayer cells were cultured in 6-well plates, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and nonspecific antibody binding was blocked for 30 min in goat serum. They were then incubated with a 1:10 dilution of mouse anti-SirT1 primary antibody visualized using a broad-spectrum immunohistochemistry kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA).Statistical Analyses—Statistical analysis was obtained using one-way analysis of variance, assuming confidence levels of 95% (p < 0.05) to be statistically significant. The least significant difference (LSD) test was carried out to determine the differences between two equivalent treatments within a group, assuming confidence levels of 95% (p < 0.05). Error bars indicate the S.D. around the mean value of data point. The symbol a was used to express statistical significance between SirT1 and pHan, b was used for SirT1 and SirT1-M, and c was use for pHan and SirT1-M. All transfections in the Col2-luciferase assays were compared with DNA control, and statistical significance is indicated as *, LSD, p < 0.05. The asterisk (*) was also used to express statistical significance in equivalent SirT1 transient transfection, reservatrol-treated cells, NAM-treated cells, and siRNA transfection comparisons (LSD, p < 0.05).The immunoblots, ChIP, and co-immunoprecipitation assays represent two repetitions from two distinct cell lines or cell sources (n = 4). The SirT activity and luciferase assays were carried out in triplicate using 2 distinct cell lines generated from different transfections or cell sources (n = 6). The scanned RT-PCR presented in Figs. 1 and 2 were generated from 3 runs of 2 distinct cell lines (n = 6). Supporting quantitative PCR (qPCR) evidence for Figs. 1 and 2 are illustrated in the supplemental data for the equivalent experiments (n = 6, triplicates of two cell lines/treatment).FIGURE 2Transient changes in SirT1 levels or activity alters cartilage gene expression. OA human chondrocytes (P0) were transiently transfected with a SirT1 expression plasmid. Extracts generated at 3 days post-transfection were used in immunoblot analysis (A) or SirT activity assays (B). C, RNA isolated from the transfected cells in A was used in RT-PCR assays with the indicated human primers. The graphs show relative induction of gene expression (compared with control). D, P0 and P1 OA chondrocytes were treated with resveratrol (1 μm) for 3 days at which time RNA was isolated and used in RT-PCR reactions with the indicated human primers. E, OA chondrocytes (P0) were transiently transfected with a SirT1 siRNA, and extracts were isolated and used in immunoblots for SirT1 and GAPDH (upper panel) or for assessment of SirT activity (lower panel). CTL, control. F, RNA was isolated from the cells expressing the SirT1siRNA in E which was used in RT-PCR reactions with the indicated human primers. G, OA chondrocytes were treated with NAM (10 mm) for 3 days at which time total RNA was isolated and used RT-PCR reactions with the indicated human primers. The graphs in F and G show relative repression of gene expression. The error bars in the graphs indicate the S.D., and the statistical significance is indicated by an asterisk (*) (LSD, p < 0.05). The displayed immunoblots are representative of four experiments. RT-PCR was performed in triplicate for two experimental repetitions (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSElevation of SirT1 Positively Affects Cartilage Gene Expression—To test the hypothesis that cartilage-specific gene expression in chondrocytes is affected by SirT1, osteoarthritic (OA) human chondrocytes (P0-P2) were stably infected with a SirT1 expressing retrovirus. The vectors expressed either wild-type SirT1 or an enzymatically inactive mutant SirT1-M (SirT1H355Y). The vector alone (pHan) was used as a control. Immunohistochemistry assays (Fig. 1A) as well as immunoblot assays (Fig. 1B) confirmed SirT1 and SirT1-M overexpression and nuclear localization. As a test for SirT1 activity, the total levels of AcH3K9, a known substrate for SirT1 (18Imai S.I. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar), were measured. From Fig. 1C it appears that the SirT1-expressing cells possess reduced AcH3K9 (∼3-fold) when compared with the SirT1-Mut and control cell lines. H3K9 dimethylation and tubulin, which served as a control, were unaffected in all cell lines. The graph in Fig. 1D indicates a significant increase of SirT activity in cells expressing wild type SirT1 compared with SirT1-M and pHan (LSD, p < 0.05, 2.5-fold). These data indicate that the ectopic SirT1 is active within these chondrocytes. Interestingly, cells expressing SirT1-M displayed lower SirT activity compared with control, suggesting that it acts in a dominant/negative way as previously described (19Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S.I. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar, 20Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Eaton E.N. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar).We next examined the effects of SirT1 on cartilage-specific gene expression. RNA was harvested and used in RT-PCR reactions for markers of cartilage genes (aggrecan, collagen 2a(α1) and 2b(α1), collagen 9(α1), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)). Surprisingly, SirT1-expressing cells exhibited significantly higher expression values than the control cells (LSD, p < 0.05; Fig. 1E). When the same analyses were performed for SirT1-M-expressing cells, it was clear that cartilage gene expression was significantly repressed as compared with the control cells (LSD, p < 0.05; Fig. 1F). In all cell lines GAPDH remained unaffected. As additional controls, we assessed expression of the nonlineage-specific genes collagen 1(α1), fibronectin, and NFκB (p65) and found no changes in RNA levels between pHan, SirT1, and SirT1M cell lines (supplemental Figs. A and B). Additionally, qPCR was carried out on collagen 2a(α1), collagen 2b(α1), and aggrecan in the stably transfected cell lines (supplementary Figs. I and J). These data show collagen 2a(α1), collagen 2b(α1), and aggrecan to be induced by SirT1 and repressed by SirT1-M.To confirm that SirT1 had a positive effect on cartilage gene expression, transient expression experiments and drug treatments were also performed in low passage chondrocytes. A SirT1 expression vector was transiently expressed in chondrocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, SirT1 protein levels and SirT activity were markedly elevated in the transfected chondrocytes. Furthermore, the ectopically expressed SirT1 is completely nuclear as assessed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). Fig. 2C shows significantly higher gene expression values for the indicated genes in SirT1-expressing cells compared with the pcDNA control (LSD, p < 0.05). qPCR analysis for transiently transfected cells showed that collagen 2a(α1), collagen 2b(α1), and aggrecan were up-regulated by SirT1 (supplemental Fig. K). In a separate line of experiments, the chemical resveratrol (1 μm) was added to chondrocytes to directly activate SirT1 (19Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S.I. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, this also resulted in the up-regulation of cartilage gene expression. qPCR analysis showed that aggrecan, collagen 2a(α1), collagen 2b(α1), and aggrecan were up-regulated by resveratrol (supplemental Fig. L). Taken together, these results show that by either transient overexpression or activation of SirT1, cartilage gene expression is enhanced in human chondrocytes. For an additional control we tested expression of the non-lineage specific genes collagen 1(α1), fibronectin, and NFκB (p65) in response to SirT1 transient transfection and resveratrol treatment. No effect was found on gene expression (supplemental Figs. C and F, respectively).Inhibition of SirT1 Negatively Affects Cartilage Gene Expression—To perform the opposite of the above experiments, a SirT1 siRNA was transfected into chondrocytes to lower SirT1 protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2E, SirT1 levels and activity dropped by 3-fold after siRNA transfection. Fig. 2F shows that reducing SirT1 protein levels significantly lowered cartilage-specific gene expression (LSD, p < 0.05). qPCR analysis showed that SirT1 siRNA treatment repressed collagen 2(α1) and aggrecan (supplemental Fig. M). As a corollary to the above experiments, chondrocytes were also treated with NAM (10 mm), which is a direct feedback inhibitor of SirT1 (11Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 12Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Fig. 2G shows a clear reduction in cartilage gene expression in NAM-treated cells (LSD, p < 0.05). qPCR confirmed that NAM repressed expression of collagen 2(α1) and aggrecan in chondrocytes (supplemental Fig. M). In total these data indicate that reducing SirT1 levels or activity had a profound negative effect on cartilage gene expression. Furthermore, inspection of nonlineage-specific genes collagen 1(α1), fibronectin, and NFκB (p65) in SirT1 siRNA- and NAM-treated cells found no effect on gene expression (supplemental Figs. D and E, respectively) with the exception that SirT1 SiRNA-treated cells suppressed p65 expression.SirT1 Interacts with Sox9 and Enhances Transcription from the Collagen 2(α1) Promoter—The data above show that SirT1 positively regulates cartilage gene expression. Because it is well established that expression of many cartilage genes is regulated by the transcription factor Sox9 (1Lefebvre V. Smits P. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2005; 75: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that SirT1 may interact with Sox9, thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity, possibly through deacetylation. To first determine whether Sox9 was acetylated, it was expressed in 293 cells (Fig. 3A, left panel) and in human chondrocytes derived from OA patients (Fig. 3A, right panel). It was then immunoprecipitated (IP) with a Sox9-specific antibody and then immunoblotted in duplicate lanes. Half the blot was incubated with a Sox9 antibody, and the other half was incubated with an acetyl-lysine-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, Sox9 is recognized by the acetyl-lysine antibody, indicating it is an acetylated protein.FIGURE 3SirT1 associates with Sox9, modulates its acetylation status, and enhances transcription from the collagen 2(α1) promoter. A, 293 cells and human P0 OA chondrocytes were transfected with the pcDNA or Sox9 expression plasmids. Extracts were generated and used in immunoprecipitations with a Sox9 antibody. The IPs were immunoblotted (IB) in duplicate lanes, and the blots were separated and probed with either a Sox9 antibody or an acetyl-lysine-specific antibody. B, 293 cells were transfected with Sox9, SirT1, or both the Sox9 and SirT1 expression plasmids. Extracts were generated and used in IP reactions with either a Sox9 or SirT1 antibody. Upper panels, the IPs were immunoblotted with either a Sox9, SirT1, or acetyl-lysine-specific antibody as indicated. Lower panels, control immunoblots showing the levels of SirT1 and Sox9 along with GAPDH in the transfected extracts. C, 293 cells were transfected with Sox9, SirT1, or pcDNA. The upper panel shows an IP for Sox9 followed by an immunoblot for Sox9 as well as an IP for SirT1 followed by an immunoblot for SirT1. Middle panel, the SirT1 and Sox9 IPs were incubated at room temperature for 3 h with either NAD or with NAM (1 mm) and then electrophoresed and blotted with either acetyl-lysine- or Sox9-specific antibodies. The displayed immunoblots are representatives of four experiments. Right panel, SirT1 consensus deacetylation site (11Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) is compared with a putative site for deacetylation within Sox9 (amino acids 242–254). This site is similar to that within histones H3(K19 and K14) and H4(K16). D, an outline of the collagen 2(α1)-promoter/enhancer luciferase construct utilized in the reporter assay.

Moreover, processing body form and body action relies on distinct neural substrates. Although brain lesion studies show specific face processing deficits, neuropsychological evidence for defective recognition of nonfacial body parts is lacking. By combining psychophysics studies with lesion-mapping techniques, we found that lesions of ventromedial, occipitotemporal areas induce face and body recognition deficits while lesions involving extrastriate body area seem causatively associated with impaired recognition of body but not of face and object stimuli. We also found that body form and body action recognition deficits can be double dissociated and are causatively associated with lesions to extrastriate body area and ventral premotor cortex, respectively. Our study reports two category-specific visual deficits, called body form and body action agnosia, and highlights their neural underpinnings."

Here, we identify Bhlhb5, a transcription factor expressed in layers II–V, as a postmitotic regulator of area identity. Bhlhb5 is initially expressed in a high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradient that transforms into a sharp border between sensory and rostral motor cortices. Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit aberrant expression of area-specific genes and structural organization in the somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. In somatosensory cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice display postsynaptic disorganization of vibrissal barrels. In caudal motor cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit anomalous differentiation of corticospinal motor neurons, accompanied by failure of corticospinal tract formation. Together, these results demonstrate Bhlhb5's function as an area-specific transcription factor that regulates the postmitotic acquisition of area identities and elucidate the genetic hierarchy between progenitors and postmitotic neurons driving neocortical arealization.

Together, these results demonstrate Bhlhb5's function as an area-specific transcription factor that regulates the postmitotic acquisition of area identities and elucidate the genetic hierarchy between progenitors and postmitotic neurons driving neocortical arealization. The tangential plane of the six layered mammalian neocortex is comprised of areas that process cognitive, motor, and sensory information. Neocortical areas are characterized by unique molecular profiles, architecture, and connectivity and are delineated by sharp boundaries (O'Leary and Nakagawa, 2002O'Leary D.D. Nakagawa Y. Patterning centers, regulatory genes and extrinsic mechanisms controlling arealization of the neocortex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Areal identities are specified in neocortical progenitors by complex interactions between signaling molecules and transcription factors (TFs). For example, the signaling molecule FGF8, secreted by the anterior neural ridge, represses the homeodomain TF Emx2 and the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF1 anteriorly, and probably generates their high caudal to low rostral gradients in neocortical progenitors (Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001Fukuchi-Shimogori T.

Targeted deletion of the caudomedially enriched Emx2 results in expansion of rostrolateral areas and contraction of caudomedial areas. A converse phenotype is observed in mice overexpressing Emx2 or null for Pax6, a paired-box TF expressed in a high rostrolateral to low caudomedial gradient (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop K.M.

Cortex-specific deletion of the caudolaterally enriched COUP-TF1 results in dramatic expansion of rostral areas in the caudal sensory cortex (Armentano et al., 2007Armentano M. Chou S.J. Tomassy G.S.

Thus, gradients of TFs along the rostrocaudal and mediolateral axes specify area/positional information in progenitors that is then inherited by postmitotic progeny as they migrate radially out of the ventricular zone (VZ). This positional information is manifested as area-specific molecular, anatomical, and functional features in postmitotic neurons (Grove and Fukuchi-Shimogori, 2003Grove E.A. Fukuchi-Shimogori T.

This deep and important work on areal specification of progenitors motivates a fundamental question: what are the TFs in postmitotic neurons that regulate the acquisition, manifestation, or execution of areal identities specified in progenitors by TFs such as Emx2 (Mallamaci and Stoykova, 2006Mallamaci A.

In other words, what are the postmitotic transcriptional regulators that control precise differentiation of diverse neuron populations within distinct neocortical areas? While Emx2 and Pax6 have progenitor-restricted expression (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop K.M. Goudreau G. O'Leary D.D.

Several candidates, such as Emx1 and members of the Ten_m family, exhibit differential areal expression in the cortical plate, but either do not regulate, or have undemonstrated roles, in arealization (Bishop et al., 2002Bishop K.M.

Here, we identify Bhlhb5 as a postmitotically expressed TF that functions centrally in regulation and acquisition of areal identity in developing neurons of layers II–V in somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. Bhlhb5 is a member of the Olig subfamily of the spatiotemporally restricted Class B basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs (Bertrand et al., 2002Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Proneural genes and the specification of neural cell types.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). It is postulated to be a transrepressor, and is implicated in retinogenesis (Feng et al., 2006Feng L. Xie X. Joshi P.S. Yang Z. Shibasaki K. Chow R.L. Gan L.

Bhlhb5 has not been previously identified as having a function in corticogenesis. Here, we demonstrate the postmitotic expression of Bhlhb5 selectively in glutamatergic projection neurons of neocortical layers II–V. Midway through cortical neurogenesis, Bhlhb5 expression in the murine cortical plate parallels the high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradient of Emx2 in progenitors. By birth, Bhlhb5 is expressed in the entire sensory cortex, thereby defining a sharp border between sensory and rostral motor cortices. We thus hypothesized that Bhlhb5 might either suppress rostral areal identities or preferentially impart sensory identities within the sensory domain in layers II–V. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed area-specific markers and input-output connectivity in Bhlhb5 null mice. We observe a highly stereotypical disruption of gene expression patterns, with ectopic, absent, or reduced expression of multiple area-specific genes in the somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. There is also significant disruption of the cytoarchitectonic somatosensory cortical barrels, and aberrant differentiation of caudal corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) accompanied by failure of corticospinal tract formation, additionally notable in light of human BHLHB5's mapping to a locus associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (Hentati et al., 1994Hentati A. Pericak-Vance M.A. Hung W.Y. Belal S. Laing N. Boustany R.M. Hentati F. Ben Hamida M. Siddique T.

Functional and structural characterization of the human gene BHLHB5, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor.Genomics. 2002; 80: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Bhlhb5 is required for acquisition of area-specific properties by postmitotic neurons of the somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. Immunocytochemistry reveals onset of Bhlhb5 expression in the nascent cortical plate of the dorsal telencephalon at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) (Figure 1A). During peak production of deep layer neurons between E12.5 and E13.5, Bhlhb5 is restricted to postmigrational neurons, with no expression in the proliferative ventricular zone (VZ) or in migrating neurons (Figures 1A and 1B). Between E15.5 and E17.5, when superficial layer neurons are generated, Bhlhb5 is expressed strongly in the cortical plate and weakly in presumptive migrating neurons and in the subventricular zone (SVZ; Figures 1C, 1D, and see Figures S1A available online). Bhlhb5 does not colocalize with proliferating progenitors in S or M phase in either the VZ or the SVZ (Figures 1K, 1L, and S1B) and is restricted to postmitotic glutamatergic projection neurons during neurogenesis (Figures 1M, 1N, and S1C–S1I). Bhlhb5 is not expressed in cortical GABAergic interneurons (Figures 1O, S1J, and S1K) or their extracortical sites of genesis, the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (Figures S1L–S1N). Postnatally, Bhlhb5 begins to be downregulated at the junction of the cingulate cortex and neocortex (Figures 1E, 1G, and 1H); by postnatal day 4 (P4), downregulation well into the neocortex is observed anteriorly (Figure 1F) with the exception of the most superficial layer. Downregulation continues from medial to lateral, exhibiting a markedly reduced expression by P14 (Figures 1I and 1J). These results are in agreement with previously published regional Bhlhb5 expression analysis at the transcript level (Kim et al., 2002Kim M.H. Gunnersen J. Augustine C. Tan S.S. Region-specific expression of the helix-loop-helix gene BETA3 in developing and adult brains.Mech. Dev. 2002; 114: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We next evaluated the more precise laminar and cell type-specific expression of Bhlhb5 at P4 via triple immunolabeling with CTIP2, a TF that specifically labels all subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) including CSMN in layer V (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype-specific genes that control corticospinal motor neuron development in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 207-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), and TBR1, a TF enriched in layers II–III and in layer VI corticothalamic neurons (Hevner et al., 2001Hevner R.F. Shi L. Justice N. Hsueh Y. Sheng M. Smiga S. Bulfone A. Goffinet A.M. Campagnoni A.T. Rubenstein J.L. Tbr1 regulates differentiation of the preplate and layer 6.Neuron. 2001; 29: 353-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Using TBR1 and CTIP2 to delineate both laminar borders and SCPN identity, we find that Bhlhb5 is expressed in layers II, III, IV, and V and clearly colocalizes with CTIP2+ SCPN of layer V (Figures 2A–2D). Within layer VI, Bhlhb5 is expressed in only very rare scattered TBR1 negative neurons (Figure 2D). We next examined whether Bhlhb5 is expressed in the same populations earlier in development. During neurogenesis, TBR1 is restricted to layer VI and subplate (Hevner et al., 2001Hevner R.F. Shi L. Justice N. Hsueh Y. Sheng M. Smiga S. Bulfone A. Goffinet A.M. Campagnoni A.T. Rubenstein J.L. Tbr1 regulates differentiation of the preplate and layer 6.Neuron. 2001; 29: 353-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), and Bhlhb5 does not colocalize with the overwhelming majority of TBR1+ neurons at E13.5 and E15.5 (Figures 2E and 2F). These data indicate that there is essentially no Bhlhb5 expression in layer VI corticothalamic and subplate neurons. In contrast, many of the presumptive CSMN and other SCPN in developing layer V, identified by high level CTIP2 expression in the cortical plate (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J.

Bhlhb5 is also expressed in layers superficial to the CTIP2-expressing layer during development (Figure 2G). Bhlhb5 expression varies strikingly along the A-P axis; there is a precipitous decrease in expression in the rostral cortical plate (Figure 2I). To determine the dynamics of Bhlhb5 expression across all cortical areas, we performed β-galactosidase enzymatic reactions on whole mount brains obtained from Bhlhb5lacZ/+ mice (Figure S2A; Feng et al., 2006Feng L. Xie X. Joshi P.S. Yang Z. Shibasaki K. Chow R.L. Gan L. Requirement for Bhlhb5 in the specification of amacrine and cone bipolar subtypes in mouse retina.Development. 2006; 133: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Analysis of adjacent Bhlhb5lacZ/+ brain sections demonstrated that Bhlhb5-lacZ faithfully recapitulates endogenous Bhlhb5 expression at the mRNA and protein levels (Figures 2H–2J). X-Gal histochemistry at E12.5 reveals that Bhlhb5 expression is highest medially in the cingulate cortex with weak expression in the rest of the cortex (Figure 2K). At E15.5, Bhlhb5 is expressed in a high caudomedial to a low rostrolateral gradient that is strikingly similar to the Emx2 gradient in progenitors (Figure 2L). Between E15.5 and P0, Bhlhb5 expression increases laterally and the gradient gradually transforms into a sharp border between the presumptive rostral motor and sensory domains (Figures 2L–2N). During the first postnatal week, there is a further transformation from homogeneous expression across sensory cortex into discrete areas of high Bhlhb5 expression coincident with the primary sensory areas. At P4 and P7, Bhlhb5 is expressed in primary visual cortex (V1), primary auditory cortex (A1), and distinct primary somatosensory (S1) representations, including the vibrissal barrel field (Figures 2O and 2P). Thus, Bhlhb5 is unique as a TF in distinctly delineating the cortical map at the level of layer IV neurons. We employed an in vivo loss-of-function approach to investigate Bhlhb5's role in corticogenesis by crossing Bhlhb5lacZ/+ mice (henceforth referred to as heterozygotes) to obtain Bhlhb5lacZ/lacZ homozygous mutants (henceforth referred to as Bhlhb5 nulls) (Figure S2B). Due to deletion of the entire ORF, we did not expect or detect any Bhlhb5 protein via immunocytochemistry in Bhlhb5 nulls (Figure S2C). Heterozygotes are indistinguishable from wild-types, and Bhlhb5 nulls are born at Mendelian frequencies and survive into adulthood. At birth, Bhlhb5 nulls are similar to wild-type mice in size (WT n = 9; nulls n = 7; p = 0.57) but exhibit a 14% and a 40% reduction in bodyweight by P7 (WT n = 11; null n = 12; p < 0.01) and 1 month (WT n = 6; null n = 6; p < 0.01), respectively (Figure S2D and data not shown). While a 15% reduction in brain weight and 37% increase in brain weight to body weight ratio is observed at one month in Bhlhb5 nulls, these indices are no different from wild-type at P0 and P7. Nonetheless, Bhlhb5 null brains are slightly smaller in volume in the first postnatal week (Figures S5A–S5C′). We performed TUNEL staining on E17.5 and P5 wild-type and Bhlhb5 null brain sections to assess apoptotic cell death; this analysis showed no change in the number of TUNEL+ cells in Bhlhb5 nulls versus wild-types (data not shown). To evaluate the survival of Bhlhb5-expressing neurons, we performed X-Gal reactions on P5 heterozygous and Bhlhb5-null brain sections at comparative locations along the A-P axis. Bhlhb5-lacZ staining is highly similar in both groups (Figure S3A), with the exception of more intense staining in the nulls with two copies of lacZ, suggesting that the overwhelming majority of Bhlhb5-expressing neurons survive and migrate normally into the cortex in Bhlhb5 null mice. We also assessed cortical lamination by evaluating several lamina specific markers (Figures S3B–S3H). We observed a morphologically normal cortex with six distinct layers in Bhlhb5 nulls. However, there is a subtle and reproducible laminar abnormality in layer V of sensorimotor cortex, with compaction of its sublayers (Figures S3F–S3H). Thus, overall, Bhlhb5 does not appear to function substantially in cell survival and cortical lamination. The caudomedial high to rostrolateral low gradient of Bhlhb5 at E15.5 that transforms into a sharp border between the sensory and rostral motor cortices by P0 (Figures 2L–2N) leads to consideration of two hypothetical roles during neocortical arealization: (1) Bhlhb5 might suppress rostral motor identity in layers II–V of the sensory cortex or (2) Bhlhb5 might regulate the acquisition of sensory and caudal motor identities in layers II–V of these cortices. We first evaluated wild-type and Bhlhb5 null mice for a broad set of genes (such as TFs, cell adhesion, and axon guidance molecules) whose expression demarcates cortical areas in specific layers. We analyzed these between P1 and P5, when cortical layers can be delineated. For simplicity, we denote areas along the A-P axis medially as rostral motor, caudal motor, and occipital cortex, and laterally as rostral motor, somatosensory (parietal), and occipital cortex (see Figure 5A). A directional shift of gene expression patterns is often indicative of respecification of area identity, whereas a disruption is often indicative of an anomaly in acquisition of appropriate area identity (see Figure 9). In Bhlhb5 nulls, there is highly consistent disruption of normal patterns of area-specific gene expression that is most severe in somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. For example, in wild-type neocortex, Cadherin 8 is expressed in layers II–III of the rostral motor and occipital, but not somatosensory cortex (Bishop et al., 2002Bishop K.M. Rubenstein J.L. O'Leary D.D. Distinct actions of Emx1, Emx2, and Pax6 in regulating the specification of areas in the developing neocortex.J.

Neuronal circuits are subdivided by differential expression of type-II classic cadherins in postnatal mouse brains.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, there is ectopic expression of Cadherin 8 in layers II–III of somatosensory cortex in Bhlhb5 nulls, resulting in a nearly homogeneous expression across all areas of the cortex (Figure 3A). The orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF1 exhibits an abrupt decline in expression at the rostral motor-somatosensory and somatosensory-occipital transitions in layer IV of wild-type mice (Liu et al., 2000Liu Q. Dwyer N.D. O'Leary D.D. Differential expression of COUP-TFI, CHL1, and two novel genes in developing neocortex identified by differential display PCR.J.

While Bhlhb5 nulls exhibit largely normal COUP-TF1 expression in rostral motor and occipital cortices, there is a striking lack of expression in somatosensory cortex (Figure 3B). Ephrin-A5, a GPI-linked cell surface axon guidance molecule normally enriched in multiple layers of the somatosensory cortex (Bishop et al., 2002Bishop K.M. Rubenstein J.L. O'Leary D.D.

USA. 1998; 95: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) exhibits quite decreased expression in layers IV–V in Bhlhb5 nulls (Figure 3C). Bhlhb5 nulls also exhibit a striking loss of the somatosensory expression of Lmo4 (Figure 3D), a transcriptional regulator normally uniformly expressed in layer IV (Bulchand et al., 2003Bulchand S. Subramanian L. Tole S. Dynamic spatiotemporal expression of LIM genes and cofactors in the embryonic and postnatal cerebral cortex.Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Bhlhb5 regulates the expression of some area-specific markers selectively along the mediolateral axis. For example, RORβ, a layer IV enriched orphan nuclear receptor is expressed discontiguously across areas (Bishop et al., 2002Bishop K.M. Rubenstein J.L. O'Leary D.D.

While RORβ's expression is unchanged in the rostral motor and occipital cortex of Bhlhb5 nulls, there is a lack of expression medially in the caudal motor cortex, but not laterally in the somatosensory cortex in Bhlhb5 nulls (Figures 3E and 3F). Id2, an HLH TF, marks the presumptive border between the sensory and rostral motor cortex in layer V (Bulfone et al., 1995Bulfone A. Smiga S.M. Shimamura K. Peterson A. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L.

While Id2 expression persists in the occipital cortex of Bhlhb5 nulls, we observe a lack of expression medially in the caudal motor cortex, but not laterally in the somatosensory cortex in Bhlhb5 nulls (Figures 3G and 3H). EphA7 receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed in layer IV of the occipital cortex (Bishop et al., 2002Bishop K.M. Rubenstein J.L. O'Leary D.D.

Here we show that purified Mre11 and Rad50 from Pyrococcus furiosus act cooperatively with HerA and NurA to resect the 5' strand at a DNA end under physiological conditions in vitro. The 3' single-stranded DNA generated by these enzymes can be utilized by the archaeal RecA homolog RadA to catalyze strand exchange.

A substantial proportion of the genes targeted by the three factors are transcription factors as well, making understandable how three proteins alone can control the complex ES cell behavior. Remarkably, the levels of these core factors must be tightly coordinated to prevent early differentiation. For example, repression or inactivation of Oct4 differentiates ES cells along the trophoectodermal lineage, whereas high levels of Oct4 can also cause differentiation mainly into primitive endoderm-like derivatives (12Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG frequently co-occupy the promoters of their target genes and also bind to their respective own promoters to modulate their own expression. In addition, all three factors can bind to and activate the Oct4 promoter (11Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G.

Nature. 2008; 453: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). ESRRB and the related ESRRα and -γ share significant homology with the estrogen receptor and belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors (15Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). They are classified as orphan receptors because they bind to DNA and are transcriptionally active in the absence of identified exogenous ligand (16Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). ESRRB can be co-immunoprecipitated as part of the protein complex associated with NANOG in ES cells (10Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of this interaction was not known. In addition, Esrrb knockdown using either short hairpin RNA lentiviruses or small interfering RNA oligonucleotides induces ES cell differentiation (8Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J.

Possibly related to this, Esrrb is essential for adequate placental development, with Esrrb null mutant mice displaying abnormal trophoblast proliferation and precocious differentiation toward the giant cell lineage (17Mitsunaga K.

In this report, we have investigated how Esrrb relates to the fundamental ES cell regulators Oct4 and Nanog and have also demonstrated that forced expression of Esrrb alone is enough to maintain ES cell characteristics. Cell Lines, Culture Media, and Primary Antibodies—HEK293T cells, mouse ES cell lines CGR8 and E14T, and mouse embryonic carcinoma cell lines P19 and F9 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (Invitrogen) with 10! (HEK293T), 15! (P19 and F9), or 20! (CGR8 and E14T) of fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin. Medium for ES cells also contained LIF (1000 units/ml; Chemicon), nonessential amino acids (100 mm; Invitrogen), 0.55 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), 1 mm pyruvate sodium (Invitrogen), and 2 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were prepared by transient transfection with pPyCAGIP containing Esrrb or Nanog and selection with puromycin (Fluka). Alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining was performed using a kit from Chemicon. Antibodies used for this study were anti-NANOG and anti-ESRRB (made by us), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-Myc (Abcam), and anti-OCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmids and Transfection Procedures—pPyCAGIP plasmids containing mouse NANOG full-length or deletions N1 (amino acids 1-197), N3 (amino acids 1-247), and N4 (amino acids 1-197/248-305), and FG-CD (amino acids 156-305) and NHWVP16 and NHVP16 plasmids have been described before (18Pan G.

N5 and N6 were prepared by inserting PCR products encoding amino acids 1-95 (N5) of NANOG or 96-156 (N6) into a modified pCR3.1 II with green fluorescent protein and a Myc tag in the NH2-terminal edge. pPyCAGIP plasmids containing full-length mouse ESRRB and deletions E1 (amino acids 1-211), E2 (amino acids 1-168), E3 (amino acids 169-433), E4 (amino acids 212-433), and E5 (amino acids 93-433) were generated by inserting PCR products into a modified pPyCAGIP plasmid containing an amino-terminal FLAG or Myc tag. NANOG luciferase reporter plasmid p5N and the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the Oct4 promoter have been described before (18Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Pan G. Li J. Zhou Y. Zheng H. Pei D. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1730-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); the pS2-luciferase plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Vincent Giguere (McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Canada) (22Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Oct4 promoter was performed using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara) and DpnI (New England Biolabs) digestion. Primers were muNa-nog-F (5′-gccatcctggcccatGACCAggttgagtacttgtttagg), muNa-nog-R (5′-cctaaacaagtactcaaccTGGTCatgggccaggatggc), muEsrrb-P1-F (5′-ggattgtccagccaaTTccattgtcctgcccccttccc), muEsrrb-P1-R (5′-gggaagggggcaggacaatggAAttggctggacaatcc), muEsrrb-P1-F (5′-gaattatcaggagttcaaTTCcagcttgttttatag), muEsrrb-P2-R (5′-ctataaaacaagctgGAAttgaactcctgataattc). All newly prepared plasmids were verified by sequencing. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for all transfections. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for Western blotting and luciferase activity measurement and after 48 h for immunoprecipitation assays. Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system from Promega. Transfections were carried out as duplicates and repeated at least three times. The indicated luciferase reporter genes (0.2 μg) and either pPyCAGIP vector (control) or the indicated expression vectors (0.5 μg) were used; pCMV-Renilla (0.005 μg) was used for normalization. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Amersco). Membranes were developed using AP with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate or ECL. For immunoprecipitation, cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes and lysed on ice in 400 μl of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5! Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. We used anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads from Sigma or anti-ESRRB and anti-NANOG combined with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Sigma); 50 μl of the lysate supernatant was saved for the input control. ChIP—DNA-protein complexes were cross-linked by adding 1! formaldehyde to cells cultured in 10-cm dishes, cross-linking was stopped with glycine. Cells were lysed on ice using a buffer containing 5 mm PIPES, pH 8.1, 85 mm KCl, 0.5! Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation and extracted with nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1! SDS with protease inhibitors and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice. Chromatin samples were sonicated on ice and centrifuged, and supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads pretreated with salmon sperm (Sigma). Corresponding antibodies were incubated overnight with the samples in rotation at 4 °C; rabbit preimmune serum was used as control antibody. Fresh protein A-Sepharose beads with salmon sperm were added afterward, incubated for 2 h, and washed in rotation at room temperature sequentially with low salt buffer (0.1! SDS, 1! Triton X-100, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1! SDS, 1! Triton X-100, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1! Nonidet P-40, 1! deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and finally two times in TE buffer. Chromatin was eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1! SDS) at room temperature. RNase A (Ameresco) and NaCl were added to the eluates, and samples were incubated at 65 °C for 4-5 h to reverse the cross-linking. DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The following primers were used for PCR amplification: P1 forward (5′-ggggattggggctcaggagggggt), P1 reverse (5′-tctccctccccccacctcctcatc), P2 forward (5′-atgtgctatgtgtagctgtgtgta), P2 reverse (5′-tagccaggacagagttctgagcct), control forward (5′-gatggaatactgtgctctgaaaac), and control reverse (5′-catcctctggagagcctaaaacat). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were obtained using an extraction kit from Keygene. Equal protein amounts were incubated with the corresponding biotin-labeled DNA probes using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce). The gel was transferred to a charged nylon membrane (Millipore) before developing. For supershift experiments, antibodies were added to the reaction mixtures. Probes were Esrrb-P1 (forward, 5′-attgtccagccaaggccattgtcctgc; reverse, 5′-gcaggacaatggccttggctggacaat), Esrrb-P2 (forward, 5′-caggagttcaagggcagcttgtt; reverse, 5′-aacaagctgcccttgaactcctg), and Nanog (forward, 5′-gagccatcctggcccattcaagggttg; reverse, 5′-caacccttgaatgggccaggatggctc). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked for 60 min with 10! fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1! Triton X-100. Secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgM TRITC was purchased from Southern Biotech. All antibodies were diluted in 2! fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline; cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on 80! glycerol. A confocal microscope (LEICA TCS SP2 AOBS) was used for visualization. Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of RNA were retrotranscribed using RTAce (Toyobo), and real time reverse transcription-PCR experiments were performed using SYBR Green (Takara) and an ABI machine. Samples were normalized on the basis of β-actin values. Primers used for this study are available upon request. ESRRB and NANOG Interact through Their DNA Binding Domains—Previously, immunoprecipitation and subsequent mass spectrophotometry analysis has identified ESRRB as a putative NANOG-interacting protein (10Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). We verified this interaction in mouse CGR8 ES cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-NANOG or anti-ESRRB and Western blotting (Fig. 1). Next, we mapped the domains involved in this interaction. Deletion mutants of NANOG and ESRRB were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, which do not express endogenous ES cell markers (e.g. Nanog or Oct4). Deletions N1, N3, N4, N5, N6, and FG-CD of NANOG; and deletions E1-E5 of ESRRB are represented in Fig. 2, A and B. NANOG N1, N3, N4, and FG-CD have been described by us before (18Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); FG-CD is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and a FLAG tag. NANOG N5 and N6 have an amino-terminal green fluorescent protein and a Myc tag. ESRRB full-length is fused to either Myc or FLAG. All ESRRB deletions are fused to an amino-terminal FLAG tag. Western blotting with anti-NANOG, anti-Myc, or anti-FLAG antibodies showed efficient expression of these constructs (Fig. 2, A and B). Full-length NANOG (N) was co-immunoprecipitated with full length ESRRB-FLAG (E), and the interaction was maintained with ESRRB deletions E1 and E5 but not with deletions E2-E4, which lack all or part of the DNA binding domain (Fig. 2C). NANOG full-length and deletions N1, N2, N3, and N6, but not N5 (lacks DNA binding domain), co-immunoprecipitated with ESRRB-FLAG (Fig. 2, D and E). Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies of cells overexpressing NANOG FG-CD and Myc-ESRRB (Myc-E) demonstrated that ESRRB does not interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of NANOG (Fig. 2F). Taken together, our results indicate that the interaction between ESRRB and NANOG is mediated through their respective DNA binding domains. ESRRB and NANOG Reciprocally Modulate Their Transactivation Ability in Pluripotent Cells—NANOG was originally described as a transcriptional repressor (23Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar, 24Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that it can also act as a potent transactivator (18Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), thanks to two unusually potent transactivation domains (WR and CD2) located in the carboxyl-terminal edge (see Fig. 2A). We thus hypothesized that the interaction between ESRRB and NANOG might result in increased transcriptional activity of the latter, since this could potentially explain why Esrrb knockdown induces ES cell differentiation. Paradoxically, forced expression of Esrrb in CGR8 and mouse embryonic carcinoma cell lines (P19 and F9) repressed the activation mediated by NANOG of a reporter gene containing NANOG binding sites (Fig. 3A). A similar experiment was performed using chimeric proteins of NANOG that lack either the CD2 terminal domain (NHWVP16) or the entire carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain (CD1, WR, and CD2) (NHVP16) and are fused to the viral VP16 transactivation domain (see scheme in Fig. 3B). Western blotting showed potent expression of both NANOG fusion proteins in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B). ESRRB reduced the activity of both NHWVP16 and NHVP16 in pluripotent cells (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the repressive effect does not involve the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of NANOG.FIGURE 2NANOG and ESRRB interact through their DNA binding domains. A, the scheme shows the respective protein domains contained in mouse NANOG deletions N1, N3, N4, N5, N6, FG, and FG-CD. ND, amino-terminal transactivation domain; HD, homeodomain and corresponds to the DNA binding domain of NANOG. The carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of NANOG is composed of the CD1, WR, and CD2 subdomains. Panels on the right-hand side show Western blots with anti-NANOG (left), anti-Myc (middle), or anti-FLAG (right) of lysates from transiently transfected HEK293T cells and demonstrate adequate expression and sizes of these constructs.

One representative experiment of three is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ESRRB can bind to specific DNA response elements and activate transcription (e.g. in the case of the pS2 gene) (22Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated whether NANOG could influence ESRRB transactivation ability in this setting. Forced expression of NANOG moderately induced ESRRB mediated-transcriptional activity in P19 and F9 cells and more potently in CGR8 ES cells (Fig. 3D). This synergistic effect was more dependent on the CD2 domain of NANOG than the WR, since it was abolished when NHWVP16 (which only lacks CD2) was overexpressed together with ESRRB and the pS2 reporter (Fig. 3D). Hence, the interaction between ESRRB and NANOG has the potential to reciprocally modulate the transcriptional activity of both. ESRRB and NANOG Independently Activate Oct4 Transcription—Given the above results, we speculated that ESRRB might be controlling ES cell behavior by binding to and activating the promoters of key ES cell core factors. We chose Oct4 as a putative target because tight control of Oct4 levels is essential to prevent ES cell differentiation (12Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). Using the MAT-INSPECTOR program (Genomatix), we identified two degenerate ESRRB DNA binding sites (ESRRB-P2 and ESRRB-P1) (25Pettersson K. Svensson K. Mattsson R. Carlsson B. Ohlsson R. Berkenstam A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 54: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in the mouse proximal Oct4 promoter (Fig. 4A). ESRRB-P1 is located near a putative NANOG site. Specific binding of ESRRB or NANOG to these sequences was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with labeled oligonucleotide sequences that comprise either ESRRB-P2 or ESRRB-P1 or the NANOG binding site. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with Myc-Esrrb or Nanog. ESRRB bound to both ESRRB-P1 and ESRRB-P2, and NANOG bound to its putative cognate sequence (Fig. 4B). Binding was effectively eliminated in both cases when anti-Myc or anti-NANOG antibodies were added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 4B). ChIP analysis of CGR8 cells stably expressing Myc-Esrrb (to increase efficiency of the capture) further demonstrated that both ESRRB-P2 and P1 are bona fide ESRRB binding sites (Fig. 4C). Only the DNA fragment containing the NANOG binding site could be immunoprecipitated with anti-NANOG antibodies in CGR8 cells stably expressing NANOG-Flag (Fig. 4C). We next used a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the Oct4 promoter described in Fig. 4A (see the scheme in Fig. 5A). Overexpression of Nanog and Esrrb activated the Oct4 promoter reporter in F9 when transfected individually, but co-transfection did not result in synergy but rather in antagonism (Fig. 5B). This effect could be related to the above described interplay between ESRRB and NANOG. Overexpression of either transcription factor in CGR8 cells could only activate the Oct4 reporter modestly (data not shown), which is probably due to high levels of endogenous Esrrb and Nanog. We therefore mutated ESRRB-P1 and ESRRB-P2 or the NANOG binding site; the latter 2 mutations had a potent effect in reducing the basal activity of the Oct4 promoter in CGR8 cells (Fig. 5C). In conclusion, ESRRB and NANOG independently bind to and activate Oct4 transcription.FIGURE 5ESRRB and NANOG activate transcription of the Oct4 promoter.

C, effect of mutating ESRRB or NANOG binding sites in the basal Oct4 promoter reporter activity in transiently transfected CGR8 cells.

The resulting cell lines were then cultured in the presence or absence of LIF for 6 days, after which cell morphology and AP activity were evaluated (Figs. 6, A and B, and 7, A and B). AP staining was high in Esrrb-overexpressing ES cells cultured without LIF and faint or absent in the control. Esrrb-overexpressing colonies also retained the classic compact morphology with well defined borders of dedifferentiated ES cell colonies, whereas control cells were flat and displayed abundant cytoplasmic prolongations. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of ES cell marker genes, including Nanog and Rex1, demonstrated comparable levels in Esrrb-stable ES cell lines cultured with or without LIF (Figs. 6C and 7C). LIF depletion in Esrrb-stable ES cells did not influence mRNA levels of genes (Fgf5 and T) known to increase after ES cell differentiation (Figs. 6C and 7C). In addition, immunofluorescence staining for NANOG and OCT4 showed homogeneous high levels in ESRRB-overexpressing CGR8 cells cultured without LIF and low in the control (Fig. 6D).FIGURE 7Esrrb is sufficient to maintain ES pluripotency and self-renewal in the absence of LIF. A, E14T cell lines stably transfected with empty vector or Myc-Esrrb were cultured in the presence of LIF or deprived of LIF for 6 days, after which phase-contrast pictures were taken. Most if not all colonies remained undifferentiated in Esrrb-overexpressing LIF cultured in either condition. This behavior was reproduced in multiple experiments. B, representative AP staining of the same cell lines with or without LIF. Quantification is shown in the right panel. This pattern was maintained in multiple experiments.

In many cases, like it happens with ESRRB, it is poorly understood how they exert their roles. ESRRB has been reported to interact with the ES cell master regulator NANOG (10Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Multiple other proteins also interact with NANOG, and some of them are also transcription factors. It is, for example, the case of Dax1, Sall4, and NF-κB (10Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 26Wu Q. Chen X. Zhang J. Loh Y.H. Low T.Y. Zhang W. Zhang W. Sze S.K. Lim B. Ng H.H.

Dax1 belongs, like Esrrb, to the family of orphan nuclear receptors and has a known role in the establishment and maintenance of steroid-producing tissues like the testis and the adrenal gland (30Niakan K.K. McCabe E.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 86: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). How Dax1 helps control pluripotency is probably unrelated to its role in steroi-dogenesis. Sall4 is a member of the Spalt-like family of proteins; Sall4 co-occupies with NANOG the promoters of many genes and is needed for NANOG-mediated transactivation of these targets (26Wu Q. Chen X. Zhang J. Loh Y.H. Low T.Y. Zhang W. Zhang W. Sze S.K. Lim B. Ng H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24090-24094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). High levels of NF-κB induce differentiation of ES cells by activating lineage-specific programs. NF-κB binds to the WR transactivation domain of NANOG, and this results in repression of the transcriptional activity of the latter (27Torres J. Watt F.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ESRRB can bind to specific DNA recognition sequences and is transcriptionally active in the absence of exogenously added ligand. Two ESRRB binding sites were identified in the proximal mouse Oct4 promoter, one of which is responsible for maintaining Oct4 transcription together with NANOG. The positive effect of ESRRB on Oct4 may on its own explain why small interfering RNA for Esrrb induces differentiation. Further supporting this idea, we have demonstrated that overexpression of Esrrb alone is able to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in ES cells in the absence of LIF (see the scheme in Fig. 8). While our manuscript was under review, ChIP-on-chip analysis in mouse ES cells demonstrated the existence of ESRRB binding sites through the whole genome (31Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. Loh Y.H. Yeo H.C. Yeo Z.X. Narang V. Govindarajan K.R. Leong B. Shahab A. Ruan Y. Bourque G. Sung W.K. Clarke N.D. Wei C.L. Ng H.H. Cell. 2008; 133: 1106-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). Many of these potential ESRRB target genes comprise OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG-regulated genes and include the respective promoters of these core ES cell regulators too. Also, van den Berg et al. (32van den Berg D.L. Zhang W. Yates A. Engelen E. Takacs K. Bezstarosti K. Demmers J. Chambers I. Poot R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 5986-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ESRRB binds to Nanog, Rest, and Rex1 promoters. For the former two promoters, binding of ESRRB to its cognate sequence required Oct4 being bound to a nearby site. This was, however, not needed for ESRRB binding to the Rex1 promoter. Paradoxically, ESRRB was capable of transactivating Nanog and Rex1 promoters but not Rest. In the context of our study, ESRRB could repress the ability of NANOG to transactivate a NANOG reporter gene, whereas NANOG had the opposite effect on ESRRB. This suggests that the interplay between both factors may reciprocally affect their ability to activate common targets and thus fine-tune ES cell pluripotency. But this interplay is likely to be target-specific and complex. Likewise, it is conceivable that the number of ESRRB-interacting proteins in ES cells will extend beyond OCT4 and NANOG in the same way that most ES cell transcription factors interact with and cross-regulate each other. Future work will be important to evaluate these considerations. We thank Y. Q. Ding, W. Li, C. Huang, and K. S. Chen for assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1963504189,"During transcription, proteins assemble sequentially with nascent RNA to generate a messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP). The THO complex and its associated Sub2p helicase are functionally implicated in both transcription and mRNP biogenesis but their precise function remains elusive. We show here that THO/Sub2p mutation leads to the accumulation of a stalled intermediate in mRNP biogenesis that contains nuclear pore components and polyadenylation factors in association with chromatin. Microarray analyses of genomic loci that are aberrantly docked to the nuclear pore in mutants allowed the identification of approximately 400 novel validated target genes that require THO /Sub2p for efficient expression. Our data strongly suggests that the THO complex/Sub2p function is required to coordinate events leading to the acquisition of export competence at a step that follows commitment to 3'-processing."
https://openalex.org/W2141929116,"In most eukaryotes, histone methylation patterns regulate chromatin architecture and function: methylation of histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9) demarcates heterochromatin, whereas H3K4 methylation demarcates euchromatin. We show here that the S. pombe JmjC-domain protein Lid2 is a trimethyl H3K4 demethylase responsible for H3K4 hypomethylation in heterochromatin. Lid2 interacts with the histone lysine-9 methyltransferase, Clr4, through the Dos1/Clr8-Rik1 complex, which also functions in the RNA interference pathway. Disruption of the JmjC domain alone results in severe heterochromatin defects and depletion of siRNA, whereas overexpressing Lid2 enhances heterochromatin silencing. The physical and functional link between H3K4 demethylation and H3K9 methylation suggests that the two reactions act in a coordinated manner. Surprisingly, crossregulation of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation in euchromatin also requires Lid2. We suggest that Lid2 enzymatic activity in euchromatin is regulated through a dynamic interplay with other histone-modification enzymes. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the coordination of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation."

When a subject learns a new perceptual task by repeated exposure to sensory stimuli, a persistent modification of the brain takes place to improve performance (Fahle, 2005Fahle M.

The neural correlates of perceptual learning may involve changes in the tuning properties of neurons that provide relevant sensory information and/or changes in how these sensory responses are routed to and decoded by brain areas involved in decision-making (Dosher and Lu, 1998Dosher B.A. Lu Z.L.

In the auditory and somatosensory systems, learning can substantially alter the tuning properties and topographic organization in primary cortical areas (Jenkins et al., 1990Jenkins W.M.

In contrast, perceptual learning elicits little change in the basic tuning properties of neurons in primary visual cortex (Crist et al., 2001Crist R.E. Li W. Gilbert C.D. Learning to see: experience and attention in primary visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 519-525PubMed Google Scholar, Ghose et al., 2002Ghose G.M. Yang T. Maunsell J.H.

Practising orientation identification improves orientation coding in V1 neurons.Nature. 2001; 412: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Somewhat larger changes in tuning properties have been observed at higher levels of visual processing such as area V4 (Raiguel et al., 2006Raiguel S. Vogels R. Mysore S.G. Orban G.A. Learning to see the difference specifically alters the most informative V4 neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6589-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Yang and Maunsell, 2004Yang T. Maunsell J.H. The effect of perceptual learning on neuronal responses in monkey visual area V4.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effects of learning on the selective transmission of sensory signals to decision circuitry have been relatively unexplored. However, a recent study has shown that learning of motion discrimination is manifested in parietal cortex circuitry thought to be involved in decision-making, with little plasticity in sensory representations of visual motion (Law and Gold, 2008Law C.T. Gold J.I. Neural correlates of perceptual learning in a sensory-motor, but not a sensory, cortical area.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Physiological studies of perceptual learning generally examine how training alters the neural representation of sensory information that is relevant to the newly learned task. Here, we address an important related question: How does learning a new task affect the neural substrates of previously learned tasks? Given that the same neural representations of sensory cues and/or decision variables may be used to perform multiple tasks, learning-induced changes in these representations may alter how particular brain regions contribute to tasks learned previously. We addressed this question by training monkeys to perform a fine depth discrimination task and examining how this learning affects the causal contribution of area MT to coarse depth discrimination. We have previously shown that area MT contributes to coarse judgments of absolute disparity (near versus far) in the presence of noise (Figure 1A) (DeAngelis et al., 1998DeAngelis G.C. Cumming B.G. Newsome W.T. Cortical area MT and the perception of stereoscopic depth.Nature. 1998; 394: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, Uka and DeAngelis, 2003Uka T. DeAngelis G.C.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6791-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, electrical stimulation of MT does not alter fine judgments of relative depth (Figure 1B) (Uka and DeAngelis, 2006Uka T. DeAngelis G.C. Linking neural representation to function in stereoscopic depth perception: roles of the middle temporal area in coarse versus fine disparity discrimination.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6791-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results suggest that learning to perform the fine depth task recruits visual areas that represent relative disparities, which are thought to be necessary for high stereoacuity (Prince et al., 2000Prince S.J. Pointon A.D. Cumming B.G. Parker A.J. The precision of single neuron responses in cortical area V1 during stereoscopic depth judgments.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3387-3400PubMed Google Scholar, Westheimer, 1979Westheimer G. Cooperative neural processes involved in stereoscopic acuity.Exp. Brain Res. 1979; 36: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to ask how learning the fine depth task alters the causal contribution of area MT to coarse depth discrimination. We report that reversible chemical inactivation of area MT prior to fine depth training severely impairs performance of the coarse depth task. Surprising, after animals learned the fine depth task, inactivation of MT no longer affected coarse depth discrimination, indicating considerable plasticity in the contribution of area MT to stereopsis. Single-unit recordings revealed no differences in the disparity selectivity of MT neurons before and after fine depth training, indicating that the change in MT's contribution to coarse depth discrimination does not result from a loss of sensory information. Our findings show that the linkage between task performance and neuronal activity in a particular brain area can be modified by the process of learning a new task. These findings may be explained by changes in the transmission of sensory signals to decision circuitry, without changes in the sensory representation of binocular disparity itself. We studied the effect of reversible chemical inactivation of area MT on monkeys' performance of three visual discrimination tasks: coarse depth discrimination, fine depth discrimination, and direction discrimination. Our goal was to examine the contribution of area MT to coarse depth discrimination before and after monkeys were trained on the fine depth task. Thus, experiments were performed on two monkeys (Bk and J) prior to any training on the fine depth task and on two monkeys (Bk and R) following fine depth training (monkey Bk contributed to each group). Both experimental groups performed the direction discrimination task as a control for negative effects of reversible inactivation. Figure 1 illustrates the three discrimination tasks schematically. In the coarse depth task (Uka and DeAngelis, 2003Uka T. DeAngelis G.C. Contribution of middle temporal area to coarse depth discrimination: comparison of neuronal and psychophysical sensitivity.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3515-3530PubMed Google Scholar), the monkey discriminated between two different absolute disparities (near versus far) in the presence of noise (Figure 1A). Task difficulty was manipulated by varying the percentage of binocularly correlated dots in the stimulus. In the fine depth task (Uka and DeAngelis, 2006Uka T. DeAngelis G.C. Linking neural representation to function in stereoscopic depth perception: roles of the middle temporal area in coarse versus fine disparity discrimination.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6791-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the monkey judged the relative depth between two concentric patches of dots, i.e., whether the center patch was near or far relative to the surround (Figure 1B). No disparity noise was added to the display; rather, difficulty was manipulated by presenting very small relative disparities between the center and surround. In the direction discrimination task (Britten et al., 1992Britten K.H. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A. The analysis of visual motion: a comparison of neuronal and psychophysical performance.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4745-4765PubMed Google Scholar), monkeys reported whether the global motion of a noisy random-dot stimulus was leftward or rightward, and task difficulty was varied by manipulating the percentage of dots that moved coherently (Figure 1C). We first describe the effects of reversible inactivation on performance of the coarse depth and direction tasks prior to any training on the fine depth task, and we then describe the effects of inactivation on all three tasks. Figure 2 shows data from a representative experiment performed on monkey Bk prior to training on the fine depth task. A “microinjectrode” (see Experimental Procedures) was lowered into the middle layers of area MT, and the receptive field of multiunit activity was mapped to determine the location and size of a visual stimulus that filled most of the classical receptive field. Psychophysical data were then collected for the coarse depth and direction tasks prior to drug injection (Figure 2, “Pre”, black squares). The monkey performed both tasks well prior to injection, with psychophysical thresholds of 28% for coarse depth discrimination and 18% for direction discrimination (see Experimental Procedures). Next, 1–2 μl of muscimol, a GABA agonist, was slowly injected (0.05 μl/min) into area MT through the microinjectrode. Within ∼25 min, neuronal activity declined sharply as the drug diffused outward from the end of the cannula (see, e.g., Figure S1 available online). After injection, the monkey again performed blocks of the coarse depth and direction tasks. For both tasks, performance was clearly diminished within 40–45 min following drug injection, with psychophysical thresholds of 68% for coarse depth and 53% for direction discrimination (Figure 2, cyan). On the morning after drug delivery (∼20 hr postinjection), performance of both tasks was devastated, with percent correct near 50% even for the highest binocular correlation or motion coherence (Figure 2, “+1d”, red). Thus, muscimol had a long-lasting suppressive effect on MT activity at the concentration we used (as confirmed by recordings; see Experimental Procedures). On the second day following injection, psychophysical performance returned to normal (Figure 2, “+2d”, green). In this experiment, there was no significant difference between psychophysical thresholds measured preinjection versus +2d (p > 0.05 for both tasks, bootstrap analysis). By comparison, thresholds for both tasks were significantly higher at +1hr and +1d relative to +2d (p < 0.05, bootstrap). The long-lasting effect of muscimol allowed us to collect extensive behavioral data following each injection while still demonstrating full recovery. Figure 3 summarizes data obtained from two monkeys (Bk and J) during performance of the coarse depth and direction tasks. In each panel, psychophysical thresholds are plotted at three time points: preinjection, 1 day postinjection, and 2 days postinjection. Error bars reflect the 95% confidence interval for each threshold. For monkey Bk, thresholds were significantly elevated (+1d versus +2d) in 5 of 6 individual experiments for the coarse depth task (Figure 3A) and 6 of 6 experiments for the direction task (Figure 3B; p < 0.05, bootstrap). Note that weaker effects of muscimol were seen in the same subset of experiments for both tasks (yellow, magenta, and cyan points), suggesting that some of the variation in drug efficacy across experiments was methodological. For monkey J, thresholds were significantly elevated in 6 of 7 individual experiments for coarse depth (Figure 3C) and 5 of 7 experiments for direction discrimination (Figure 3D). Combining across experiments, we found a highly significant difference between psychophysical thresholds measured at +1d and +2d for both the coarse depth task (monkey Bk: p = 0.004; monkey J: p < 0.001; paired t test) and the direction discrimination task (monkey Bk: p = 0.001; monkey J: p < 0.001). To address the possibility that muscimol had a nonspecific effect on behavior, we examined the spatial localization of behavioral effects. In six experiments on direction discrimination and seven experiments on coarse depth discrimination, we measured the effect of muscimol on performance when the visual stimulus was placed at a location in the opposite visual hemifield (diametrically opposite the fixation point). We found no significant difference between psychophysical thresholds measured at +1d and +2d in these controls (Figure S2; coarse depth: p = 0.46; direction: p = 0.53; paired t test). To further localize behavioral deficits, we presented the visual stimulus at multiple locations relative to the MT receptive field in some experiments. Figure 4A shows an example result for the direction discrimination task. When the visual stimulus was centered on the multiunit receptive field (RF, gray shading), there was a large (>200%) and highly significant elevation of threshold at +1d (hatched bar) relative to +2d (black bar). When the visual stimulus was shifted by about 2/3 of the receptive field diameter (locations 1 and 3), direction thresholds were still elevated by ∼50% at +1d, although these elevations were not individually significant. When the visual stimulus did not overlap the multiunit receptive field at all (locations 2 and 4), there was no elevation of direction thresholds at +1d. Analogous results are shown in Figures 4B and 4C for two additional experiments. Perceptual deficits associated with muscimol were abolished when the visual stimulus did not overlap the multiunit receptive field, indicating that muscimol affected the region of visual space represented by neurons near the tip of the injectrode. Robust effects of muscimol on coarse depth and direction discrimination are not surprising given that electrical microstimulation was previously found to bias judgments in these tasks (DeAngelis et al., 1998DeAngelis G.C. Cumming B.G. Newsome W.T. Cortical area MT and the perception of stereoscopic depth.Nature. 1998; 394: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, Salzman et al., 1992Salzman C.D. Murasugi C.M. Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Microstimulation in visual area MT: effects on direction discrimination performance.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2331-2355PubMed Google Scholar). The key question is how the contribution of MT to these tasks is affected by training monkeys to perform the fine depth discrimination. If MT does not contain the disparity signals necessary for fine depth discrimination (Uka and DeAngelis, 2006Uka T. DeAngelis G.C. Linking neural representation to function in stereoscopic depth perception: roles of the middle temporal area in coarse versus fine disparity discrimination.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6791-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), then fine depth training should recruit other visual areas into play. How does recruiting these other areas alter the contribution of MT to coarse depth discrimination? To address this question, we trained monkey Bk extensively on the fine depth task, which led to a gradual 3-fold reduction in psychophysical thresholds over a period of weeks (Figure S3). This gradual improvement in sensitivity is consistent with perceptual learning and is similar to effects of learning on direction discrimination in monkeys (Law and Gold, 2008Law C.T. Gold J.I. Neural correlates of perceptual learning in a sensory-motor, but not a sensory, cortical area.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This improvement is unlikely to reflect operational learning, as the monkey previously learned the coarse depth task, which has the same operational rule. Indeed, the monkey performed the fine depth task correctly when large disparities were presented from the beginning of the training period; however, thresholds declined gradually as the animal learned to extract fine relative disparity information. After this training period, we examined effects of muscimol on all three tasks: fine depth, coarse depth, and direction discrimination. Figure 5 shows a representative result. Reversible inactivation produced no significant effect on performance of either the fine (Figure 5A) or coarse (Figure 5B) depth tasks (p > 0.05, bootstrap). However, muscimol produced a large deficit in performance of the direction discrimination task (Figure 5C; p < 0.001), similar to that seen before fine depth training. Figures 6A–6C summarize the results from monkey Bk following training on the fine depth task. Consistent with our previous microstimulation results (Uka and DeAngelis, 2006Uka T. DeAngelis G.C. Linking neural representation to function in stereoscopic depth perception: roles of the middle temporal area in coarse versus fine disparity discrimination.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6791-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), reversible inactivation of MT did not impair fine depth discrimination. Specifically, the relative disparity threshold was not significantly elevated in any of the eight experiments (Figure 6A; p > 0.05, bootstrap), and the average threshold was not significantly different between +1d and +2d (p = 0.20, paired t test). This lack of effect on fine depth discrimination was not due to failure of inactivation, because the same muscimol injections dramatically impaired direction discrimination (Figure 6C; p < 0.001, paired t test), with significant effects in all eight individual experiments (p < 0.05). In a few experiments, we halved the size of the center patch to place the disparity boundary within the classical receptive field, and we again found no significant effects of inactivation on fine depth discrimination (p > 0.05, bootstrap). Strikingly, after fine depth training, inactivation of MT in monkey Bk failed to produce any significant effect on coarse depth discrimination. Across the same eight sessions, none of the coarse depth thresholds changed significantly from +1d to +2d (Figure 6B; p > 0.05, bootstrap), and the average thresholds did not differ significantly between these two time points (p = 0.24, paired t test). These data lie in clear contrast to those obtained from the same monkey before training on the fine depth task (compare Figure 6B to Figure 3A) despite the use of identical experimental protocols and despite similar effects of muscimol on direction discrimination (compare Figure 6C to Figure 3B). We found no significant changes in eye movements that were correlated with this striking change in behavior (Experimental Procedures; Figures S4–S6). Figures 6D–6F show analogous data from another animal (monkey R) that was tested on all three tasks. Again, there was a highly significant effect of inactivation on direction discrimination (Figure 6F; p < 0.001), but no significant effect on either fine depth (Figure 6D; p = 0.07) or coarse depth (Figure 6E; p = 0.46) discrimination (paired t tests). Thus, training monkeys to perform fine depth discrimination alters the contribution of area MT to the coarse depth task. It should be noted that we have previously reported significant effects of microstimulation on coarse depth discrimination in animals that had been trained to perform the fine depth task (Uka and DeAngelis, 2006Uka T. DeAngelis G.C. Linking neural representation to function in stereoscopic depth perception: roles of the middle temporal area in coarse versus fine disparity discrimination.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6791-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, effects of microstimulation in that study were significantly smaller than those obtained in an earlier study without any fine depth training (DeAngelis et al., 1998DeAngelis G.C. Cumming B.G. Newsome W.T. Cortical area MT and the perception of stereoscopic depth.Nature. 1998; 394: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) despite the fact that larger currents were often used (Figure S7). Thus, fine depth training acts to reduce, but not eliminate, effects of microstimulation on coarse depth discrimination. The quantitative difference between microstimulation and inactivation results likely reflects differences in the nature and sensitivities of the two methods. MT may still contribute to coarse depth discrimination following fine depth training (as suggested by microstimulation), but other areas may compensate for the loss of MT during inactivation. Microstimulation of MT could also indirectly activate other pathways that contribute to coarse depth perception. One possible explanation for the inactivation results is that fine depth training alters the disparity tuning of MT neurons and makes them less informative for coarse depth discrimination. For example, if fine depth training were to weaken disparity selectivity, broaden tuning curves, or shift disparity preferences toward the plane of fixation (zero disparity), these changes could render MT responses less useful for coarse depth discrimination. To address this possibility, we analyzed disparity tuning curves from MT neurons recorded before and after fine depth training. Specifically, data were analyzed from 284 MT neurons in two monkeys (Bn and J) that had not been trained on the fine depth task. Data were also analyzed from 217 neurons from two monkeys (Bn and R) after fine depth training (monkey Bn contributed to both groups). For each neuron, horizontal disparity tuning was measured in response to random-dot stereograms (DeAngelis and Uka, 2003DeAngelis G.C. Uka T. Coding of horizontal disparity and velocity by MT neurons in the alert macaque.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1094-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and tuning curves were fit with Gabor functions (see Experimental Procedures) to quantify various tuning parameters. Figure 7A compares distributions of the disparity discrimination index (DDI; see Experimental Procedures) (DeAngelis and Uka, 2003DeAngelis G.C. Uka T.

Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with training history and monkey identity as factors. The DDI did not differ significantly between the two training groups (p = 0.55, ANOVA), although there was a modestly significant difference between animals (p = 0.005). Training history also did not significantly affect DDI when we examined only the data from monkey Bn using a nonparametric test (Figure 7B; p > 0.1, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S] test). We have previously shown that DDI is strongly correlated with neuronal sensitivity in the coarse depth task (Uka and DeAngelis, 2003Uka T. DeAngelis G.C. Contribution of middle temporal area to coarse depth discrimination: comparison of neuronal and psychophysical sensitivity.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3515-3530PubMed Google Scholar), so this finding indicates that fine depth training does not reduce the sensitivity of MT neurons for discriminating coarse depth. Figure 7C shows the distribution of disparity frequency, a measure of tuning width (Cumming and DeAngelis, 2001Cumming B.G. DeAngelis G.C. The physiology of stereopsis.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 203-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, DeAngelis and Uka, 2003DeAngelis G.C. Uka T. Coding of horizontal disparity and velocity by MT neurons in the alert macaque.J.

Again, there was no difference due to training for either the entire data set (p = 0.15, ANOVA on log-transformed data) or the data from monkey Bn (Figure 7D; p > 0.1, K-S test). Finally, Gabor fits were also used to determine the disparity at which each tuning curve showed its dominant peak or trough. The distribution of this peak/trough disparity was also not significantly different before and after fine depth training (all data: Figure 7E; p = 0.21, ANOVA; monkey Bn: Figure 7F; p > 0.1, K-S test). Overall, the available data provide no evidence that fine depth training altered the repr"
https://openalex.org/W2149079498,"Chronic hyperglycemia promotes insulin resistance at least in part by increasing the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have previously shown that in L6 myotubes human glycated albumin (HGA) induces insulin resistance by activating protein kinase Cα (PKCα). Here we show that HGA-induced PKCα activation is mediated by Src. Coprecipitation experiments showed that Src interacts with both the receptor for AGE (RAGE) and PKCα in HGA-treated L6 cells. A direct interaction of PKCα with Src and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) has also been detected. In addition, silencing of IRS-1 expression abolished HGA-induced RAGE-PKCα co-precipitation. AGEs were able to induce insulin resistance also in vivo, as insulin tolerance tests revealed a significant impairment of insulin sensitivity in C57/BL6 mice fed a high AGEs diet (HAD). In tibialis muscle of HAD-fed mice, insulin-induced glucose uptake and protein kinase B phosphorylation were reduced. This was paralleled by a 2.5-fold increase in PKCα activity. Similarly to in vitro observations, Src phosphorylation was increased in tibialis muscle of HAD-fed mice, and co-precipitation experiments showed that Src interacts with both RAGE and PKCα. These results indicate that AGEs impairment of insulin action in the muscle might be mediated by the formation of a multimolecular complex including RAGE/IRS-1/Src and PKCα.

These results indicate that AGEs impairment of insulin action in the muscle might be mediated by the formation of a multimolecular complex including RAGE/IRS-1/Src and PKCα. Insulin resistance is genetically determined, but it may also be affected by environmental conditions and by factors secondary to diseases (1Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar). These acquired and secondary factors further impair insulin action in diabetic individuals. For instance, chronic hyperglycemia per se promotes insulin resistance (2Hager S.R. Jochen A.L. Kalkhoff R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: E353-E362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Davidson M.B.

Chronic hyperglycemia also leads to the production of Amadori products through the nonenzymatic glycation reactions between glucose and reactive amino groups of serum proteins. Depending on the protein turnover rate and glucose concentration, Amadori products undergo further irreversible reactions to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The modifications of proteins that lead to their glycation induce alterations in biological properties as compared with their non-glycated counterparts. Several studies have shown that elevated concentrations of Amadori products such as glycated albumin (GA) are associated with diabetic atherogenesis by activating vascular smooth muscle cells (7Hattori Y. Suzuki M. Hattori S. Kasai K. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). GA has also been implicated in the development of diabetic retinopathy (8Ruggiero-Lopez D.

Eichler W. Rosenthal A. Wiedemann P. Graefes Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 2002; 240: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Finally, GA has been shown to participate in the development of diabetic nephropathy by the induction of cytokines and growth factors (12Makita Z. Yanagisawa K. Kuwajima S. Yoshioka N. Atsumi T. Hasunuma Y. Koike T. J. Diabetes Complications. 1995; 9: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which may themselves contribute to diabetic renal disease (13Flyvbjerg A. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1205-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition to those endogenously formed, AGEs are abundant in exogenous sources such as foods, especially when prepared under elevated temperatures (14O'Brien J. Morrissey P.A. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1989; 28: 211-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 15Vlassara H. Hosp. Pract. 2000; 35 (32, 35–39): 25-27Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After ingestion, 10% of preformed AGEs are absorbed into the human or rodent circulation (16Koschinsky T. He C.J. Mitsuhashi T. Bucala R. Liu C. Buenting C. Heitmann K. Vlassara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6474-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 17He C. Sabol J. Mitsuhashi T. Vlassara H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), ⅔ of which are retained in tissues. Also, reduced intake of dietary AGEs has been shown to decrease the incidence of type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice (18He C. Li J. Sabol J. Hattori M. Chang M. Mitsuhashi T. Vlassara H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 48Google Scholar) as well as the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (19Lin R. Choudhury R. Lu M. Dore A. Fallon J. Fisher E. Vlassara H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 48Google Scholar). Furthermore, Vlassara and co-workers (20Hofmann S.M. Dong H.J. Li Z. Cai W. Altomonte J. Thung S.N. Zeng F. Fisher E.A. Vlassara H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2082-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) have shown that reduced AGE intake leads to lower levels of circulating AGEs and to improved insulin sensitivity in db/db mice. Several AGE-binding proteins have been identified, including lactoferrin, galectin-3 (AGE-R3), lysozyme, and the receptor for AGE (RAGE) (21Thornalley P.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-Grand). 1998; 44: 1013-1023PubMed Google Scholar). RAGE is a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed on the surface of a variety of cell types. By their binding to RAGE, AGEs trigger a range of cellular responses. RAGE has been reported to activate intracellular signals including the MAPK cascade and the cdc42/Rac pathway (22Bucciarelli L.G. Wendt T. Rong L. Lalla E. Hofmann M.A. Goova M.T. Taguchi A. Yan S.F. Yan S.D. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Cell. Mol.

Hori O. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wautier J.L. Stern D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inflammation (24Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M.

The cytoplasmic region of RAGE is considered to be responsible for the binding of the signaling molecule(s) (26Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that ERK1/2 interacts with the cytoplasmic region of RAGE after stimulation with amphoterin (27Ishihara K. Tsutsumi K. Kawane S. Nakajima M. Kasaoka T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that STAT5 becomes activated and physically interacts with RAGE upon glycated low density lipoprotein stimulation (28Brizzi M.F. Dentelli P. Gambino R. Cabodi S. Cassader M. Castelli A. Defilippi P. Pegoraro L. Pagano G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3311-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, RAGE is devoid of intrinsic catalytic activity. Src tyrosine kinase is required for signaling events downstream of several receptors lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, such as cytokine receptors. Cho et al. (29Cho H.M. Choi S.H. Hwang K.C. Oh S.Y. Kim H.G. Yoon D.H. Choi M.A. Lim S. Song H. Jang Y. Kim T.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 60-66Google Scholar) have shown that glycated low density lipoprotein (LDL) activates ERK1/2 via Src-, phospholipase C (PLC)-, and PKC-dependent pathways, whereas native and non-glycated LDL activate ERK1/2 by an Src-independent mechanism. It has been recently reported that in vascular smooth muscle cells derived from insulin-resistant and diabetic db/db mice, RAGE expression and Src activity are increased compared with those from control mice. Further studies showed that the RAGE ligand S100B induced Src activation in a RAGE-dependent manner. Moreover, in vascular smooth muscle cells Src activation is necessary for the S100B-induced RAGE downstream signaling involving several targets such as caveolin-1, MAPKs, NF-κB, and STAT3. Interestingly, a PKC inhibitor could block S100B-induced activation of MAPKs, suggesting a role for PKC in this event (30Reddy M.A. Li S.L. Sahar S. Kim Y.S. Xu Z.G. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13685-13693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that human glycated albumin (HGA) pretreatment induces a selective activation of PKCα. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) serine/threonine phosphorylation by HGA-activated PKCα inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism without changes in growth-related pathways regulated by insulin (31Miele C. Riboulet A. Maitan M.A. Oriente F. Romano C. Formisano P. Giudicelli J. Beguinot F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47376-47387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signaling mechanism by which HGA induces PKCα activation remains to be determined. In this work we report that HGA and dietary AGEs induce the formation of a complex including RAGE, PKCα, and Src in L6 cells and in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant HAD-fed mice, respectively. In L6 cells HGA-mediated complex formation requires the presence of IRS-1. We suggest that the formation of this complex may mediate the AGE-dependent inhibition of insulin action in skeletal muscle cells in vitro and, possibly, in vivo. protein kinase C protein kinase B advanced glycation end product receptor for AGE soluble RAGE glycated albumin human GA 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine carboxymethyllysine low AGE diet high AGE diet phospholipase D human serum albumin mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphate-buffered saline diacylglycerol dominant negative General—Media, sera, antibiotics for cell culture, and the Lipofectamine reagent were from Invitrogen (Invitrogen).

Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2. Under these culture conditions, L6 myoblasts spontaneously differentiate into myotubes upon confluence. Transient transfections of IRS-1 and control ribozymes and of the kinase-inactive Src were performed by the Lipofectamine method according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cells were incubated for the appropriated times with 0.1 mg/ml of HGA or non-glycated human serum albumin (HA) as a control. Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 50 μm PD98059, 30 min with 50 nm wortmannin, 2 h with 5 μm PP1, or 30 min with 10 μm U73122 or 5 μm U73343 before the incubation with HGA.

Each batch was tested for possible insulin-like growth factor-I contamination by IGF-I-D-RIA-CT (BioSource Europe, Nivelles, Belgium) and the absence of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) by the use of Limulus amebocyte lysates assay (Sigma). Each human glycated albumin batch was reconstituted at 10 mg/ml with sterile PBS and, to avoid glycoxidation, thereafter immediately frozen at –30 °C until use. The results obtained are summarized in Table 1 and show the absence of significant modifications in the extent of free lysine and arginine residues between the two preparations. Furthermore, the batches were found not to contain IGF-I and to be bacterial endotoxin-free. The physicochemical properties determined for our HGA preparation demonstrate that the effects observed in L6 myotubes are the consequence of glycated albumin present essentially as a glycated Amadori product.TABLE 1Characteristics of glycated human albuminNon-glycated human albuminGlycated human albuminCML/mg protein55 ng195 ngLys modification (%)10094.9 ± 3.2Arg modification (%)10091.6 ± 1.5IGF-1UndetectableUndetectableLPSUndetectableUndetectable Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting, Overlay Blot, PKC Assay, and Determination of Diacylglycerol (DAG) Cellular Content—Cell lysates were solubilized as described in Miele et al.

Fasting plasma free fatty acid levels were measured with Wako NEFA C kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), and triglycerides were measured with the Infinity triglyceride reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). For analyzing glucose utilization by skeletal muscle, an intravenous injection of 1μCi of the non-metabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose (GE Healthcare) and an intraperitoneal injection of insulin (0.75 milliunits/kg of body weight) were administered to random-fed mice. The specific blood 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose clearance was determined with 25-μl blood samples collected from the tail vein obtained 1, 15, and 30 min after injection as previously reported (33Miele C.

Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with Statview software (Abacus Concepts) by one-factor analysis of variance and are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test for unpaired comparison. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Role of HGA-activated Src in PKCα Activation in L6 Skeletal Muscle Cells—To investigate the molecular mechanisms of PKCα activation by AGEs, HGA-induced PKCα activity was measured in L6 cells treated with different pharmacological inhibitors to selectively block ERK1/2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Src. PKCα activity in response to HGA was unchanged upon treatment of L6 cells with PD98059 and wortmannin, which inhibit ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively (Fig. 1a). At variance, preincubation with the Src inhibitor PP1 or the expression of a dominant negative kinase-inactive Src (SrcDN) (38Ulianich L. Garbi C. Treglia A.S. Punzi D. Miele C. Raciti G.A.

Therefore, the levels of Src phosphorylation on Tyr416 have been evaluated in L6 myotubes upon incubation for 24 h with HGA in the presence or absence of either PP1 or SrcDN. Src phosphorylation was increased by HGA, but this effect was prevented by PP1 treatment (Fig. 1b) and by overexpression of SrcDN (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, both HGA-induced PKCα (Fig. 2a) and Src (Fig. 2b) activation were inhibited by the addition of an excess of sRAGE. To investigate the possibility that HGA-activated Src could directly regulate PKCα activity, we first measured in L6 myotubes PKCα tyrosine phosphorylation after HGA incubation for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3a, HGA induced a 3-fold increase of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCα. This effect was abolished in the presence of PP1.FIGURE 2sRAGE abrogates HGA-activated Src and PKCα activation in L6 skeletal muscle cells. a, L6 skeletal muscle cells were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml HA or HGA for 24 h in the absence or in the presence of 50 μg/ml sRAGE.

https://openalex.org/W2093051682,"Signaling networks respond to diverse stimuli, but how the state of the signaling network is relayed to downstream cellular responses is unclear. We modeled how incremental activation of signaling molecules is transmitted to control apoptosis as a function of signal strength and dynamic range. A linear relationship between signal input and response output, with the dynamic range of signaling molecules uniformly distributed across activation states, most accurately predicted cellular responses. When nonlinearized signals with compressed dynamic range relay network activation to apoptosis, we observe catastrophic, stimulus-specific prediction failures. We develop a general computational technique, “model-breakpoint analysis,” to analyze the mechanism of these failures, identifying new time- and stimulus-specific roles for Akt, ERK, and MK2 kinase activity in apoptosis, which were experimentally verified. Dynamic range is rarely measured in signal-transduction studies, but our experiments using model-breakpoint analysis suggest it may be a greater determinant of cell fate than measured signal strength."

To investigate the activity of ABCA12, we generated Abca12 null mice and analyzed the impact on skin function and lipid content. Abca12-/- mice are born with a thickened epidermis and die shortly after birth, as water rapidly evaporates from their skin. In vivo skin proliferation measurements suggest a lack of desquamation of the skin cells, rather than enhanced proliferation of basal layer keratinocytes, accounts for the 5-fold thickening of the Abca12-/- stratum corneum. Electron microscopy revealed a loss of the lamellar permeability barrier in Abca12-/- skin. This was associated with a profound reduction in skin linoleic esters of long-chain ω-hydroxyceramides and a corresponding increase in their glucosyl ceramide precursors.

The transport activities of the other members of the ABCA proteins remain to be clarified, but the molecular precedents noted above strongly suggested that ABCA12 would also play a role in lipid transport.

These mice provide a remarkable model of human HI in that they develop a markedly thickened stratum corneum and defects in the skin lipid barrier, as evidenced by electron microscopy and functional assays of tissue water loss. To better characterize the lipid barrier defect, an extensive analysis of the lipid content of the skin of the ABCA12-deficient mice was performed. As ceramides are the major lipid constituent of lamellar sheets in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum, attention was particularly focused on this class of lipids. Using mass spectrometry, we were able to establish that a marked decrease in multiple species of Ceramide 1 (also called Cer(EOS) or esterified ω-hydroxy acid sphingosine) was present in Abca12 null mice. This was associated with a significant increase in the amount of precursor EOS-glucosyl ceramide in the skin, suggesting that a loss of ABCA12 activity leads to a failure to transport glucosylceramides to a location where cleavage of the sugar moiety by glucocerebrosidase can occur. These findings indicate that Abca12 null mice are an excellent model of human harlequin ichthyosis, and they demonstrate that ABCA12 activity is required for the generation of a specific class of lipids that are essential to the formation of the epidermal permeability barrier. Generation and Genotyping of Abca12 Null Mice—Mice that were heterozygous for recombination at the Abca12 locus were obtained through the National Institutes of Health Mutant Mouse Resource Center, University of California, Davis. These mice were generated by replacing exon 9 of Abca12 with a NeoR cassette via homologous recombination. To confirm the genotype of these mice, Southern hybridization was conducted using genomic DNA cleaved with the SpeI restriction endonuclease and a radiolabeled cDNA fragment that hybridizes to intron 7/8 (nucleotides 4440-5010) of the Abca12 locus. This probe detects a band of 15.4 kb in the wild-type locus and 8 kb in the targeted gene. For PCR genotyping, three primer multiplex reactions were used (P1, common, 5′-GGGGCGGTGAGAAGTAAAGTAT-3′; P2, wild-type allele, 5′-GGATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGG-3′; P3, targeted allele, 5′-CTTGGCAGAGTACATCTCAG-3′) that amplify a wild-type product of 356 bp and a targeted product of 271 bp. F2 heterozygous animals (129SvEvBrd × C57BL6/J) were intercrossed to produce homozygous Abca12-/- mice, as well as wild-type and heterozygous littermates. All animal procedures were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care and were conducted in accordance with the USDA Animal Welfare Act and the PHS Policy for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. ABCA12 mRNA Quantitation—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed using the Agilent RNA Bioanalyzer. RNA (1 μg) was reversed transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), and quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed on a Thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Levels of β-actin mRNA were used to normalize ABCA12 mRNA levels. The primer pairs were as follows: ABCA12, 5′-AAGATGCTGACTGGAGACATAATTC-3′ and 5′-GAAATACAAGTGCTCTTCCACAGTT-3′, which amplify exons 46 and 47 of the Abca12 mRNA, and 5′-CATACAAGCCACTGTTATCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CAGAGATTTCGTACCTCTCCTCA-3′, which amplify the β-actin mRNA. In Situ Hybridization—Automated in situ hybridization was performed using the Discovery System (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Sense and antisense probes that hybridize to exons 46-51 of the Abca12 mRNA were generated using digoxigenin-labeled UTP. The efficiency of transcription and incorporation of digoxigenin-UTP to the riboprobes were evaluated by 5% acrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and dot blot on nylon membrane, respectively (DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit, nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Slides were hybridized at 65 °C for 6 h, washed twice in 0.1× SSC buffer at 75 °C, each for 6 min. The detection was performed using biotinylated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) followed by streptavidin-alkaline-phosphatase conjugate and visualized by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate reaction (Ventana BlueMap Detection Kit, Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Slides were counterstained by nuclear fast red (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Immunoblotting Procedures and Generation of an ABCA12 Antibody—Mouse ABCA12 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from adult C57/BL6 skin total RNA, and the sequence was verified on both strands by dideoxy sequencing. An anti-ABCA12 anti-serum was raised against the C-terminal 98 amino acids of murine ABCA12 as we previously described for ABCA1 (23Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A.

The specificity of the sera obtained was confirmed by immunoblotting of lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNAs of ABCA12, ABCA7, or ABCA1, using the ABCA12 antiserum (diluted 1:1000) and pre-immune control serum (diluted 1:1000). The antiserum recognized a band of ∼290 kDa only in lysates of cells transfected with the ABCA12 cDNA. Equal amounts of skin lysates (20 μg of total cell protein in a lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.001% Sigma protease mixture) were electrophoresed on 4-12% or 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 1× PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 1% bovine serum albumin, and were probed with the anti-ABCA12 or anti-ABCA1 antiserum, diluted 1:1000, at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes were washed in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Antibody binding was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of filaggrin solubility and processing, skin lysates were prepared with the buffer as above, or with a denaturing thiocyanate buffer (1 m NaSCn, 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm ortho-phenanthroline, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% isopropanol) as previously described (24Epp N.

Histological, Immunofluorescent, and Ultrastructural Procedures—For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histological analysis, skin samples were fixed overnight (4% formaldehyde, 1× PBS, 4 °C), embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained and imaged using a Nikon Eclipses 50i microscope. For immunofluorescence staining, OCT-embedded skin was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, and sections (5 μm) were fixed (acetone:methanol (1:1), -20 °C) and blocked with Superblock (Thermo Scientific) (26Weiner L.

Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 dye (1 μg/ml, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1× PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich), and slides were imaged using a Nikon OPTIPHOT photomicroscope (Nikon Eclipse E 800). For electron microscopy studies, skin taken from littermate E18.5 embryos was prepared and imaged as described previously (27Hou S.Y. Mitra A.K. White S.H. Menon G.K. Ghadially R. Elias P.M. J.

In brief, dorsal skin was fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, with 0.06% calcium chloride in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). Skin samples were post-fixed (0.2% ruthenium tetroxide, 0.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.8, room temp in darkness, 30 min), dehydrated, and embedded in Epon-812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Ultrathin sections cut on a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome were collected onto Formvar-coated slot grids and examined unstained or after double staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate using a JEOL 1011 transmission electron microscope with an ATM digital camera at 80 kV. A survey of corneocyte interstitial lamellae and granulocyte lamellar storage bodies in the epidermis of littermate-paired E18.5 pups (Abca12+/+ and Abca12-/-; n = 3) was carried out on 100 micrographs at magnifications of 80,000-120,000. In Utero BrdUrd Incorporation and Imaging—Pregnant mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 100 μg/g, Invitrogen) and sacrificed 1 h later as described with the following modifications (28Horsley V.

Dorsal skin from the labeled E18.5 embryos was embedded, sectioned, and fixed as described above, and slides were stained with an anti-BrdU antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma-Aldrich). IP Lab Spectrum software (4.0) was used to quantify the area of BrdUrd-positive nuclei per area of epidermal tissue (Scanalytics, Rockville, MD). Average values derived from five images of each embryo sample were compared (Abca12+/+, n = 3 and Abca12-/-, n = 4). Skin Permeability Assays—Dye penetration assays were performed with toluidine blue as previously described (29Hardman M.J. Sisi P. Banbury D.N. Byrne C. Development. 1998; 125: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, E18.5 embryos were dehydrated by incubations in 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% methanol/PBS (1 min per incubation). The embryos were washed in PBS and stained in 0.0125% toluidine blue for 10 min. After staining, embryos were immediately washed in PBS three times and photographed. Trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured in 1-cm2 skin sections using a gravimetric assay as previously described (30Ting S.B. Caddy J. Hislop N. Wilanowski T. Auden A. Zhao L.L. Ellis S. Kaur P. Uchida Y. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Science. 2005; 308: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Lipid-profiling Procedures—Phospholipids in skin lysates from individual E18.5 embryos were determined using an electrospray ionization-MS/MS approach as reported previously (16Fitzgerald M.L. Xavier R. Haley K.J. Welti R. Goss J.L. Brown C.E. Zhuang D.Z. Bell S.A. Lu N. McKee M. Seed B. Freeman M.W. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In brief, skin (∼5-10 mg) cleaned of all subcutaneous tissue (Abca12+/+ and Abca12-/- E18.5 embryos, n = 5) was minced with scissors and vortex-homogenized with steel beads in 0.5 ml of 1× PBS (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK). Homogenate was extracted with 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/distilled water (1:1:0.5, v/v), and two 0.5-ml chloroform extractions. Combined organic phases were wash with 0.5 ml of KCl (1 m, 1×) and with 0.5 ml of dH20 (2×) and dried with N2 gas. Samples were resuspended in 1 ml of chloroform, and phospholipid scans were performed as described (16Fitzgerald M.L. Xavier R. Haley K.J. Welti R. Goss J.L. Brown C.E. Zhuang D.Z. Bell S.A. Lu N.

To analyze ceramides and glucosylceramides, additional scans were performed for precursors of m/z 264 in the positive mode (collision energy, 50 V) for GlcCers and high mass Cers and neutral loss of m/z 316 in the negative mode (collision energy, 50 V) for low mass Cers. Internal standards for quantitating these sphingolipids were d18:1/14:0Cer and d18:1/12:0GalCer. Levels of free fatty acids in skin lysates from individual E18.5 embryos were determined by methyl esterification (22Kim W.S. Fitzgerald M.L. Kang K. Okuhira K. Bell S.A. Manning J.J. Koehn S.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 3989-3995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar): samples were mixed with methanol:methylene chloride and acetyl chloride, incubated for 1 h at 75 °C, cooled, and then 7% potassium carbonate was added. Lipids were extracted with hexane, washed with acetonitrile and injected (splitless) into an Agilent 6890 gas chromatography-MS (G2613A system, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a Supelcowax-10 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film, Supelco, Bellafonte, PA). The temperature program for the gas chromatography oven was as follows: Initial temperature 150 °C for 2 min, increased to 200 °C (10 °C/min), held at 200 °C for 4 min, increased to 240 °C (5 °C/min), held at 240 °C for 3 min, and finally increased to 270 °C (10 °C/min) and held at 270 °C for 5 min. A model 5973N mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies) in scan mode and coupled with Enhanced Chemstation G1701CA version C software was used to identify the generated mass spectra by comparison to a spectral library created from known fatty acids. The amount of each fatty acid species was quantified relative to an internal standard of heptadecanoic acid (17:0) added to the samples before extraction. Total cholesterol in the skin was determined as previously described (31Moore K.J. Kunjathoor V.V. Koehn S.L. Manning J.J. Tseng A.A. Silver J.M. McKee M. Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2192-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test with sample sizes indicated in the figure legends for each comparison that was made. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Homozygous Null Abca12-/- Mutations in Mice Result in Neonatal Lethality and Epidermal Hyperkeratosis—The targeting strategy used to produce mice lacking ABCA12 is shown in Fig. 1A. To confirm that the heterozygous mice we obtained from the NIH Mutant Mouse Resource had the correctly rearranged gene structure, we performed Southern blot analysis. Appropriate homologous recombination leading to the deletion of exon 9 was confirmed in E18.5 embryos derived from Abca12+/- heterozygous matings (Fig. 1B). One or both wild-type 15.4-kb SpeI fragments were replaced by an 8.0-kb band in animals heterozygous or homozygous, respectively, for the targeted gene locus. Having established by Southern blot that the desired homologous recombination at exon 9 of the Abca12 locus had occurred in parental strains, high throughput genotyping of mouse offspring was subsequently performed using an assay that enabled all three potential genotypes to be determined in a single, multiplexed PCR reaction (Fig. 1B). To establish that the gene rearrangement led to loss of expression of ABCA12, assays of both ABCA12 mRNA and protein levels were performed. ABCA12 message levels in the skin were first determined using reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR amplifications of exons (46 and 47) downstream of the deleted exon 9. Fig. 1C demonstrates that, although wild-type animals have readily detected levels of ABCA12 mRNA, null mice do not. These data indicate that the targeted deletion of exon 9 results in the production of an mRNA that is either unstable or poorly transcribed. These in vitro amplification results were confirmed by an in situ hybridization assay using a probe encompassing exons 46 to 51. ABCA12 mRNA was detected in the skin of wild-type animals by the antisense probe, but the same probe was unable to generate any signal of ABCA12 expression in animals homozygous for the targeted deletion (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the RNA analyses, immunoblots of proteins extracted from epidermis revealed no ABCA12 protein in null mice, but a band of the expected size was presented in heterozygotes and wild-type mice. All three groups of mice had similar levels of expression of the closely related ABCA1 transporter (Fig. 1E). In composite, these results indicate that deletion of exon 9 of Abca12 prevents expression of ABCA12. Abrogation of ABCA12 expression led to death in mice, as no homozygous null animals survived the immediate postnatal period. However, if day 18.5 embryos were genotyped, near Mendelian frequencies of each genotype were obtained (wt:het: null, 104:155:72). Larger genotyping studies will be needed to determine whether Abca12-/- animals have slightly reduced viability in utero, as suggested by the genotyping results, but the absence of the transporter is clearly compatible with embryonic development to term. After birth, if the null animals are kept in an ambient air environment, mortality is universal, indicating a vital role for ABCA12 in survival ex utero. To investigate the cause of death of Abca12-/- mice, studies were carried out on late term E18.5 embryos delivered by cesarean section. When kept hydrated, the weight of Abca12-/- embryos was indistinguishable from that of wild-type and heterozygous littermates (wt, 0.96 ± 0.28 g, n = 16; heterozygous, 1.06 ± 0.26 g, n = 22; null 1.02 ± 0.21 g, n = 20; p = 0.44 wt versus null) (Fig. 2A). However, when exposed to ambient temperature and humidity, the Abca12-/- pups rapidly dehydrated within a matter of minutes, with their skin contracting and encasing them in a collodion-like shell (Fig. 2B). Consistent with a specific defect in skin function, histological analysis showed a markedly hyperkeratotic stratum corneum in the Abca12-/- mice (Fig. 2C). Further histological analysis did not reveal gross pathologies of the other major organs, including the lungs, which the Abca12-/- neonates were able to aerate, and which contain surfactant and type II pneumatocyte lamellar bodies as determined by electron microscopic analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). Loss of the Interstitial Lamellar Barrier in the Abca12-/- Skin Increases Trans-epidermal Water Loss—The markedly thicken stratum corneum observed in the Abca12-/- animals and their rapid demise after birth suggested that the loss of ABCA12 activity had disrupted their epidermal permeability barrier. To test this hypothesis, E18.5 Abca12-/- embryos were stained with toluidine blue, a dye that does not penetrate the epidermis upon formation of the permeability barri"

As NMDARs are permeable to Ca2+ and monovalent cations, they could alter release directly by increasing presynaptic Ca2+ or indirectly by axonal depolarization sufficient to activate voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs). Using two-photon microscopy to measure Ca2+ excursions, we found that somatic depolarization or focal activation of dendritic NMDARs elicited small Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities of cerebellar stellate cell interneurons. These axonal transients resulted from Ca2+ entry through VSCCs that were opened by the electrotonic spread of the NMDAR-mediated depolarization elicited in the dendrites. In contrast, we were unable to detect direct activation of NMDARs on axons, indicating an exclusive somatodendritic expression of functional NMDARs. In cerebellar stellate cells, dendritic NMDAR activation masquerades as a presynaptic phenomenon and may influence Ca2+-dependent forms of presynaptic plasticity and release.

NMDARs are found throughout the central nervous system and contribute to synaptic excitability and intracellular Ca2+ transients. NMDARs were once thought to be expressed exclusively in somatodendritic membranes, concentrated at the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses (Fagg and Matus, 1984Fagg G.E. Matus A.

An emerging view suggests that NMDARs are also expressed in axons because NMDAR activation can alter spontaneous and action potential-evoked transmitter release (Berretta and Jones, 1996Berretta N.

Given the Ca2+ dependence of neurotransmitter release and modulation (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar), these results imply that there is a close spatial association of NMDARs and presynaptic release sites because of the limited intracellular diffusion of NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ entry (Mainen et al., 1999Mainen Z.F. Malinow R. Svoboda K.

However, results from dentate granule cells and cortical pyramidal cells indicate that subthreshold somatodendritic depolarizations can enhance axonal release by passively depolarizing axonal release sites (Alle and Geiger, 2006Alle H. Geiger J.R.P. Combined analog and action potential coding in hippocampal mossy fibers.Science. 2006; 311: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Shu et al., 2006Shu Y. Hasenstaub A. Duque A. Yu Y. McCormick D.A. Modulation of intracortical synaptic potentials by presynaptic somatic membrane potential.Nature. 2006; 441: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is possible, then, that potentiation of release by NMDARs is caused, at least in part, by somatodendritic NMDAR activation and passive propagation of the resulting depolarization to axonal release sites. Stellate cells are a class of interneuron located in the molecular layer of cerebellar cortex (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974Palay S.L. Chan-Palay V. Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization. Springer-Verlag, New York1974Crossref Google Scholar). They express NMDARs in an atypical pattern in their dendrites in that they surround the postsynaptic density rather than reside within it (Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002Clark B.A. Cull-Candy S.G. Activity-dependent recruitment of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation at an AMPA receptor-only synapse.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4428-4436PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies report that NMDARs are also expressed on the axons of stellate cells. In the absence of action potentials, bath application of NMDA increases the rate of spontaneous exocytotic release of GABA from stellate cells onto Purkinje cells (Glitsch and Marty, 1999Glitsch M. Marty A. Presynaptic effects of NMDA in cerebellar Purkinje cells and interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 511-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Duguid and Smart, 2004Duguid I.C. Smart T.G.

Linden D.L. An NMDA receptor/Nitric Oxide cascade is involved in cerebellar LTD but is not localized to the parallel fiber terminal.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, direct detection of presynaptic NMDA receptors remains elusive (Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002Clark B.A. Cull-Candy S.G. Activity-dependent recruitment of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation at an AMPA receptor-only synapse.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4428-4436PubMed Google Scholar), and the contribution of somatodendritic NMDARs to axonal Ca2+ elevation has not been determined. In this study, we have investigated the distribution of NMDARs in stellate cells using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and Ca2+ imaging. We find that NMDARs are expressed on dendrites but not on axons. However, Ca2+ transients are evoked in axons by activation of dendritic NMDARs either by exogenous agonists or synaptic stimulation. NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ transients in stellate cell axons result from VSCCs opened by passive spread of the dendritic NMDAR depolarization. Our results suggest that NMDAR depolarization-mediated Ca2+ transients in axons will have a profound influence on release. To probe for NMDAR activity, we imaged Ca2+ transients evoked by bath-applied NMDA (10 μM) in the axons and dendrites of stellate cells in rat cerebellar slices (0 mM Mg2+, 0.5 μM TTX). Cells were filled through the patch pipette with the red fluophore Alexa 594 (50 μM) to visualize cell morphology and the green calcium indicator Fluo-5F (200 μM) for measuring Ca2+ transients. After loading, dendrites and axons were easily resolved (Figure 1A). Axons were distinguished by a long, complex plexus of collaterals studded with varicosities, whereas dendrites were short and not varicose (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974Palay S.L. Chan-Palay V. Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization. Springer-Verlag, New York1974Crossref Google Scholar). Images of dendrites during NMDA application revealed large increases in intracellular Ca2+ in current-clamped stellate cells (Figure 1B), consistent with the activation of Ca2+-permeable NMDARs (MacDermott et al., 1986MacDermott A.B. Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Smith S.J. Barker J.L. NMDA-receptor activation increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration in cultured spinal cord neurones.Nature. 1986; 321: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Concurrent with the rise in Ca2+, NMDA application also resulted in a significant depolarization (17.7 ± 0.6 mV, n = 28) of the stellate cell as recorded in the soma (Figure 1B). The large magnitude of the NMDAR-mediated response is attributable to the absence of extracellular Mg2+ that, when present, blocks NMDARs in a voltage-dependent manner (Mayer et al., 1984Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Guthrie P.B. Voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ of NMDA responses in spinal cord neurones.Nature. 1984; 309: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, Nowak et al., 1984Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Magnesium gates glutamate-activated channels in mouse central neurons.Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). For example, with 1 mM extracellular Mg2+, 30 μM NMDA, the concentration used in previous reports (Glitsch and Marty, 1999Glitsch M. Marty A. Presynaptic effects of NMDA in cerebellar Purkinje cells and interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 511-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Huang and Bordey, 2004Huang H. Bordey A.

It is unlikely that Ca2+ influx through VSCCs contributed significantly to the NMDA-evoked Ca2+ transient recorded in the dendrite because direct depolarization by somatic current injection resulted in very little Ca2+ elevation (Figure 1B). We then imaged the bead-like varicosities along axons for NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx (Shin and Linden, 2005Shin J.H. Linden D.L. An NMDA receptor/Nitric Oxide cascade is involved in cerebellar LTD but is not localized to the parallel fiber terminal.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) where the activation of axonal NMDARs is thought to increase the rate of spontaneous inhibitory neurotransmission (Glitsch and Marty, 1999Glitsch M. Marty A. Presynaptic effects of NMDA in cerebellar Purkinje cells and interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 511-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Duguid and Smart, 2004Duguid I.C. Smart T.G.

Axon varicosities are hot spots of action potential-evoked Ca2+ entry (Figure 1C1) indicative of clustered VSCC activity and therefore are presumed en passant sites of release (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974Palay S.L. Chan-Palay V. Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization. Springer-Verlag, New York1974Crossref Google Scholar, Llano et al., 1997Llano I. Tan Y.P. Caputo C.

Action potential-evoked Ca2+ signals and calcium channels in the axons of developing cerebellar interneurons.J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We found that bath application of NMDA (10 and 30 μM; 0 and 1 mM Mg2+, respectively) also resulted in an elevation of Ca2+ in axon varicosities (Figures 1C2 and 1D, ΔG/R = 0.0219 ± 0.0043, n = 30; ΔG/R = 0.0090 ± 0.0005, n = 5, 10, and 30 μM NMDA, respectively, p = 0.24). However, the Ca2+ rise in axons was much smaller than that recorded in dendrites (p < 0.05). In contrast to dendrites, matching the NMDA-induced depolarization by somatic current injection resulted in a Ca2+ elevation in the axon that was indistinguishable from the transient evoked by bath-applied NMDA (n = 4, p = 0.64; Figure 1C2). This suggests that NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ elevation in axon varicosities is controlled by membrane potential and VSCCs rather than direct Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors. If axonal NMDARs mediate the depolarization underlying Ca2+ accumulation in axon varicosities, then bath NMDA-evoked Ca2+ transients should be observed throughout the axonal arbor. However, we found that NMDA-evoked Ca2+ transients in proximal axon varicosities were often much larger than those evoked in distal varicosities (Figure 1D). Nonlinear regression analysis revealed an inverse correlation (r2 = 0.98) between the amplitude of the Ca2+ increase in axon varicosities and distance from the soma. A monoexponential fit of binned data (50 μm bins) yielded a decay length constant of 212 μm. We therefore propose that NMDA-evoked Ca2+ elevation in axons results from an NMDAR depolarization originating in the somatodendritic compartment that passively propagates into the axon. To determine whether depolarization resulting from selective activation of dendritic NMDARs is sufficient to control axonal Ca2+ entry without the concomitant activation of axonal NMDARs, we used iontophoresis of the NMDAR agonist L-aspartate to locally activate NMDARs on stellate cell dendrites (Figure 2A1) in the presence of TTX (0.5 μM). In current-clamped cells, dendritic iontophoresis of L-aspartate (−50 to −200 nA; 10–50 ms) elicited brief NMDAR-mediated potentials (29.8 ± 1.7 mV, n = 13; Figure 2A2) that resembled EPSPs (see Figure 7A2) and evoked Ca2+ transients in dendrites near the iontophoretic pipette (Figures 2B and 2C). The NMDAR antagonist (R)-CPP (20 μM) blocked the Ca2+ transient evoked by iontophoresis (ΔG/R 5.9% ± 4.3% of control, n = 7; Figure 2C), indicating that the Ca2+ transient was NMDAR mediated. We found that dendritic L-aspartate iontophoresis also evoked Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities (Figure 2D). These transients were much smaller in amplitude than action potential-evoked Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities or the Ca2+ transients evoked by iontophoresis recorded in the dendrite (Figures 2D and 2E). We confirmed that the axonal Ca2+ transient depended on the NMDAR-mediated depolarization originating in the dendrite by voltage clamping the soma. This manipulation prevents the passive propagation of dendritic depolarization into the axon and eliminated iontophoresis-evoked Ca2+ entry in axon varicosities (Figures 2F and 2H). This observation is reminiscent of experiments in dentate granule cells and cortical pyramidal cells showing that subthreshold depolarizations originating in the somatodendritic domain can passively propagate into axons (Alle and Geiger, 2006Alle H. Geiger J.R.P. Combined analog and action potential coding in hippocampal mossy fibers.Science. 2006; 311: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Shu et al., 2006Shu Y. Hasenstaub A. Duque A. Yu Y. McCormick D.A. Modulation of intracortical synaptic potentials by presynaptic somatic membrane potential.Nature. 2006; 441: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Similarly, somatic voltage clamp dramatically reduced the bath NMDA-evoked Ca2+ transient recorded in axon varicosities (ΔG/R 25.3% ± 7.5% of current clamp, n = 3; p < 0.05), suggesting a similar pathway of Ca2+ entry. The Ca2+ component remaining in voltage clamp probably reflects diffusion of Ca2+ from the dendrite into the axon during prolonged bath application of NMDA. In contrast, somatic voltage clamp did not alter the dendritic Ca2+ transient evoked by L-aspartate iontophoresis (Figures 2G and 2H), indicating that the dendritic signal is the result of Ca2+ influx through local NMDARs. Cable theory predicts that nonregenerative potentials will passively decay along lengths of dendrite and axon (Rall, 1969Rall W. Time constants and electrotonic length of membrane cylinders and neurons.Biophys. J. 1969; 9: 1483-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Therefore, distance-dependent shaping of depolarizing potentials that control Ca2+ entry in axon varicosities should be reflected in the amplitude and shape of the evoked Ca2+ transient. As with bath applications of NMDA, the amplitudes of L-aspartate iontophoresis-evoked Ca2+ transients were largest in proximal varicosities and decreased with distance from the soma (ΔG/R = 0.0154 ± 0.0038, n = 17; and ΔG/R = 0.0019 ± 0.0013, n = 7; <150 μm and ≥150 μm, respectively; p < 0.05) (Figures 3A–3C). In addition, there was a trend for faster Ca2+ transients in proximal varicosities; however, small-amplitude transients, especially in distal axonal segments, prevented accurate fitting of rise times for all data points (Figures 3B and 3D). Together, these results indicate that NMDAR-mediated potentials originating in the dendrite can control Ca2+ entry in axon varicosities. It is likely that NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ entry in axon varicosities occurs through VSCCs because this effect depends on membrane potential, and VSCCs are enriched in stellate cell presynaptic specializations (Llano et al., 1997Llano I.

Action potential-evoked Ca2+ signals and calcium channels in the axons of developing cerebellar interneurons.J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, a cocktail of VSCC blockers (ω-conotoxin MVIIC 1 μM, SNX 0.3 μM, ω-agatoxin IVA 0.2 μM, nimodipine 20 μM, and mibefradil 10 μM) greatly reduced the Ca2+ transient evoked in axon varicosities by dendritic-targeted iontophoresis of L-aspartate (Figures 4A and 4D). The unblocked component likely reflects toxin-resistant Ca2+ channels (Tottene et al., 1996Tottene A. Moretti A. Pietrobon D.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13420-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), given that action potential-evoked Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities were blocked to a similar extent (Figures 4B and 4D). In contrast, iontophoresis-evoked Ca2+ transients in dendrites were unaltered by VSCC blockers (Figures 4C and 4D), indicating that most Ca2+ entry in this compartment was directly through NMDARs. Our results indicate that NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ entry in axon varicosities does not result from direct influx through axonal NMDARs but rather that NMDAR-mediated depolarization, most likely from dendritic receptors, results in Ca2+ influx through VSCCs. If NMDARs were expressed on the axon, then axonal L-aspartate iontophoresis would increase axonal Ca2+ directly through NMDARs. However, in voltage-clamped cells, L-aspartate iontophoresis failed to evoke Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities when focally applied near the axon (ΔG/R = 0.0004 ± 0.0002, n = 33; Figures 5A and 5B). Iontophoresis of L-aspartate onto dendrites prior to and following axonal application elicited large Ca2+ transients in the dendrites (Figures 5A and 5B) and inward currents (−24.3 ± 3.8 pA, n = 10) in somatic electrical recordings, confirming the reliability of iontophoresis within single-cell experiments. No current was detected when L-aspartate was applied near the axon (−0.2 ± 0.1 pA, n = 24), similar to the results of Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002Clark B.A. Cull-Candy S.G. Activity-dependent recruitment of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation at an AMPA receptor-only synapse.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4428-4436PubMed Google Scholar. Fluorescence measurements obtained from axon varicosities following direct iontophoretic stimulation were unchanged by (R)-CPP (20 μM) (ΔG/R 114.8% ± 29.3% of control, n = 15), confirming that axon varicosities lack functional NMDARs. It is unlikely that low-density NMDAR expression mediated Ca2+ transients that were below detection threshold, given that two-photon fluorescence imaging has the sensitivity to detect Ca2+ entry through single channels (Sabatini and Svoboda, 2000Sabatini B.L. Svoboda K. Analysis of calcium channels in single spines using optical fluctuation analysis.Nature. 2000; 408: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Nimchinsky et al., 2004Nimchinsky E.A.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures). To examine a larger axonal area than afforded by line scans, frame scans were used to image small regions of axons (Figures 6A–6D). As with line scans, we were unable to detect elevations of Ca2+ in axonal varicosities following iontophoretic application of L-aspartate near the axon of interest (ΔG/R = 0.0006 ± 0.0005, n = 14). Action potential-evoked Ca2+ transients confirmed that the selected sites were hot spots of Ca2+ entry (Figure 6C). In addition, NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ transients were not detected in axon segments between varicosities (ΔG/R = 0.0004 ± 0.0006, n = 9; Figures 6C and 6D). These results suggest that the entire axonal arbor is devoid of functional NMDARs. Therefore, dendritic NMDARs must provide the sole source of depolarization responsible for NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ entry in axon varicosities. We next determined whether synaptic stimulation could produce NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities similar to those evoked by bath-applied NMDA and dendritic L-aspartate iontophoresis. Subthreshold NMDAR-mediated EPSPs (17.6 ± 0.7 mV, n = 23) were evoked in current-clamped cells by extracellular stimulation (50 Hz, 80–140 ms) of parallel fibers (PFs) near the dendritic arbor (Figures 7A1 and 7A2). PF stimulation elicited large Ca2+ transients localized to dendrites near the stimulating pipette (ΔG/R = 0.1994 ± 0.0338, n = 8; Figures 7B and S1A). The spatial extent of Ca2+ accumulation was larger than expected from single synapses (Soler-Llavian and Sabatini, 2006Soler-Llavian G.J. Sabatini B.L. Synapse-specific plasticity and compartmentalized signaling in cerebellar stellate cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), owing to the stimulation of multiple PFs, the extrasynaptic localization of NMDARs, and glutamate spillover (Carter and Regehr, 2000Carter A.G. Regehr W.G. Prolonged synaptic currents and glutamate at the parallel fiber to stellate cell synapse.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4423-4434PubMed Google Scholar, Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002Clark B.A. Cull-Candy S.G. Activity-dependent recruitment of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation at an AMPA receptor-only synapse.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4428-4436PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ transients were also evoked in axon varicosities by dendrite-targeted PF stimulation (Figure 7B). These Ca2+ transients were smaller than those evoked by dendritic iontophoresis (ΔG/R = 0.0110 ± 0.0029, n = 24; and ΔG/R = 0.0027 ± 0.0006, n = 37, iontophoretic and synaptic stimulation, respectively; p < 0.05) most likely because iontophoretically evoked potentials were larger in amplitude (p < 0.05). (R)-CPP (20 μM) blocked PF-evoked Ca2+ transients in both dendrites and axon varicosities (ΔG/R 2.8% ± 1.9% of control, n = 3; and 1.0% ± 6.3% of control, n = 5; dendrites and axon varicosities, respectively) confirming that the transients were NMDAR mediated (Figures S1B and S1C). As with iontophoretic stimulation of dendritic NMDARs, somatic voltage clamp greatly reduced the PF-evoked Ca2+ transient recorded in axon varicosities but not in the dendrite (ΔG/R 13.8% ± 9.0%, n = 7; and 95.7% ± 1.8% of control amplitude, n = 5, axon varicosity and dendrite, respectively; p < 0.05; Figures 7C1 and 7C2), indicating that the passive propagation of somatodendritic depolarization evoked axonal Ca2+ entry. Positioning the stimulating pipette adjacent to axon varicosities so that local PFs were excited failed to elevate Ca2+ (Figures 7D and 7E), again suggesting that there are no functional axonal NMDARs. That axonal Ca2+ transients evoked by dendritic PF stimulation rely on passive propagation of somatic depolarizations is further supported by the dependence of their amplitudes on the distance from the soma (Figure S2). Nonlinear regression analysis revealed that the amplitude of these axonal Ca2+ transients was inversely correlated (r2 = 0.89) with distance from the soma with a monoexponential fit (50 μm bins) yielding a decay length constant of 60 μm (Figure S2C). In contrast, the amplitude of action potential-evoked Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities varied irrespective of distance (r2 = 0.03). Axonal expression of NMDARs has been reported in many regions of the CNS (Berretta and Jones, 1996Berretta N. Jones R.S.

How do central excitatory synapses mediate behavioral outputs accurately matched to sensory inputs over a wide dynamic range? Here we demonstrate that vestibular afferent synapses in vitro express frequency-independent transmission that spans their in vivo dynamic range (5–150 spikes/s). As a result, the synaptic charge transfer per unit time is linearly related to vestibular afferent activity in both projection and intrinsic neurons of the vestibular nuclei. Neither postsynaptic glutamate receptor desensitization nor saturation affect the relative amplitude or frequency-independence of steady-state transmission. Finally, we show that vestibular nucleus neurons can transduce synaptic inputs into linear changes in firing rate output without relying on one-to-one calyceal transmission. These data provide a physiological basis for the remarkable linearity of vestibular reflexes."

The role of ADF/cofilin activation in the regulation of actin dynamics and tension development during the contractile activation of smooth muscle was evaluated in intact canine tracheal smooth muscle tissues. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that ADF and cofilin exist in similar proportions in the muscle tissues, and that ∼40% of the total ADF/cofilin in unstimulated tissues is phosphorylated. Phospho-ADF/cofilin decreased concurrently with tension development in response to stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) or potassium depolarization indicating the activation of ADF/cofilin. Expression of an inactive phospho-cofilin mimetic (cofilin S3E) but not wild type cofilin in the smooth muscle tissues inhibited endogenous ADF/cofilin dephosphorylation and ACh-induced actin polymerization. Expression of cofilin S3E in the tissues depressed tension development in response to ACh, but it did not affect myosin light chain phosphorylation. The ACh-induced dephosphorylation of ADF/cofilin required the Ca2+-dependent activation of calcineurin (PP2B).

Actin monomers (G-actin) add preferentially to the fast growing (barbed) ends of the actin filaments; the availability of barbed ends is critical for the addition of G-actin monomers to existing actin filaments (3Condeelis J.

The activity of ADF/cofilin is regulated by phosphorylation at a single site on the amino terminus, serine 3, which inhibits its activity. Phosphorylation at this site abolishes the ability of ADF/cofilin to bind to F-actin and thus inhibits its severing function (1Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S.

We hypothesized that ADF/cofilin might play an important role in the regulation of actin dynamics in smooth muscle during contractile activation. In this study, we analyzed the effect of contractile activation on the phosphorylation of ADF/cofilin at Ser-3. To evaluate the function of ADF/cofilin in regulating actin dynamics and tension generation during contraction of smooth muscle tissues, we expressed an inactive cofilin phosphomimetic (cofilin S3E) in the tissues, which has minimal actin severing activity (23Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that ADF/cofilin undergoes dephosphorylation in response to contractile stimulation in smooth muscle tissues and that ADF/cofilin dephosphorylation is necessary for both actin polymerization and active tension generation. We conclude that the activation of ADF/cofilin is a necessary step for the dynamic reorganization of actin that occurs during the contraction of smooth muscle tissues. Preparation of Smooth Muscle Tissues and Measurement of Force—Mongrel dogs (20–25 kg) were euthanized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg intravenously) and quickly exsanguinated. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Indiana University School of Medicine. A segment of the trachea was immediately removed and immersed in physiological saline solution (PSS) at 22 °C containing (mm): 110 NaCl, 3.4 KCl, 2.4 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 25.8 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, and 5.6 glucose. PSS was aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.4. Smooth muscle was dissected free of connective tissue and epithelium and cut into strips (1 mm wide × 0.2–0.5 mm thick × 15 mm long). Muscle strips were placed in PSS at 37 °C in a 25-ml organ bath and attached to a force transducer for measurement of force. At the beginning of each experiment, the optimal length (Lo) for muscle contraction was determined by progressively increasing the length of the muscle until the active isometric force elicited by ACh reached a maximum. All tissues were then maintained at Lo for 30–60 min without stimulation. For experiments involving the introduction of plasmids encoding cofilin proteins, muscle strips were then subjected to the reversible permeabilization procedure described below. Two days were then allowed for expression of the recombinant proteins, at which time the active isometric force in response to ACh at Lo was determined again.

After initial equilibration and contraction to 10-5 m ACh to obtain maximal force, muscle strips were attached to metal mounts at Lo. The strips were incubated successively in each of the following solutions: Solution 1 (at 4 °C for 120 min) containing (mm): 10 EGTA, 5 Na2ATP, 120 KCl, 2 MgCl2, and 20 TES; solution 2 (at 4 °C overnight) containing (mm): 0.1 EGTA, 5 Na2ATP, 120 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 20 TES, and 10 μg/ml plasmids; Solution 3 (at 4 °C for 30 min) containing (mm): 0.1 EGTA, 5 Na2ATP, 120 KCl, 10 MgCl2, 20 TES; and solution 4 (at 22 °C for 60 min) containing (mm): 110 NaCl, 3.4 KCl, 0.8 MgSO4, 25.8 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, and 5.6 dextrose. Solutions 1–3 were maintained at pH 7.1 and aerated with 100% O2. Solution 4 was maintained at pH 7.4 and aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. After 30 min in Solution 4, CaCl2 was added gradually to reach a final concentration of 2.4 mm. The strips were then incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 days in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm Na2ATP, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml plasmids encoding human wild type cofilin or the inactive mutant cofilin S3E. Analysis of ADF/Cofilin Phosphorylation—ADF/cofilin isoforms and phosphorylation were analyzed by one-dimensional and by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Muscle tissues were rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen-cooled tongs and pulverized using a mortar and pestle. Pulverized muscle tissues were mixed with extraction buffer containing the following: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100, 0.4% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm molybdate, and 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride) and protease inhibitors (2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For one-dimensional electrophoresis, each sample was centrifuged for the collection of supernatant, and the supernatant was then boiled in sample buffer (1.5% dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. To measure ADF/cofilin phosphorylation, the nitrocellulose membrane was simultaneously probed with antibodies to phospho-Ser-3 ADF/cofilin and cofilin, followed by fluorophore-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins. Fluorescence signals were detected and analyzed using an Odyssey fluorescence scanner (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). For two-dimensional PAGE, protein was precipitated from smooth muscle tissue protein extracts using a methanol/chloroform/water mixture (26Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). The precipitated total smooth muscle protein was redissolved in ReadyPrep two-dimensional sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing was performed in a PROTEAN IEF cell with 11-cm IPG strips pH 3–10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The focused proteins were then separated by means of an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). ADF and cofilin were detected using a polyclonal anti-ADF/cofilin antibody that reacts with both ADF and cofilin (24Shaw A.E. Minamide L.S. Bill C.L. Funk J.D. Maiti S. Bamburg J.R. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2611-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ratios of phosphorylated ADF and phosphorylated cofilin to total ADF and total cofilin and the amount of recombinant cofilin expression were analyzed by scanning densitometry. Measurement of Regulatory Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—Frozen muscle strips were immersed in dry ice precooled acetone containing 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were extracted in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris base, 22 mm glycine, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated myosin lights chains (MLCs) were separated by urea-glycerol PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed using antibody to the 20-kDa myosin light chain (15Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1145-C1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Zhang W.W. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 572: 659-676Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated MLC was determined by scanning densitometry. Analysis of F-actin and G-actin—The relative proportions of F-actin and G-actin in smooth muscle tissues were analyzed using a standard assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) as described previously (15Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1145-C1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27Zhang W.W. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 572: 659-676Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, each of the tracheal smooth muscle strips was homogenized in 200 μl of F-actin stabilization buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Non-idet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% antifoam, 1 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 500 μg/ml tosyl arginine methyl ester). Supernatants of the protein extracts were collected after centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 37 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold distilled water containing 10 μm cytochalasin D and then incubated on ice for 1 h to depolymerize F-actin. The resuspended pellets were gently mixed every 15 min. Four microliters of supernatant (G-actin) and pellet (F-actin) fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The ratios of F-actin to G-actin were determined using densitometry. Statistical Analysis—Comparisons between the two groups were performed using paired Student's t tests. Comparisons among multiple groups were performed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Values refer to the number of tissues used to obtain mean values. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Contractile Stimulation of Tracheal Smooth Muscle Tissues Induces ADF/Cofilin Dephosphorylation on Ser-3 (Fig. 1)—Canine tracheal smooth muscle strips were maintained for 30 min without contractile stimulation and then contracted isometrically with 10-5 m ACh for 15 or 30 s or 1, 5, or 15 min or left unstimulated. ADF/cofilin phosphorylation on Ser-3 was elevated in unstimulated tissues and decreased significantly in response to ACh stimulation. The decrease in ADF/cofilin phosphorylation was evident 15 s (0.25 min) after stimulation with ACh and persisted for the duration of the contraction (Fig. 1, A and B). Differences in ADF/cofilin phosphorylation in ACh-stimulated and unstimulated tissues were statistically significant at all time points (n = 6, p < 0.05). The time course of the decrease in ADF/cofilin phosphorylation was similar to the time course of the increase in force development in response to ACh stimulation. ADF/cofilin phosphorylation 30 or 60 min after stimulation with ACh was not significantly different from ADF/cofilin phosphorylation at 15 min, suggesting that the activation of ADF/cofilin was sustained for the duration of the contraction (data not shown). We also evaluated whether the decline in ADF/cofilin phosphorylation during contractile stimulation was dependent on a receptor-mediated mechanism. Muscles were stimulated with 60 mm KCl, and ADF/cofilin phosphorylation was analyzed 15 and 30 min after stimulation. ADF/cofilin phosphorylation decreased significantly to 61 ± 5% (p < 0.05, n = 6) in response to KCl stimulation, and the decrease in ADF/cofilin phosphorylation persisted for the 30 min duration of the contraction. The decrease in ADF/cofilin phosphorylation was less than during ACh stimulation, but force development in response to KCl stimulation was only about 60% of that observed with ACh stimulation. The results demonstrate that both receptor-mediated agonists and depolarization with KCl stimulate the dephosphorylation of ADF/cofilin and its activation in tracheal smooth muscle tissues. ACh Stimulation Induces Similar Dephosphorylation at Ser-3 of Both Cofilin and ADF in Tracheal Smooth Muscle Tissues (Fig. 2)—We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to determine which isoforms of ADF/cofilin are present in tracheal smooth muscle and to quantitate the effects of stimulation with ACh on their phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). We found that cofilin and ADF were represented in similar proportions (54 ± 2 and 46 ± 2%, respectively) (n = 4). Cofilin2 represented less than 7% of the total ADF/cofilin detected in the muscle tissue. In the unstimulated smooth muscle tissues, the phospho-cofilin was 40 ± 3% of total cofilin, and this proportion decreased to 14 ± 3% with ACh stimulation (Fig. 2B)(n = 4). The proportion of phospho-ADF in unstimulated smooth muscle was 38 ± 4%, and this decreased to 14 ± 1% with ACh stimulation. Expression of the Inactive Cofilin S3E Mutant Inhibits the Dephosphorylation of Endogenous ADF/Cofilin Induced by ACh (Fig. 3)—Plasmids encoding wild type cofilin (cofilin WT) or the inactive phosphomimetic cofilin mutant S3E (cofilin S3E) were introduced into smooth muscle strips by reversible permeabilization. Transfected tissues and control untreated tissues were then maintained in an incubator for 2 days to allow for the expression of recombinant proteins. Muscle tissues were stimulated with 10-5 m ACh for 5 min or left unstimulated and then frozen for the analysis of ADF/cofilin phosphorylation on Ser-3. The amount of total cofilin was 70–80% higher in each group of muscle strips treated with cofilin WT or cofilin S3E compared with tissues without plasmid treatment (n = 5 or 6, p < 0.05), consistent with a robust expression of the recombinant proteins in the transfected tissues (Fig. 3C). There were no significant differences in the amount of cofilin in tissues expressing wild type or mutant cofilin constructs. The amount of P-ADF/cofilin in unstimulated muscle tissues treated with either cofilin WT or cofilin S3E was also significantly higher than in control tissues, reflecting the higher levels of cofilin in these tissues. When the P-ADF/cofilin values were normalized to total cofilin, the amount of phosphorylated ADF/cofilin in the cofilin WT-treated and unstimulated cofilin S3E-treated muscles was not significantly different from untreated muscles. Stimulation with ACh caused a significant decrease in the amount of P-ADF/cofilin in untreated and cofilin WT-treated tissues; when normalized either to GAPDH or to total cofilin. In contrast, ACh did not cause a significant decrease in the amount of phosphorylated ADF/cofilin in muscle tissues treated with cofilin S3E, whether normalized to GAPDH or total cofilin. Thus, expression of the cofilin S3E mutant in the muscle tissues markedly suppressed ADF/cofilin dephosphorylation and activation in response to stimulation with ACh (Fig. 3, A and B). We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to evaluate the effects of expression of cofilin S3E on the phosphorylation of both ADF and cofilin in response to ACh, and to quantify the amount of cofilin S3E in the smooth muscle tissue (Fig. 4, A and B). Cofilin S3E represented 34 ± 5% of the total ADF/cofilin (n = 4). The expression of cofilin S3E caused comparable inhibition of the dephosphorylation of both cofilin and ADF in response to ACh. Expression of Cofilin S3E Inhibits Tension Development in Smooth Muscle Tissues (Fig. 5)—We evaluated the effects of expression of cofilin S3E and cofilin WT on contractile tension 5 min after the stimulation of muscle tissues with 10-5 m ACh. The contractile force generated in response to stimulation with ACh was significantly inhibited in tissues expressing cofilin S3E. The mean tension in cofilin S3E-treated tissues was 52 ± 4.0% of force in untreated or WT-treated tissues (n = 27; p < 0.01). In contrast, the contractile force in tissues expressing the cofilin WT was not significantly different from force in untreated tissues (Fig. 5, A and B). Expression of Inactive Mutant Cofilin S3E Inhibits Actin Polymerization in Response to ACh (Fig. 6)—Smooth muscle strips incubated without plasmids or with plasmids encoding the cofilin S3E or cofilin WT were stimulated with 10-5 m ACh for 5 min, and the proportions of F-actin to G-actin in muscle extracts were analyzed by cell fractionation and immunoblot. Whereas ACh stimulation significantly increased the ratio of F-actin to G-actin in untreated and cofilin WT-treated smooth muscle strips (n = 6; p < 0.05), ACh stimulation did not significantly alter the ratio of F-actin to G-actin in smooth muscle tissues expressing inactive cofilin S3E (Fig. 6A). In tissues treated with cofilin S3E, the ratio of F/G-actin was significantly elevated in unstimulated muscles and significantly depressed in ACh-stimulated muscles relative to untreated or cofilin WT-treated muscles. The effect of ADF/cofilin inactivation on the pools of G-actin and F-actin was evaluated in cofilin S3E, cofilin WT, and untreated muscles (Fig. 6B). Unstimulated muscles treated with cofilin S3E had significantly less G-actin and more F-actin than untreated or cofilin WT-treated muscles (n = 6, p < 0.05). Cofilin WT-treated muscles exhibited a small but statistically significant increase in G-actin and a decrease in F-actin compared with untreated muscles (n = 6, p < 0.05). The results suggest that expression of the cofilin S3E protein inhibited actin polymerization in muscle strips in response to ACh stimulation, and that cofilin S3E inhibited actin depolymerization in unstimulated muscle tissues. Expression of Inactive Cofilin S3E Does Not Affect MLC Phosphorylation in Response to ACh in Smooth Muscle Tissues (Fig. 7)—The effects of stimulation with ACh on MLC phosphorylation were compared in muscle tissues transfected with the plasmids encoding inactive cofilin S3E and cofilin WT and in tissues incubated with no plasmids. There were no significant differences in MLC phosphorylation in unstimulated or ACh-stimulated muscles expressing the inactive cofilin S3E, cofilin WT, or muscles not treated with plasmids (n = 4, p > 0.05). Thus, the inhibition of contraction by cofilin S3E did not affect the signaling pathways that regulate MLC phosphorylation. Depletion of Intracellular Ca2+ from Muscle Tissues or Treatment of the Tissues with Calcineurin Inhibitors Inhibits the Dephosphorylation of ADF/Cofilin Induced by ACh (Fig. 8)—Calcineurin, the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), has been shown to regulate the activation of ADF/cofilin in several non-muscle cell lines (23Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 28Wang Y. Shibasaki F. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12683-12689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We evaluated the Ca2+ dependence of ADF/cofilin activation by depleting intracellular Ca2+ from muscle tissues. Tissues were incubated in Ca2+-free PSS containing 0.1 mm EGTA. The tissues were then repeatedly stimulated for 5-min time periods with ACh until the contractile response decreased to a minimum (29Tang D.D. Mehta D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C250-C258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This generally required ∼60 min and resulted in a reduction of isometric force to less than 10% of the maximal force. ADF/cofilin phosphorylation was then evaluated after ACh stimulation of the Ca2+-depleted tissues for 5 min. The depletion of Ca2+ markedly inhibited the decrease in ADF/cofilin phosphorylation stimulated by ACh (p < 0.05, n = 6). This suggests that the dephosphorylation and activation of ADF/cofilin are mediated by Ca2+-dependent mechanisms in this tissue. Muscle tissues were incubated with the calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporin A (10 μm) or deltamethrin (10 μm), for 2 h to evaluate the role of calcineurin in ADF/cofilin activation during active contraction with ACh (Fig. 9). ADF/cofilin dephosphorylation was inhibited significantly in ACh-stimulated muscle tissues pretreated with calcineurin inhibitors (p < 0.05, n = 5). This suggests that t"
https://openalex.org/W2083836563,"Rapid and selective erasures of certain types of memories in the brain would be desirable under certain clinical circumstances. By employing an inducible and reversible chemical-genetic technique, we find that transient αCaMKII overexpression at the time of recall impairs the retrieval of both newly formed one-hour object recognition memory and fear memories, as well as 1-month-old fear memories. Systematic analyses suggest that excessive αCaMKII activity-induced recall deficits are not caused by disrupting the retrieval access to the stored information but are, rather, due to the active erasure of the stored memories. Further experiments show that the recall-induced erasure of fear memories is highly restricted to the memory being retrieved while leaving other memories intact. Therefore, our study reveals a molecular genetic paradigm through which a given memory, such as new or old fear memory, can be rapidly and specifically erased in a controlled and inducible manner in the brain."

Because of their chemical reactivity with regard to biological macromolecules (proteins, lipids, DNA, and others), free radicals are responsible for major damages when produced in large amounts within living cells (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York, NY2007Google Scholar). On the other hand, there has been an explosive growth in the number of enzymatic reactions found to proceed by mechanisms involving free radicals as intermediates (2Frey P.A. Hegeman A.D. Reed G.H. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3302-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This chemistry implies that enzymes have evolved delicate mechanisms to generate reaction-initiating primary radicals from stable substrates and to control these highly reactive species within the active sites so that they can undergo subsequent steps in the enzymatic process and do not get inactivated through radical coupling or harmful reactions with the protein itself or with oxygen, for example. This represents a fascinating issue in enzymology, and many mysteries of this chemistry remain to be unraveled.

During exposure to UV light of bacterial spores, a dormant form produced by some bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium species, dimerization of adjacent thymine bases in DNA results in the specific formation of 5-(α-thyminyl)-5,6-dihydrothymine, the so-called spore photoproduct SP (Scheme 1A), a lesion that can block replication and transcription and is thus potentially lethal, mutagenic, and cytotoxic (3Donnellan Jr., J.E.

Sporulating bacteria are extremely resistant to UV radiation, because they use SPL early in the spore germination cycle, to very efficiently and specifically revert SP to two unmodified thymines (Scheme 1A) (5Setlow P.

P. Begley, on the basis of model compounds (8Mehl R.A. Begley T.P. Organic Lett. 1999; 1: 1065-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). First, SPL is a “Radical-SAM (S-adenosyl-methionine)” iron-sulfur enzyme (9Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This class of enzymes uses a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, produced from reductive cleavage of AdoMet, to initiate the reaction (Scheme 1B) (10Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Frey P.A. Hegeman A.D. Ruzicka F.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Second, experimental evidence of label transfer to AdoMet from SP in DNA specifically 3H-labeled at C-6 indirectly shows that repair is initiated by abstraction of the C-6 hydrogen atom of SP by the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (12Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1B). The subsequent steps have been less characterized, but it is likely that C–C bond homolytic cleavage follows to give an allyl-type radical together with a first repaired thymine. The last step of the reaction has been proposed to involve hydrogen atom transfer from 5′-deoxyadenosine (AdoH) to the thymine monomer radical (12Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments have indeed shown some label transfer from [5′-3H]AdoMet into thymine monomers, using a DNA substrate containing the SP lesion, thus supporting the mechanism shown in Scheme 1B (12Cheek J.

In this report, we provide evidence for the involvement of the allyl-type radical during in vitro B. subtilis SPL-dependent repair reaction. We took advantage of using pure preparations of a dinucleoside monophosphate substrate named SPTpT in the following (Scheme 2), in one hand, and, in another hand, an SPL mutant in which Cys-141, a residue fully conserved in Bacillus species and previously shown to be essential for spore DNA repair in vivo, has been changed into alanine (14Fajardo-Cavazos P. Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Curr. Microbiol. 2005; 51: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We were indeed intrigued by this observation, because Cys-141 is not a ligand of the [Fe-S] cluster present in the active site, in contrast to cysteines 91, 95, and 98 of the CysXXXCysXXCys motif characteristic of Radical-SAM enzymes. Implications of the data reported here regarding the reaction mechanism and the role of Cys-141 are discussed. Materials—Strains: Escherichia coli DH5α was used for routine DNA manipulations. E. coli Tuner (DE3) was used for enzymes overexpression. Enzymes, oligonucleotides, and culture media were purchased from Euromedex (Strasbourg, France). Plasmid DNA purification kit, Qiaprep™, was from Qiagen. DNA sequencing was performed by Genome Express (Grenoble, France). Cloning and Construction of Mutant C141A SPL-overexpressing Plasmid—The plasmid containing the SplB gene, encoding wild-type N-terminal 6His-tagged SPL (pT7-SPL6H), was obtained as previously described (7Chandor A.

A site-directed mutagenesis was performed to change cysteine 141 into an alanine using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutant plasmid was entirely sequenced to ensure that no error was introduced during PCR reaction. The plasmid was then named pT7-SPLC141A.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using 2.5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm dithionite, and 1.5 mm AdoMet. At each time point (0, 15 30, 60, 120, 215, and 280 min) 20 μl and 10 μl of the solution were transferred into Eppendorf tubes, and the reaction was stopped by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Conversion of the spore photoproduct (SPTpT) into the unmodified dinucleoside monophosphate (TpT) and other products in SPL-treated samples was quantified by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), using the same conditions as for samples treated by wt SPL (7Chandor A. Berteau O. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Sanakis Y. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HPLC-MS Analysis—HPLC-MS/MS analyses were carried out on an API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer associated to a Series 1100 Agilent chromatography system. An Uptisphere ODB reversed-phase octadecylsilyl silica gel column (3-μm particle size, 150 × 2 mm inner diameter, Interchim, Montluçon, France) was used in all analyses. A gradient of acetonitrile in 2 mm aqueous triethylammonium acetate was used for most analyses, which were carried out in the negative electrospray ionization mode. These conditions were applied for TpT (retention time (Rt) 26.6 min), SPTpT (Rt 19.9 min), the SO2 derivatives of TpT (TpTSO2 Rt 21.7 min and TSO2pT Rt 22.3 min), the hydroxylated derivatives of TpT (TpTOH Rt 25.6 min and TOHpT Rt 24.3 min). Experiments were also carried out in the positive electrospray ionization mode. For that purpose, acetate ammonium was used as the HPLC buffer. Under these conditions, the retention times were the following: TpTSO2 18.3 min, TSO2pT 19.2 min, 5′-deoxyadenosyl (AdoH) 5.1 min, and AdoMet 3.1 min. The chromatograms were recorded either in the MS1 (full spectra without fragmentation), SIM (selected ion monitoring without fragmentation), MS2 (full spectra of fragment arising from a specific parent ion), and MRM (multiple reaction monitoring, specific for transition corresponding to compounds of interest) modes. SAM Reductase Activity—The cleavage of AdoMet was monitored by HPLC from the formation of AdoH as previously described (15Pierrel F. Douki T. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47555-47563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Protein concentration (by monomer) was determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). Protein-bound iron (17Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and labile sulfide (18Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) concentrations were determined according to standard procedures. Preparation and Light-induced Decomposition of Thiophenyl Derivatives of TpT—5-(Thiophenylmethyl)-2′-deoxyuridylyl-(3′,5′)thymidine (TSΦpT) and thymidylyl-(3′,5′)-5-(thiophenylmethyl)-2′-deoxyuridine (TpTSΦ) were prepared as previously described (19Romieu A. Bellon S. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Organic Lett. 2000; 2: 1085-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In a first series of experiments, solutions containing 40 μm TpTSΦ or TSΦpT together with 1.5 mm Na2S2O4 were kept overnight in an anaerobic glove box. Samples were then exposed for 5 min to UV-C radiation (254 nm) emitted by a germicidal lamp. A second series of irradiations was performed with aerated solutions of either TpTSΦ or TSΦpT. Samples were then analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS without further treatment. Elution was monitored in the MS2 mode. Parent ions were set at m/z 609 and 561 in the negative mode and 611 in the positive mode. UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. EPR—Reconstituted SPL-C141A (187 μm, 4.2 iron/protein) were reduced with 2 mm dithionite under anaerobic conditions for 20 min and frozen inside the glove box. X-Band EPR spectra were recorded on a Brucker Instruments ESP 300D spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 flow cryostat (4.2–300 K). Spectra were quantified under non-saturating conditions by double integration against a 1 mm Cu-EDTA standard. Mössbauer Spectroscopy—For Mössbauer measurements, reconstituted SPL-C141A (9.6 mg and 4.2 iron/protein) was prepared as described above in a final volume of 400 μl. The protein solution was transferred into a Mössbauer cup and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 57Fe-Mössbauer spectra were recorded at zero magnetic field on a spectrometer operating in constant acceleration mode using an Oxford cryostat that allowed temperatures from 1.5 to 300 K and a 57Co source in rhodium. Isomer shifts are reported relative to metallic iron at room temperature. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of SPL C141A Variant—The pT7-SPL-C141A plasmid, obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was used to transform E. coli Tuner (DE3) strain for production of a protein with a His tag at the N-terminal end and an alanine at position 141 in place of a cysteine. A His tag at this extremity is not detrimental to wild-type (wt) SPL enzyme activity (20Rebeil R. Sun Y. Chooback L. Pedraza-Reyes M. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Nicholson W.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SPL-C141A mutant protein could be obtained in pure form, with traces of protein-bound iron and acid-labile sulfide. Reconstitution of the [Fe-S] cluster yielded a SPL-C141A protein containing ∼3–3.5 iron and 3.5–4 sulfur atoms per monomer, in agreement with the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The UV-visible spectrum, with two broad bands at 330 and 420 nm, of the reconstituted mutant as well as the EPR spectrum of the dithionite-reduced protein, with a signal characteristic for a S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]+1 species, were similar to those of wt SPL (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The [Fe-S] cluster was further investigated by Mössbauer spectroscopy using a protein sample (277 μm, 4.01 iron/monomer) reconstituted with 57Fe and sulfide as previously described in the case of wt SPL (7Chandor A. Berteau O. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Sanakis Y. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The spectra recorded at 78 K and 4.2 K were dominated by a quadrupole doublet, the parameters of which (δ ∼ 0.44(1) mm.s-1, ΔEQ = 1.07(2) mm.s-1) clearly corresponded to a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, accounting for ∼73% of total Fe (supplemental Fig. S3). Extra iron was in the form of high spin ferrous iron, as observed in the case of wt SPL. In Vitro SPTpT Repair Activity of the Wild-type SPL Enzyme—We assayed SPL activity using the SPTpT dimer, shown in Scheme 2, as a pure substrate. SPTpT is produced by UV irradiation of the unmodified dinucleoside monophosphate TpT. The methylene bridge in SP corresponds to the methyl group of the 3′-end thymine (7Chandor A. Berteau O. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Sanakis Y. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This synthetic compound is identical to that released from DNA extracted from UV-irradiated spores as shown by their identical HPLC retention time and fragmentation mass spectrometry features (7Chandor A. Berteau O. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Sanakis Y. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Use of this substrate facilitated monitoring of the repair reaction, because assay samples could be directly submitted to HPLC-MS/MS analysis at the end of the incubation time, for separation, identification, and quantitation of SPTpT and TpT (Scheme 2). We recently reported that this substrate is totally transformed into TpT under standard assay conditions, using wt SPL (7Chandor A. Berteau O. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Sanakis Y. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For sake of comparison with the SPL-C141A enzyme, a standard highly reproducible wt SPL time-dependent repair experiment is shown in Fig. 1A. The assay mixture contained a pure preparation of reconstituted wt SPL (1 μm) together with 1.5 mm dithionite as a reducing agent, 1.5 mm AdoMet and 10 μm SPTpT in DTT-containing buffer at pH 8 under strict anaerobic conditions. The repair reaction was then assayed at time intervals by HPLC-MS/MS for its content in SPTpT and TpT. Fig. 1A shows that a quantitative conversion of SPTpT to TpT was achieved in <60 min. In parallel, the reaction mixture was assayed for the production of AdoH, the product resulting from AdoMet-reductive cleavage. The results shown in Fig. 1B demonstrate that approximately one equivalent of AdoH with regard to the reaction TpT product was formed during repair. Further production of AdoH still took place after 60-min incubation reflecting the ability of the wt SPL enzyme to reductively cleave AdoMet in the absence of substrate, a property also reported by others (see Fig. 1B) (21Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,22Pieck J.C. Hennecke U. Pierik A.J. Friedel M.G. Carell T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36317-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data thus suggest that, at least with SPTpT as a substrate, the SPL enzyme reaction is not catalytic with regard to AdoMet and that AdoH does not serve as a hydrogen atom donor during the final step of the reaction, leading to TpT (see Scheme 1B). This has been confirmed by a labeling experiment, using an AdoMet preparation containing a partially deuterated 5′-methylene group, because no appreciable D incorporation into TpT, during SPTpT repair under standard conditions, could be observed. Buffer used in these in vitro experiments contained DTT, which could function as a hydrogen atom donor. In Vitro SPTpT Repair Activity of the SPL-C141A Mutant Enzyme—The SPL-C141A enzyme was also competent for AdoMet reductive cleavage in the absence of substrate, under anaerobic conditions showing that the protein interacts with the AdoMet cofactor (data not shown). A time curve for SPL-C141A-dependent conversion of SPTpT, assayed under the conditions used for the wt SPL, is shown in Fig. 1C. The results clearly showed that the SPTpT substrate, corresponding to the peak eluted at 19.9 min (Fig. 1D), was totally consumed after a 30-min reaction but, in contrast to the wt SPL-catalyzed reaction, repaired TpT product (retention time: 26.6 min, Fig. 1D) yield did not exceed 10%. No SPTpT consumption could be detected when protein SPL-C141A or AdoMet was omitted from the reaction mixture (data not shown). This showed that SPTpT was indeed modified by SPL-C141A but not primarily reverted back to TpT with two unmodified thymines. Samples were then analyzed by HPLC with MS1 monitoring to search for putative incomplete reaction products. Besides SPTpT and TpT, two additional peaks (A, 25.6 min; B, 21.7 min), which increased in intensity during reaction, were observed (Fig. 1, C and D). The molecular weight of the corresponding compounds was found by MS1 to be 562 and 610 for compounds A and B, respectively (Fig. 2A). These values are consistent with an hydroxylated derivative of TpT for compound A and with a SO2 adduct for compound B. Determination of their fragmentation mass spectra (Fig. 2, B and C, see comments below) allowed us to set up a specific and sensitive MRM HPLC-MS/MS method to monitor the time-dependent formation of products A and B upon conversion of SPTpT catalyzed by the SPL-C141A enzyme. The results are those shown in Fig. 1C. At the end of the reaction compound B (90% yield) was by far the major product, and very low amounts of compound A (1–2%) could be detected. In fact, this last product was also observed in tiny amounts in the case of the wt SPL-dependent reaction. Identification of the Products of the Reaction Catalyzed by the SPL-C141A Enzyme—Further insights into the chemical structure of compounds A and B could be first obtained from the analysis of their MS2 fragmentation mass spectra (Fig. 2). In the negative mode, the fragmentation of unmodified dinucleoside monophosphate compounds is dominated by the loss of the base of the 5′-terminal nucleotide leading to the following fragments: the deprotonated free base and the dinucleoside monophosphate with a single base at the 3′-terminal nucleotide (23Ni J. Pomerantz C. Rozenski J. Zhang Y. McCloskey J.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1989-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Such a typical fragmentation is illustrated in the supplemental Fig. S4 with uracil/thymine dinucleoside monophosphates dUpT and TpdU. The same fragmentation pattern was unambiguously observed for compound A, with release of unmodified thymine (noted “Thy-H”) and formation of an abasic dinucleoside monophosphate with a single hydroxylated base at the 3′-terminal nucleotide (noted “M-Thy-H”) (Fig. 2B). These data show that compound A is a derivative of TpT with an hydroxyl group at the 3′-end thymine exclusively. Characterization of compound B was more tedious. Indeed, its fragmentation spectrum recorded in the negative mode (Fig. 2C) was not conclusive, regarding the presence of the SO2 group on the 3′-end or 5′-end thymine: whereas a thymine fragment but no SO2-thymine derivative was observed, detection of a fragment possibly resulting from the loss of ThySO2 could also be explained by the presence of SO2 at the 5′-end base (Fig. 2C). In contrast, fragmentation MS under positive ionization made conclusions possible (Fig. 2D). Under these conditions, a typical fragmentation pattern for dinucleoside monophosphates is the release of the protonated 3′-end nucleotide together with the dehydrated 5′-end nucleoside (see supplemental Fig. S5 for the case of dUpT and TpdU). Fragmentation of product B followed this pattern with evidence for an unmodified dehydrated thymidine at the 5′-end (noted “dThd-H2O+H” in Fig. 2D) and a SO2-modified monophosphate thymidine at the 3′-end (noted “dTMPSO2+H” in Fig. 2D). These data thus clearly demonstrated that the major product during transformation of SPTpT catalyzed by the mutant enzyme was a dinucleoside monophosphate in which the covalent link between the two bases has been cleaved and that a SO2 group was attached specifically to the base of the 3′-end nucleotide. In the next section we describe experiments aiming at showing, through a chemical approach, that the SO2 moiety comes from dithionite and that SO2 addition occurs at the methyl group of the modified thymine. A Model Chemistry for the Formation of A and B—We reasoned that formation of B could arise from coupling between an intermediate dinucleoside monophosphate radical and an SO2 dithionite. A good candidate for the former is the carbon-centered allylic radical generated after the homolytic cleavage of the C–C bond, shown in Scheme 1B. To study such a reaction, we generated this allylic radical photochemically in the presence of dithionite and identified the reaction products by HPLC and MS as discussed under “Experimental Procedures.” The precursor was a synthetic dinucleoside monophosphate derivative in which a thiophenyl moiety is covalently attached to the methyl group of the thymine either at the 5′- (named TSΦpT) or the 3′- (named TpTSΦ) end (Scheme 3). This functionality is known to undergo homolytic cleavage of the sulfur-carbon bond during irradiation (19Romieu A. Bellon S. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Organic Lett. 2000; 2: 1085-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the presence of dithionite (1.5 mm) and the absence of oxygen, UV-C photolysis of TSΦpT and TpTSΦ (40 μm) each yielded a compound with an additional mass of 64 consistent with the addition of a SO2 group, as shown by MS (supplemental Figs. S6–S8). However, the two compounds were different in terms of both HPLC retention times (Fig. 3I) and mass spectrometry features (supplemental Figs. S6–S8). Only the reaction product of the TpTSΦ compound irradiated in the presence of dithionite exhibited properties perfectly identical to those of compound B produced during the repair of SPTpT by SPL-C141A. Interestingly, the reaction also produced a very small amount of compound A by an undefined mechanism.FIGURE 3HPLC comparison of the reaction products obtained upon repair of SPTpT by SPL-C141A and by photolysis of radical precursor (TpTSΦ and TSΦpT). Panel I, SO2 (*) and OH (**) TpT adducts obtained upon photolysis of TpTSΦ (solid line) and TSΦpT (dotted line), anaerobically in the presence of dithionite. Panel II, SO2 (B) and OH (A) TpT adducts obtained upon incubation of SPTpT with SPL-C141A in the presence of dithionite, anaerobically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These data then unambiguously established a number of conclusions. First they confirm that compound B had the SO2 adduct at the 3′-end thymine and not at the 5′-end one. Second, they show that the addition occurred at the methyl carbon of the base and that dithionite was the source of SO2. We earlier discovered that the SPTpT dimer (Scheme 2), identical to the dimer released from DNA extracted from UV-irradiated spores, behaves as a substrate of the spore photoproduct lyase (SPL) (7Chandor A. Berteau O. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Sanakis Y. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Now, we show that with SPTpT as a substrate the enzyme reaction is not catalytic with regard to AdoMet and produces the repaired TpT compound and AdoH in stoichiometric amounts. This implies that the product radical intermediate, precursor of TpT, does not abstract a hydrogen atom from AdoH (Scheme 1B). Confirmation is provided from the lack of incorporation of deuterium into TpT when the reaction is carried out in the presence of deuterated AdoMet. The source of H atoms in this reaction has not been determined and will be discussed below. In contrast, in one study using irradiated DNA, SPL-dependent repair was found to be catalytic with regard to AdoMet, thus in agreement with the mechanism shown in Scheme 1B, in which AdoH is the H atom donor. Nevertheless, because SPTpT can be easily produced by UV irradiation of the unmodified dinucleoside monophosphate TpT in significant yields and in pure form and is a SPL substrate easy to monitor, we used it for mechanistic studies rather than an undefined preparation of irradiated DNA containing a mixture of lesions, with the spore photoproduct as a minor one (7Chandor A. Berteau O. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Sanakis Y. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Atta M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26922-26931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DNA from irradiated bacterial spores is another possible source of substrate but much less easily accessible. Intrigued by the importance of Cys-141, a conserved cysteine in Bacillus SPLs, for spore survival under UV irradiation (14Fajardo-Cavazos P. Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Curr. Microbiol. 2005; 51: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we have investigated in detail the properties of the SPL-C141A mutant form and made a number of interesting unexpected observations. Here, using in vitro experiments, we confirm that this cysteine residue plays an important function in the outcome of the repair reaction. Indeed, whereas SPTpT is still recognized by the mutant enzyme and transformed efficiently, the major product of the reaction is not the TpT dimer. HPLC analysis, mass spectrometry, and chemical model reactions, using photoreactive radical precursors, led us to unambiguously establish that the major product (>90% yield) of the reaction is a modified dinucleoside monophosphate containing one thymine and one thymine with a sulfinate moiety compound B (Scheme 4). We also demonstrate that the sulfinate group: (i) is attached to the methyl carbon of the base; (ii) is exclusively present in the thymine of the 3′-end of the dinucleoside monophosphate; and (iii) is derived from dithionite, the reducing agent present in the in vitro assay mixture. These results are interpreted by the mechanism shown in Scheme 4 for the repair of SPTpT catalyzed by the wt SPL and the mutant SPL-C141A enzyme. Because both enzymes are able to generate products lacking the initial covalent bond between the bases it is likely that the first steps of the reaction, during which the cross-link is broken, are the same and that the substitution of cysteine 141 into alanine is not detrimental to substrate binding in the active site of the protein and reacting with the cofactor. This is consistent with the fact that the SPL-C141A enzyme chelates a [4Fe-4S] cluster with high yield, as shown by Mössbauer spectroscopy, and catalyzes the reductive cleavage of AdoMet in the absence of substrate, as does wt SPL (our results and Refs. 21Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9038-9043Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Pieck J.C. Hennecke U. Pierik A.J. Friedel M.G. Carell T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36317-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, in both cases the reaction starts with the reductive cleavage of AdoMet by the reduced cluster generating the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, which then abstracts one of the H atoms at the methylene C-6 position. This primary radical undergoes a β-scission leading to the homolytic cleavage of the C–C bond linking the two thymines generating an allylic radical. Differences between the two enzymes appear in the last step of the reaction (Scheme 4). Our data suggest that the substitution of Cys-141 into alanine is responsible for a deficient control/protection of the allylic radical intermediate, which then is efficiently trapped by the SO2·¯ radicals generated in solution by dithionite, through a radical-radical coupling reaction producing the sulfinate compound (Scheme 4). This mechanism implies two key radical intermediates. The involvement of the first one, derived from H atom abstraction at C-6 methylene by the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical Ado·, has been demonstrated by DNA labeling experiments, using the wt enzyme, previously reported (12Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The involvement of the second one, the allylic radical precursor of the repaired product, is now indirectly proven by the experiments reported here using the SPL-C141A mutant enzyme. The latter in that respect proved remarkable as it indeed unexpectedly allowed an efficient trapping of this second radical by dithionite, which could be easily monitored by HPLC/mass spectrometry. At this stage it is not known how Cys-141 provides the radical control/protection mechanism, but two possibilities, requiring further investigation, are briefly discussed in the following. The first hypothesis implies Cys-141 as an H atom donor to the intermediate allylic radical. Such a reaction is thermodynamically reasonable, considering that the energy of the S–H bond of a cysteine residue is slightly larger than to that of the C–H bond of an allyl group (25Stubbe J. van Der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Substitution of Cys-141 into alanine thus would result in a further stabilization of the intermediate allylic radical, thus facilitating its coupling with highly reactive free radicals in the environment such as those produced by dithionite in the in vitro experiments. To be catalytic, the resulting protein-bound cysteinyl radical generated in SPL after TpT formation needs to be converted back to a normal cysteine. This reaction implies an H atom donor, which has not been identified but might be DTT in vitro. A second hypothesis implies that cysteine 141 participates in the stabilization of a specific structure of the active site, which prevents the intermediate radical from reacting with exogenous free radicals. In this model, the wt enzyme has its active site in a “closed” conformation because of the presence of Cys-141 and the allylic radical does not react with the dithionite-derived radicals present in the in vitro reaction mixture. Instead, it reacts almost exclusively with an H atom donor, by H atom radical abstraction, to generate the final repaired TpT product. In the case of the SPTpT substrate used here, because AdoH is excluded, the nature of the H atom donor is unknown. Considering that with DNA substrate AdoH is the direct H atom donor (Scheme 1B), we consider the second hypothesis as more likely. Obviously a structural characterization of SPL is required to substantiate at the molecular level such a hypothesis. In conclusion, our data confirm that a single substitution of cysteine-141 into alanine has a major impact on the SPL-dependent repair reaction and are consistent with the high sensitivity of bacterial spores containing a C141A SPL mutant enzyme to irradiation, as previously reported (14Fajardo-Cavazos P. Rebeil R. Nicholson W.L. Curr. Microbiol. 2005; 51: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). How this amino acid residue contributes to tightly control the outcome of highly energetic and reactive radical intermediates during catalysis remains to be understood. Furthermore, the mutant enzyme studied here has allowed trapping of one of the key catalytically competent free radical intermediates, providing new insights into the mechanism of SP repair by the SPL enzyme.

Although Fe-S clusters can be assembled by chemical means, dedicated proteins for in vivo Fe-S protein maturation have been discovered over the past 10 years (2Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 3Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 669-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In plants assembly proteins have been localized to the plastids and mitochondria, the endosymbiotic organelles where photosynthesis and respiration take place, respectively (for review, see Refs. 4Balk J.

Both systems appear to follow the same biochemical steps; (i) generation of persulfide by a cysteine desulfurase (the Nfs1-Isd11 complex in mitochondria; CpNifS in plastids), (ii) transfer of persulfide and combination with iron to form an Fe-S cluster on a scaffold protein (ISU proteins in mitochondria; NFU2 in plastids), (iii) transfer of the Fe-S cluster from the scaffold protein to a target protein (mediated by chaperones in the ISC system). iron-sulfur cluster (assembly) A. thaliana cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly full-length green fluorescent protein deletion of N-terminal domain nucleotide binding protein S. cerevisiae Important Fe-S enzymes are also found in the cytosol and nucleus (3Lill R.

Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In plants, these include DNA repair enzymes, RNA polymerase I and III (7Hirata A. Klein B.J. Murakami K.S. Nature. 2008; 451: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), xanthine dehydrogenase, abscisic aldehyde oxidase (AAO3), and cytosolic aconitase. How these proteins obtain their Fe-S clusters is currently not known. By analogy with yeast, it is presumed that the mitochondria are required for cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly, but supporting experimental evidence has not yet been provided. Bioinformatic analyses have revealed that sequence relatives of the yeast CIA proteins (for cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly) are also present in the genomes of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (4Balk J. Lobréaux S. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Godman J. Balk J. Genetics. 2008; 179: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In yeast and humans the CIA machinery includes two P-loop NTPases, Cfd1 and Nbp35, which form a heterotetrameric complex and function as Fe-S scaffolds, mediating the de novo assembly of an Fe-S cluster and its transfer to target apoproteins (9Hausmann A.

Biol. 2008; 28: 5517-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cfd1 and Nbp35 are classified as Mrp-like proteins that belong to the Mrp/NBP35 subfamily of P loop NTPases (13Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 333: 781-815Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although Cfd1 and Nbp35 share 49! sequence similarity, they can be distinguished as different types based on their N-terminal domains (Fig. 1B). A third type of Mrp-like protein, HCF101, was characterized in plastids and is involved in the assembly of Photosystem I, which has three [4Fe-4S] clusters (14Lezhneva L. Amann K. Meurer J. Plant J. 2004; 37: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Stöckel J. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10243-10251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified a fourth type of eukaryotic Mrp-like protein associated with Fe-S protein assembly. This protein, named Ind1, is localized in the mitochondria and is required for the effective assembly of respiratory Complex I, which contains eight Fe-S clusters, in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (16Bych K. Kerscher S. Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Zwicker K. Huynen M.A. Lill R. Brandt U. Balk J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1736-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To initiate studies on Fe-S protein assembly in the plant cytosol and analyze how this process may depend on the organellar assembly systems, we investigated two uncharacterized Mrp-like proteins in Arabidopsis. Here we show that NBP35 (gene locus At5g50960) is essential for embryo development and is localized in the cytosol, whereas the gene product of At4g19540, designated INDL for Ind1-like, was localized in the mitochondria. AtNBP35 bound [4Fe-4S] clusters that were readily transferred to an apoprotein in vitro, consistent with an Fe-S scaffold function. Plant Material and Yeast Strains—The A. thaliana lines, SALK_054678 and SALK_056204, were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. The presence and position of the T-DNA insert in the NBP35 gene (At5g50960) was confirmed by PCR. Segregation analysis showed that the T-DNA was linked to the embryo lethality phenotype in the SALK_056204 line. Arabidopsis cell cultures were generated as described (17Prime T.A. Sherrier D.J. Mahon P. Packman L.C. Dupree P. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3488-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303-1A (MATa, ura3-1, ade2-1, trp1-1, his3-11,15, leu2-3112) served as wild type. The Gal-NFS1 strain and conditions for depletion of Nfs1 protein were described previously (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The following yeast plasmids were used: pRS416 (p416) containing the MET25 promoter for intermediate expression and pRS426 (p426) with the TDH3 promoter for high expression (19Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation and Protein Blot Analysis—Arabidopsis cell cultures were used as source material to obtain highly purified mitochondria (20Sweetlove L.J. Taylor N.L. Leaver C.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), nuclei (21Balk J. Chew S.K. Leaver C.J. McCabe P.F. Plant J. 2003; 34: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and a cytosolic fraction. For the latter, drained cells were squashed in one volume of cold nuclei isolation buffer (21Balk J. Chew S.K. Leaver C.J. McCabe P.F. Plant J. 2003; 34: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. Chloroplasts were isolated from rosette leaves (22Aronsson H. Jarvis P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Total protein extract from plant tissue was prepared by grinding the tissue with 1–2 volumes of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5! (v/v) glycerol, 1! (w/v) SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie Dye Reagent (Bio-Rad). Thirty μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and labeled with antibodies following standard protocols. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against purified His-AtNBP35 and His-AtINDL. Antibodies against AtISU1 were a kind gift from Stéphane Lobréaux (23Léon S. Touraine B. Briat J.-F. Lobréaux S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and antibodies against pea PETC were kindly provided by John C. Gray (24Salter A.H. Newman B.J. Napier J.A. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody against Arabidopsis actin (MA1–744) was from Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO; polyclonals against histone 3 (ab1791) were from Abcam, Cambridge, UK. Antisera against Nfs1 and Leu1 were described previously (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In Vitro Fe-S Analysis—The full-length (FL) AtNBP35 coding sequence or a version lacking the first 54 codons (ΔN) was isolated from wild-type Arabidopsis cDNA and cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen) in-frame with an N-terminal His tag. Protein overexpression and affinity purification were carried out following the manufacturer's manuals. Chemical reconstitution of the Fe-S clusters was carried out in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI). In a typical experiment, 20–30 μm protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A), was treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) at 15 °C for 1 h. The reconstitution was started by the addition of 10 mol eq of ferric ammonium citrate and Li2S followed by incubation at 15 °C for 3 h. To remove non-bound iron and sulfide, reconstituted AtNBP35 was passed through a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column using buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The assembly of Fe-S clusters was ascertained by UV-visible spectroscopy (Jasco V-550). The quantification of iron and acid-labile sulfide and performance of in vitro cluster transfer assays were as previously described (11Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stümpfig M. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 25Balk J. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Mössbauer Spectroscopy—Protein samples were reconstituted as described above. Low temperature X-band EPR spectra of samples reduced with 2 mm dithionite were recorded with a Bruker ESP 300E cw spectrometer equipped with a helium flow cryostat ESR910 (Oxford Instruments). For the preparation of Mössbauer samples reconstitution was carried out with 57FeSO4. The samples were concentrated with Vivaspin 30-kDa concentrator devices and frozen on a cold aluminum block in the anaerobic glove box. Mössbauer measurements and simulations were carried out as described in Barthelme et al. (26Barthelme D. Scheele U. Dinkelaker S. Janoschka A. MacMillan F. Albers S.-V. Driessen A. J.M. Stagni M.S. Bill E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Schümann V. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14598-14607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous Methods—Published methods used were transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein using vector pOL-GFP-S65C (27Peeters N.M. Chapron A. Giritch A. Grandjean O. Lancelin D. Lhomme T. Vivrel A. Small I. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and radiolabeling of yeast cells, protein extraction, and immunoprecipitation (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Error bars represent the S.D. value. NBP35 but Not CFD1 Is Conserved in the Green Plant Lineage—With the availability of recently sequenced genomes of plants and algae, we investigated the conservation of Mrp-like proteins and their domains in the green lineage. Three separate coding sequences for proteins with a Mrp family signature were usually found: one with a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence, designated INDL, the plastid HCF101, characterized by an N-terminal DUF59 domain, and an NBP35 homolog with an N-terminal Fe-S cluster domain (Fig. 1). No other sequence relative that could correspond to yeast Cfd1 was found in any of the six plant, one moss, and four green algal genomes analyzed. In addition, the predicted NBP35 proteins in the green lineage differed from those in the fungi/Metazoa group in the C-terminal region after the highly conserved VENMS motif (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Most notably, the C-terminal CXXC motif, which is critical for Fe-S cluster binding to Cfd1 and Nbp35 in yeast, 4D. J. A. Netz, unpublished information. is absent from plant and algal NBP35 proteins. Instead, a ∼35-amino acid insertion is found that is conserved in all Viridiplantae genomes investigated so far but that has no sequence similarity to other known protein motifs. As a consequence, only one C-terminal cysteine residue is conserved in all NBP35 proteins: Cys-234 in S. cerevisiae numbering, corresponding to Cys-220 in Arabidopsis NBP35. However, a number of semiconserved cysteine residues are found in the C-terminal 70-amino acid sequence of plant and algal NBP35 proteins. The absence of CFD1 genes in the green lineage suggests that the NBP35 protein may function as a homo-oligomer in the cytosol without a CFD1-like partner. AtNBP35 Is a Soluble Cytosolic Protein—To determine the cellular localization of NBP35 (At5g50960) in the model plant Arabidopsis, the full coding sequence isolated from cDNA was fused in-frame to a C-terminal GFP sequence and transiently expressed using particle bombardment of Arabidopsis leaves. GFP fluorescence was found in the cytoplasm, which is appressed to the plasma membrane in the highly vacuolate, jigsaw-shaped epidermal cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Green fluorescence was also observed in the nucleus, which, however, may be due to diffusion, a recurrent problem in determining the localization of nuclear proteins as GFP fusions (28von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Stacey M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Seibel N.M. Eljouni J. Nalaskowski M.M. Hampe W. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 368: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated the localization of endogenous AtNBP35 using cell fractionation and immunoblotting. Antibodies specific to AtNBP35 (see supplemental Fig. S2) recognized an ∼37-kDa protein in total plant extracts (Fig. 2C), in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 37,306 Da. The AtNBP35 protein was found in the soluble, cytosolic fraction but not in purified nuclei, mitochondria, or chloroplasts. We also investigated the localization of the INDL protein (At4g19540) using specific antibodies and obtained a signal in the purified mitochondrial fraction only, similar to the pattern observed for ISU1 (Fig. 2C). Note that these two proteins are not or are barely detectable in total extract due to their low abundance and the relatively minor contribution of mitochondria to total protein in plant extract. These data show that AtNBP35 is a soluble cytosolic protein that is spatially separated from the homologous AtINDL protein in the mitochondria. Both the N- and C-terminal Domains of AtNBP35 Bind Fe-S Clusters—Because the characteristic C-terminal CXXC motif of the Cfd1/Nbp35 scaffold proteins is missing in plant and algal NBP35 proteins, it was of interest to analyze the capacity of the C-terminal domain to bind an Fe-S cluster. To this end, AtNBP35 was overproduced in Escherichia coli, either FL or lacking the N-terminal Fe-S cluster binding motif (ΔN). The proteins were purified by His-tag affinity purification (Fig. 3A, inset). The FL protein appeared brown in color, whereas the ΔN protein was virtually colorless except for a light yellow hue. UV-visible spectroscopy of the FL protein showed absorbance peaks at 320 and 415 nm, which were more than halved upon addition of dithionite (Fig. 3A). These spectral features are characteristic of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (30Orme-Johnson W.H. Orme-Johnson A.R. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. 1982; : 67-95, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar); however, the intensity of the signal indicated that only a minor fraction of the molecules contained a cluster (11Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stümpfig M. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectrum of ΔN AtNBP35 (as isolated) did not have a pronounced absorbance. We, therefore, incubated both FL and ΔN protein with excess iron and sulfide under reductive, anaerobic conditions to chemically reconstitute the Fe-S clusters. Quantification of protein-bound Fe and sulfide showed that FL AtNBP35 bound 5.7 ± 1.2 iron and 5.1 ± 0.8 acid-labile sulfide per polypeptide, whereas the ΔN protein bound 1.8 ± 0.7 iron and 1.7 ± 0.1 acid-labile sulfide per polypeptide (Fig. 3B, inset). Subtraction of these numbers indicate that the N-terminal domain bound a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The C terminus may bind either a [2Fe-2S] cluster or a [4Fe-4S] cluster bridging two polypeptides, assuming complete reconstitution in our samples. The second possibility is supported by the UV-visible spectrum of reconstituted ΔN AtNBP35 (Fig. 3B), which is typical of a cubane cluster. Further support for a cubane cluster was obtained by EPR spectroscopy, showing attenuation of the EPR signal of the reduced protein above 40 K (supplemental Fig. S3). The EPR spectrum of FL AtNBP35 after reduction with dithionite is rhombic and is dominated by the sharp signal of the N-terminal cluster, with g values of 2.051, 1.928, and 1.86 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, FL yeast Nbp35 and its human counterpart huNbp35 have an axial signal (Fig. 3C, see also Refs. 11Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stümpfig M. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and 12Stehling O. Netz D.J. Niggemeyer B. Rösser R. Eisenstein R.S. Puccio H. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5517-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Comparison of the EPR signals of ΔN AtNBP35 (Fig. 3C) with the corresponding yeast ΔN Nbp35 and yeast Cfd1 (not shown) showed no pronounced differences for the relatively broad axial signal of the C-terminal domain. Mössbauer spectroscopy of the reconstituted protein (without reduction) showed that 85! of the iron associated with FL AtNBP35 was present in the form of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters (Fig. 3D). The values of the isomer shift (0.43 mm/s) and quadrupole splitting (1.20 mm/s) were similar to the values observed for delocalized mixed-valent (Fe2.5+-Fe2.5+) pairs in exclusively cysteine-coordinated [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters (31Ferreira G.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Pereira A.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7062-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the instability of ΔN AtNBP35 upon concentration of protein for Mössbauer spectroscopy, the individual isomer shift and quadrupole splitting parameters of N- and C-terminal clusters could not be determined. Gel filtration analysis of recombinant as isolated FL AtNBP35 showed that most of the protein occurred as a dimer, with some forming a tetramer (Fig. 3E). The chromatographic behavior of ΔN AtNBP35 or the reconstituted proteins could not be analyzed due to instability during the gel filtration procedure. Taken together, these data indicate that AtNBP35 occurs as a homo-oligomer with a stable [4Fe-4S] cluster in the N-terminal domain of each subunit and a C-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster shared between two protomers. Holo-AtNBP35 Can Transfer an Fe-S Cluster—Next we investigated whether the Arabidopsis NBP35 protein can act as an Fe-S scaffold in that it can transfer an Fe-S cluster to a potential target protein in vitro. Following a previously described assay (11Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stümpfig M. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), chemically reconstituted and desalted FL AtNBP35 was added to apoLeu1, the apoform of yeast isopropylmalate isomerase. Cluster transfer was followed by the generation of enzymatic activity upon conversion of apoLeu1 to the [4Fe-4S]-containing form. Cluster transfer to Leu1 occurred at a rate and efficiency comparable with that observed for yeast Nbp35 or the Cfd1-Nbp35 complex (11Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stümpfig M. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). At the earliest time point that we were able to measure (1.5 min), more than 80! of the maximal Leu1 activity was obtained. In contrast, chemical reconstitution with the same amounts of ferric iron and sulfide hardly led to activation of apoLeu1 (Fig. 4). The addition of 1 mm ATP/GTP (plus MgCl2) had no effect on cluster transfer, as has been noted for ApbC (40Boyd J.M. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R. Downs D.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Cfd1/Nbp35.4 These in vitro data suggest that a labile Fe-S cluster of AtNBP35 can be donated to a target Fe-S protein. AtNBP35 Binds Fe-S Clusters in Vivo but Cannot Replace Yeast NBP35—To analyze the physiological relevance of the in vitro data, we expressed AtNBP35 in yeast cells (S. cerevisiae, Sc). First, we confirmed that the AtNBP35 protein was localized in the yeast cytosol (Fig. 5A). Second, we investigated whether Fe-S clusters were assembled on AtNBP35 by the yeast Fe-S cluster assembly machinery. For this we made use of a mutant, Gal-NFS1, containing a galactose-regulatable NFS1 gene encoding the only cysteine desulfurase in yeast. Cluster assembly on AtNBP35 was followed by using a sensitive 55Fe radiolabeling assay (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast cells overproducing AtNBP35 were incubated with 55Fe and washed followed by preparation of a soluble cell extract. AtNBP35 was immunoprecipitated from the cell extract and subjected to scintillation counting. A significant amount of 55Fe (10 times over background) was associated with immunoprecipitated AtNBP35 (Fig. 5, B and C). Down-regulation of NFS1 expression led to a near loss of 55Fe bound to AtNBP35 (Fig. 5C, last bar). The Nfs1-dependent 55Fe binding to AtNBP35 indicates that the iron was part of an Fe-S cluster. Next, we investigated whether AtNBP35 can replace the function of yeast Nbp35 using cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutant copy of the endogenous NBP35 gene (32Vitale G. Fabre E. Hurt E.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Yarunin A. Panse V.G. Petfalski E. Dez C. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 580-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Upon shifting the cells to 37 °C, the mutant ScNbp35 protein becomes non-functional, leading to growth arrest after a few cell duplications. The growth of the temperature-shifted nbp35 mutant was rescued by expression of wild-type ScNBP35 from a plasmid but not by Arabidopsis NBP35 (Fig. 6). We then tested whether AtNBP35 could rescue a temperature-sensitive cfd1 mutant (33Yarunin A. Panse V.G. Petfalski E. Dez C. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 580-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, expression of AtNBP35 enabled slow growth of temperature-sensitive cfd1 mutant cells shifted to 37 °C. We also tested the functional requirement of the N-terminal domain of AtNBP35 for yeast complementation, as yeast Cfd1 lacks this domain. Truncated ΔN AtNBP35 did not complement the temperature-sensitive cfd1 mutant, although the protein was stably expressed (supplemental Fig. S2). Similar results were obtained with galactose-regulatable mutants of NBP35 and CFD1 (not shown). In summary, AtNBP35 is able to acquire Fe-S cofactors in the yeast cytosol but cannot substitute for the endogenous yeast Nbp35. In contrast, AtNBP35 can partially replace the function of Cfd1 in yeast. AtNBP35 Is Ubiquitously Expressed and Essential for Embryo Development—To assess the role of NBP35 in Arabidopsis, we investigated the expression of AtNBP35 and analyzed available insertion mutants. Immunoblot analysis of vegetative and reproductive organs showed that AtNBP35 is ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 7A). This is in agreement with microarray data from the GeneVestigator data base (supplemental Fig. S4). Comparison of the signal intensities in lanes with cell extract and known amounts of purified protein indicated that the abundance of AtNBP35 is less than 0.005! of SDS-extractable protein. Two plant lines with insertions in the AtNBP35 gene were obtained from the Arabidopsis stock center. SALK_054678 contains a T-DNA insert in the 5′-untranslated region, and SALK_056204 contains a T-DNA insert at the 3′ end of the first intron (Fig. 7B). Homozygous plants were bred from the SALK_054678 line, but they had no detectable phenotype. Reverse transcription PCR using primers in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region confirmed the absence of full-length NBP35 transcript (not shown). However, PCR products covering the start and end of the coding sequence were as abundant as in wild type, suggesting that an alternative transcription start site was used to produce sufficient amounts of functional AtNBP35 mRNA. In contrast, no homozygous plants were obtained from the SALK_056204 line. PCR analysis indicated that transcript levels were decreased by half in heterozygous plants (not shown). Closer examination of the siliques of these plants revealed that a quarter of the seeds were not properly developed, appearing small and dark brown (Fig. 7C). The ratio of underdeveloped to normal seeds was 1:3 (Fig. 7D), indicating that the mutation is recessive, that is, those embryos with at least one copy of the functional AtNBP35 gene survive. The requirement of AtNBP35 for embryo development together with its constitutive expression indicate that NBP35 performs an essential function in the plant cell. In plants and algae, Fe-S proteins are abundant in four cell compartments: plastids, mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus. Biogenesis of Fe-S proteins in the latter two compartments has not been investigated in photosynthetic organisms despite the occurrence of unique and important Fe-S proteins. It has been proposed that in mammals alternative splicing mechanisms provide small amounts of ISC protein isoforms in the cytosol. However, localization data of various ISC proteins in Arabidopsis argue against this possibility in plants (23Léon S. Touraine B. Briat J.-F. Lobréaux S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Storozhenko S. Davey M.W. Papenbrock J. De Rycke R. Engler G. Stephan U.W. Lange H. Kispal G.

Biol. 2007; 64: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports in mammals show that cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly is dependent on the mitochondrial ISC machinery rather than the cytosolic ISC isoforms (36Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 37Biederbick A. Stehling O. Rösser R. Niggemeyer B. Nakai Y. Elsässer H.P. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5675-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, the CIA machinery is required for Fe-S protein assembly in the cytosol of human cell lines (12Stehling O. Netz D.J. Niggemeyer B. Rösser R. Eisenstein R.S. Puccio H. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5517-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Song D. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9231-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, started to functionally analyze plant homologs of the CIA proteins using a reverse genetics approach. Focusing on two uncharacterized Mrp-like proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis, we showed that a homolog of one of the yeast CIA proteins, AtNBP35, is present in the plant cytosol (Fig. 2). In contrast, a Cfd1-type partner protein as found in fungi and Metazoa (11Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stümpfig M. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Stehling O. Netz D.J. Niggemeyer B. Rösser R. Eisenstein R.S. Puccio H. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5517-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) could not be identified either as a separate protein coding sequence in any of the sequenced plant or algal genomes or as a cytosolic isoform of the mitochondrial INDL protein in Arabidopsis (Fig. 2). Another marked difference between plant/algal and the fungal/metazoan NBP35 proteins is the absence of the C-terminal CXXC motif, which is replaced by an ∼35-amino acid insertion in the plant/algal proteins. This change may have occurred early in the evolution of the Viridiplantae, as it is found across the green lineage (plants and green algae) but not in the rhodophyte (red alga) Cyanidioschyzon merolae (39Matsuzaki M. Misumi O. Shin-I T. Maruyama S. Takahara M. Miyagishima S.Y. Mori T. Nishida K. Yagisawa F. Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Nishimura Y. Nakao S. Kobayashi T. Momoyama Y. Higashiyama T. Minoda A. Sano M.

Sato N. Nozaki H. Ogasawara N. Kohara Y. Kuroiwa T. Nature. 2004; 428: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). The C. merolae genome also encodes HCF101 and INDL but not a CFD1 protein. Thus, the NBP35 protein in C. merolae may represent the ancestral form containing the C-terminal CXXC motif but no CFD1 partner. Hence, one might speculate that CFD1 may have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication in the fungal/metazoan group. Despite the lack of the characteristic CXXC motif, the C-terminal domain of AtNBP35 bound an Fe-S cluster upon chemical reconstitution (Fig. 3). It will be interesting, therefore, to investigate more precisely the role of the CXXC motif in the function of the Mrp-like proteins, as this motif is also absent in HCF101. In contrast, mutation studies have shown that the individual cysteines of the CXXC motif in yeast Cfd1 and Yarrowia Ind1 are essential (10Roy A. Solodovnikova N. Nicholson T. Antholine W. Walden W.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Bych K. Kerscher S. Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Zwicker K. Huynen M.A. Lill R. Brandt U. Balk J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1736-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Quantification of bound Fe and sulfide in reconstituted AtNBP35 suggested that the C-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster was shared between two protomers. A similar situation has been proposed for the bacterial Mrp-like protein called ApbC in Salmonella enterica (40Boyd J.M. Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R. Downs D.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8195-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As a consequence, each polypeptide would provide two ligands to this cluster which remain to be determined by site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of the C-terminal cluster is not required for dimer formation, as the as-isolated FL protein was able to form dimers (Fig. 3, A and B). To initiate the functional analysis of AtNBP35, we performed an in vitro cluster transfer assay and complementation studies with yeast nbp35 and cfd1 mutants. Although the in vitro assay suggested similar cluster transfer properties of AtNBP35 and ScNbp35 (Fig. 4 and Ref. 11Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stümpfig M. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), expression of AtNBP35 could not rescue the growth defect of ScNbp35-depleted cells (Fig. 6). The reason for the lack of complementation is not known; Fe-S cluster assembly on AtNBP35 could be demonstrated in yeast, and control experiments confirmed stable expression of AtNBP35 in the yeast cytosol (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, the growth of ScCfd1-depleted cells was restored albeit partially by expression of FL AtNBP35 but not without the N-terminal domain. Our studies presented here will be fundamental for further studies to unravel the precise molecular function of AtNBP35. Because we have shown that AtNBP35 is an essential gene (Fig. 7), embryo lethality has to be circumvented by the construction of partial or regulatable knock-down mutants, which is in progress in our laboratory. Moreover, it will be interesting to investigate the cellular role of other CIA homologs in plants, including AtNAR1 (41Cavazza C. Martin L. Mondy S. Gaillard J. Ratet P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2008; 102: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and AtCIA1 (42Balk J. Aguilar Netz D.J. Tepper K. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10833-10841Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and to study their protein interactions with AtNBP35. The presence of NBP35 as a homooligomer in the plant cytosol rather than the Cfd1-Nbp35 complex shows that plants provide an insightful model system for Fe-S protein biogenesis and the compartmentalization of this process in eukaryotic cells.

https://openalex.org/W1985939984,"Cathepsin S (CatS) is a lysosomal cysteine protease belonging to the papain superfamily. Because of the relatively broad substrate specificity of this family, a specific substrate for CatS is not yet known. Based on a detailed study of the CatS endopeptidase specificity, using six series of internally quenched fluorescent peptides, we were able to design a specific substrate for CatS. The peptide series was based on the sequence GRWHTVGLRWE-Lys(Dnp)-DArg-NH2, which shows only one single cleavage site between Gly and Leu and where every substrate position between P-3 and P-3′ was substituted with up to 15 different amino acids. The endopeptidase specificity of CatS was mainly determined by the P-2, P-1′, and the P-3′ substrate positions. Based on this result, systematically modified substrates were synthesized. Two of these modified substrates, Mca-GRWPPMGLPWE-Lys(Dnp)-DArg-NH2 and Mca-GRWHPMGAPWE-Lys(Dnp)-DArg-NH2, did not react with the purified cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and cathepsin L (CatL). Using a specific CatS inhibitor, we could further show that these two peptides were not cleaved by endosomal fractions of antigen presenting cells (APCs), when CatS was inhibited and related cysteine proteases cathepsin B, H, L and X were still active. Although aspartic proteases like cathepsin E and cathepsin D were also present, our substrates were suitable to quantify cathepsin S activity specifically in APCs, including B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells without the use of any protease inhibitor. We find that CatS activity differs significantly not only between the three types of professional APCs but also between endosomal and lysosomal compartments.

Lysosomal cysteine proteases of the papain family were long believed to be exclusively involved in nonspecific proteolysis within the lysosome. However, the use of specific protease inhibitors and the study of gene knock-out mice suggested that some of them are involved in many other processes, such as cellular homeostasis, autophagy, apoptosis, and antigen presentation (1Hsing L.C.

These antigens are then processed by proteolytic enzymes, of which the lysosomal cysteine proteases of the papain family constitute an important subset. The generated peptides bind to MHC class II molecules, which are then displayed at the surface of professional APCs including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and B cells. The variety of MHC class II peptide products that can activate CD4+ T cells is on the one hand determined by allelic variation in MHC molecule binding specificity and on the other by the identity and level of activity of processing proteases present in APCs. Although CatS is one of the major proteases involved in antigen processing (4Beck H. Schwarz G. Schroter C.J. Deeg M. Baier D. Stevanovic S. Weber E. Driessen C. Kalbacher H. Eur. J.

CatS has recently emerged as an important proteolytic enzyme in cancer development, and CatS inhibitors have been proposed as anticancer agents (17Wang B. Sun J. Kitamoto S. Yang M. Grubb A.

Compounds targeting CatS in rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma, and psoriasis are already undergoing clinical evaluation, and the development of new CatS inhibitors is still a growing field (19Vasiljeva O. Reinheckel T. Peters C. Turk D. Turk V. Turk B. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A specific substrate for CatS could be a useful tool to test whether newly developed inhibitors are able to inhibit CatS specifically in APCs. In this study we examine the endopeptidase specificity of CatS at the substrate amino acid positions P-3 to P-3′ in detail, using six series of internally quenched fluorescent peptides. Based on this detailed study we were able to design a specific substrate for CatS. The substrate allows a clear differentiation between CatS activity and the activities of enzymatically similar proteases CatB, CatH, CatL, and CatX in APCs. Furthermore, the substrate is suitable for quantification of CatS activity specifically in all three types of professional APCs without the use of any protease inhibitor. Using the specific substrate, we find that CatS activity differs significantly between different types of APCs. Furthermore we show that CatS activity is mainly located in endosomes of the APCs investigated and only to a minor extent in lysosomes. Peptides—Chemicals were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. All of the peptides were synthesized by a solid-phase technique, using the Fmoc strategy on a Syro II synthesizer (MultiSynTech, Witten, Germany). Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA) or from MultiSynTech. Mca was from Sigma. Rink amide resin was purchased from Pep Chem (Reutlingen, Germany). 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetrametyluronium-tetrafluoroborat and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole were from MultiSynTech. The final de-protected peptides were purified by semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC, using a Reprosil C-8 column (5 μm particle size, 150 × 10 mm) from Dr. Maisch GmbH (Tuebingen, Germany) and a two-solvent system: (A) 0,055% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and (B) 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. Purity and molecular mass of the collected fractions was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry, using a MALDI time-of-flight system (Reflex IV, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). All of the peptides were dissolved in water and stored as 2 mm stock solutions at –20 °C. The synthetic substrate Z-FR-AMC was purchased from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany). Enzymes—Human recombinant CatS was kindly provided by K. Schilling and B. Wiederanders (Institute of Biochemistry I, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany). CatS was obtained by autocatalytic processing of the zymogene expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (20Kramer G. Paul A. Kreusch A. Schuler S. Wiederanders B. Schilling K. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 54: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CatL (rat liver) was provided by E. Weber (Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany). CatS and L were quantified by E64 titration, CatS was stored at a concentration of 13 μm, and CatL was stored at a concentration of 18.7 μm at –80 °C. CatB (human liver) was purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) and stored as a 5.8 μm stock solution at –80 °C without further characterization. Enzyme Assays—The specificity of CatS was analyzed in a qualitative and in a quantitative manner. In the qualitative assay, library peptides at a concentration of 20 μm were processed by 1.3 nm CatS in digestion buffer (50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 4 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. After 30 min the reaction was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to an end concentration of 0.5%. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by analytical reverse phase HPLC, using a binary HPLC system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with an SPD-10AV UV-visible detector (Shimadzu), an RF-10Axl fluorescence detector (Shimadzu), a Reprosil C-8 column (5-μm particle size, 150 × 2 mm) from Dr. Maisch GmbH (Tuebingen, Germany), and a two solvent system: (A) 0.055% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and (B) 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. Products were detected by their UV absorbance at 220 nm and by fluorescence emission at 360 nm, following extinction at 280 nm. The percentage of digestion was calculated as 1 minus the UV area ratio of the undigested educt peak of the digestion mixture to the educt peak of an undigested negative control. All of the digestions were conducted in triplicate. The identity of cleavage products was verified by mass spectrometry. In the quantitative assay of the substrate specificity, kinetic constants of eight peptides for each subsite were determined. The initial velocities of the CatS catalyzed reactions were measured at different substrate concentrations in a stopped enzyme assay. The peptides were subjected to CatS cleavage at pH 5.5 as described above, but this time the reaction was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid after 5 min. The product mixture was separated by analytical reverse phase HPLC as described above. The product concentration after 5 min was quantified by fluorescence emission of the N-terminal tryptophan at 360 nm, following extinction at 280 nm. The molar product concentration was calculated by multiplying the fluorescent peak area of the N-terminal fragment with a proportional factor, which was calculated for each peptide individually out of the fluorescent peak area after total substrate turnover. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were calculated by nonlinear regression based on the Michaelis-Menten function using the EKI3 software version 1.3 (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany), which uses the regression analysis described in Ref. 21Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar. The value of kcat was calculated as the Vmax/enzyme concentration ratio. For the specific detection of CatS activity in APCs, 10 μlof subcellular fractions were added to 80 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 4 mm dithiothreitol) and preincubated for 1 h at 37°C. When CatS was inhibited, the buffer additionally contained the specific CatS inhibitor LHVS at a final concentration of 10 nm. The inhibitor was freshly prepared as a 1 mm stock solution in Me2SO and diluted in water. The final Me2SO concentration in the reaction mixture was 0.001%. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of Mca-conjugated substrate solution (0.2 mm in water). The progress of fluorescent product formation was recorded over 2 h, using a fluorimeter (SLT Spectra Fluor, Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) on kinetic mode at 37 °C (λex = 340 nm, λem = 405 nm). All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell Culture—The Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cell line WT100 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (final concentration, 100 units/ml; Invitrogen), and streptomycin (final concentration, 0.1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in tissue culture flasks (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). DCs and macrophages were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll/Paque (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) density gradient centrifugation of heparinized blood obtained from buffy coats. Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were plated (DCs: 1 × 108 cells/8 ml/flask; macrophages: 8 × 107 cells/10 ml/flask) into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (DCs: Cell Star, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany; macrophages: BD Primaria T 75, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) under the same culture conditions as for WT100. After an incubation of 1.5 h for DCs and 2.5 h for macrophages at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were cultured in complete culture medium. The macrophage medium was supplemented with granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (Leukomax; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland), the DC medium with granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 6 days as described previously (22Lautwein A.

Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar). DCs were harvested, whereas macrophages were cultured for one more week in a specialized macrophage medium, consisting of 60% adoptive immunotherapy medium-V, 30% Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen), and 10% human AB+ serum. This resulted in a cell population consisting of 60–70% DCs and 90% macrophages, respectively, as determined by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, Heidelberg, Germany). All of the antibodies for immunophenotyping were obtained commercially (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA). DCs were quantified by co-expression of HLA-DR and CD1a. The macrophages were identified by co-expression of HLA-DR and the macrophage mannose receptor CD206. Subcellular Fractionation and Active Site Labeling—Cell fractionation was performed as previously described (25Schroter C.J. Braun M. Englert J. Beck H. Schmid H. Kalbacher H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 227: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, resuspended in 2.2 ml of fractionation buffer, (10 mm Tris buffer, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4), and then homogenized at 4 °C using a cell cracker (HGM Lab Equipments, Heidelberg, Germany). Debris was separated by centrifugation at 8000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Endolysosomal fractions were separated by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 min (Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge, Palo Alto, CA). Finally, the lysosomes were separated from endosomes by hypotonic lysis with double distilled H2O (approximately 5-fold of the pellet volume) and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 min. Lysosomal material was released into the supernatant, and endosomes remained in the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. Total protein content was determined according to Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For active site labeling of cysteine proteases in subcellular fractions of macrophages, the compound DCG0N was used. DCG0N, a derivative of DCG04 with identical labeling characteristics, is a biotin-labeled active site-directed probe specific for active papain-like proteases (27Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 28Reich M. van Swieten P.F. Sommandas V. Kraus M. Fischer R. Weber E. Kalbacher H. Overkleeft H.S. Driessen C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 81: 990-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions, in which protease activity was inhibited, were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with either E64 at a concentration of 10 μm or LHVS at a concentration of 10 nm. Subcellular fractions without protease inhibition were treated in the same way. After inhibition, the samples were labeled with 10 μm DCG0N in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for 30 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (0.67 μg of total protein/lane) on a 12% separating gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then blocked overnight at 4 °C, using TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.0), containing 10% (v/v) Roti® Block (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The enzyme bands were stained with a streptavidin-peroxidase reagent (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Endopeptidase Specificity of Cathepsin S—Using six series of internally quenched peptides with single amino acid modifications, we analyzed the endopeptidase specificity of CatS at the substrate amino acid positions P-3 to P-3′ in detail. The peptide library was based on the CatS-sensitive substrate GRWHTVGLRWE-Lys(Dnp)-DArg-NH2, which shows only one single cleavage site between Gly and Leu and where the fluorescence of the N-terminal tryptophan is quenched by the Dnp group. Fig. 1 shows the results for all the qualitative analyses of CatS specificity for all substrate positions between P-3 and P-3′. Table 1 shows the kinetic parameters of eight selected peptides per modified substrate position, determined in the quantitative assay. At the P-3 position, all of the 15 tested amino acids were accepted with nearly identical susceptibilities to CatS. Although no special group of amino acids was preferred by CatS at the P-3 position, the negatively charged aspartic acid showed the lowest Vmax and kcat/Km values and was the least well accepted residue in this position. At the P-2 position the hydrophobic branched amino acids valine, norleucine, as well as methionine were clearly preferred by CatS. The substrates with valine and norleucine at the P-2 position showed the highest Vmax values in this series followed by the aromatic phenylalanine. The highest kcat/Vmax values were also obtained by these peptides. Interestingly, the amino acid isoleucine was not favored at the P-2 position. Although all other internally quenched fluorescent peptides with P-2 modifications showed relatively low kcat/Km values (<1 s–1 μm–1), no peptide was completely resistant to the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by CatS. At the S1 subsite of CatS no clear discrimination was observed. In contrast to the P-2 series, all of the substrates with P-1 variations showed kcat/Km values around 1 s–1 μm–1 or higher. However, peptides with lysine and glutamine at the P-1 position were more susceptible to hydrolysis than the others. They showed the highest Vmax and kcat values not only in the P-1 series, but also among all tested peptides. Substrates with isoleucine and aspartic acid showed the lowest kcat values. Together with valine these were the least well accepted amino acids at this subsite. Among all tested substrates, amino acid permutations at P-1′ affected the hydrolysis reaction most significantly. The substrates containing the hydrophobic branched amino acids valine, leucine, norleucine and isoleucine were hydrolyzed with significantly higher Vmax and kcat/Km values than substrates containing other amino acids at this position. Substrates with charged amino acids at the P-1′ position showed the lowest Vmax values among all of the tested peptides, and the peptide with proline at P-1′ position was the only completely resistant peptide. Together with the qualitative analysis, this indicates that CatS favors hydrophobic branched amino acids at P-1′ position, whereas substrates with charged and aromatic amino acids were hydrolyzed weakly. Because all peptides of the P-2′ series show relatively similar Vmax and Km values, and no peptide was discriminated compared with the basis peptide, the P-2′ position could be occupied by every tested amino acid without affecting hydrolysis. In contrast, the kinetic constants of the P-3′ series peptides differ significantly from each other. Substrates with branched hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids showed the highest Vmax values and the lowest Km values, whereas peptides with charged amino acids were hydrolyzed with the lowest Vmax and highest Km values. Also the glycine peptide was hydrolyzed very weakly, indicating that a side chain at the P-3′ position of the substrate is advantageous. It is noteworthy that the poorly digested peptides of the P-3′ series show relatively high Km values at low or intermediate Vmax values compared with other series. Hydrophobic amino acids at the P-3′ position result in substrates with higher affinity, in contrast to charged amino acids, which result in low affinity substrates. Taken together, these data show that the substrate specificity of CatS was mainly determined by the P-2, P-1′, and P-3′ substrate positions. The amino acid preferences of these positions are summarized in Table 2. The most restrictive position in our assay was the P-1′ substrate position.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of six peptide series based on the sequence GRWHTVG ↓ LRWE-Lys(Dnp)-DArg-NH2 by recombinant human cathepsin S for characterization of all subsites from S3 to S3′Substrate positionAmino acidKmVmaxkcat/KmSubstrate positionAmino acidKmVmaxkcat/Kmμmμm/min1/(s × μm)μmμm/min1/(s × μm)P-3F1.42 ± 0.320.450 ± 0.0044.05P-1′F4.80 ± 0.440.206 ± 0.0040.55K1.94 ± 0.290.349 ± 0.0062.30K5.35 ± 1.090.071 ± 0.0040.17V2.76 ± 0.020.752 ± 0.0113.49V2.37 ± 0.231.005 ± 0.0165.43G5.14 ± 0.120.626 ± 0.0051.56Cit1.71 ± 0.380.156 ± 0.0031.17D1.88 ± 0.090.154 ± 0.0011.05X0.73 ± 0.050.644 ± 0.02711.24X1.60 ± 0.240.367 ± 0.0052.95R2.44 ± 0.260.082 ± 0.0010.43P3.24 ± 0.320.478 ± 0.011.89I1.98 ± 0.220.579 ± 0.0113.75I0.48 ± 0.090.216 ± 0.0065.82LaThe basis peptide of the library experiment.2.37 ± 0.170.616 ± 0.0093.34P-2F2.01 ± 0.090.262 ± 0.0081.67P-2′F5.27 ± 0.350.730 ± 0.0141.78K7.82 ± 0.540.136 ± 0.0060.22K1.05 ± 0.120.484 ± 0.0195.91T9.30 ± 1.070.133 ± 0.0040.18H3.12 ± 0.010.419 ± 0.0021.72VaThe basis peptide of the library experiment.2.37 ± 0.170.616 ± 0.0093.34Q2.59 ± 0.150.637 ± 0.0123.16G12.86 ± 0.270.242 ± 0.0050.24D3.14 ± 0.100.455 ± 0.0021.86D12.37 ± 0.350.143 ± 0.0020.15RaThe basis peptide of the library experiment.2.37 ± 0.170.616 ± 0.0093.34X4.18 ± 0.160.277 ± 0.0030.85P1.31 ± 0.100.296 ± 0.0042.91P5.91 ± 0.290.231 ± 0.0040.50I1.50 ± 0.300.406 ± 0.0093.47I3.95 ± 0.440.174 ± 0.0030.57M7.79 ± 0.490.536 ± 0.0130.89P-1F2.58 ± 0.120.774 ± 0.0123.84P-3′F8.20 ± 0.390.83 ± 0.0101.30K27.47 ± 1.652.939 ± 0.1501.37K37.87 ± 3.160.551 ± 0.0310.19Q24.90 ± 0.893.834 ± 0.2301.97H14.93 ± 0.780.179 ± 0.0040.15T5.06 ± 0.111.083 ± 0.0202.74G16.48 ± 0.390.299 ± 0.0050.23D2.80 ± 0.100.265 ± 0.0091.22WaThe basis peptide of the library experiment.2.37 ± 0.170.616 ± 0.0093.34X10.47 ± 0.591.566 ± 0.0391.92D16.68 ± 1.910.353 ± 0.0300.27P19.98 ± 0.751.277 ± 0.0270.82R11.54 ± 0.240.400 ± 0.0060.44I5.12 ± 0.360.359 ± 0.0030.90I8.20 ± 0.690.897 ± 0.0041.40GaThe basis peptide of the library experiment.2.37 ± 0.170.616 ± 0.0093.34a The basis peptide of the library experiment.

https://openalex.org/W2087255503,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf1 kinase plays a critical role in recalibrating cellular metabolism in response to glucose depletion. Hundreds of genes show changes in expression levels when the SNF1 gene is deleted. However, cells can adapt to the absence of a specific gene when grown in long term culture. Here we apply a chemical genetic method to rapidly and selectively inactivate a modified Snf1 kinase using a pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitor. By allowing cells to adjust to a change in carbon source prior to inhibition of the Snf1 kinase activity, we identified a set of genes whose expression increased when Snf1 was inhibited. Prominent in this set are genes that are activated by Gcn4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes. Deletion of Snf1 increased Gcn4 protein levels without affecting its mRNA levels. The increased Gcn4 protein levels required the Gcn2 kinase and Gcn20, regulators of GCN4 translation. These data indicate that Snf1 functions upstream of Gcn20 to regulate control of GCN4 translation in S. cerevisiae.

These data indicate that Snf1 functions upstream of Gcn20 to regulate control of GCN4 translation in S. cerevisiae. Snf1 is the catalytic subunit of a trimeric kinase complex and is one of the founding members of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 2The abbreviations used are:AMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseTORtarget of rapamycinuORFupstream open reading frameHAhemagglutininGOgene ontology 2The abbreviations used are:AMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseTORtarget of rapamycinuORFupstream open reading frameHAhemagglutininGOgene ontology family that is present in all eukaryotic cells. AMPK serves as a nutrient sensor that is activated during times of nutrient and energy limitation (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Once activated, Snf1/AMPK phosphorylates enzymes and transcription factors that recalibrate metabolism to conserve energy. In yeast, Snf1 is most active when cells are grown under glucose-limiting conditions where it promotes gluconeogenesis and utilization of alternative carbon sources (2Hedbacker K. Carlson M. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2408-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Earlier studies that compared transcript profiles of cells expressing Snf1 with those lacking Snf1 identified a large number of genes whose expression is Snf1-dependent (3Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26146-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As expected, many of the Snf1-regulated genes participate in carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Furthermore, the Snf1-mediated regulation of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins may explain its global effect on gene expression (3Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26146-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this study, we created an analog-sensitive allele of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF1 gene that could be rapidly inactivated upon exposure to a pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitor (4Knight Z.A. Shokat K.M. Cell. 2007; 128: 425-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast to using an snf1Δ mutation, chemical inhibition of Snf1 allowed us to identify genes whose expression is controlled by the kinase activity of Snf1 and not some other function of the protein. Using this system and genome-wide mRNA analysis, we identified a large number of genes whose expression is negatively regulated by Snf1. A common feature of many of these Snf1-repressed genes is their dependence on the Gcn4 transcriptional activator for proper expression. AMP-activated protein kinase target of rapamycin upstream open reading frame hemagglutinin gene ontology AMP-activated protein kinase target of rapamycin upstream open reading frame hemagglutinin gene ontology In response to amino acid limitation, Gcn4 activates the transcription of a large number of genes that encode proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis (5Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The regulation of Gcn4 itself lies primarily at the level of GCN4 mRNA translation (6Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 7Irniger S. Braus G.H. Curr. Genet. 2003; 44: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). During amino acid starvation, uncharged tRNA molecules bind and activate the Gcn2 kinase, which phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α. Phosphorylation of eIF2α promotes GCN4 translation by inhibiting translation of four small open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5′-regulatory region of the GCN4 message. Once translated, the stability of the Gcn4 protein provides a second level of control (7Irniger S. Braus G.H. Curr. Genet. 2003; 44: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a role for Snf1 in repressing the translation of GCN4 mRNA, revealing a previously unrecognized mode of regulation for GCN4 translation and further illuminating the cross-talk between regulatory pathways that respond to amino acid and carbon source availability. Media and Growth Assays—Synthetic complete media (SC) were prepared as described (8Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 179-180Google Scholar); synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura) was used to maintain plasmid selection as indicated. Halo assays were performed as described (9Rubenstein E.M. McCartney R.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Shirra M.K. Arndt K.M. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 222-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For growth curves, cultures were grown overnight to saturation in SC-Ura medium containing 2! glucose and then diluted in SC-Ura medium containing 2! raffinose and 0.05! glucose to an A600 of 0.1. Cultures were grown until the A600 reached 0.3, divided, and incubated with either dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or 25 μm 2NM-PP1 dissolved in Me2SO, and A600 values were recorded every 30 min. Yeast Strains—The S. cerevisiae strains used in these experiments are listed in Table 1. All strains have the same genetic background as FY2, a GAL2+ derivative of S288C (10Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1996; 11: 53-55Crossref Scopus (770) Google Scholar). FY1193 was obtained from Fred Winston. MSY strains have been described previously (11Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4936-4943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KY and PY strains were constructed by genetic mating and tetrad dissection or integrative transformations. To generate strains containing the gcn4Δ::KANMX4 mutation or the gcn20Δ::KANMX4 mutation, oligonucleotides were designed to amplify by PCR the alleles from the appropriate strain in the S. cerevisiae deletion collection (12Winzeler E.A.

The plasmid encoding Gcn4c-13myc, pPS127, was generated by gap repair (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. eds.

Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which is a YCp50-based (CEN/ARS, URA3) plasmid expressing Gcn4, but p238 also contains the point mutations in the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) described by Mueller et al. (19Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The p238 plasmid was digested with AflII and XbaI, and the 9.6-kb fragment was transformed into PY1017, a strain that contained a GCN4-13myc::KANMX6 allele, previously created by PCR-mediated one-step gene replacement (13Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar). In some experiments, we needed to use a 13myc epitope, instead of the HA tag, because expression of Gcn4c (untagged or tagged) in strains lacking a chromosomal copy of GCN4 induced expression of an unknown protein that was recognized by HA antibody in Western blot analysis and migrated at a molecular weight similar to Gcn4 in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gap-repaired pPS127 plasmids (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. eds.

The plasmid encoding Gcn4-13myc, pPS128, was created by substituting the AflII-XbaI fragment from pPS127, encoding the C terminus of Gcn4 and 13myc tag, into the same sites in p164 (18Hinnebusch A.G.

Oligonucleotide and plasmid sequences are available upon request. Yeast Microarray Analysis—Yeast cultures were grown in triplicate to an A600 of 0.8-1.0 at 30 °C in SC-Ura medium containing 2! glucose. Cultures were shifted to medium containing 2! raffinose and 0.05! glucose for 2 h. The drug 2NM-PP1 was added to cultures to a final concentration of 25 μm for 40 min prior to harvesting. Total RNA samples were prepared from cells by glass bead lysis, digested with DNase, and purified (RNeasy kit, Qiagen). Sample quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent). Triplicate RNA samples were combined, and 7 μg of the yeast RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Biotin-labeled RNA probes were prepared using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo). The biotin-labeled RNA probe (15 μg) was fragmented and hybridized to an Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 array. Arrays were washed using an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. DAT files were generated using Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 (MAS5). Values from duplicate arrays were compared and found to be highly reproducible. Spot fluorescence intensity values ranged from 0 to 5.7 with a standard deviation of 0.38 and 0.43 for the duplicate sets. The Affymetrix data discussed here have been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (20Edgar R. Domrachev M. Lash A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 207-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE12061 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). In addition, normalized values are given in supplemental Table 1. Northern Blot Analysis—Cells grown at 30 °C as described in the figure legends were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were frozen immediately by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were thawed in the presence of RNA lysis buffer and processed as described (21Arndt K.M. Ricupero-Hovasse S. Winston F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1490-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Hybridization probes were prepared by PCR and random-prime labeling (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. eds. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York2007Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells grown at 30 °C as described in the figure legends were harvested as described for the Northern blot analysis. Cell pellets were thawed in the presence of lysis buffer (22Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science. 1987; 237: 874-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and 10 mm NaF, and processed as described (23Shirra M.K. Rogers S.E. Alexander D.E. Arndt K.M. Genetics. 2005; 169: 1957-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), except that 50 μg of total extract was separated on an SDS-10! polyacrylamide gel. The HA epitope antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used at a 1:3000 dilution, and the c-Myc epitope antibody (Covance) was used at a 1:500 dilution. Antibody directed against Sse1, a component of the Hsp90 chaperone complex, was used at a 1:2000 dilution as a loading control (gift from Jeff Brodsky, University of Pittsburgh). Western blot experiments were performed two to five times with extracts prepared from independently grown cultures. Representative results are shown. β-Galactosidase Assays—Extract preparations, β-galactosidase assays, and unit calculations were performed as described (24Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values represent the average of two to four transformants for each plasmid assayed at two different extract concentrations. Standard errors ranged from 3 to 22!. Development of an Analog-sensitive Allele of SNF1—To study the immediate downstream targets of the Snf1 kinase, we sought a means to rapidly and selectively inhibit the activity of Snf1 in vivo. To this end, we chose to employ a chemical genetic method that enabled rapid, potent, and selective inhibition of the kinase activity of Snf1 by an enlarged analog of the pyrazolopyrimidine-based kinase inhibitor PP1, through introducing a space-creating mutation at the conserved gatekeeper position within the kinase domain (4Knight Z.A. Shokat K.M. Cell. 2007; 128: 425-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The gatekeeper residue Ile-132 in the Snf1 kinase domain was changed to glycine, creating the snf1-as allele. The Snf1-I132G protein is fully functional as judged by its ability to complement a deletion of the SNF1 gene for growth on alternative carbon sources, growth in the absence of inositol, and the induction of invertase (data not shown). To identify a PP1 analog that could specifically inhibit Snf1 kinase activity, cells expressing either wild-type Snf1 or Snf1-I132G were tested for the ability to grow on medium containing sucrose in the presence of a panel of PP1 analogs (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Among the 22 compounds tested, the molecule 2NM-PP1 most effectively inhibited growth of snf1-as cells without affecting growth of SNF1 strains. The functionality of the Snf1-I132G variant and the selectivity of inhibition by 2NM-PP1 were assessed by a more sensitive assay in which the growth rate of cells was monitored in raffinose medium (Fig. 1B). Snf1 kinase function is required for cells to utilize raffinose as a carbon source. The growth rate of the snf1-as (Snf1-I132G) strain but not the wild-type strain was reduced in the presence of 2NM-PP1, indicating that 2NM-PP1 is specific for the Snf1 variant. Furthermore, in the absence of 2NM-PP1, the snf1-as strain showed a growth rate comparable with the wild-type strain, indicating that the I132G substitution does not itself affect Snf1 function. To further characterize the Snf1-I132G variant, we examined the Snf1-dependent induction of SUC2 mRNA by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). In cells expressing wild-type Snf1, we detected a large increase in the abundance of SUC2 mRNA relative to ACT1 mRNA upon shifting cells from glucose to raffinose (Fig. 2, lane 2). The addition of the inhibitor 2NM-PP1 did not affect the induction of SUC2 mRNA in wild-type cells (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). In the absence of 2NM-PP1, induction of SUC2 mRNA in the Snf1-I132G strain (Fig. 2, lane 10) was indistinguishable from induction in the wild-type strain (Fig. 2, lane 2). However, addition of 2NM-PP1 to raffinose-grown Snf1-I132G cells returned SUC2 mRNA levels back to the uninduced state (Fig. 2, lanes 15-22). A titration of the inhibitor showed that 25 μm 2NM-PP1 was sufficient to abrogate Snf1-I132G function. Lower concentrations of inhibitor or shorter incubation times only partially reduced SUC2 transcription (data not shown). Based on the results of the growth assays and SUC2 Northern blot analyses, incubation with 25 μm 2NM-PP1 for 40 min was used to inhibit the activity of Snf1-I132G in subsequent experiments. Taken together, our data show that the combination of the Snf1-I132G variant and the pyrazolopyrimidine compound 2NM-PP1 provides us with the ability to efficiently and selectively inhibit the Snf1 kinase in vivo. Identification of Snf1-regulated mRNAs—The Snf1-I132G variant allowed us to first grow cells in conditions where Snf1 was activated and then selectively inhibit its kinase activity by the addition of 2NM-PP1. We reasoned that this approach would enhance our ability to identify Snf1-repressed genes, a class of genes that had not been well studied. Snf1 activity was first stimulated by growing cells for 2 h in medium containing raffinose and then inhibited by addition of 2NM-PP1. RNA was harvested 40 min following addition of the inhibitor. At this time, the growth rate of these cells had not yet changed (Fig. 1B), although SUC2 transcription was greatly reduced (Fig. 2). Therefore, any effects on mRNA levels should not be due to the cells undergoing growth arrest. Using Affymetrix yeast genome microarrays to detect mRNA transcript levels, 153 genes showed a greater than 2.8-fold increase in mRNA abundance in the snf1-as strain treated with 2NM-PP1 compared with the SNF1 strain treated with 2NM-PP1 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 1). These genes were categorized by their gene ontology (GO) annotation to determine whether any biological processes were enriched in this set of genes (25Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. Matese J.C. Richardson J.E. Ringwald M. Rubin G.M. Sherlock G. Nat.

(p value of <1 × 10-42) of the genes repressed by Snf1 clustered to the GO-ID 6519, “amino acid and derivative metabolic process.” Gcn4-regulated Genes Are Repressed by Snf1—Since Gcn4 is known to activate the transcription of many amino acid biosynthetic genes, we asked if any of the 153 genes up-regulated upon acute inhibition of Snf1 kinase activity are targets of Gcn4 (5Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). We compared our data with two previously published sets of Gcn4-regulated genes. The first set contains those genes whose transcription decreased 1.5-fold or more when GCN4 was deleted (26Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Armour C.D. Bennett H.A. Coffey E. Dai H. He Y.D. Kidd M.J. King A.M. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Lum P.Y. Stepaniants S.B. Shoemaker D.D. Gachotte D. Chakraburtty K. Simon J. Bard M. Friend S.H. Cell. 2000; 102: 109-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, similar to our conditions, these data were obtained from cells grown in synthetic complete media as opposed to media with limited amino acids, which have been used in other studies (5Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Of the 117 genes whose proper expression requires Gcn4 activity (26Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Armour C.D. Bennett H.A. Coffey E. Dai H. He Y.D. Kidd M.J. King A.M. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Lum P.Y. Stepaniants S.B. Shoemaker D.D. Gachotte D. Chakraburtty K. Simon J. Bard M. Friend S.H. Cell. 2000; 102: 109-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 54 were up-regulated in the inhibitor-treated snf1-as strain (Fig. 3B). The second set we examined was compiled by Pokholok et al. (27Pokholok D.K. Harbison C.T. Levine S. Cole M. Hannett N.M. Lee T.I. Bell G.W. Walker K. Rolfe P.A. Herbolsheimer E. Zeitlinger J. Lewitter F. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), who generated a list of 84 Gcn4 target genes using the following criteria: 1) their expression changed in a Gcn4-dependent manner during amino acid starvation; 2) their promoters contained a conserved Gcn4-binding site; and 3) their promoters were shown to bind Gcn4 in vitro. Remarkably, half of the genes in the Pokholok set showed increased expression in our experiment (Fig. 3, A and C). We considered it a positive match if at least one of the two genes with a shared promoter (27Pokholok D.K. Harbison C.T. Levine S. Cole M. Hannett N.M. Lee T.I. Bell G.W. Walker K. Rolfe P.A. Herbolsheimer E. Zeitlinger J. Lewitter F. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) was found in our set. Thus, approximately one-third of the genes whose expression increased in response to Snf1 inhibition are predicted to require Gcn4 for their transcriptional activation. To confirm our microarray data, we analyzed several of the Snf1-repressed genes by Northern blot analysis, focusing on those involved in amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 4). We measured mRNA levels for these genes in snf1Δ cells containing plasmids that express Snf1 (SNF1), Snf1-I132G (snf1-as), or no Snf1 protein (empty vector, snf1Δ). The Northern blot analysis confirmed that treatment of the snf1-as strain with 2NM-PP1 induced expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 5). The expression of many of these genes was repressed when SNF1 cells were transferred from glucose to raffinose media, a condition where Snf1 is more active (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2), and increased in snf1Δ cells, relative to SNF1 cells in raffinose media (compare lanes 2 or 4 to lane 3). Interestingly, a few of the genes, notably HIS5, ARG3, and HIS1, showed higher levels of expression in the inhibitor-treated snf1-as strain than in the snf1Δ strain. This suggests that cells may adapt to the absence of Snf1 and shows the power of using the analog-sensitive allele to look at acute effects of inactivating Snf1. Snf1 Represses ARG1 Expression in Glucose Medium—Our analysis of Gcn4-dependent transcripts showed that in many cases, including the well studied ARG1 gene, the increase in mRNA levels observed in the snf1-as strain was also detected in an snf1Δ strain grown in raffinose medium (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 5). Therefore, we chose to use snf1Δ strains in the remainder of the experiments presented here to simplify the growth conditions and analysis. We also examined the Snf1-dependent repression of ARG1 in strains grown in the presence of high levels of glucose. Deletion of SNF1 caused a clear increase in ARG1 expression under these conditions (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). Although Snf1 activity is greatly reduced in cells grown in glucose-rich media (28Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the residual, low level of Snf1 activity is apparently sufficient to repress ARG1 expression. Induction of ARG1 in the Absence of Snf1 Is Dependent on the Gcn4 Activator—To determine whether the increase in ARG1 mRNA in the absence of Snf1 was dependent on the Gcn4 activator, we constructed strains lacking SNF1, GCN4, or both genes (Fig. 5). Gcn4 is required to generate ARG1 mRNA in snf1Δ strains (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 8), suggesting that derepression of ARG1 in the absence of Snf1 does not bypass the requirement for Gcn4. Rather, Snf1 most likely regulates ARG1 transcription at a step prior to activator function. Snf1 Affects Gcn4 Protein Levels but Not GCN4 mRNA Levels—A simple explanation for the induction of ARG1 transcription in snf1Δ strains would be an increase in Gcn4 levels. Although many studies have shown Snf1 to activate transcription, Snf1 is also known to cause repression of some genes, most notably HXT1 (29Tomas-Cobos L. Sanz P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We first asked whether Snf1 repressed GCN4 transcript levels. By Northern blot analysis, we found that deletion of SNF1 did not affect the level of GCN4 mRNA, regardless of whether cells were grown using glucose or raffinose as a carbon source (Fig. 5). Therefore, the effect of Snf1 on the expression of Gcn4-regulated genes is not because of changes in GCN4 mRNA abundance. The control of Gcn4 protein levels by regulation of its translation and stability has been well characterized (7Irniger S. Braus G.H. Curr. Genet. 2003; 44: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When cells are grown in amino acid-rich conditions, translation of Gcn4 is repressed, and proteolysis of Gcn4 is enhanced. To determine whether Snf1 is involved in regulating Gcn4 translation or stability, we placed three copies of the HA epitope on the C terminus of Gcn4 by integrative transformation and measured Gcn4 protein levels by Western blot"

Here we tested the impact of CREB on expression of cyclin D1 and wingless-related mouse mammary tumor virus integration site 10b (Wnt10b) in 3T3-L1 cells. Forced depletion of CREB blocked Bt2cAMP-stimulated cyclin D1 expression and basal Wnt10b gene expression. Two CREB-binding sites were identified in the Wnt10b promoter region. Ablation of either site partially blocked promoter activity, while mutation of both sites completely suppressed promoter activity. These results suggest that CREB activates transcription from both the cyclin D1 and Wnt10b gene promoters. What accounts for the differential regulation of cyclin D1 and Wnt10b genes by cAMP? Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed CREB bound to the Wnt10b promoter in untreated preadipocytes but not following treatment with Bt2cAMP. CREB binding to the cyclin D1 promoter was detected in untreated cells and post-Bt2cAMP. Differences between CREB binding to the two genes correlated with increasing methylation of the Wnt10b promoter following Bt2cAMP treatment, whereas no methylation of the cyclin D1 promoter was observed. Treatment of cells with the methylase inhibitor 5-azacytidine restored CREB binding to the Wnt10b gene promoter and prevented the inhibition of Wnt10b RNA expression by Bt2cAMP. We conclude that cAMP stimulates phosphorylation and binding of CREB to the cyclin D1 gene promoter.

We conclude that cAMP stimulates phosphorylation and binding of CREB to the cyclin D1 gene promoter. Simultaneously, hypermethylation of the Wnt10b gene promoter suppresses binding of CREB, allowing adipogenesis to proceed. Adipogenesis is the process by which mature, insulin-responsive adipocytes are generated from undifferentiated preadipocytes and mesenchymal progenitor cells (1.Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). This process is crucial to the normal development of adipose tissue and its expansion in response to excess dietary energy intake. Alternatively, most lipodystrophic syndromes are characterized by a suppression of adipogenesis and an increase in adipocyte death. Cells destined to the adipose lineage arise late in development from multipotential stem cells of mesodermal origin (1.Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref Scopus (1968) Google Scholar, 2.Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. Negrel R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 3.Poissonnet C.M.

Pediatr. 1988; 113: 1-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The commitment of the multipotent stem cells to the adipocyte lineage is a poorly understood process. However, once committed to the adipocyte lineage, nonproliferating preadipocytes become responsive to external stimuli that induce their differentiation to mature adipocytes. These stimuli include insulin-like growth factor-1 or insulin (which appears to work through the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor), glucocorticoids, and agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (1.Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Exposure of these cells to adipogenic inducers initiates a temporally orchestrated cascade of gene expression events that characterize adipogenic differentiation. These agents initially induce a period of mitotic expansion during which expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. β and δ is increased, whereas expression of factors like Pref-1, necdin, and Wnt10b are diminished. Following mitotic expansion, differentiation begins, during which peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and C/EBP α are up-regulated. These transcription factors regulate the expression of many of the factors that characterize the mature adipocyte phenotype like GLUT4 (5.Cha H.C. Oak N.R. Kang S. Tran T.A. Kobayashi S. Chiang S.H.

We previously reported that the activity of the transcription factor CREB was stimulated by cAMP mimetics and insulin in both preadipocytes (8.Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K.

Subsequent experiments demonstrated that ectopic expression of constitutively active forms of CREB could induce adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells (9.Klemm D.J. Leitner J.W. Watson P. Nesterova A.

Klemm D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1326-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alternately, ectopic expression of dominant negative forms of CREB blocked adipogenic conversion and stimulated apoptosis of mature adipocytes. Recent studies using these techniques as well as CREB-specific antisense and siRNA confirm these results and indicate that CREB may promote adipogenesis by stimulating the expression of C/EBP β (12.Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and PPARγ (13.Fox K.E. Fankell D.M. Erickson P.F. Majka S.M. Crossno J.T. Klemm D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 281: 40341-40353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, ectopic expression of C/EBPs α and β or PPARγ, which drive adipogenic differentiation in the presence of CREB, are unable to do so in the absence of CREB (and ATF-1) (13.Fox K.E.

These results suggest that CREB may modulate other pathways or processes involved in adipogenesis apart from the regulation of C/EBP β and PPARγ. For example, cyclin D1 is up-regulated during the period of mitotic expansion that precedes adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (14.Hishida T. Naito K. Osada S. Nishizuka M. Imagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 370: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15.Kim A.H. Hausman G.J. Hausman D.B. Martin R.J. Dean R.G. Obesity Res. 2001; 9: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here we show that depletion of cyclin D1 inhibits preadipocyte proliferation and ultimately adipogenic conversion. Cyclic AMP-induced cyclin D1 expression and MDI-stimulated preadipocyte proliferation were suppressed in CREB-deficient cells. This indicated that CREB was required for cyclin D1 expression in response to cAMP. Results reported herein also demonstrate that Wnt10b expression is partly regulated by CREB during early adipogenesis. Of the ∼19 members of the Wnt family of signaling proteins, six are either expressed in preadipocytes or during adipogenic conversion (16.Nishizuka M. Koyanagi A. Osada S. Imagawa M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3201-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17.Prestwich T.C. MacDougald O.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Wnts 1, 6 and 10b are expressed in preadipocytes and inhibit initiation of adipogenesis. Alternately, Wnts 4, 5a, and 5b are expressed transiently during adipocyte differentiation and promote the differentiation cascade. These factors control adipocyte differentiation via canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. Expression of Wnt10b is suppressed by cAMP mimetics but not insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 or glucocorticoids in 3T3-L1 cells (18.Bennett C.N. Ross S.F. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N. Johnson K.W. Harrison S.D. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30998-31004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Because cAMP mimetics regulate CREB transcriptional activity and suppress Wnt10b expression, we hypothesized that both events may be linked. We found that depletion of CREB inhibits Wnt10b gene promoter activity. The effect of CREB on Wnt10b gene expression appears to be mediated by two putative cAMP response elements (CREs) in the Wnt10b gene promoter. This suggested that CREB was required to maintain basal Wnt10b gene transcription rather than repress Wnt10b expression in response to cAMP mimetics. These results raise two related questions. First, how does activation of CREB transcriptional activity lead to inhibition of Wnt10b gene transcription. Second, how does activation of CREB simultaneously stimulate cyclin D1 gene transcription while attenuating Wnt10b gene transcription? Our results indicate that CREB binds the cyclin D1 gene promoter before and after cAMP or MDI treatment, whereas CREB binds the Wnt10b gene promoter only before induction with adipogenic agents. The differential binding of CREB to these gene promoters appears to be modulated in part by DNA methylation.

Cell Culture and Adipocyte Differentiation in Vitro—3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were passaged in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes after siRNA and/or plasmid transfection, upon reaching confluency by the addition of high glucose DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 300 μm isobutylmethylxanthine or Bt2cAMP, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin (MDI). After 2 days, the 3T3-L1 cells were transferred to high glucose DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 1 μg/ml insulin and refed every 2 days. Differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes was confirmed by Oil Red O staining of lipid vesicles. Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 10% glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Tablets; Roche Applied Science). After correcting for protein concentrations, the cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli SDS loading buffer, and equal amounts of lysate protein were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then treated with antibodies that recognize the target proteins indicated in each figure overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and subsequently treated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After the blots were washed, specific immune complexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrates. siRNA and Plasmid Transfection and Luciferase Assays—For siRNA transfection, 3T3-L1 cells were plated at 30-50% confluency on 6-well plates in complete medium. Twenty-four hours later the cells were transferred to Optimem for transfection. Double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides were complexed with Oligofectamine reagent and applied to the cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations at a final concentration of 200 nm. Where more than one siRNA oligonucleotide was used, equimolar amounts of the individual oligonucleotides were combined before use. After 3 h, an equal volume of DMEM containing 30% fetal calf serum was added to the wells. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before subsequent manipulations. For plasmid transfections, plates of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to 70-80% confluency and transfected with the indicated plasmids with Lipofectamine Plus reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Luciferase assays were conducted on lysates from cells transfected with plasmid (pGL3-Basic; Promega) containing a 900-bp region of the Wnt10 gene promoter (see Fig. 5) linked to the firefly luciferase gene. The cells were cotransfected with the plasmid pRL-TK as an internal control. Cell lysates and luciferase reactions were performed with a dual luciferase reporter assay system on a Turner Designs 20/20n luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Microscopy—Microscopy was performed on a Nikon TE2000-U inverted epifluorescent microscope. Phase contrast, brightfield images were captured to a personal computer with a Spot Insight color camera (Diagnostic Imaging, Sterling Heights, MI). The images were analyzed and processed with MetaMorph 6.1 Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation for CREB Promoter Binding—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for CREB binding to the cyclin D1 and Wnt10b gene promoters were preformed on 3T3-L1 cells treated with MDI for 48 h using kits from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA) according to their directions. The procedure was modified as described previously (12.Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—cDNA was prepared from cells using Cells-to-cDNA II (Ambion, Austin, TX) reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was performed with 3 μl of transcribed cDNA and 1 pmol of each primer for 30 cycles: hot start at 94 °C for 1 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at appropriate temperature for 45 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final elongation for 8 min at 72 °C. Negative PCR controls included omission of reverse transcriptase or omission of cDNA. β-Actin primers were used to validate each batch of template before use. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet illumination. [3H]Thymidine Uptake—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured as described above, incubated in serum-reduced medium for 24 h, and then transfected as indicated with control or cyclin D1-specific siRNA. During the final 24 h of incubation, half of each cell treatment group was exposed to MDI. During the final 3 h of the 24 h treatment, 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine/ml were added to the cultures. The cells were assayed for thymidine incorporation by standard methods. The results are expressed as 3H dpm/μg of protein. Antisense Oligonucleotides and Treatments—Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The sequence of the antisense oligonucleotide was: CREB, 5′-GGTCATCTAGTCACCGGT-3′, and a random sequence oligonucleotide (Scrambled) with sequence 5′-GTCTGCAGTCGATCTACG-3′ was used as a control. Each antisense or control oligonucleotide was introduced into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide-Lipofectin complexes were prepared in Optimem medium (Invitrogen) and placed on cells at a final concentration of 15 μg/ml Lipofectin and 3 μm oligonucleotide. After 4 h, the cells were refed with conventional growth medium containing 20 μm of the individual oligonucleotides. CREB DNA Binding Measurements—CREB DNA binding was measured using TransAM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. For direct DNA binding, biotinylated double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing each of the putative CREs in the Wnt10b gene promoter (Figs. 5 and 6) were individually bound to the wells of a TransAM assay strip. Control wells were prepared using oligonucleotides containing a consensus CRE (positive control) or a scrambled oligonucleotide (negative control). Competition binding assays were performed with consensus CRE oligonucleotides bound to the assay wells, but binding reactions contained a 10-fold molar excess of each Wnt10b CRE oligonucleotides. All other assay parameters followed the supplier's instructions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis for DNA binding to the Wnt10b or cyclin D1 gene promoters was conducted as described previously (13.Fox K.E. Fankell D.M. Erickson P.F. Majka S.M. Crossno J.T. Klemm D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 281: 40341-40353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pWnt10b-Luciferase Plasmid—A 900-bp region of the Wnt10b gene promoter (from -705 to 216 relative to the primary transcription start site) was PCR-amplified from a mouse genomic library. The fragment was inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the plasmid pGL3-Basic. Two putative CREs in the promoter were mutated to a non-CREB-binding sequence (TCTGGTT) individually or in combination by the method of Huang and Sorkin (21.Huang F. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1268-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DNA Methylation—The methylation status of the cyclin D1 and Wnt10b gene promoters was measured using DNA methylation assay kits from Panomics (Fremont, CA). Basically, 3T3-L1 cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and treated as described in the figure legends. The medium was removed from the cell monolayers, which were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were recovered by scraping into microcentrifuge tubes and pelleted at 500 × g. Genomic DNA was isolated with Genomic DNA extraction reagents from Panomics. Approximately 5 μg of genomic DNA was cleaved with MseI restriction enzyme for 2 h at 37 °C. The DNA fragments were then incubated with the methylation binding protein, MeC2P, for 30 min at 15 °C. The binding reactions were applied to separation columns, and DNA retained on the column was isolated for PCR amplification with primers listed above. The presence of a PCR-amplified product indicates binding of MeC2P to methylated target DNA fragments. Cyclin D1 Is Required for Preadipocyte Proliferation and Adipogenesis—Prior to entering the adipogenic differentiation cascade, 3T3-L1 cells undergo a period of mitotic expansion, which is obligatory for their adipogenic differentiation. This period of proliferation is not essential for adipogenesis of primary preadipocytes or mesenchymal progenitor cells. Treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with the differentiation-inducing mixture MDI stimulates expression of cyclin D1, a key regulator of G1 entry and the G1-S transition, within 6 h (Fig. 1). Cyclin D1 levels remain elevated for 48 h. No change in expression of another cell cycle-related factor, Cdk-4, was observed. Actin levels diminished as differentiation progressed as previously reported (22.Antras J. Hilliou F. Redziniak G. Pairault J. Biol. Cell. 1989; 66: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23.Spiegelman B.M. Farmer S.R. Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the importance of cyclin D1 to mitotic expansion and adipogenesis, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with nonspecific (control) or cyclin D1-specific siRNA. Fig. 2A shows that cyclin D1 is easily detected in cells transfected with control siRNA and exposed to MDI but not in cells receiving cyclin D1-specific siRNA and MDI 36 h post-transfection. Mitotic expansion, which occurs during the 48 h following induction with adipogenic agents was measured by [3H]thymidine uptake with MDI-treated cells. Cells transfected with control siRNA exhibited a more than 3-fold increase in cell number at 48 h, whereas cells transfected with cyclin D1 siRNA showed no increase in cell number (Fig. 2B). Because terminal differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes takes several days longer than the initial expansion phase, adipogenic conversion was measured 9 days following MDI induction. Depletion of cyclin D1 prevented adipogenic conversion as evidenced by an absence of lipid accumulation (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Increased expression of cyclin D1 is required for 3T3-L1 preadipocyte proliferation and adipogenesis. A-C, preadipocytes were transfected with control (Cntrl) or cyclin D1-specific siRNA and replated at confluence 24 h later. A, after an additional 24 h, the cells were treated with MDI. The next day whole cell lysates were prepared, and 10 μg of lysate protein was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were probed with antibodies to cyclin D1. The representative (of three replicates) blot demonstrates depletion of cyclin D1 by specific siRNA. The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated to the right of the panel. B, the following day cells were treated with MDI for 48 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as an index of proliferation. The data averaged from three experiments shows that depletion of cyclin D1 inhibits preadipocyte proliferation. C, siRNA-transfected cells were treated with MDI for 48 h and then transferred to medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml insulin for 7 days. Medium plus insulin was replaced every 48 h. On day 9, the cells were fixed and stained with Oil Red O. Representative brightfield micrographs show that cyclin D1 depletion suppresses adipogenesis and lipid accumulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is unlikely that CREB induces cyclin D1 expression in preadipocyte and mesenchymal stem cell models that do not require mitotic expansion for PPARγ expression and adipogenesis. Although this cyclin is expressed in these models, it is not induced by pro-adipogenic agents (15.Kim A.H. Hausman G.J. Hausman D.B. Martin R.J. Dean R.G.

Obesity Res. 2003; 11: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, the induction of cyclin D1 expression and its obligatory impact on preadipocyte proliferation and adipogenic conversion may be restricted to the 3T3-L1 model.

CREB/ATF-1 siRNA effectively reduced CREB levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes 48-72 h post-transfection (Fig. 3A). We found that forced a loss of CREB/ATF-1 repressed both basal and MDI-stimulated (Fig. 3B) cyclin D1 expression. No changes in Cdk-4 gene expression were observed with MDI and/or siRNA treatments. Likewise, the loss of CREB did not prevent MDI induction of C/EBP β expression as we previously reported (13.Fox K.E. Fankell D.M. Erickson P.F. Majka S.M. Crossno J.T. Klemm D.J. J. Biol.

Thus PP2A is actually a family of enzymes defined by which B subunit is used. The B56 family member B56α is a phosphoprotein that regulates dephosphorylation of BCL2. The stress kinase PKR has been shown to phosphorylate B56α at serine 28 in vitro, but it has been unclear how PKR might regulate the BCL2 phosphatase. In the present study, PKR regulation of B56α in REH cells was examined, because these cells exhibit robust BCL2 phosphatase activity. PKR was found to be basally active in REH cells as would be predicted if the kinase supports B56α-mediated dephosphorylation of BCL2. Suppression of PKR promoted BCL2 phosphorylation with concomitant loss of B56α phosphorylation at serine 28 and inhibition of mitochondrial PP2A activity. PKR supports stress signaling in REH cells, as suppression of PKR promoted chemoresistance to etoposide. Suppression of PKR promoted B56α proteolysis, which could be blocked by a proteasome inhibitor. However, the mechanism by which PKR supports B56α protein does not involve PKR-mediated phosphorylation of the B subunit at serine 28 but may involve eIF2α activation of AKT. Phosphorylation of serine 28 by PKR promotes mitochondrial localization of B56α, because wild-type but not mutant S28A B56α promoted mitochondrial PP2A activity.

Interestingly, this regulatory ERK site is conserved in all of the known B56 family members except B56α. Although ERK may not regulate B56α function negatively, phosphorylation of this particular B56 isoform by the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) has been suggested to affect PP2A function positively (19Xu Z.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5285-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The PP2A isoform that is responsible for BCL2 dephosphorylation contains B56α (12Ruvolo P.P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-derived REH cells express high levels of BCL2, but there is little if any phosphorylation of the protein under basal conditions (24Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether PKR is a physiologic B56α kinase in REH cells and how the kinase might regulate B56α-mediated PP2A function in these cells. It was found that PKR was indeed basally active in REH cells as well as in three other ALL-derived cell lines (i.e. CCRF-CEM, RS (4Mumby M. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and MOLT4). Loss of PKR rendered REH cells resistant to etoposide. PKR supports B56α-mediated mitochondrial and BCL2 phosphatase activity. We found that PKR was responsible for B56α phosphorylation at serine 28, which promoted mitochondrial localization of the B subunit resulting in enhanced mitochondrial PP2A activity and dephosphorylation of BCL2. PKR protects B56α from degradation by the proteasome, although this mechanism does not involve the role of PKR as a B56α kinase. Recently, the Koromilas laboratory identified a role for eIF2α phosphorylation in proteasomal regulation (25Raven J.F. Baltzis D. Wang S. Mounir Z. Papadakis A.I. Gao H.Q. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3097-3108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and in activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade (26Kazemi S. Mounir Z. Baltzis D. Raven J.F. Wang S. Krishnamoorthy J.L. Pluquet O. Pelletier J. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence suggests that PKR protection of B56α from the proteasome may involve phosphorylation of eIF2α and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTor signaling cascade. Consistent with a mechanism whereby phosphorylated eIF2α promotes B56α expression, three ALL cell lines (REH, CCRF-CEM, and MOLT4) displayed phosphorylated eIF2α and expressed B56α, whereas RS(4;11) cells did not display any phosphorylated eIF2α (due to lack of the eIF2α protein) and had little if any B56α. In addition, mitochondrial PP2A activity in the ALL cell lines correlated with B56α expression. In conclusion, the findings presented here suggest that PKR regulates a B56α-mediated apoptotic process that likely includes inactivation of BCL2 by dephosphorylation. Cell Lines—Phoenix™ Ampho retroviral packaging cells were obtained from Orbigen (San Diego, CA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5! newborn calf serum and 5! fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5! CO2. REH, CCRF-CEM, and MOLT4 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 5! newborn calf serum plus 5! fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5! CO2. RS(4;11) cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10! fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5! CO2. The REH/B56α transfectant cell lines were obtained from batch transfections using either an N-terminal HA-tagged plasmid encoding the human PPP2R5A gene (B56α) under the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV; GeneCopoeia, German-town, MD) or its serine 28-mutated counterpart. As a control, a plasmid from GeneCopoeia containing HA-tagged GFP under the cytomegalovirus promoter was used also. To obtain the latter we used a QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as directed by the manufacturer. A complementary primer pair was used to create the S28A mutation (sense primer, cttcacccggaaagctgtccgcaaggcgca). A second complementary primer pair was used to create the S28E mutation (sense primer, cttcacccggaaagaggtccgcaaggcgca). Primer pairs were annealed to the complementary region of a dammethylated parental plasmid and extended using Pfu polymerase to generate a nicked, nonmethylated daughter plasmid containing the mutation. Following digestion of the parental DNA by DpnI, the nicked daughter plasmid was used to transform competent bacterial cells. Mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The plasmids were introduced into REH cells by electroporation (200 V, 975-microfarad capacitance) using a GenePulser Xcell electroporator (Bio-Rad). Transfectants were selected and maintained in the above medium plus 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Manassas, VA). Where appropriate, PKR inhibitor (Calbiochem), LY294002 (Calbiochem), LiCl (Sigma), salubrinal (Tocris, Evansville, MO), and/or MG-132 (Sigma) was added to cells. Analysis of Cell Death and Apoptosis by Annexin V Staining or Sub-G0 Content—Cells were treated with varying doses of etoposide (Sigma), MG-132 (Sigma), PKR inhibitor (Calbiochem), AKT inhibitor VIII (Calbiochem), or rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion, and apoptosis was analyzed either by annexin V staining or measurement of sub-G0 content. Apoptosis was evaluated using the Annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1× annexin binding buffer. 100 μl was transferred to a 5-ml tube, and 5 μl of annexin V-PE and 5 μl of 7-AAD were added to each tube. The cells were mixed gently and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), placing the PE signal in FL2 and the 7-AAD signal in FL3. Intact cells were gated to exclude small debris. Cells in the lower right quadrant of the FL2/FL3 dot plot (labeled with annexin V-PE only) were considered to be in early apoptosis and cells in the upper right quadrant (labeled with annexin V-PE and 7-AAD) in late apoptosis/necrosis. To determine apoptosis by sub-G0 content, a variation of a conventional FACS method to detect sub-2N DNA content in nonviable cells was used. Cells were treated with drug, fixed in methanol, incubated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and stained with 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) prior to analysis using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Retroviral Transduction of shRNA—HuSH shRNA (29-mer) targeting PKR and a negative control plasmid targeting GFP were purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD). These were transiently transfected into Phoenix™ Ampho cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer. Retroviral supernatants were harvested at 48 h post-transfection first by centrifugation for 10 min at room temperature at 800 × g and then by filtration through 0.45 μm surfactant-free cellulose acetate to assure complete removal of producing cells. Polybrene (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was then added to a concentration of 8 μg/ml, and the resulting virus stock was used at once to spinoculate REH cells in a variation of the method of O'Doherty et al. (27O'Doherty U. Swiggard W.J. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Briefly, REH cells were resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 million cells/ml of virus stock, transferred to the wells of a 12-well tissue culture cluster, and centrifuged for 30 min at 30 °C at 1300 × g. After the addition of 1 volume of fresh virus stock, the cells were subject to a second round of centrifugation followed by incubation at 32 °C in 5! CO2 for 30 min. The infected cells were then washed twice with growth medium to remove the Polybrene and allowed to grow for 24 h after which time they were subject to selection with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem). Puromycin-resistant pools of infected cells were assessed for PKR knockdown by Western analysis. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and the phosphorylation status of BCL2 was determined by an immunoprecipitation method that we had used previously (24Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We used a similar method to determine the phosphorylation status of B56α. Because an antibody that could immunoprecipitate B56α was not available, REH cells that exogenously express HA-tagged B56α protein or mutant S28A B56α protein were used. HA-tagged B56α protein from radiolabeled cells was isolated using HA antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The isolated protein was electrophoresed using 10! SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The identity of the labeled band as HA-tagged B56α protein was verified by Western analysis using B56α antisera (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). For other Western analysis, 20 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE using antibodies specific for the analyzed proteins. Antibodies used were p-PKR (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, and Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), PKR (Cell Signaling and Upstate), p-eIF2α (Cell Signaling), eIF2α (Cell Signaling), AKT (Cell Signaling), p-AKT (Cell Signaling), HA (Cell Signaling), lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), BCL2 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), β-actin (Sigma), GAPDH (Santa Cruz), and tubulin (Sigma). The B56α antibody was produced at Alpha Diagnostics International (San Antonio, TX) using a peptide (DGFTRKSVRKAQRQKR) that represents amino acids 22–37 of the PP2A/B56α protein sequence. Molecular weights are presented using an Invitrogen Benchmark™ prestained protein ladder or Bio-Rad Precision Plus Protein™ standards. Where appropriate, densitometric analysis of protein bands was performed using Image J software (version 1.38x available in the public domain from the National Institutes of Health Web site, Bethesda, MD). Isolation of Nuclei and Mitochondria—Subcellular fractionation of cells was performed as described previously (12Ruvolo P.P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 107 cells) were swelled in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min, aspirated repeatedly through a 25-gauge needle (25 strokes), and centrifuged at 200 × g to pellet nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet the mitochondria. Protein Phosphatase Assay—Protein phosphatase activity of isolated mitochondria and nuclei were determined as described previously (12Ruvolo P.P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Generation of free phosphate from the phosphopeptide RRA(pT)VA was measured using the molybdate-malachite green-phosphate complex assay as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The phosphatase assay was performed in a PP2A-specific reaction buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.02! 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) using 100 μm phosphopeptide substrate and 2 μg of protein mitochondria or nuclei isolated as described above. After a 30-min room temperature incubation, molybdate dye was added, and free phosphate was measured by optical density at 590 nm. A standard curve with free phosphate was used to determine the amount of free phosphate generated. Phosphatase activity was defined as pmol of free phosphate generated/μg of protein/min. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using standard t test analysis with SigmaStat computer software (SSPS, Chicago, IL). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of three separate replicate experiments. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. PKR Is Basally Active in a Number of ALL Cell Lines Including REH—PKR is thought to be normally dormant in cells and is expected to be activated only in response to viral infection or stress challenges (22Garcia M.A. Gil J. Ventoso I. Guerra S. Domingo E. Rivas C. Esteban M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 1032-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Thus activation of PKR under survival conditions is generally not expected. PKR expression and activation status was determined in four ALL cell lines: REH, CCRF-CEM, MOLT4, and RS(4;11). As shown in Fig. 1, PKR was expressed and phosphorylated in all four cell lines. The PKR antibody does not detect the presumed phosphorylated (i.e. slower migrating) form of the kinase (Fig. 1). This would suggest that the level of phosphorylated kinase is below the level of detection of the PKR antibody and thus that only a fraction of the PKR kinase is activated in the ALL cell lines. Nevertheless, a constitutively active nonphosphorylated PKR has yet to be reported (28Cole J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 57-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and the presence of any active PKR in the ALL cell lines suggests that the kinase may be important for cellular homeostasis in these cells. The best characterized substrate of PKR is eIF2α (20Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 21Williams B.R. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : RE2Google Scholar, 22Garcia M.A. Gil J. Ventoso I. Guerra S. Domingo E. Rivas C. Esteban M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 1032-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 23García M.A. Meurs E.F. Esteban M. Biochimie (Paris). 2007; 89: 799-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α was examined to determine whether PKR phosphorylation levels correlated with phosphorylation of the primary substrate of the kinase. Consistent with the presence of active PKR, phosphorylated eIF2α was detected in all of the cell lines except RS(4;11) (Fig. 1). The lack of observed phosphorylated eIF2α in the RS(4;11) cells, however, likely reflects the low abundance of the eIF2α protein. As shown in Fig. 1, there is little eIF2α protein present in the RS(4;11) cells compared with the other ALL cell lines. B56α Expression Correlates with Mitochondrial PP2A Activity in ALL Cell Lines—Mitochondrial and nuclear PP2A activity was assessed in the four ALL cell lines using a molybdate dye assay that we routinely use to measure PP2A activity (12Ruvolo P.P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, REH, CCRF-CEM, and MOLT4 cells exhibited higher mitochondrial PP2A activity (87, 81, and 105 pmol/μg/min, respectively) compared with nuclear PP2A activity in these cells (26, 41, and 43 pmol/μg/min, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2, the RS(4;11) cells exhibited low mitochondrial PP2A activity (26 pmol/μg/min) compared with nuclear PP2A activity in this cell line (46 pmol/μg/min). Although there was no difference by standard t test in the nuclear PP2A activity among the ALL cell lines, there was a significant difference in the mitochondrial PP2A activity in the RS(4:11) cells compared with the other three ALL cell lines (p < 0.001). The lack of mitochondrial PP2A activity in RS(4;11) cells may be because of a lack of B56α in these cells. RS(4;11) cells displayed little if any B56α protein, whereas the other three ALL cell lines expressed the B subunit (Fig. 1). These findings suggest that B56α may be a positive regulator of mitochondrial PP2A activity in ALL cells. Suppression of PKR in REH Cells by shRNA Promotes BCL2 Phosphorylation, Inhibits Mitochondrial PP2A Activity, and Promotes Chemoresistance—To determine whether PKR supports BCL2 phosphatase, PKR gene expression was suppressed in REH cells using shRNA. A shRNA plasmid targeting PKR (designated TI379192) is commercially available from OriGene. A negative control shRNA plasmid that targets GFP (designated TR30003) is also available from OriGene. The shRNA plasmids were introduced into REH cells by retroviral transduction. As shown in Fig. 3A, shRNA targeting PKR resulted in significant loss of PKR protein when expression was compared with the cells transduced with the negative control. Consistent with a loss of PKR kinase activity, REH cells expressing shRNA against PKR displayed reduced phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 3A), although they did not show any effects on cell viability, cell proliferation, or cell cycle profile (data not shown). Loss of PKR had no effect on overall BCL2 protein expression (Fig. 3A), but an effect on the phosphorylation status of the anti-apoptotic protein was unknown. To determine the effect of loss of PKR on BCL2 phosphorylation, a metabolic radiolabeling experiment was performed. REH cells transduced with control shRNA plasmid or with PKR shRNA were radiolabeled with 32P, and BCL2 protein was immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal antisera (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated protein was electrophoresed and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and phosphorylated bands on the filter were detected by autoradiography. Western analysis using a mouse monoclonal antibody against BCL2 (from Dako) was used to determine that the band corresponding to 32P-labeled protein was indeed BCL2. As shown in Fig. 3B, loss of PKR potently promoted BCL2 phosphorylation in the REH cells. Such a consequence would be expected if PKR supports B56α-mediated PP2A activity targeting BCL2. As shown in Fig. 3A, B56α expression is suppressed in REH cells transfected with PKR shRNA. The loss of BCL2 phosphatase function in REH cells with PKR shRNA may reflect loss of this vital component of the BCL2 phosphatase. As noted earlier, PP2A is an obligate heterotrimer, and there is a stoichiometric competition between B subunits for available PP2A catalytic core (i.e. A and C subunit) complexes. Loss of B56α might promote expression of other B subunits to replace B56α as a partner for available catalytic core complexes. To determine whether such a phenomenon occurred in the PKR shRNA REH cells, we examined compared expression of B55, a ubiquitously expressed B subunit, in the PKR shRNA REH cells with REH cells transfected with control shRNA. As shown in Fig. 3C, B55 expression levels were increased in REH cells with PKR shRNA. Densitometric analysis of the B55 and GAPDH bands (see Fig. 3C) using Image J software revealed that B55 (relative to GAPDH expression) was increased 2.9-fold in REH cells with PKR shRNA compared with REH cells with control shRNA. Interestingly, REH cells with PKR shRNA displayed reduced expression of the A scaffold subunit of PP2A (i.e. PP2A/A) compared with cells with control shRNA. Densitometric analysis of the PP2A/A and GAPDH bands (see Fig. 3C) revealed that PP2A/A (relative to GAPDH expression) was less than half (i.e. 43!) in REH cells with PKR shRNA compared with REH cells with control shRNA. These findings suggest that there is a stoichiometric change in expression of the scaffold A subun"

https://openalex.org/W2103662303,"We show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal protein Rpl42ab (the identical product of the RPL42A and RPL42B genes) is monomethylated at Lys-40 and Lys-55. The methylation of Lys-40 is dependent upon the Ybr030w gene product; the methylation of Lys-55 is dependent upon the Set7 gene product. Ybr030w and SET7 genes both encode SET domain containing proteins homologous to known protein lysine methyltransferases, suggesting that their products are the specific enzymes responsible for the monomethylation of the two sites in Rpl42ab. We thus designate Ybr030w as Rkm3 and Set7 as Rkm4. Yeast strains with deletions in both the Ybr030w and SET7 genes produce unmethylated Rpl42ab. A slow growth phenotype was seen for the SET7 deletion strain and the double knock-out when grown in low concentrations of the eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. These results suggest that modification of Rpl42ab at Lys-55 can fine-tune its structure to avoid inhibition. An intact mass fragmentation approach (“top down mass spectrometry”) was used to quantitate the extent of methylation of Rpl42ab. In wild-type strains, it was found that 78! was monomethylated at both Lys-40 and Lys-55 and that 22! was a mixture of species with either Lys-40 or Lys-55 monomethylated. The top down approach was also used to reevaluate the methylation sites of Rpl12ab. We found that the yeast Rpl12ab protein is dimethylated at the N-terminal proline residue, trimethylated at Lys-3 by Rkm2, and monomethylated at Arg-66.

We found that the yeast Rpl12ab protein is dimethylated at the N-terminal proline residue, trimethylated at Lys-3 by Rkm2, and monomethylated at Arg-66. The emergence of histone protein lysine methyltransferases that regulate the epigenetic state of chromatin highlights the biological importance of this modification (1Couture J.F. Trievel R.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Xiao B. Wilson J.R. Gamblin S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Protein lysine methylation has also been found to occur in over a hundred proteins ranging from flagellin in Salmonella typhimurium to RUBISCO in plants to transcription initiation factor TAFT10 in Homo sapiens (3Dirk L. M.A. Trievel R.C. Houtz L.R. The Enzymes,3rd Ed. 2006; 24: 179-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Physiological functions of lysine methylation of non-histone proteins remain unclear, and the enzymes responsible for the modifications have only recently begun to be characterized. With the exceptions of the yeast DOT1 and the bacterial PrmA enzymes, known protein lysine methyltransferases all belong to the family of SET domain-containing proteins (4Marmostein R.

These enzymes are capable of adding up to three methyl groups to the side chain amino group of lysine residues to form mono-, di-, and trimethylated derivatives. Interestingly, this modification can be reversed by members of a large family of demethylases (7Culhane J.C. Cole P.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have been interested in identifying protein lysine methyltransferases that are involved in the formation of methylation marks on ribosomal proteins. Multiple proteins in both the small and large ribosomal subunits have been shown to be modified at lysine residues in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (8Polevoda B. Sherman F. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 590-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our work has focused on the ribosomal large subunit of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Evidence has been presented that six proteins are methylated, Rpl1ab, Rpl3, Rpl12ab, Rpl23ab, Rpl42ab, and Rpl43ab (9Lee S.W. Berger S.J. Martinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently determined the sites and the SET methyltransferases responsible for the methylation of Rpl23ab and Rpl12ab (10Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Miranda T.B. Clarke S. J.

We identified the SET domain protein Rkm1 as the enzyme responsible for the dimethylation of Lys-105 and Lys-109 in Rpl23ab (10Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Miranda T.B. Clarke S. J. Biol.

Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35835-35845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has shown that the S. cerevisiae genome encodes twelve SET domain proteins that can be separated into two subfamilies each containing six members (11Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35835-35845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The known Set1 and Set2 histone lysine methyltransferases are members of one family, and Rkm1, Rkm2, and the enzyme responsible for cytochrome c methylation are members of the second family. However, the methyltransferase function of seven of these proteins remains to be identified. In this work we focused on the modification of the large ribosomal protein encoded by the RPL42A and the RPL42B genes of S. cerevisiae. The protein produced from each of these genes is identical in sequence and we designate it Rpl42ab (9Lee S.W. Berger S.J. Martinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This protein is conserved in nature and corresponds to the product of the human RPL36A gene (13Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Ballesta J.-P.G. Lee J.C. Mizuta K. Suzuki K. Warner J.R. Woolford J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4872-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This protein is located in the ribosomal tRNA exit site with contacts to both the large subunit rRNA and the tRNA (14Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. RNA. 2003; 9: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This species has also been associated with cycloheximide sensitivity (15Kawai S. Murao S. Mochizuka M. Shibuya I. Yano K. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that Rpl42ab is monomethylated at two lysine residues (16Itoh T. Wittmann-Liebold B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the enzyme or enzymes responsible for the modification remains unidentified. Using a combination of reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, we analyzed Rpl42ab from yeast deletion mutants lacking SET domain proteins. Using a top down mass spectrometric approach, we quantitated modification of Rpl42ab and found that Ybr030w is required for the methylation of Lys-40 and that Set7 is required for the methylation of Lys-55. Finally, we found that monomethylation of Lys-55 imparted resistance to cycloheximide. Purification of Yeast Ribosomal Large Subunit Proteins from Wild Type and Mutant Strains—Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The ΔYbr030w ΔSET7 double knock-out strain was created by crossing the MATα strain of ΔSET7 with the MATa strain of ΔYbr030w and selecting for cells on lysine- and methionine-deficient plates. The resulting diploid strain was induced to sporulate and screening on kanamycin plates for the non-parental ditype identified haploid spores containing both gene deletions. The deletion of both the Ybr030w and SET7 genes was confirmed by PCR analysis using flanking TAG1 and TAG2 primers.TABLE 1Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains usedStrainGenotypeSourceBY4742MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0SGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL)ΔYbr030w (BY4742)BY4742, Δ Ybr030w::KanrSGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL)ΔSET7 (BY4742)BY4742, Δ SET7::KanrSGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL)BY4741MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0SGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL)ΔYbr030w (BY4741)BY4741, Δ Ybr030w::KanrSGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL)ΔSET7 (BY4741)BY4741, Δ SET7::KanrSGDPaStrains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL)ΔYbr030w ΔSET7MATα ΔYbr030w::Kanr Δ SET7::Kanr LYS+ MET+This studya Strains prepared by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) Open table in a new tab Large ribosomal subunits were isolated from wild-type, ΔYbr030w, ΔSET7, and the double knock-out ΔYbr030w ΔSET7 strains as described previously (11Porras-Yakushi T.R.

The resulting purified large ribosomal subunits were concentrated to a volume of ∼100 μl by vacuum centrifugation and promptly subjected to analysis. Liquid Chromatography with Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry of Intact Ribosomal Proteins (LC-MS+) 3The abbreviations used are:LC-MS+liquid chromatography with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry and fraction collectionFTICRFourier-transform ion cyclotron resonanceMSMStandem mass spectrometry —Ribosomal proteins were fractionated using reverse-phase liquid chromatography. The resulting effluent was split between a fraction collector, collecting 1-min fractions, and an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer as described previously (11Porras-Yakushi T.R.

Biol. 2004; 251: 323-340PubMed Google Scholar). For HPLC fractionation a PLRP-S polymeric column was used that had a pore size of 300 Å, bead size of 5 μm, and a dimensions of 150 × 1 mm (Polymer Laboratories, Amherst, MA). The column was maintained at 50 °C and initially equilibrated in solvent A (0.05! trifluoroacetic acid in water) at 95! and solvent B (0.05! trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at 5!. The ribosomal proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 60 μl/min using a program of 5 min at 5! B, followed by a 25-min gradient from 5 to 30! B and ending with a 100-min gradient from 30 to 100! B, for a total gradient time of 130 min. The API III+ mass spectrometer (PE Sciex) used was tuned and calibrated as described previously (18Whitelegge J.P. Gundersen C.B. Faull K.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) to yield a mass accuracy of 0.01! (±1.0 Da at 10 kDa). The 30-μl fractions collected during chromatography were stored at -20 °C. The data obtained was analyzed using the BioMultiview 1.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems). liquid chromatography with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry and fraction collection Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometry Identification of Methylation Sites by Top Down Mass Spectrometry Using Collisionally Activated Dissociation and Electron Capture Dissociation of Intact Proteins—Fractions containing isolated ribosomal protein from LC-MS+ were diluted with 30 μl water/acetonitrile/formic acid (500/500/1, v/v/v) and analyzed by direct nanospray injection. LC fractions were individually loaded into a 2-μm internal diameter externally coated nanospray emitter (New Objective Inc., Woburn, MA) and desorbed using a spray voltage between 1.2 kV and 1.4 kV versus the inlet of the mass spectrometer. These conditions produced a flow rate of 20–50 nl/min. A hybrid linear ion-trap/FTICR mass spectrometer was used for the analysis (LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). The m/z resolving power of the FTICR mass analyzer was set at 100,000 (defined by m/Δm50! at m/z 400). Individual charge states of multiply protonated molecular ions were selected for isolation and collisional activation in the linear ion trap followed by detection of the resulting fragments in the FTICR cell. For the collisionally activated dissociation studies, the precursor ions were activated using 35! normalized collision energy at the default activation q-value of 0.25. Additional studies were conducted in which the precursor ions were guided to the FTICR cell and fragmented using electron capture dissociation. The fragmentation efficiency was optimized to maximize fragment ion signal. All FTICR MSMS spectra were processed using ProSightPC software (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) in single protein mode with a 10 ppm mass accuracy threshold. The root mean square deviations for assigned fragments were less than 5 ppm. Corresponding ribosomal protein sequences were taken from Swiss-Prot and used as the reference sequences in ProSightPC. Intact mass measurements were processed using the manual Xtract program, version 1.516 (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA). All top down experimental data obtained for this study are available online at proteome commons. Quantitation of Protein Species from FTICR Mass Spectrometry—In spectra where multiple species of the same protein differing in mass are present, the PIRR method of Pasavento et al. (19Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Pesavento J.J. Bullock C.R. LeDuc R.D. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14927-14937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was used to measure the relative amounts of protein species present. We integrated the intensity of the four most abundant isotope peaks (13C5, 13C6, 13C7, 13C8) for the 14+ and 15+ charge states of the wild-type Rpl42ab protein. The values were combined into a weighted average and the percent abundances of each species were calculated. This was repeated for the Rpl42ab protein in the ΔSET7 strain with the exception of only the 15+ charge state used in the calculation due to it being the only charge state with a signal to noise value >10, thus allowing for accurate quantitation (19Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Growth of Yeast Strains in Cycloheximide—Single colonies were seeded into 5 ml of YPD broth (Difco, 1! yeast extract, 2! peptone, and 2! dextrose) and incubated 18 h at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm/min). Appropriate volumes were taken to inoculate 49 ml of YPD in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.05. Cells were grown at 30 °C with shaking as above. When an optical density of 0.1 was reached, 50 μl of a stock solution of cycloheximide in water (1 mg/ml) was added to give a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and growth was monitored by optical density over the next 40 h. Identification of Two Rpl42ab Lysine Methyltransferases—Ribosomes from wild-type and SET domain knock-out yeast strains were isolated by differential centrifugation, and subunits were separated using high salt sucrose gradients (11Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35835-35845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting large subunit proteins were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC and their intact masses determined by electrospray mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We focused on the large ribosomal protein Rpl42ab since evidence has been presented for monomethyllysine formation at two sites (16Itoh T. Wittmann-Liebold B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of two methyl groups on Rpl42ab was supported by the mass spectrometric determination of the intact protein. It was 28 Da larger than expected from the encoded open reading frame (9Lee S.W. Berger S.J. Martinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because the loss of a SET domain protein lysine methyltransferase in a given knock-out strain would be expected to result in the loss of one or more methyl groups on a ribosomal protein, we examined the mass of Rpl42ab for differences in wild-type and mutant strains. The accuracy of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer used (100 ppm) permitted us to detect differences as low as a few Da in mass. This approach led to the identification of two SET domain-containing proteins, Set7 and Ybr030w, that are required for Rpl42ab modification. In the wild-type BY4742 strain, an intact average mass of 12,108 Da was seen for a species eluting at 27 min on reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1). This mass corresponds to the mass of the gene product of Rpl42ab with the loss of the initiator methionine and the presence of two methyl groups (9Lee S.W. Berger S.J. Martinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Itoh T. Wittmann-Liebold B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This wild-type 12,108 species was also observed when the analysis was repeated for ribosomal proteins from a number of SET domain mutant strains, including RKM2, SET2, SET3, SET4, SET5, SET6, and Yhl039w. However, no species with the mass 12,108 Da was detected in the Rpl42ab fraction from the SET7 and Ybr030w mutant strains. Here, we detected a new species in each strain at 12,094 Da, or 14 Da lower than that of the wild-type species (Fig. 1). Similar results were found for the SET7 and Ybr030w mutants in the independent BY4741 strain background (Table 1 and data not shown). The loss of 14 Da corresponds to the loss of a single methyl group in the protein; the loss in both mutant strains suggests that the SET7 and Ybr030w genes each encode a methyltransferase that modifies a distinct site on Rpl42ab. To confirm this hypothesis, we constructed a double knock-out strain with deletions in both the SET7 and Ybr030w genes. Ribosomal proteins from this strain were subjected to the same analysis. Here, we found the Rpl42ab fraction contained a species of 12,081 Da (Fig. 1). This mass is within the instrument error of the calculated mass of unmodified Rpl42ab at 12,080 Da. This loss of 28 Da from the wild type protein along with the previous data showing the presence of two monomethylated lysine residues (9Lee S.W. Berger S.J. Martinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Itoh T. Wittmann-Liebold B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) provides additional evidence for Set7 and Ybr030w as lysine methyltransferases, each adding one methyl group to Rpl42ab. The modification of Rpl42ab in wild-type cells may not be complete because we do find a small peak corresponding to the singly methylated species of mass 12,094 Da (Fig. 1). Determination and Quantitation of the Methylation Sites of Rpl42ab by Top Down MSMS—To identify the sites of methylation in Rpl42ab, we first performed intact mass top down analysis. Rpl42ab fractions isolated from the LC-MS+ method were analyzed on a hybrid linear ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher LTQ FT Ultra) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This instrument resolves the 13C isotopomers allowing for the accurate determination of the monoisotopic masses of the all-12C species. The deconvoluted spectrum of wild type Rpl42 shows two molecular ions differing by the mass of one methyl group. The most abundant monoisotoopic signal was at 12,100.71 Da corresponding to the doubly methylated protein (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). A second minor signal was seen at 12086.70 Da corresponding to a singly methylated form. We confirmed that the Rpl42ab protein from the deletion strains ΔYbr030w and ΔSET7 contains the monomethylated form at 12,086.73 Da and 12,086.75 Da, respectively, as expected. The ΔYbr030w strain has no detectable amount of unmodified Rpl42ab; however, the ΔSET7 strain shows the presence of a small amount of the unmodified species (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). Rpl42ab from the ΔYbr030w ΔSET7 double mutant displays only the unmodified species (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). These observations confirm the average mass results obtained with triple-quadrupole instrument described above and shown in Fig. 1.TABLE 2Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance of intact Rpl42abRpl42ab purified from strainObserved monoisotopic massCalculated monoisotopic massErrorModifications observed!

However, we found a bias for the most abundant ions when the signal to noise level was less than 10. We then followed the approach used by Pesavento et al. (19Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Pesavento J.J. Bullock C.R. LeDuc R.D. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14927-14937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) to quantitate human histone H4 variants to determine the relative amounts of the fully and partially methylated Rpl42ab species in yeast cells. We applied the protein ion relative ratio calculation described in “Experimental Procedures” to determine that 78! of Rpl42ab is dimethylated in wild-type cells and 22! is monomethylated. For the ΔSET7 strain the unmodified version accounted for 12! and the monomethylated accounted for 88! of the total Rpl42ab present. It is worthwhile to note that the FTICR instrumentation used in this study is a commercially available hybrid linear ion-trap/FTICR while Pesavento et al. (19Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Pesavento J.J. Bullock C.R. LeDuc R.D. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14927-14937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) used a custom quadrupole-FTICR hybrid. Single charge states of intact species were then individually isolated and fragmented to localize the sites of methylation on the Rpl42ab protein. Two fragmentation methods were used, collisionally activated dissociation producing b and y ions, and electron capture fragmentation producing c and z ions. Multiple MSMS spectra representing different charge states were collected of Rpl42ab for each yeast strain, mating type, and methylation state. These data were combined to create the fragmentation map shown in Fig. 2. The MSMS data for the wild-type fully methylated Rpl42ab confirms the sites of monomethylation to Lys-40 and Lys-55. Chemical sequence analysis of Rpl42ab (16Itoh T. Wittmann-Liebold B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) had previously identified a monomethyllysine residue in a Gly-Arg-Lys-Arg sequence; it now appears that this sequence should be Gly-Lys-Arg-Arg corresponding to the genomic and mass spectral determined sequence of residues 39–42 (Fig. 2). These results, however, confirm the previous identification of the Gln-Thr-Lys-Pro sequence as a possible second site of lysine monomethylation at residues 53–56 (16Itoh T. Wittmann-Liebold B. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we find that the less abundant monomethylated form of Rpl42ab from the wild-type strain is a mixture of two modification states. One form contains a single methyl group at Lys-40 and the other contains a single methyl group at Lys-55 (Fig. 2). We estimated the amount of each monomethylated species by the signal intensity of the informative c43 fragment ions (residues 1–43; supplemental Fig. S2). We found that the singly methylated wild-type form at Lys-40 is present in three times the amount as the form methylated at Lys-55. The unmodified c43 ion intensity was weak, with a signal to noise below 10 rendering accurate quantitation difficult (19Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Rpl42ab isolated from the ΔYbr030w strain lacks methylation at Lys-40, indicating the gene product of Ybr030w is required for monomethylation of this site (Fig. 2). The ΔSET7 mutant has a loss of methylation at Lys-55, demonstrating the protein encoded by the SET7 gene is required for monomethylation of Lys-55 (Fig. 2). In agreement with the intact mass data, the ΔYbr030w ΔSET7 strain is unmodified at both Lys-40 and Lys-55 (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Growth Defect of SET7-deficient Yeast in the Presence of Cycloheximide—Mutation of the Rpl42ab Pro-56 residue to a glutamine residue confers resistance to cycloheximide, an inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces griseus (15Kawai S. Murao S. Mochizuka M. Shibuya I. Yano K. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 254-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The close proximity Lys-55 and Pro-56 in Rpl42ab raises the question of whether methylation may affect the sensitivity of yeast to cycloheximide. We thus monitored the growth of yeast strains containing or lacking the genes for Rpl42ab methylation in the presence of a low concentration of cycloheximide (Fig. 3). SET7 mutants in two strain backgrounds (Table 1) demonstrated decreased resistance to cycloheximide, while the Ybr030w mutants grew similarly to the wild-type strains. The double mutant also displayed sensitivity to cycloheximide. Control experiments performed in the absence of cycloheximide displayed no growth differences under these conditions (data not shown). Thus, methylation of Lys-55 by SET7 may have evolved to provide a protective effect against cycloheximide in the environment; a similar protection may be obtained in organisms such as Candida maltosa that naturally contain a glutamine residue at position 56. Utilization of Top Down Mass Spectrometry to Determine the Sites of Methylation of Rpl12ab—Previously we reported the SET domain-containing protein Rkm2 trimethylated the ribosomal protein Rpl12ab at lysine 10 and an unknown enzyme dimethylated the protein at lysine 3 (11Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35835-35845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since that time, the methylation sites for two orthologs of Rpl12ab have been reported for Arabidopsis thaliana and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In Arabidopsis, evidence was presented for the dimethylation of the N-terminal proline residue and the trimethylation of lysine 3 (21Carroll A.J. Heazlewood J.L. Ito J. Millar A.H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 347-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); a similar modification pattern was seen in S. pombe (22Sadaie M. Shinmyozu K. Nakayama J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7185-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sadaie et al. (22Sadaie M. Shinmyozu K. Nakayama J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7185-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also identified the methyltransferase responsible for the trimethylation of lysine 3, SET11 in S. pombe. In light of sequence identity of the Rpl12ab protein from all of these species at the N terminus, we isolated wild-type S. cerevisiae Rpl12ab protein and subjected it to intact mass top down MSMS analysis as described above for Rpl42ab (Fig. 4). Unlike Rpl42ab, we found a single modified species for Rpl12ab containing six methyl groups. MSMS fragmentation revealed two methyl groups on Pro-1, three on Lys-3, and one on Arg-66. Close evaluation of previously published data on the MSMS of an N-terminal ArgC fragment of Rpl12ab from a ΔRKM2 deletion strain shows the loss of three methyl groups at the third lysine and the presence of the N-terminal dimethyl proline (Fig. 4). These results suggest that Rkm2 modifies Rpl12a largely at Lys-3, although modification at Lys-10 cannot be ruled out, especially when considering the b3, b8, b9, b10, and y9 ions in the original mass spectrum (11Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35835-35845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fragmentation evidence for the presence of methylation at Lys-10 was not seen in the intact mass top down analysis, possibly due to the low abundance of this form of modification. In any case, it now appears that the major modifications of Rpl12 at the N terminus are similar in S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and Arabidopsis. Structural Significance of Lysine Methylation in the Yeast Large Ribosomal Subunit—Cryo-EM structures are available for the free yeast 80S ribosome at a resolution of ∼15 Å (23Spahn C. M.T. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J. Cell. 2001; 107: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and for the 80S subunit bound to eEF2 at a resolution of 11.7 Å (24Spahn C. M.T. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G.

In both structures, the 25S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNA, and the 43 yeast ribosomal proteins were computationally docked onto the cryo-EM structure using the previously solved crystal structures of the 30S subunit of T. thermophilus and the 50S subunit of H. marismortui as a guide (25Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar, 26Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). Both structures show Rpl42ab positioned close to the tRNA exit site. The docked structure showed the positions of the monomethylated lysine residues in close proximity to rRNA. The ϵ-N of Lys-40 is within 3.6 Å and 3.9 Å of the 25S rRNA and ϵ-N of Lys-55 overlaps the 25S rRNA. This region of overlap appears to be an error in the docking and shows the limitations of the composite structures. To overcome this limitation, the position of the corresponding sites of yeast Rpl42ab Lys-40 and Lys-55 in the homologous L44E protein of the 60S H. marismortui ribosomal subunit was determined from its x-ray crystal structure in complex with a deacylated tRNA minihelix (14Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. RNA. 2003; 9: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this structure, L44E localizes to the tRNA exit site and has direct contacts to the bound tRNA minihelix (14Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. RNA. 2003; 9: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The aspartate at position 37 (corresponding to monomethyl Lys-40 of Rpl42ab) is within 6.5 Å of the tRNA minihelix, presenting the possibility that methyl lysine plays a role in binding tRNA in yeast (Fig. 5, panel A). The ϵ-N of Lys-51 (corresponding to the monomethyl Lys-55 residue of Rpl42ab) is 2.9 Å and 3.7 Å from the 23S rRNA and is within 4.5 Å of the bound tRNA minihelix (Fig. 5, panel A). These structural data suggest that the monomethyl lysine residues in Rpl42ab may contact rRNA and tRNA, and may not be exposed at the surface of the ribosome. If this is the case, the methyl marks in Rpl42ab may not be “read” by protein species including the tudor, MBT, and chromo domains that specifically recognize methylated lysine residues in histone tails (27Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We suggest instead that lysine methylation in Rpl42ab may modulate hydrogen bonding interactions to RNA. To determine whether the possible interaction of ribosomal protein methylated lysine residues with rRNA is a general phenomenon, we examined the location of the dimethylated lysine residues of yeast Rpl23ab at Lys-106 and Lys-110 (11Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35835-35845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The position of the dimethylated lysine residues in the yeast composite cryo-EM structure of the 80S eEF2 complex show the closest contact of the ϵ-N of dimethyl Lys-106 to be 7.6 Å and 8.1 Å from the 25S rRNA, and the ϵ-N of dimethyl Lys-110 closest contact to be 8.6 Å to the 25S rRNA. In the 60S H. marismortui crystal structure, Rpl23ab is homologous to the L14 protein with dimethyl Lys-106 corresponding to Asn-101. The closest contact of this asparagine is the 23S rRNA at 9.7 Å. Rpl23ab dimethyl Lys-110 aligns with Arg-105 and is 13.8 Å from its closest contact with the 23S rRNA. Thus, it appears that the methylated lysine residues in Rpl23ab do not contact the 23S rRNA. The Rpl23ab protein is on the binding face of the large ribosomal subunit and is involved in multiple contacts with the 18S small ribosomal rRNA (24Spahn C. M.T. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J. P.G. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This localization opens the possibilities that the methylated lysine residues may interact with the 18S rRNA on the small subunit. Finally, we were not able to position the methylated Lys-3 residue in Rpl12ab to these structures because the N terminus is disordered (23Spahn C. M.T. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J. Cell. 2001; 107: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 24Spahn C. M.T. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J. P.G. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that methylated lysine residues in ribosomal proteins may play structural roles distinct from the recognition marking roles seen in histones (27Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).

In contrast, using several independent types of experiments, we find that mammalian proteasomes can degrade polyubiquitylated proteins without disassembling. Thus, immobilized, 35S-labeled 26S proteasomes degraded polyubiquitylated Sic1 and c-IAP1 without releasing any subunits. In addition, it is predicted that if 26S proteasomes dissociate into 20S proteasomes and regulatory complexes during a degradation cycle, the reassembly rate would be limiting at low proteasome concentrations. However, the rate with which each proteasome degraded polyubiquitylated Sic1 was independent of the proteasome concentration. Likewise, substrate-dependent dissociation of 26S proteasomes could not be detected by nondenaturing electrophoresis. Lastly, epoxomicin-inhibited 20S proteasomes can trap released regulatory complexes, forming inactive 26S proteasomes, but addition of epoxomicin-inhibited 20S proteasomes had no effect on the degradation of either polyubiquitylated Sic1 or UbcH10 by 26S proteasomes or of endogenous substrates in cell extracts.

Intracellular protein degradation is involved in many fundamental processes in eukaryotic cells (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway: destruction for the sake of construction.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar, Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The degradation is carried out by 26S proteasomes. These are complicated molecular machines, which consist of a cylindrical 20S proteasome with regulatory ATPase complexes (RCs) attached to one or both ends. The proteolytically active sites are exposed to the interior of the 20S proteasome cylinder (Löwe et al., 1995Löwe J. Stock D. Jap R. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Crystal structure of the 20S proteasome from the Archaeon T. acidophilum at 3.4 angstrom resolution.Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, Groll et al., 1997Groll M.

Structure of 20S proteasome from yeast at 2.4 angstrom resolution.Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). In order to reach the active sites, native, folded substrate proteins therefore have to be unfolded by the RCs and be threaded into the cylinder. In the absence of ATP, the RCs dissociate from 20S core proteasomes (Eytan et al., 1989Eytan E. Ganoth D. Armon T. Hershko A.

The RC is quite stable and was originally purified and described as an activator of 20S proteasomes (Hoffman et al., 1992Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Multiple forms of the 20-S multicatalytic and the 26-S ubiquitin/ATP-dependent proteases from rabbit reticulocyte lysate.J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, the RC can be split into two subcomplexes, the lid and the base, by treatment with salt (Glickman et al., 1998Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W.

The base contains three subunits without known enzyme activity as well as six different ATPases of the AAA family, which are thought to form a ring that makes contact to the ends of the 20S proteasome cylinder (Hartmann-Petersen et al., 2001Hartmann-Petersen R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26815-26820Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and are therefore believed to assist in unfolding of substrate proteins. The lid consists of at least nine different subunits. It has ubiquitin hydrolase activity and is involved in release of ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-coupled substrates (Guterman and Glickman, 2004Guterman A. Glickman M.H.

Three subunits of the RC, Rpt5, Rpn13, and S5a/Rpn10, bind polyubiquitin and are therefore involved in substrate binding (Deveraux et al., 1994Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M.

Curiously, S5a/Rpn10 and Rpn13 are dispensable for cell viability (Kominami et al., 1997Kominami K. Okura N. Kawamura M. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Shimbara N. Chung C.H. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Subunit S5a/Rpn10 forms contacts to both the lid and the base (Glickman et al., 1998Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D.

In yeast, Rpn10 is found both proteasome bound and in the free state (van Nocker et al., 1996van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H.Y. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. The multiubiquitin-chain-binding protein Mcb1 is a component of the 265 proteasome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and plays a nonessential, substrate-specific role in protein turnover.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested to shuttle between proteasomes and a pool of free S5a/Rpn10, perhaps bringing substrates to the proteasome. However, no pool of free S5a/Rpn10 is found in mammalian cells (Hendil et al., 2002Hendil K.B. Hartmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. 26S proteasomes function as stable entities.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ATP has at least two roles in 26S proteasome function. For one, it is necessary to stabilize the binding of 20S proteasomes to the RCs. This binding causes opening of the pore into the 20S proteasomes (Rubin et al., 1998Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H.

ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis play distinct roles in the function of 26S proteasome.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In order to become 26S proteasome substrates, most proteins are polyubiquitylated, i.e., they are coupled to a chain of ubiquitin moieties. Once the chain has a length of at least four ubiquitin moieties, it gains affinity for the 26S proteasome (Thrower et al., 2000Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Recognition of the polyubiquitin proteolytic signal.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). The protein must also have an unstructured stretch of polypeptide chain, which may act as an initiation site for degradation (Lee et al., 2001Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. ATP-dependent proteases degrade their substrates by processively unraveling them from the degradation signal.Mol.

Proteasome substrate degradation requires association plus extended peptide.EMBO J. 2006; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is not known exactly how ubiquitylated substrate proteins are engaged by the proteasome or how they become threaded into the proteasome core particle. The frailty of the 26S proteasomes has led to speculations on whether 26S proteasomes undergo obligatory dissociation–reassociation reaction cycles like the GroEL/GroES chaperone or ribosomes. In a former study, we (Hendil et al., 2002Hendil K.B. Hartmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. 26S proteasomes function as stable entities.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) used species-specific monoclonal antibodies to proteasome subunits to follow the exchange of RCs between murine and human 26S proteasomes in freshly prepared cell extracts, which continue to degrade endogenous substrates for some time. We estimated that the exchange rate was about a hundred times too slow to be an obligatory step in a substrate degradation cycle and concluded that dissociation of 26S proteasomes is not a mandatory step in a degradation cycle. In contrast, Babbitt and coworkers (Babbitt et al., 2005Babbitt S.E. Kiss A. Deffenbaugh A.E. Chang Y.H. Bailly E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Buranda T. Sklar L.A. Baumler J. et al.ATP hydrolysis-dependent disassembly of the 26S proteasome is part of the catalytic cycle.Cell. 2005; 121: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported a fast ATP-dependent release of subcomplexes from yeast proteasomes. They suggested that disassembly of the 26S proteasomes is part of the catalytic cycle. In our former study, we used crude cell extracts and relied on undefined, endogenous proteasome substrates, whereas Babbitt et al., 2005Babbitt S.E. Kiss A. Deffenbaugh A.E. Chang Y.H. Bailly E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Buranda T. Sklar L.A. Baumler J. et al.ATP hydrolysis-dependent disassembly of the 26S proteasome is part of the catalytic cycle.Cell. 2005; 121: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar worked with defined biochemical preparations. We have therefore readdressed the question of whether 26S proteasomes undergo an obligatory dissociation and reassembly during their reaction cycle. We use well-defined components, namely purified, mammalian 26S proteasomes and polyubiquitylated Sic1, c-IAP1, and UbcH10 proteins, as model substrates. Our results show that 26S proteasomes can degrade several molecules of substrate without any release of subunits or subcomplexes. In order to study substrate-dependent release of proteasome subunits, we prepared a known proteasome substrate, polyubiquitylated Sic1, henceforth referred to as UbnSic1 (Verma et al., 2000Verma R.

Briefly, Sic1 was expressed with a ubiquitylation motif, which is recognized by the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5. After purification, Sic1 was ubiquitylated in a reaction with ubiquitin, recombinant ubiquitin-activating enzyme, Uba1, the ubiquitin carrier protein, Ubc4, and a truncated version of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase (Saeki et al., 2005Saeki Y. Isono E. Toh-E A. Preparation of ubiquitinated substrates by the PY motif-insertion method for monitoring 26S proteasome activity.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation was highly processive since mainly high-molecular-weight ubiquitylated Sic1 was formed even at time points where free Sic1 was still present (Figure 1A). Soluble 26S proteasomes, 20S proteasomes, and RCs were purified from red blood cells, and the purity was assessed by both nondenaturing electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE (Figures 1B and 1C). In some experiments immobilized 26S proteasomes were obtained by precipitation from an extract of HeLa cells, expressing a protein A-tagged proteasome subunit β1 (Klare et al., 2007Klare N. Seeger M. Janek K. Jungblut P.R. Dahlmann B. Intermediate-type 20 S proteasomes in HeLa cells: “asymmetric” subunit composition, diversity and adaptation.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C, lane 4). 35S-UbnSic1 was incubated with purified 26S proteasomes and the degradation was followed as formation of TCA-soluble radioactivity. UbnSic1 was degraded much faster by 26S proteasomes than by 20S proteasomes and its degradation depended on ATP (Figure 1D). In this context ATP has two functions. It stabilizes the interaction between 20S proteasome core particles and RCs and promotes the degradation of folded protein substrates. The noncleavable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, stabilizes 26S proteasomes but cannot support degradation of folded substrates (Smith et al., 2005Smith D.M. Kafri G. Cheng Y. Ng D. Walz T. Goldberg A.L.

Since AMP-PNP also did not support degradation of UbnSic1 (Figure 1D), Sic1 probably needs to be actively unfolded in order to be degraded. 26S proteasomes have deubiquitylating activity resting with both intrinsic and loosely associated ubiquitin hydrolases (Stone et al., 2004Stone M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Seeger M. Bech-Otschir D. Wallace M. Gordon C. Uch2/Uch37 is the major deubiquitinating enzyme associated with the 26S proteasome in fission yeast.J. Mol.

Relative structural and functional roles of multiple deubiquitylating proteins associated with mammalian 26S proteasome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that no free Sic1 was formed when UbnSic1 was incubated with 26S proteasomes (results not shown). Deubiquitylation was therefore coupled to Sic1 degradation, as found in yeast (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates Jr., I.I.I. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Role of Rpn11 metalloprotease in deubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome.Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). For these several reasons, we believe that UbnSic1 behaves like a bona fide substrate for mammalian 26S proteasomes, as previously described for yeast (Verma et al., 2000Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Proteasomal proteomics: Identification of nucleotide-sensitive proteasome-interacting proteins by mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified proteasomes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Protein A-tagged 26S proteasomes were expressed in HeLa cells. The 26S proteasomes were precipitated with immunoglobulin-Sepharose from an extract of HeLa cells, which had been metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine. Putative release of labeled 26S proteasome subunits from the beads into the supernatant during degradation could then be followed by SDS-PAGE. In such experiments, addition of UbnSic1 did not cause any increase in release of proteasome subunits above the slow bleeding seen in the absence of substrate (Figure 2A). In parallel incubations, the degradation of 35S-UbnSic1 by unlabeled 26S proteasomes was followed by acid precipitation. The amount of 26S proteasomes on the beads was determined by SDS-PAGE and densitometry of Coomassie-stained gels. In this experiment, at least 300 moles of UbnSic1 were degraded to TCA-soluble peptides by each mole of 26S proteasome during an incubation of 1 hr. If 26S proteasomes disassemble as an obligatory step in substrate degradation, all 26S proteasomes should therefore have dissociated several times during the experiment. Since no free subunits or subcomplexes were detected, the results suggest that 26S proteasomes do not dissociate as part of their reaction cycle. The failure to detect released subunits might owe to fast reassembly of 26S proteasomes. In order to chase released, radioactive subunits from the immobilized proteasomes, we therefore added unlabeled 26S proteasomes, which had been purified from human red blood cells. These 26S proteasomes have no protein A tag and could therefore not bind to the immunoglobulin beads. Since both immobilized and soluble 26S proteasomes are exposed to substrate, they should exchange subunits unless they remain stable during degradation of UbnSic1. The putative release of subunits could still not be detected (Figure 2B). Conceivably, the 26S proteasomes might become stabilized by the high concentration of substrate used in these experiments. The experiments were therefore repeated but with varied substrate concentration. However, even with just 0.5 molecule of substrate per proteasome at the beginning of the incubation, no dissociation was seen (Figure 2C). The cells, used as a source of proteasomes, were usually lysed by Triton X-100. One could assume that this removes proteasome-associated proteins (Verma et al., 2000Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Proteasomal proteomics: Identification of nucleotide-sensitive proteasome-interacting proteins by mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified proteasomes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), which might be necessary for dissociation of 26S proteasomes. We probed for two of them, Hsp70 and hHR23B, which both remained attached to 26S proteasomes even in the presence of detergent (Figure S1 available online). Besides, the results in Figure 2B did not differ when the experiment was repeated with omission of detergent and with cells homogenized by sonication (results not shown). Rpn10 is found in the free state in yeast cells (van Nocker et al., 1996van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H.Y. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D.

We therefore also added UbnSic1 to labeled 26S proteasomes, which had been bound to beads with an immobilized antibody to S5a/Rpn10. A surplus of unlabeled recombinant S5a was added to some of the incubations as a chasing agent: if the bound S5a subunit dissociated from 26S proteasomes during degradation of UbnSic1, all other subunits of the 26S proteasome should become released from the beads. Reassembly would mainly be with the soluble S5a, ensuring that released, radioactive subcomplexes remained in solution. Nonetheless, no such release of 26S proteasome subunits was observed (Figure 2D). Rsp5, the E3 enzyme we used to produce UbnSic1, seems to generate ubiquitin chains coupled via isopeptide linkages to Lys63 of the preceding ubiquitin moiety (Kee et al., 2005Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M.

In an effort to identify these mechanisms we found that β-catenin blocks anoikis of malignant kidney and intestinal epithelial cells and promotes their anchorage-independent growth by down-regulating death-associated protein kinase-2 (DAPk-2), a pro-apoptotic protein whose cellular functions have so far remained unexplored. We found that β-catenin-induced down-regulation of DAPk-2 requires the presence of the transcription factor Tcf-4, a known mediator of β-catenin signaling. We also observed that DAPk-2 contributes to the execution of anoikis of the non-malignant epithelial cells. Thus, β-catenin-induced down-regulation of DAPk-2 represents a novel signaling mechanism by which β-catenin promotes the survival of malignant epithelial cells following their detachment from the ECM and enables these cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner.

Detachment from the ECM triggers apoptosis of these cells (1Rosen K. Shi W. Calabretta B. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 46123-46130Google Scholar, 2Liu Z. Li H. Wu X. Yoo B.H. Yan S.R.

Cell Biol.. 2001; 13: 555-562Google Scholar). By contrast, carcinomas, cancers of epithelial origin, represent three-dimensional disorganized multicellular masses in which cell-BM contacts are significantly altered. It is known in this regard that during tumor progression cancer cells often secrete BM-degrading enzymes, and this allows tumors to invade adjacent tissues (4Ljubimov A.V. Bartek J. Couchman J.R. Kapuller L.L. Veselov V.V. Kovarik J. Perevoshchikov A.G. Krutovskikh V.A. Int. J. Cancer.. 1992; 50: 562-566Google Scholar). Furthermore, at advanced stages of the disease clumps of cancer cells detach from the tumor and migrate to other organs where they give rise to metastases (5Douma S. Van Laar T. Zevenhoven J. Meuwissen R. Van Garderen E. Peeper D.S. Nature.. 2004; 430: 1034-1039Google Scholar, 6Berezovskaya O. Schimmer A.D. Glinskii A.B. Pinilla C. Hoffman R.M. Reed J.C. Glinsky G.V. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 2378-2386Google Scholar). Despite the fact that carcinoma cells tend to be deprived of normal contacts with the BM during tumor progression, a significant fraction of these cells remains viable (5Douma S. Van Laar T. Zevenhoven J. Meuwissen R. Van Garderen E. Peeper D.S. Nature.. 2004; 430: 1034-1039Google Scholar, 6Berezovskaya O. Schimmer A.D. Glinskii A.B. Pinilla C. Hoffman R.M. Reed J.C. Glinsky G.V. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 2378-2386Google Scholar). Numerous studies indicate that this viability is a critical prerequisite for carcinoma progression. First, cancer cells can typically survive and grow without adhesion to the ECM as colonies in soft agar, and this ability represents one of the most stringent criteria for malignant transformation that are presently used (7Freedman V.H. Shin S.I. Cell.. 1974; 3: 355-359Google Scholar, 8Lim K.H. Baines A.T. Fiordalisi J.J. Shipitsin M. Feig L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Counter C.M. Cancer Cell.. 2005; 7: 533-545Google Scholar). Second, we and others found that activation of major oncoproteins, such as Ras (9Liu Z. Li H. Derouet M. Filmus J. LaCasse E.C. Korneluk R.G. Kerbel R.S. Rosen K.V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 37383-37392Google Scholar, 10Liu Z. Li H. Derouet M. Berezkin A. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Rosen K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 14738-14747Google Scholar) or β-catenin (11Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 146: 855-868Google Scholar), can block anoikis of various types of cancer cells. Third, several studies, including ours, indicate that treatments reversing anoikis resistance of cancer cells suppress their ability to form primary tumors (12Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 149: 447-456Google Scholar, 13Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol.. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Google Scholar, 14Duxbury M.S. Ito H. Zinner M.J. Ashley S.W. Whang E.E. Oncogene.. 2004; 23: 1448-1456Google Scholar) and metastases (6Berezovskaya O. Schimmer A.D. Glinskii A.B. Pinilla C. Hoffman R.M. Reed J.C. Glinsky G.V.

Finally, we found that spontaneous acquisition of anoikis resistance by the non-malignant epithelial cells is sufficient for their in vivo tumorigenicity (15Derouet M. Wu X. May L. Hoon Y.B. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Rak J. Rosen K.V. Neoplasia.. 2007; 9: 536-545Google Scholar). Thus, anoikis resistance of tumor cells represents a potential therapeutic target. However, molecular mechanisms that are responsible for anoikis resistance of these cells are understood poorly. Signaling regulator β-catenin is a major oncoprotein that is thought to contribute to the progression of colorectal, ovarian, kidney, and other cancers (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar). It is now known that β-catenin plays a significant role in tumor initiation (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of β-catenin in cancer cells was demonstrated to promote metastasis (17Stein U. Arlt F. Walther W. Smith J. Waldman T. Harris E.D. Mertins S.D. Heizmann C.W. Allard D. Birchmeier W. Schlag P.M. Shoemaker R.H. Gastroenterology.. 2006; 131: 1486-1500Google Scholar, 18Balint K. Xiao M. Pinnix C.C. Soma A. Veres I. Juhasz I. Brown E.J. Capobianco A.J. Herlyn M. Liu Z.J. J. Clin. Invest.. 2005; 115: 3166-3176Google Scholar). β-Catenin was found to be able to inhibit anoikis and trigger anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells (11Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 146: 855-868Google Scholar, 19Weng Z. Xin M. Pablo L. Grueneberg D. Hagel M. Bain G. Muller T. Papkoff J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 18677-18686Google Scholar), but the mechanisms by which β-catenin exerts these effects are presently not known. In normal cells β-catenin typically interacts with proteins involved in cell-cell contact (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar). The excess of β-catenin is removed from such cells by a complex composed of a tumor suppressor protein APC and other proteins. After binding to this complex β-catenin is targeted for proteasomal degradation due to its phosphorylation by kinases casein kinase-1α and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar). APC is thought to ensure proper presentation of β-catenin to glycogen synthase kinase 3β (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar). In carcinomas, β-catenin degradation is often blocked by either loss-of-function mutations of APC or by β-catenin mutations that render β-catenin stable (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar). Consequently, excessive β-catenin moves to the nucleus of cancer cells where it is thought to contribute to tumor initiation (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar) and metastasis (17Stein U. Arlt F. Walther W. Smith J. Waldman T. Harris E.D. Mertins S.D. Heizmann C.W. Allard D. Birchmeier W.

Invest.. 2005; 115: 3166-3176Google Scholar) by binding and activating transcription factors of the Lef/Tcf family (16Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1653: 1-24Google Scholar). The indicated factors are known to exert their effects on cells by altering the expression of genes that control diverse cellular properties. Some of these changes, such as the elevation of the cellular levels of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 (20Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature.. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar), or a transcription factor c-Myc (21He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science.. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Google Scholar), are associated with the ability of the Lef/Tcf proteins to promote gene expression. Other changes, such as the down-regulation of the cell-to-cell adhesion mediator E-cadherin (22Jamora C. DasGupta R. Kocieniewski P. Fuchs E. Nature.. 2003; 422: 317-322Google Scholar) or that of the cell cycle inhibitor p16Ink4A (23Delmas V. Beermann F. Martinozzi S. Carreira S. Ackermann J. Kumasaka M. Denat L. Goodall J. Luciani F. Viros A. Demirkan N. Bastian B.C. Goding C.R. Larue L. Genes Dev.. 2007; 21: 2923-2935Google Scholar) are attributed to the ability the Lef/Tcf transcription factor to block gene expression. The mechanisms by which β-catenin inhibits anoikis of cancer cells are presently not known. This is in contrast to other major oncoproteins, such as for example Ras, that similar to β-catenin, is thought to play an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer (24Bos J.L. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Verlaan-de Vries M. van Boom J.H. van der Eb A.J. Vogelstein B.

We found that ras oncogene blocks anoikis of colon cancer cells by altering the expression of well studied components of the cell death machinery. The ras-dependent anti-anoikis mechanisms that we have identified include ras-induced activation of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase, an event that results in the down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins Bak (13Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol.. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Google Scholar). This, in turn, leads to the inhibition of a well established pro-apoptotic phenomenon that is normally triggered by detachment of the non-malignant cells from the ECM, such as the release of a death-promoting protein Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm of detached colon cancer cells (10Liu Z.

Other anti-anoikis mechanisms induced by ras identified by us include the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family Bcl-XL (12Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 149: 447-456Google Scholar) as well as that of apoptosis inhibitors cIAP2 and XIAP (9Liu Z. Li H. Derouet M. Filmus J. LaCasse E.C. Korneluk R.G. Kerbel R.S. Rosen K.V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 37383-37392Google Scholar). According to our studies, the effect of ras on cIAP2 requires ras-dependent autocrine production of transforming growth factor-α by the malignant cells (9Liu Z. Li H. Derouet M. Filmus J. LaCasse E.C. Korneluk R.G. Kerbel R.S. Rosen K.V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 37383-37392Google Scholar). We found in this study that β-catenin suppresses anoikis of colon cancer cells as well as that of malignant kidney epithelial cells via a novel mechanism that involves β-catenin-dependent down-regulation of Death-Associated Protein Kinase-2 (DAPk-2), a poorly studied pro-apoptotic protein that has never been implicated as a mediator of anoikis or a target of β-catenin and whose cellular functions have so far remained unexplored. Cell Culture—RK3E cells and their β-catenin-transformed variants were provided by Dr. E. Fearon. RK3E and DLD-1 cells were cultured as described elsewhere (12Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 149: 447-456Google Scholar, 25Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Google Scholar). For suspension cultures cells were plated above a layer of 1% sea plaque agarose polymerized in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Western Blot—This assay was performed as previously described (1Rosen K. Shi W. Calabretta B. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 46123-46130Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-DAPk-2 (Chemicon), anti-β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-TCF-1 (Cell Signaling), anti-TCF-4 (Cell Signaling), anti-HA (Upstate), anti-CDK-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Sigma), and anti-α-tubulin (Upstate). Gene Expression Array—The expression of mRNAs coding for regulators of apoptosis was assayed by the rat-specific array carrying respective cDNAs (SuperArray) according to manufacturer's instructions. Vectors—Expression vector pcDNA-3 carrying human HA-tagged DAPk-2 was provided by Dr. A. Kimchi (26Inbal B. Shani G. Cohen O. Kissil J.L. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 1044-1054Google Scholar). pcDNA-3 served as a control vector in the transient transfection assays. The T-REX system (Invitrogen) was used to generate cells expressing tetracycline-inducible DAPk-2. DAPk-2 cDNA was placed into XbaI and BamHI sites of the pcDNA4-TO vector (a component of the T-REX system). RNA Interference—RNA interference (RNAi) was performed as we described (10Liu Z. Li H. Derouet M. Berezkin A. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Rosen K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 14738-14747Google Scholar). In the case of β-catenin-directed RNAi experiments (Fig. 3), 5 × 105 DLD-1 cells were transfected with 100 nm of each RNA. In the case of the RNAi experiments aimed at simultaneous ablation of β-catenin and DAPk-2 (Fig. 6), 5 × 105 DLD-1 cells were transfected. In this case total RNA concentration in each transfection reaction was 50 nm. In the case of DAPk-2-directed RNAi experiments (Fig. 7), 105 RK3E cells were transfected with 100 nm of each RNA. In the case of TCF-4-directed RNAi experiments (Fig. 8), 3.5 × 105 DLD-1 cells were transfected with 100 nm of each RNA. siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA #1 (Dharmacon) was used as a control RNA.

Cells were processed and assayed for apoptosis by fluorescence microscopy following the manufacturer's instructions. The following assays were performed as previously described: Northern blot analysis, detection of apoptosis by monitoring changes in nuclear morphology, soft agar, the Cell Death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (1Rosen K. Shi W. Calabretta B. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 46123-46130Google Scholar), membrane blebbing (27Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 157: 455-468Google Scholar), and clonogenicity (10Liu Z. Li H. Derouet M. Berezkin A. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Rosen K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 14738-14747Google Scholar) assays. Western and Northern Blot Images—When lanes were removed from Western and Northern blot images, and separate parts of an image were joined together, a short vertical black line was used to indicate where the image was cut. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Cells were exposed to formaldehyde for cross-linking of proteins to chromosomal DNA as described by others (28Labhart P. Karmakar S. Salicru E.M. Egan B.S. Alexiadis V. O'Malley B.W. Smith C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 1339-1344Google Scholar) and submitted to Genpathway, Inc. (San Diego, CA) for further analysis, which was performed as per standard Genpathway protocol. In brief, cells were sonicated to fragment the DNA into 300- to 500-bp pieces, and DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated as described (28Labhart P. Karmakar S. Salicru E.M. Egan B.S. Alexiadis V. O'Malley B.W. Smith C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 1339-1344Google Scholar). Enrichment of specific genomic regions in immunoprecipitated DNA was determined by quantitative PCR (QPCR). Along with each experimental QPCR reaction (carried out in triplicates), a dilution series of three standards of known amounts of sonicated DNA was amplified with a “standard” set of primers (primers that are routinely used by Genpathway for QPCR calibration). Assuming that the mass of a haploid genome is 3.3 pg, the starting quantities of the experimental QPCR reaction could be expressed as the number of DNA copies. The number of binding events that were detected per 1000 cells (B) was then calculated according to the formula, B = C* 1000/(F * P), where C is the number of DNA copies (calculated as described above), F is the fraction of the immunoprecipitated chromatin that was used for the QPCR reaction, and P is primer efficiency (which represents the ratio of the QPCR signal observed for the experimental pair of primers to that of the QPCR signal observed for the “standard” set of primers). Antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation were rabbit IgG (Sigma), anti-β-catenin (Upstate), and anti-TCF-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The following primers were used for the QPCR reactions: for standards standard-a, CTGTACCTGGGGTTCATTCATT; standard-b, CAGTAAGCCGTTCACTCTCACA; for negative controls negative control-a, TGCAGTTTTGGCTTTGTCTC; negative control-b, GATGCGGAGAGGTCAAGAAG; for the analysis of chromosomal DNA adjacent to the DAPk-2 transcription start site DAPK1-a, GGGAGCAAGAGGTGAGAGAG; DAPK1-b, AGCAGGGGATGGGAGACAG; DAPK2-a, TGACATGGTCTGGCACAATC; DAPK2-b, AGACGGCCTATTCCTCAGTG; DAPK3-a, TCTCACCATCACGCCTTCTC; DAPK3-b, TCACCCCCTCACTCTCATTC; DAPK4-a, GGCATGGCTCTTTCTTCATC; DAPK4-b, TCATCTCAGCCCCACCATAG; DAPK5-a, ACATCCTCGGCAAAGAGTTC; DAPK5-b, TGACATCAGAAACCACCTCTAGTC; DAPK6-a, AAGGTTGGGTGAGTTCATCAG; DAPK6-b, GACTGCCTCTGGCTTCATTC; DAPK7-a, CACCACTCTTGGTTGGTACATC; DAPK7-b, TGCCCTTGAGAAAAGGAGAAG (the DNA region that was amplified by primers DAPk-2-a and -b is referred to in Fig. 9 as DAPk“-725-718”); for the analysis of the cyclin D1 promoter region cyclin D1-a, GGGCTTTGATCTTTGCTTAAC; cyclin D1-b, ACTCTGCTGCTCGCTGCTAC; for the analysis of the uPA promoter region uPA-a, TCACGACACCTAACCCAATC; uPA-b, AAGGCAAGGCCAGATTACTG; for the analysis of SGK-1 promoter region SGK1-a, TCAAACCAGGAATAGCATGTG; and SGK-1b, CAAAGCAAACCAAGGAGTTG. Statistical Analysis—Statistical data analysis was performed by using the unpaired Student's t test. In those experiments when percentage of cell death was determined data were analyzed by both t test and chi-square test for goodness-of-fit. Mutant β-Catenin Down-regulates Death-associated Protein Kinase-2 in Malignant Kidney Epithelial Cells—To explore the mechanisms by which β-catenin blocks anoikis of cancer cells we used non-malignant, anoikis-susceptible rat kidney epithelial cells RK3E (19Weng Z. Xin M. Pablo L. Grueneberg D. Hagel M. Bain G. Muller T. Papkoff J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 18677-18686Google Scholar) and two published (25Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Google Scholar) independently derived clones of these cells S33Y-A and -D that constitutively express an S33Y mutant of β-catenin, which cannot be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β and is thus abnormally stable. Unlike the parental RK3E cells, these clones can form tumors in immunodeficient mice (25Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Google Scholar). The indicated clones are known to display a significantly increased transcriptional activity of the Lef/Tcf factors compared with the parental cells (25Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Google Scholar). Indeed, we confirmed that both clones showed substantially higher levels of cyclin D1 protein (transcription of the mRNA encoding cyclin D1 is well known to be stimulated by β-catenin and Lef/Tcf proteins due to direct binding of the indicated factors to the Tcf recognition elements within the cyclin D1 promoter (20Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature.. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar)) than the parental RK3E cells (Fig. 1A). We further verified that β-catenin can suppress apoptotic events, such as condensation and fragmentation of the nuclei and fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA in RK3E cells following their detachment from the ECM (Fig. 1, B–D). To identify the mechanisms by which β-catenin blocks anoikis, we compared levels of mRNAs coding for 97 apoptosis regulators in detached RK3E and S33Y-A cells by using the array carrying respective cDNAs. The most significant β-catenin-induced change observed by us was the down-regulation (∼10-fold) of the mRNA coding for the pro-apoptotic protein DAPk-2/DAPk-related protein kinase-1 (DRP-1) (not shown). DAPk-2/DRP-1 is a cytosolic Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated Ser/Thr kinase that belongs to the DAPk family (26Inbal B. Shani G. Cohen O. Kissil J.L. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 1044-1054Google Scholar, 29Kawai T. Nomura F. Hoshino K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 3471-3480Google Scholar). DAPk-2/DRP-1 has a well established ability to cause apoptosis via unidentified mechanisms requiring its kinase activity (26Inbal B. Shani G. Cohen O. Kissil J.L. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 1044-1054Google Scholar, 27Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 157: 455-468Google Scholar, 29Kawai T. Nomura F. Hoshino K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 3471-3480Google Scholar). Substrates and physiological functions of DAPk-2 are not known. We confirmed that β-catenin down-regulates DAPk-2 both at the mRNA (Fig. 2A) and the protein (Fig. 2, B and C) levels in both attached (Fig. 2, A and B) and detached (Fig. 2C) S33Y-A and -D cells. Abnormally Stable Wild-type β-Catenin Is Required for Maintaining Constitutively Low Levels of DAPk-2 in Colon Cancer Cells—To extend our observations indicating that β-catenin can down-regulate DAPk-2 in cancer cells and block anoikis of these cells we used colon carcinoma cells DLD-1 that lack functional APC (a tumor suppressor protein that normally facilitates β-catenin degradation) and thus carry a wild-type β-catenin, whose transcriptional activity is constitutively elevated due to its abnormally high stability (30Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science.. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Google Scholar). (We confirmed that β-catenin and its partner transcription factor Tcf-4 can efficiently bind promoters of various genes, such as those encoding cyclin D1,"
https://openalex.org/W2038146608,"Clavulanic acid is a widely used β-lactamase inhibitor whose key β-lactam core is formed by β-lactam synthetase. β-Lactam synthetase exhibits a Bi-Ter mechanism consisting of two chemical steps, acyl-adenylation followed by β-lactam formation. 32PPi-ATP exchange assays showed the first irreversible step of catalysis is acyl-adenylation. From a small, normal solvent isotope effect (1.38 ± 0.04), it was concluded that β-lactam synthesis contributes at least partially to kcat. Site-specific mutation of Lys-443 identified this residue as the ionizable group at pKa ∼ 8.1 apparent in the pH-kcat profile that stabilizes the β-lactam-forming step. Viscosity studies demonstrated that a protein conformational change was also partially rate-limiting on kcat attenuating the observed solvent isotope effect on β-lactam formation. Adherence to Kramers’ theory gave a slope of 1.66 ± 0.08 from a plot of log(okcat/kcat) versus log(η/ηo) consistent with opening of a structured loop visible in x-ray data preceding product release. Internal “friction” within the enzyme contributes to a slope of >1 in this analysis. Correspondingly, earlier in the catalytic cycle ordering of a mobile active site loop upon substrate binding was manifested by an inverse solvent isotope effect (0.67 ± 0.15) on kcat/Km. The increased second-order rate constant in heavy water was expected from ordering of this loop over the active site imposing torsional strain.

Resistance to antibiotics is a consequence of their wide-spread use in the treatment of disease and can arise with dispiriting rapidity after the introduction of a new drug. β-Lactam antibiotics constitute 55% of all antibiotics sold despite their prominent use for more than 50 years (1Fisher J.F. Meroueh S.O. Mobashery S. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Their longevity is because of semi-synthetic structural modifications, the discovery of new members of the family from natural sources, and the growing importance of inhibitors of the principal means of resistance, the β-lactamases (2Kershaw N.J. Caines M.E. Sleeman M.C. Schofield C.J. Chem. Commun. 2005; 34: 4251-4263Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Clavulanic acid is a potent serine β-lactamase inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus (3Li R. Khaleeli N. Townsend C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) whose combination with broad spectrum β-lactam antibiotics has proven to be highly effective against resistant infections in humans (4Elander R.P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 61: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5Baggaley K.H. Brown A.G. Schofield C.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1997; 14: 309-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases are emerging (1Fisher J.F. Meroueh S.O. Mobashery S. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), however, and the need for new entities clinically useful against them is growing. Clavulanic acid is one of only three β-lactamase inhibitors in clinical use (Scheme 1) (6Silver L.L. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents. 2007; 17: 1175-1181Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although other clavams produced in nature may possess antibacterial and antifungal properties, clavulanic acid is the only known clavam with potent β-lactamase inhibitory activity owing in part to its 3R,5R stereochemistry (7Jensen S.E. Paradkar A.S. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 75: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to understand the steps involved in this pathway to enable the production of derivatives. Substitution at C-6 of clavulanic acid derivatives, for example, led to broader spectrum inhibition toward β-lactamases (8Simpson I.N. Urch C.J. Hagen G. Albrecht R. Sprinkart B. Pfaendler H.R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2003; 56: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and encourages efforts at engineering clavulanic acid biosynthesis. The β-lactam core of clavulanic acid is formed by β-lactam synthetase (β-LS) 2The abbreviations used are: β-LS, β-lactam synthetase; MES, 2-(N-morpho-lino)ethanesulfonic acid; TAPS, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid; CAPS, N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid; DTT, dl-dithiothreitol; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; CEA, N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-l-arginine; CMA, N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-l-arginine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DGPC, deoxy-guanidinoproclavaminic acid; SIE, solvent isotope effect. in an early step in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. β-LS converts N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-l-arginine (CEA) to deoxy-guanidinoproclavaminic acid (DGPC) through acyl-adenylate activation followed by intramolecular β-lactam ring closure (9Bachmann B.O. Li R. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Formation of the four-membered ring in clavulanic acid is distinct from its well characterized formation in penicillin and cephalosporin. In this respect the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid more closely resembles that of carbapenem biosynthesis (7Jensen S.E. Paradkar A.S. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 75: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This important mechanistic commonality revealed that a second major bacterial pathway to β-lactam-containing compounds existed, separate from the oxidative path to penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives (10McGowan S.J. Sebaihia M. Porter L.E. Stewart G.S. Williams P. Bycroft B.W. Salmond G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). β-LS possesses sequence homology to Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase, class B (AS-B; 33% identity, 49% similarity), and to the large, highly conserved family of other AS-B enzymes. It also has more modest sequence similarity to the β-lactam-forming enzyme carbapenam synthetase (CPS; 26% identity, 46% similarity) in carbapenem biosynthesis (9Bachmann B.O. Li R. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Townsend C.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). β-LS, and its homologs AS-B, and CPS catalyze the production of three chemically distinct compounds, DGPC, asparagine, and (3S,5S)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid, respectively, in an ATP/Mg2+-dependent fashion (Scheme 2) (12Boehlein S.K. Stewart J.D. Walworth E.S. Thirumoorthy R. Richards N.G. Schuster S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13230-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A.

Steady-state kinetic analyses have shown that both β-lactam-forming enzymes, β-LS and CPS, proceed by an ordered Bi-Ter mechanism with ATP the first substrate to bind and PPi the last product to dissociate (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Gerratana B. Stapon A. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7836-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). X-ray structural studies of β-LS highlighted the importance of enzyme and substrate pre-organization, in particular a conserved mobile loop that is present in the active sites of both β-LS and CPS (15Miller M.T.

These pictures of β-LS also revealed a lysine residue, Lys-443, in close proximity to the β-lactam carbonyl of DGPC, which suggested its possible role in chemistry (Fig. 1). This residue is also conserved in CPS, and its mutation to alanine or methionine in this homolog resulted in complete loss of activity (16Arnett S.O. Gerratana B. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9337-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).FIGURE 1From the crystal structure of β-LS (Protein Data Bank code 1JGT), the position of Lys-443 relative to DGPC can be seen. With hydrogen atoms included, a distance between this residue and the β-lactam carbonyl oxygen of DGPC of 2.15 Å is estimated. Elements are colored as follows: green = carbon, blue = nitrogen, red = oxygen, and white = hydrogen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, wild-type β-LS was subjected to pH, pD, temperature, and viscosity variation along with radiochemical experiments to probe the kinetics and thermodynamics of substrate capture through the catalytic cycle to product release. Moreover, the first mutagenesis of β-LS is presented, and the kinetic effects of this active site change are reported. Building on the order of substrate binding established previously (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the experiments presented here elucidate the rate-determining steps on β-LS catalysis, identify a crucial active-site residue in β-lactam formation, and uncover important conformational changes that critically influence the kinetics of β-LS catalysis. Materials—All buffers, coupled enzymes, and most assay components were purchased from Sigma. NADH, NADP+, and UDP-glucose were obtained from Roche Applied Sciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin was obtained from Qiagen, Inc. (Valencia, CA). D2O (99.9%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) cells were purchased from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (Madison, WI). Na 324P2O7 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DGPC was synthesized as described previously (17Lloyd M.D. Merritt K.D. Lee V. Sewell T.J. Wha-Son B. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Elson S.W. Baggaley K.H. Nicholson N.H. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 10201-10220Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). N2-(2-Carboxyethyl)-arginine—To a solution of K2CO3 (10.5 g, 0.076 mol) and l-arginine-HCl (16.01 g, 0.076 mol) in distilled H2O (250 ml), tert-butyl acrylate (9.74 g, 11 ml, 0.076 mol) was added, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 5 days. The solution was lyophilized to dryness. To crude (S)-2-(3-tert-butoxy-3-oxopropylamino)-5-guanidinopentanoate potassium salt (2.16 g, 6.33 mol), trifluoroacetic acid (20 ml) was added, and the solution was stirred for 90 min under argon (g). The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure at 35 °C to give an oil. The crude CEA was purified as described previously (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Construction and Overproduction of cHis6 β-LS and K443R—The overlap extension method was used to introduce the desired β-LS mutation (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar) using codon-optimized pET29b/bls as the template DNA in PCR amplifications with PCR primers incorporating the appropriate mutation. Optimization of the first 21 codons of the gene was achieved using an ApaI cut site within the β-LS sequence. Two primers that were codon-optimized for use in E. coli containing two DNA sequences were annealed to form a DNA linker with NdeI and ApaI overhangs. Ligation of the linker with the appropriately cut pET29b/bls construct created the optimized sequence. The desired gene was cloned into pET29b and transformed into E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) cells for subsequent overproduction and purification. Sequence verification of the entire gene was performed by the DNA Sequencing Facility, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. The codon optimization primers are as follows: forward, 5′-TATGGGTGCTCCGGTTCTGCCGGCTGCTTTCGGTTTCCTGGCTTCTGCTCGTACGTGGTGGCCGGGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGGCCACCACCGGTACGAGCAGAAGCCAGGAAACCGAAAGCAGCCGGCAGACCGGAGCACCCA-3′. β-LS Preparation—E. coli electrocompetent Rosetta2(DE3) cells were transformed with pET29b/bls. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium to an A600 of 0.7–0.8, cooled to ambient temperature, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18–20 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. All purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. 20–30 g of cells was collected in one 3-liter growth for wild-type β-LS. Cells were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer/g of cells (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8), and then 1 mg/ml lysozyme was added, and the cell solution was incubated for 30 min with gentle mixing. The cells were disrupted by sonication, followed by centrifugation (28,000 × g). The supernatant was equilibrated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 1 h with gentle mixing, and the whole solution was loaded onto a column, washed with 20 and 40 mm imidazole wash buffers (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8), and finally eluted with 250 mm imidazole buffer. The 250 mm imidazole fractions were dialyzed 2.5 h against 3 liters of dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Q-Sepharose FF column (4.9 cm2 × 15 cm). The column was then washed with an equal volume of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8) and eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 50–650 mm NaCl. β-LS eluted at ∼200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing β-LS were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration under 30–40 p.s.i. N2 (g) using an Amicon cell (model 8050) over a YM10 membrane. The concentrated solution was dialyzed against storage buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5% glycerol) overnight with two buffer changes. The volume of the solution was further reduced, and its concentration was determined spectroscopically using the calculated ε280 = 48.2 mm–1 cm–1 for wild-type β-LS and 41.0 mm–1 cm–1 for K443R (19Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). The concentrated enzyme was flash-frozen dropwise in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. β-LS and K443R relative purity determined by 12% SDS-PAGE analysis was >95%. 32PPi-ATP Exchange Assay—Reaction mixtures of 100 μlat the desired pH contained 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 1 mm CEA, and 0.10 mm pyrophosphate with 0.5 μCi of 32PPi and were initiated with β-LS (0.18 μm) or K443R (0.8 μm). Control assays were run in parallel and contained all components listed above except CEA. These controls were used to calculate the background for each assay. All solutions were incubated for ∼2 h at room temperature and quenched by the addition of 3% (w/v) perchloric acid followed by 100 mm pyrophosphate and 1% (w/v) activated charcoal. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min (28,000 × g). The supernatant was discarded while the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 3.5% (w/v) perchloric acid in 100 mm pyrophosphate and centrifuged for 5 min (28,000 × g). This process was repeated twice more with the final remaining pellet resuspended in 500 μl of double distilled H2O to which 5 ml of scintillation fluid (OptiFluor) was added. The counts per min of 32P incorporated into ATP were determined with a Beckman LS-5801 scintillation counter. Each reaction was performed in duplicate. HPLC Product Analysis—DGPC formation from K443R was confirmed using an established HPLC protocol (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). K443R was incubated at room temperature overnight with 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 12.5 mm MgCl2 at pH 8.8 (μ = 0.1) in a total reaction volume of 300 μl. Control assays were run in parallel, one containing a reaction mixture without enzyme and another with wild-type β-LS to serve as a positive control. Reactions were quenched by centrifugation (28,000 × g) for 10 min, and the supernatants were subsequently filtered through 0.22-μm membranes. A Luna (5 μm) ODS column was employed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a mobile phase of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, to elute DGPC at ∼16 min. This product peak was then verified by co-injection of authentic DGPC standard. β-LS Assays—ATP hydrolysis products were quantified using AMP and PPi detection in coupled enzyme assays (see below). Both coupled assays gave identical kinetic parameters to each other for β-LS and K443R and circular dichroism ensured no significant changes to the structural integrity of the mutant relative to wild type (data not shown). The temperature was held constant at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C, unless otherwise indicated, using a water-circulating system. Reactions (500 μl) were initiated by addition of enzyme with ATP held constant at saturating levels (2 mm) with varied concentrations of the second substrate, CEA. The reactions were performed in a 3-buffer system (40 mm MES, 40 mm HEPES, and 20 mm TAPS) or 100 mm 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol hydrochloride buffer (AMP-HCl) for high pH values unless otherwise noted, with ionic strength held constant at 0.1 with KCl addition (20Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). K443R utilized a similar buffer system to that of the 3-buffer system described for wild-type to reach higher pH values (35 mm HEPES, 35 mm TAPS, 35 mm AMP-HCl, μ = 0.1). Overlapping points of the two buffers with K443R ensured appropriateness of the buffer system. The initial velocity of AMP production was measured as described previously for β-LS (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PPi production was monitored using a modified coupled enzyme assay originally determined by Townsend and co-workers (14Gerratana B. Stapon A. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7836-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Van Pelt and Northrop (21Van Pelt J.E. Northrop D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction was followed at 340 nm (ε = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1) by the rate of NADPH production. The concentrations of coupled enzymes used were 4–8 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5–10 units/ml phosphoglucomutase, and 4 units/ml UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Assay mixtures contained 200 μm UDP-glucose, 200 μm NADP+, 0.4 μm glucose 1,6-diphosphate, 1 mm DTT, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP. Initial velocity patterns were fitted to Equation 1. pH Dependence—Initial velocities were measured using the PPi assay. The 3-buffer system was used for pH 6.8–9.3, and 100 mm AMP buffer was used from pH 9.3 to 10.0. The pH dependence was measured by varying CEA from 5 μm to 1.2 mm. All assays were conducted in duplicate or triplicate at all pH values (6.8, 7.3, 7.8, 8.3, 8.8, 9.0, 9.3, 9.5, 9.8, and 10.0). Based on R2 values, the kcat and kcat/Km parameters were best fit to Equations 2 and 3, respectively, and the pKa values were determined. Profiles were plotted as the log kcat or log (kcat/Km) as a weighted function of pH. The error bars shown were propagated from the uncertainty on each rate to a natural logarithmic function (22Taylor J.R. An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements.in: McGuire A. 2nd Ed. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1997: 57-179Google Scholar). Solvent Isotope Effects—Initial velocities were measured using the PPi assay with CEA varied from 4 to 800 μm. Assay components were exchanged in D2O and evaporated to dryness two times, and then redissolved in the appropriate amount of D2O and stored under N2 in an airtight flask. Although controls showed that the 3-buffer system did not require prior exchange in D2O, the AMP buffer underwent two D2O exchanges prior to adjusting to each pD. The substrates were dissolved in D2O prior to the assay and stored under N2. Buffers were dissolved in D2O and adjusted to the appropriate pD (pD = pH + 0.4) by the addition of NaOD or DCl and stored under N2 (23Lumry R. Smith E.L. Glantz R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 73: 4330-4340Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The 3-buffer system was used at pD 7.3–9.3 and AMP buffer from pD 9.8 to 10.4. Assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. All assays were performed in either 100% H2O or >95% D2O to determine D2Okcat and D2O(kcat/Km) using Equations 2 and 4, respectively, after plotting the log of the kinetic parameters as a weighted function of pD. The SIE on kcat was determined from the alkaline plateau regions, and the kcat/Km value was calculated using the xmax values from the fitted data in both solvents. The error on the SIE values was calculated as described previously (24Mukherjee A. Brinkley D.W. Chang K.M. Roth J.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3975-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Temperature Dependence—Initial velocities were measured using either the PPi assay or AMP assay from 10.0 to 34.0 °C. Temperature control was achieved by use of water-jacketed cuvettes connected to a water-circulating system with temperature control of ± 0.1 °C. β-LS was tested at pH 8.8 and 9.3 using 100 mm TAPS and AMP, respectively, with the ionic strength held constant at 0.1. Correction for the ΔpK/°C was made for each buffer at the desired pH and temperature (20Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). CEA was varied from 10 to 800 μm. Reaction mixtures, including all components except β-LS, were incubated for at least 5 min at the desired temperature and were initiated by the addition of β-LS in a volume that was never greater than 3% of the final assay volume. Analyses were performed at two pH values in the optimal activity region of β-LS, pH 8.8 and 9.3. Time-dependent incubation assays of β-LS at temperatures equal to, and greater than, the temperatures used in the assays ensured that β-LS and the assay components were stable throughout the temperature range used. The temperature dependence is shown in Eyring plots. The errors on the Eyring plots were propagated from the uncertainty on each rate to a natural logarithmic function (22Taylor J.R. An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements.in: McGuire A. 2nd Ed. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1997: 57-179Google Scholar). Viscosity Studies—Viscosity dependence of β-LS of was analyzed at pH 9.0 with CEA varied from 2 to 600 μm using the AMP assay described above. Assays were performed with the microviscogens ethylene glycol (0–35% (w/v)) and glycerol (0–35% (w/v)). The viscosities of the solutions were determined using a Brookfield viscometer at 25 °C and were performed in triplicate. PEG 8000 (6% (w/v)) was the control macroviscogen with ηrel = 3.0. The values of ηrel determined for ethylene glycol were 1.6, 2.1, and 2.4 for 20, 30, and 35% (w/v), respectively. The ηrel values of 10, 20, 30, and 35% (w/v) glycerol buffers were 1.3, 1.7, 2.3, and 2.9, respectively, and agree well with values reported previously (25Bazelyansky M. Robey E. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Brouwer A.C. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in duplicate. The dependence of K443R catalysis on glycerol (0–30% (w/v)) and PEG 8000 (6% (w/v)) was determined at pH 9.3 with saturating concentrations of CEA (4 mm) and were repeated in quadruplicate. The viscosities of the solutions used for K443R were determined as described above. The errors shown in the plots were propagated in quadrature from the fractional uncertainties of the respective rates (22Taylor J.R. An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements.in: McGuire A. 2nd Ed. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA1997: 57-179Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—All kinetic data were fit using Kaleidograph 4.0. Initial velocity patterns were fit to Equation 1, and x represents the upper or lower limits of the fits in Equations 2, 3, 4.v[Eo]=(kcatA)(Km+A)Eq. 1 log v=log(log((x)max+(x)minċ10pH−pKa1)(1+10pH−pKa1))Eq. 2 log v=log[(x)max(a+10pKa1−pH+102pH−pKa2−pKa3+10pH−pKa2)]Eq. 3 log v=log((x)max(1+10pKa1−pH+10pH−pKa2))Eq. 4 Purification of β-LS—The overall yield of codon-optimized His-tagged β-LS was greatly enhanced compared with the native purifications reported previously (27Sleeman M.C. MacKinnon C.H. Hewitson K.S. Schofield C.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). β-LScHis6 had essentially the same kinetic behavior as native protein (pH 7.8, β-LS native: kcat = 0.29 ± 0.01 s–1, Km, CEA = 0.071 ± 0.008 mm; pH 7.8, β-LScHis6: kcat 0.43 ± 0.01 s–1, Km, CEA = 0.057 ± 0.007 mm). 32PPi-ATP Exchange Assay—32PPi-ATP exchange assays are typically used to test for acyl-adenylate formation by measuring the amount of 32PPi incorporated into ATP (28McElroy W.D. DeLuca M. Travis J. Science. 1967; 157: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This experiment operates on the assumption that acyl-adenylations are reversible, as is typically observed. Although an acyl-adenylate intermediate was captured in an x-ray crystal structure of the lower homolog of CEA, N2-(2-carboxymethyl)-l-arginine (CMA), in the enzyme (β-LS/CMA-AMP/PPi) (15Miller M.T. Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Rosenzweig A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14752-14757Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), no 32PPi exchange was detected previously with β-LS. In this study, this step was further evaluated over a wider pH range using a procedure modified from that described before (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to enhance reproducibility and lower the background radioactivity. This method was employed to analyze the acyl-adenylation step at pH 6.8–9.3. In the pH range of 8.3–9.3, no exchange was seen in wild-type β-LS as reported earlier. Increasing concentrations of β-LS (0.18–2.7 μm) and varying CEA (20 μm to 1 mm) still revealed no radioactivity incorporated into ATP. As the pH was lowered, however, appreciable exchange was measured in assays of wild type (pH 6.8–7.8). In contrast, the mutant, K443R, demonstrated significant exchange at pH 8.3 and 9.3 with values 4-fold greater than background. HPLC Product Analysis—Coupled enzyme assays detected the by-products PPi and AMP in accord with formation of DGPC in the β-LS reaction. Verification that this β-lactam product was formed in the K443R mutant was achieved through an established HPLC method (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). β-LS Assays—Because β-LS possesses an ordered binding mechanism, the concentration of the second substrate, CEA, was varied in all the assays with ATP held constant at 2 mm. It was previously established that the products DGPC, AMP, and PPi are formed in equal ratios (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Control assays containing all components except the substrate CEA indicated no detectable background ATP hydrolysis by β-LS occurred under the conditions for all experiments. pH Studies—pH profiles of β-LS were performed to identify ionizable groups involved in binding and catalysis (29Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 390-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and to reveal the optimal pH for β-LS catalysis. The previously published pH profiles of β-LS did not hold ionic strength constant, and points were not overlapped with each new buffer used (13Bachmann B.O. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11187-11193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although CHES was previously used for β-LS to show pH dependence at high pH, CHES and its analog CAPS were found to be inhibitors of β-L"
https://openalex.org/W2107875366,"The synthetic rexinoid bexarotene (Targretin, LGD1069) inhibits the formation of both estrogen receptor-negative and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in preclinical models and controls the expression of growth-regulatory biomarkers, such as IGFBP-6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6), RARβ, or cyclin D1. In this study, we identified a classical retinoic acid-responsive element in the first intron in the IGFBP-6 gene adjacent to a consensus AP-1 binding site, both elements essential for rexinoid-induced expression of IGFBP-6. In chromatin binding experiments, bexarotene increased the occupancy of the identified enhancer element by RXRα, RARβ, cJun, cFos, and p300. In normal mammary epithelial cells and T47D breast cancer cells, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of all RXR isoforms or RARβ, but not RARα or RARγ alone, blocked the induction of IGFBP-6 by bexarotene. Simultaneous knockdown of RARα and RARγ abrogated both the induction of RARβ and the up-regulation and secretion of IGFBP-6. The suppression of either RARβ or cJun by small interfering RNA blocked the recruitment of RXRα and cJun to the enhancer. These results demonstrate a novel cooperative interaction between retinoid receptors and AP-1 orchestrated by RARβ and highlight a novel mechanism by which RARβ can mediate the cancer-preventive effects of rexinoids.

Retinoids are lipid-soluble mediators that play essential roles in development and homeostatic regulation. Retinoic acid and its derivatives, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid, have been used for the treatment of various cancers, including certain forms of leukemia (1Warrell Jr., R.P. Maslak P. Eardley A. Heller G. Miller Jr., W.H. Frankel S.R. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 929-933PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, retinoids and synthetic retinoid analogues, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid, or N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide, have been shown to prevent cancer in animals (2Moon R.C.

In contrast, RXR-selective retinoids or rexinoids, such as bexarotene (LGD1069) and LG100268, were found to be very efficient in suppressing the incidence of estrogen receptor-negative mammary tumors in murine mammary tumor virus-ErbB2 mice (8Wu K.

Bexarotene is now being tested in a multicenter clinical trial for its chemopreventive activity against breast cancer. In a previous study of gene expression profiles of rexinoid-induced biomarkers, we discovered that bexarotene modulated the expression of IGFBP-6 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-6), along with other growth-regulatory genes, such as COX-2, cyclin D1, and RARβ (retinoic acid receptor β) (11Kim H.T.

Although IGF-I appears to be a critical factor in the regulation of breast cell growth, mice overexpressing IGF-II develop mammary tumors (13Sachdev D. Yee D. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). IGF-II is a mitogen for many different cancer cells, and overexpression of IGF-II gives rise to mammary tumors (14Osborne C.K.

As opposed to rodents, humans maintain high levels of IGF-II throughout life, and its stromal expression suggests that IGF-II may affect epithelial cell growth through paracrine pathways in the breast (16Giani C. Cullen K.J. Campani D. Rasmussen A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 41: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One of the important mechanisms to modulate the effect of IGFs in the tissues is to regulate the amount of available IGFs 2The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HMEC, human mammary epithelial cell; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RXRE, RXR element. through IGF-binding proteins (17Sachdev D. Yee D. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2006; 11: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with IGFBP-1 and -3 being the major IGF-I binding factors. IGFBP-2 is frequently elevated in human prostate and brain tumors and was suggested to play a role in PTEN signaling (18Mehrian-Shai R. Chen C.D. Shi T. Horvath S. Nelson S.F. Reichardt J.K.

IGFBP-4, an early responsive estrogen-induced gene, and IGFBP-5 as an estrogen-repressed gene, have been investigated as potential predictive markers for endocrine therapy of breast cancer (19Mita K.

IGFBP-3 is the most abundant IGF-binding protein in circulation carrying most of the circulating IGF, with intrinsic biologic activities independent of its potential to sequester IGF (20Kelley K.M.

Although the biological effects of IGFBP-3 have been characterized best, less is known about IGFBP-6. IGFBP-6 has a high affinity for binding IGF-II and is able to inhibit the growth of various cancer cells and activate programmed cell death pathways (22Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Brown A.L. Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2168-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Sueoka N. Lee H.Y. Walsh G.L. Fang B. Ji L. Roth J.A. LaPushin R. Hong W.K. Cohen P. Kurie J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, patients with invasive breast cancer had significantly lower serum levels of IGFBP-6 than subjects with benign breast disease (24Kaulsay K.K. Ng E.H. Ji C.Y. Ho G.H. Aw T.C. Lee K.O. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 140: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). IGFBP-6 belongs to the small group of genes recently identified as genes showing correlating expression profiles in human estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors and the estrogen receptor-positive cell lines T47D and MCF7 (25Zhu Y. Wang A. Liu M.C. Zwart A. Lee R.Y. Gallagher A. Wang Y. Miller W.R. Dixon J.M. Clarke R. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 29: 1581-1589PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have characterized the ability of the RXR-selective retinoid bexarotene to regulate the expression of IGFBP-6. Our results show that IGFBP-6 is up-regulated by the cooperative action of retinoid receptors and the AP-1 transcription factor through a complex response element in the first intron of the IGFBP-6 gene. In addition, the early induction of RARβ by bexarotene is essential for the formation of an active AP-1/RXR transcriptional complex, suggesting a novel mechanism by which RARβ can mediate the cancer preventive effects of rexinoids. Ligands—The synthetic RXR-ligand bexarotene (Targretin, LGD1069) was a kind gift of Dr. William Lamph (Ligand Pharmaceuticals) and was used at a 1 μm final concentration, unless otherwise indicated. siRNA SmartPools and Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Cell Culture—Normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) were derived from healthy women who had undergone reduction mammoplasties and were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Cells between passages 4 and 12 were used. HMECs were maintained in mammary epithelial basal medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 30 μg/ml gentamicin, and 15 ng/ml amphotericin-B (Clonetics). Cells were cultured in a humidified environment at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in the air. The human breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF-7 were obtained from the ATTC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Iscove’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). RNA Extraction and Measurement of Transcript Levels—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed in triplicate, with a “non-reverse transcription control” lacking reverse transcriptase in parallel, to control amplifications due to genomic DNA contamination. Transcript quantitation based on real time monitoring of amplification was carried out using an ABI 7700 sequence analyzer performing 40 cycles of 95 °C for 12 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Values of transcripts in unknown samples were obtained by interpolating their Ct (PCR cycles to threshold) values on a standard curve derived from known amounts of cognate, amplicon-specific synthetic oligonucleotides. Transcript levels were normalized to the level of cyclophilin mRNA. Selective Gene Knockdown Experiments—To assess the effect of gene silencing on the consequent changes in transcript levels, 104 cells were seeded on 24-well tissue culture plates 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection conditions were optimized for highest level of knockdown at the lowest toxicity, and the active individual duplexes were identified for combination knockdown experiments. Suppression of transcript levels exceeding 70% was considered acceptable. Generation of Reporter Constructs—Noncoding regions of the IGFBP-6 gene (accession number AJ006952) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the genomic clone RP11-158-I20 as a template. Fresh PCR products were TA-cloned into a TOPO2.1 TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen) and then transferred to the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) protocol according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Three point mutations were introduced in the distal AP-1 binding site (AP1mut31; TGAGTCA → TTATTAA) and two into the RXRE (RXRmut23; AGGTCA → AGTTAA). Reporter Assays—Reporter assays of luciferase expression vectors were carried out to assess the retinoid responsiveness of various regulatory regions of the IGFBP-6 gene promoter and introns. Transfections were conducted overnight in cells plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at ∼70% confluence, using 0.6 μl of FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA in each well. Treatments were done in triplicate, and experiments were repeated three times. Measurements were performed using the Dual-Reporter Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Luminoskan apparatus. To control for variations in transfection efficiency, firefly luciferase readings were normalized to the activity of the anthozoan Renilla reniformis luciferase enzyme expressed from a constitutive promoter. Western Blot—Cells were transfected with siRNAs for nuclear receptors or luciferase, as a control. Forty-eight hours later transfected cells were treated with bexarotene or vehicle. Another 24 h later, cell supernatants were harvested, and proteins from whole cell lysates were extracted using methods previously described (11Kim H.T. Kong G. Denardo D. Li Y. Uray I. Pal S. Mohsin S. Hilsenbeck S.G. Bissonnette R. Lamph W.W. Johnson K. Brown P.H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 12009-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein were electrophoresed on a 10% acrylamide denaturing gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein levels were detected by using the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for IGFBP-6 at 1:200 (catalog number PB-383-9; Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA), RXRα (D-20, sc-553), RARα (C-20, sc-551), RARβ (C-19, sc-552X), RARγ (C-19, sc-550; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal antibody specific for β-actin (catalog number sc-7202; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200). The blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (Amersham Life Sciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described before (26DeNardo D.G. Kim H.T. Hilsenbeck S. Cuba V. Tsimelzon A. Brown P.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown for 4 days in 15-cm dishes to 60% confluence and kept in serum-free media for another 48 h before drugs were added. After washing in PBS, cells were fixed in 1% formalin for 15 min. Cellular DNA was fragmented by sonication with 8 times 5 pulses at power output 5 (Branson Sonifier 450). 500 μg of cell lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose, and the transcription factors in the supernatant were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against RXRα, RXRβ, RARα, RARβ, RARγ, cJun, cFos, ATF2, and p300. Normal rabbit IgG was used as negative control. After reversal of the cross-links, DNA was extracted, and the 2530–2700 section of intron 1 of IGFBP-6 was amplified by 32 cycles of PCR. To ensure reproducibility, experiments were repeated three times. DNA products were first analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. For accuracy and increased sensitivity to detect chromatin precipitated by the RARβ antibody, extracted DNA was also measured by quantitative real time PCR. Optimal efficiency and linear nature of the reactions was determined by constructing a standard curve from serial dilutions of the BAC clone containing the IGFBP-6 gene. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t test or two-tailed analysis of variance. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are presented as means ± S.D. IGFBP-6 Is Induced by Bexarotene and Is Growth-suppressive—We previously identified IGFBP-6 as a marker gene of the chemopreventive rexinoid bexarotene (Targretin, LGD1069) in normal HMECs. In previous microarray experiments, IGFBP-6 was found to be up-regulated (mean change 2.8-fold at p < 0.05) by treatment with 1 μm bexarotene (among 12,384 genes present on the oligonucleotide chip) (11Kim H.T. Kong G. Denardo D. Li Y. Uray I. Pal S. Mohsin S. Hilsenbeck S.G. Bissonnette R. Lamph W.W. Johnson K. Brown P.H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 12009-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This result stimulated us to investigate the molecular mechanism by which rexinoids induce IGFBP-6 expression. To understand what components of the IGF system may be affected by this rexinoid, we first measured the effect of bexarotene on the mRNA levels of the IGF-binding proteins 1–6 in HMECs after a 24-h exposure to the drug using real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. These studies showed that IGFBP-2 mRNA was most abundant in HMECs, whereas IGFBP-1 and -5 were barely detectable (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, bexarotene increased the expression of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-6.TABLE 1Relative mRNA levels of IGF-binding proteins in normal mammary epithelial cells are shown ± S.D.

These studies showed an average 3–4-fold increase in the mRNA levels of IGFBP-6 upon the addition of 1 μm bexarotene to normal breast cells and breast cancer cells (T47D and MCF-7) (Fig. 1A). Increased levels of the mRNA were followed by the induction of the IGFBP-6 protein as well (Fig. 1A, upper inset). Based on the log-linear section of the dose-response curve, 1 μm concentration of bexarotene was chosen for treatment in further studies (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the up-regulation of the IGFBP-6 mRNA occurred in a delayed fashion, reaching close to maximal change at ∼24 h, suggesting that the induction involves an indirect mechanism. The requirement of a retinoid-inducible intermediary factor for the up-regulation of IGFBP-6 was demonstrated by the lack of induction in the presence of cycloheximide prior to addition of bexarotene to the culture media (Fig. 1D). In order to confirm that the effect of bexarotene is RXR-dependent, we treated HMEC and T47D cells with the rexinoid after suppressing RXRs by specific siRNAs. Suppression of RXRα was seen as assessed at the level of mRNA (see Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 2A, inset) and by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). However, loss of RXRα resulted in no significant change in the induction of IGFBP-6 by bexarotene (Fig. 2B). Similarly, individual knockdown of RXRβ or RXRγ isoforms alone had no significant effect (data not shown). However, simultaneous knockdown of all three RXR isoforms diminished the induction of IGFBP-6 (Fig. 2C). Thus, RXR proteins are required for rexinoid induction of IGFBP-6; however, the different RXR isoforms are redundant in their ability to stimulate IGFBP-6 expression in response to rexinoid.FIGURE 2Characterization of the effects of individual and combined knockdown of retinoid X receptors and retinoic acid receptors on the response of IGFBP-6 to bexarotene.

All of these receptors had detectable transcript levels at base line, with RARβ mRNA levels being less than 2% of that of RARα and less than 0.75% of RARγ. siRNA treatment of retinoic acid receptors resulted in at least 70% suppression of their mRNAs, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2D, top). Knockdown of RARβ was able to block the up-regulation of IGFBP-6 (Fig. 2D, bottom), whereas suppression of RARα or RARγ did not abrogate but only partially reduced the response of IGFBP-6 to bexarotene. Similar results were obtained when repeating the knockdown experiments in T47D cells (data not shown). Induction of RARβ Is Critical for the Rexinoid-dependent Up-regulation of IGFBP-6 Expression—As shown in Fig. 2D, RARβ was the only retinoid receptor whose knockdown alone blocked the rexinoid response of IGFBP-6. Although RARβ is expressed at a low level in untreated cultured cells, the time course of RARβ expression shows that RARβ is greatly induced as early as 3 h following bexarotene treatment (Fig. 3A), and cells sustained elevated protein levels of RARβ 48 h after rexinoid exposure (Fig. 3C, bottom). Simultaneous suppression of RARα and RARγ by siRNAs in HMECs reduced their mRNA levels by over 80% and protein levels correspondingly (Fig. 3B). The combined knockdown of RARα and RARγ greatly inhibited the induction of RARβ by bexarotene (Fig. 3C, top). Furthermore, the lack of induction of RARβ in RARα/γ-suppressed cells was associated with the abrogation of the up-regulation of IGFBP-6 transcript levels and protein by bexarotene (Fig. 3, C (middle) and D), suggesting that the induction of RARβ is critical for the up-regulation of IGFBP-6. Identification of the Bexarotene-responsive Elements in the IGFBP-6 Gene—To further elucidate the mechanism by which retinoids regulate the expression of IGFBP-6, we isolated the 5′-regulatory sequences, including the 5′-untranslated region, of the IGFBP-6 gene upstream of the coding region and cloned a series of deletion constructs into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 basic (Fig. 4A). The expression vectors containing these promoter fragments were transiently transfected into HMECs and T47D cells, and the bexarotene-dependent increase of luciferase activity was assayed. None of the reporter constructs spanning the proximal 2 kb of the putative IGFBP-6 promoter exhibited increased activity upon the addition of bexarotene (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the three introns and the 3′-untranslated region of the IGFBP-6 gene were also cloned and tested. All of the resulting reporter constructs proved unresponsive to bexarotene, with the exception of one containing the distal region of intron 1. Within this segment, spanning ∼650 bp (Fig. 4C, positions 2531–3180 in the IGFBP-6 gene), we identified an intronic region that showed identical response to bexarotene as the native IGFBP-6 gene. By creating a series of deletion mutants, we found that this rexinoid-responsive region is a complex regulatory element comprising 112 bp (2512–2623; Fig. 4D). To identify relevant intron 1 response elements, this intron 1 region was studied in silico using the Transcription Element Search Software (available on the World Wide Web). The analysis suggested that the rexinoid-responsive region of intron 1 contains potential response elements for AP-1, RXR-RAR, Sp1, TTF1, and AP-3 between the locations 2512 and 2623 (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we next created and tested various 5′, 3′, and internal deletion constructs of intron 1 to determine which of these elements were functionally required for the activity of the construct (Fig. 5B). Induction of the luciferase reporter gene upon bexarotene treatment was moderate but was highly reproducible over multiple experiments (significant at p < 0.005 between groups by two-way analysis of variance). Removal of the proximal, overlapping AP-1/RXR-RAR response elements (see construct 2) did not reduce the activity of the reporter (compare construct 2 with construct 1; Fig. 5B). However, deletion of the DR5 consensus RXR-RAR response element (AGGTCA-5-GGGACA) at position 2605–2622 (construct 3) completely eliminated the bexarotene response of the reporter (Fig. 5B). When the AP-1 binding site (TGAGTCA) upstream of the RXRE was deleted (Del 2557–2603) while the distal RXR·retinoic acid response element was left intact, again all response to retinoids was lost. To establish whether the distal RXR and AP-1 binding sites are indeed critical, these putative response elements were individually altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Inactivation of either the putative distal RXRE (construct 5, RXRmut23, 2605–2610) or the AP-1 response element (construct 6, APmut31, 2593–2599) resulted in significant reduction or the abrogation of the bexarotene response. Similar results were obtained in both T47D and HMECs, demonstrating that both the distal RXRE and the adjacent AP-1 elements are required in rexinoid-induced transactivation of the IGFBP-6 gene. To determine which transcription factors in vivo bind the regulatory region shown to be bexarotene-responsive in reporter assays, we performed ChIP assays in T47D cells targeting the rexinoid-responsive region of intron 1 (Fig. 6A). In the absence of bexarotene, this segment was occupied by cJun and ATF2 and showed weak binding of RXRα, RXRβ, and the coactivator p300 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that in the inactive state, a cJun·ATF2 heterodimer binds the element. Serial ChIP assays indicated that upon the addition of bexarotene, increased binding of RXRα to the active intronic segment occurred no earlier than 12 h (data not shown). Further ChIP analyses showed that recruitment of RXRα and cJun were the dominant changes on the response element, but increased binding of cFos, RARα, and p300 were also observed (Fig. 6, B and C). At the same time, bexarotene treatment markedly reduced its occupancy by ATF2 and RXRβ (Fig. 6, B and C). Enhanced recruitment of RARβ upon bexarotene could be detected by quantitative real time PCR but not conventional PCR analyzed on gel (Fig. 6C). The concurrent binding of AP-1 and retinoid receptors is consistent with our reporter assay data showing that selective deletion of either the RXR-RAR response element or the AP-1 site abrogates the activation of the bexarotene-responsive construct. Both RARβ and cJun Are Required for the Recruitment of RXRα to the IGFBP-6 Gene—To determine whether RARβ is essential for the recruitment of transcription factors to the rexinoid-responsive IGFBP-6 enhancer, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in bexarotene-treated cells following the knockdown of RARβ. The suppression of RARβ was associated with the loss of recruitment of RXRα and cJun to the enhancer in response to bexarotene (Fig. 6D). Conversely, ATF2 binding markedly increased upon bexarotene treatment, whereas binding of cFos diminished (data not shown). In a parallel experiment, the siRNA-mediated sup"
https://openalex.org/W2008171017,"The earth’s rotation about its axis generates predictable changes in light and temperature, which define the 24 hr day-night cycle. Organisms from bacteria to humans have evolved an internal timekeeper to anticipate these environmental changes. This timekeeper—the circadian clock—allows organisms to parse biological processes to the appropriate time of day or night. Circadian clocks regulate behavioral, physiological, and metabolic rhythms via transcriptional feedback loops. Although clocks in different species use distinct protein constituents, the general architecture is conserved: A network of interconnected transcriptional feedback loops regulates rhythmic transcription of loop components as well as clock output genes. These interconnected loops consist of a core loop (CL) with a number of interlocking loops (IL) intersecting it. The primary difference between these loops is the effect of mutations on clock behavior. Mutating components of the core loop severely affects the regulation of the clock, whereas the effects are much milder for components in the interlocking loops. Posttranslational regulation such as phosphorylation introduces small delays ensuring that feedback regulators function at the correct time and cellular location to maintain ~24 hr rhythms in transcription. The complexity of these transcriptional feedback loops for simply maintaining 24 hr timekeeping may not be a universal requirement. Recent work in cyanobacteria, a prokaryote, shows that a 24 hr oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro by three purified proteins (see Nakajima et al., 2005).

Yeast. 1998; 14: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and as the end product of dissimilative glycerol oxidation in the respiratory chain of Gluconobacter (2Deppenmeier U. Hoffmeister M. Prust C. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Dha is taken up and metabolized by bacteria and eukaryotes. The first step of Dha metabolism is either a reduction to glycerol followed by glycerol phosphorylation or, alternatively, direct phosphorylation to the glycolytic intermediate Dha-P. There are two kinases that phosphorylate Dha, glycerol kinase and Dha kinase. Glycerol kinase does not discriminate between glycerol and Dha. In contrast, Dha kinases are specific for Dha, d-glyceraldehyde, and possibly other short-chain aldehydes and ketones. The chemical basis for this specificity is the formation of a covalent hemiaminal bond between the carbonyl carbon of Dha and the Nϵ2 of the active-site histidine (for a review see Ref. 3Erni B. Siebold C. Christen S. Srinivas A. Oberholzer A. Baumann U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Dha kinases can be grouped in two structurally homologous but functionally different families. The first are the two-domain Dha kinases (DAK) occurring in eukaryotes and some bacteria. They consist of a Dha binding (K) and an ATP binding (L) domain (4Daniel R. Stuertz K. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4392-4401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characteristically for kinases, ADP is exchanged by ATP after each catalytic cycle. ATPDAK→DhaREACTION 1 The second family comprises Dha kinases that occur only in eubacteria and a few archaebacteria. These kinases consist of three subunits (5Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Two of them, DhaK and DhaL, are homologous to the K and L domains. Intriguingly, the ADP moiety is not exchanged for ATP (6Bachler C. Flukiger-Bruhwiler K. Schneider P. Bahler P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18321-18325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but remains permanently bound to the DhaL subunit where it is rephosphorylated in situ by the third subunit, DhaM. These Dha kinases function according to Reaction 2. PEP→EI→HPr→DhaM→DhaL-ADPDhAK→DhaREACTION 2 Phosphate is transferred sequentially from PEP via Enzyme I to HPr, hence to DhaM, the ADP cofactor of DhaL, and finally to Dha bound to the DhaK subunit. All subunits except for DhaK are transiently phosphorylated at a histidine and DhaL on the ADP cofactor. In some bacteria, DhaM is a multidomain protein consisting of a domain predicted to belong to the mannose family (EIIAMan) of the PTS (5Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) plus additional domains homologous to HPr and Enzyme I of the PTS. In summary, this second family of Dha kinases that are exclusively bacterial have switched from ATP to PEP as a source of high energy phosphate.Besides covalent substrate binding by DhaK (7Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and containing ADP as cofactor, bacterial Dha kinases display another noteworthy property. The DhaK and DhaL subunits or paralogues thereof function as coactivators of dha operon transcription. For instance, in Escherichia coli, DhaL-ADP (but not DhaL-ATP), and DhaK without bound Dha act antagonistically as coactivators and corepressor, respectively, of the transcription factor DhaR (8Bachler C. Schneider P. Bahler P. Lustig A. Erni B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an enhancer-binding protein (9Schumacher J. Joly N. Rappas M. Zhang X. Buck M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) consisting of a receiver, an AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities), and a DNA binding domain. In Lactococcus lactis, DhaQ, a paralogue of DhaK, acts as coactivator of the transcription factor DhaS, and Dha acts as inducer by binding to DhaQ. DhaS belongs to the tetracycline repressor family but exceptionally functions as activator of the dha operon (10Christen S. Srinivas A. Bahler P. Zeller A. Pridmore D. Bieniossek C. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23129-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Here we present three x-ray structures of the DhaM subunit alone (1.1-Å resolution), of the transient complex between the DhaM and DhaL subunits (2.1-Å resolution) and of the DhaK subunit (2.5-Å resolution). 5The amino acid sequence and X-ray structures of the proteins can be accessed through the Swiss Protein Database and the RCSB Protein Databank codes: DhaM, Q9CIV6 and 3CT6; DhaL, Q9CIV7 (DhaM·DhaL complex 3CR3); and DhaK, Q9CIV8 and 3CT4. 5The amino acid sequence and X-ray structures of the proteins can be accessed through the Swiss Protein Database and the RCSB Protein Databank codes: DhaM, Q9CIV6 and 3CT6; DhaL, Q9CIV7 (DhaM·DhaL complex 3CR3); and DhaK, Q9CIV8 and 3CT4. We notice that the characteristic fold of DhaM, the prototype of the so-called EDD fold (for EIIA domain, dihydroxyacetone kinase, and DegV (11Kinch L.N. Cheek S. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) also appears again as a core fold of the much larger DhaK subunit of the Dha kinase.Using the EDD fold for modeling showed that the contact interfaces between DhaM and DhaL on one hand and between DhaL and DhaK on the other are by and large identical. The same scaffolds control the phosphate transfer from DhaM phosphohistidine to DhaL-ADP, and from DhaL-ATP to the hydroxyl group of Dha.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—The open reading frames encoding the L. lactis Dha phosphotransferase proteins were amplified by PCR and cloned into multicopy vectors encoding N- and C-terminal hexahistidine (H6) tags. Proteins were expressed in E. coli K12 strains and purified by metal chelate and gel-filtration chromatography. N-terminal tags were removed with thrombin. Selenomethionine-labeled proteins were produced using the pathway inhibition method (13Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The details are given in the supplemental materials.Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Crystals of DhaMH6, DhaKH6 and the DhaM·DhaL complex were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 16 °C. 2 μl of DhaMH6 (15 mg/ml) was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 200 mm NaNO3, 20! polyethylene glycol 3350 acidified with HCl to pH 2.8. 2 μl of DhaKH6 (7 mg/ml) was mixed with 2 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, 8.5, 200 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm CaCl2, 30! polyethylene glycol 4000 in a 1:1 ratio. For cryoprotection, the crystals were soaked in 10 μl of crystallization condition plus 18! glycerol. 2 μl of DhaM and DhaL (15 mg/ml of each) was mixed with 2.5 μl of buffer containing 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 8.5, 0.2 m LiSO4, 36! polyethylene glycol 4000. For cryoprotection, the crystals were soaked for 5 min at 16 °C in 10 μl of crystallization condition (0.1 m Tris/HCl, 8.5, 0.2 m LiSO4, 36! polyethylene glycol 4000) supplemented with 5! 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and for 3 min at 16 °C in 10 μl of crystallization condition plus 10! 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the datasets were collected at the X12 beamline (Deutsche Elektronen-Synchrotron, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Hamburg) employing a MAR Mosaic225 detector (Mar Research, Hamburg, Germany). The details of data processing and structure solution are given in the supplemental materials.Dha Kinase Activity Assays—The Dha phosphotransferase assay was performed with the ion exchange procedure as described previously (14Erni B. Trachsel H. Postma P.W. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13726-13730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]Dha binding was assayed by acetone precipitation of the complex as described previously (15Garcia-Alles L.F. Siebold C. Nyffeler T.L. Flukiger-Bruhwiler K. Schneider P. Burgi H.B. Baumann U. Erni B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13037-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The details are given in the supplemental materials.RESULTSOverall Structure of DhaM—DhaM is a dimer of identical subunits (termed A and B). The DhaM subunit assumes a (βα)4α fold consisting of a four-stranded parallel β sheet (strand order 2, 1, 3, 4) flanked by three and two helices (1, 4, 5 and 2, 3) on either side (Fig. 1A).The intersubunit contact surface buries 1981 Å2 (15! of the monomer surface). The major contacts are between the two C-terminal helical turns of α1A and α1B and between the C-terminal ends of helices α4A and α4B (Fig. 1A). The interface is composed of 14 apolar residues, 4 hydrogen bonds, and 2 salt bridges. The carboxylate of Glu-13A forms a hydrogen bond to Ser-16B and a salt bridge with Lys-20B. The Glu-94A carboxylate forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Leu-92B and a salt bridge with Lys-123B (Fig. 1D). The His tag lies in the groove between the two subunits. It expands the interface by 17! and covers the active site. Therefore, the tagged DhaM was catalytically inactive (results not shown) and refractory to co-crystallization with DhaL (see below). The His tag is fixed by two hydrogen bonds between the backbone amide of the His-127B and the OH of Ser-69B and between the backbone carbonyl of His-126B to Tyr-97A. The latter also plays a prominent role at the DhaM·DhaL interface as it will be shown below. The active site conformations of the His-tagged DhaM and DhaM in complex with DhaL (see below) are indistinguishable indicating that inactivation of DhaM is caused by blocking of access to and not distortion of the active site. Furthermore, the His tag is responsible for 36! of the crystal contact interface in the b/c-plane of the protein crystal (supplemental Fig. S3).The transphosphorylation reaction catalyzed by DhaM proceeds through a phosphohistidine intermediate. The active site His-10 is located in the solvent-exposed β1α1 loop in a groove between the two monomers (Fig. 1D). Adjacent to His-10B is a hydrophobic patch formed by residues Ile-42B, Gly-43B, Leu-67B, Ala-70B, and Leu-21A. The Nδ1 amide of the imidazole ring facing the protein interior is in hydrogen-bonding distance to the completely buried and not charge-compensated Asp-66 in the loop between β3 and α3 (Fig. 1D). The His-Asp pair is invariant in all homologues of DhaM. By acting as a general base the carboxylate group of Asp-66 increases the nucleophilicity of the His-10 imidazole ring. Nϵ2 of His-10 is located close to the N-terminal end of helix α3, and the charge of the phosphoryl group at Nϵ2 would thus be partially compensated by the helix macro dipole. Charge-dipole stabilization (16Hol W.G. van Duijnen P.T. Berendsen H.J. Nature. 1978; 273: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) is often found in phosphate binding sites.Comparison of the x-ray structure of DhaM with known folds using the DALI-server (17Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) gave significant scores for EIIAMan domain of the E. coli mannose transporter (Z = 11.2 PDB code 1pdo (18Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), DhaK of E. coli (Z = 9.5 PDB code 1uod (7Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)), and for the DegV lipid-binding protein (Z = 11.1, Thermus thermophilus, PDB code 2DT8). DhaM and EIIAMan differ in the orientation of the α helices and the C-terminal extension (Fig. 1B). In DhaM, the C terminus lies parallel to the intersubunit groove. In EIIAMan, it crosses the subunit boundary and adds itself as a fifth antiparallel strand to the β-sheet of the second subunit. This swapping greatly increases the intersubunit contact surface (3366 Å2 of EIIAMan versus 1981 Å2 for DhaM). In the DhaM dimer, the axes of the helices α4A and α4B (orange) are oriented head to head in line, in the EIIA dimer, they are still parallel but laterally displaced. In the DhaM subunit, the axes of the α1(blue) and α5(red) helices are at an angle of only 20°, in EIIA they are at a right angle. The DhaM structure presented here is the prototype of the so-called EDD fold (11Kinch L.N. Cheek S. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The DhaM fold also occurs in DhaK, where it is embedded in a larger structure (see below).Overall Structure of DhaK·Dha Complex—DhaK is a homodimer and crystallized in space group P3121 with three DhaK monomers (A, B, and C) in the asymmetric unit. By applying the symmetry operations to the asymmetric unit the physiological dimers AC and BB of each monomer (A, B, and C) are generated. Refinement of the native protein structure against 2.5-Å data resulted in an R-factor of 20.4! and an Rfree of 26.7!, with reasonable stereochemistry. Only residues 200–209 are disordered. This segment is without electron densities in all known DhaK structures (7Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with the exception of the L. lactis DhaQ where the loop becomes ordered in the course of a conformational change triggered by Dha binding (10Christen S.

As observed before with DhaK of E. coli (7Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), DhaK of L. lactis contains a molecule of dihydroxyacetone (Dha) covalently bound in hemiaminal linkage to the Nϵ2 nitrogen of His-220.At the core of the DhaK structure is an EDD fold (residues Val-48 to Asn-185) similar to DhaM (Fig. 1, C and E, rainbow color). A comparison of the two folds calculated by DaliLite (19Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) resulted in a Z-score of 11.1 and a r.m.s.d. of 2.2 Å for 108 Cα atoms. The core, however, accounts for only 40! of the total mass of DhaK. Attached to the N terminus is an αβαβ motif (residues 1–47), which enlarges the β sheet of the EDD fold by two strands and provides one of the two dimerization helices. Attached to the C-terminal α-hairpin is a two-layered αβ fold (residues 186–331). The inner layer, a six-stranded mixed β-sheet, covers the EDD fold. An α helix of the outer layer provides the second dimerization helix.The overall structure of L. lactis DhaK is very similar to the orthologous DhaK of E. coli (PDB entry 1OI2 (7Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) and the paralogous transcription coactivator DhaQ of L. lactis (PDB entry 2IU4 (10Christen S. Srinivas A. Bahler P. Zeller A. Pridmore D. Bieniossek C. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23129-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). The sequence identity for both proteins is 45!, and the r.m.s.d. values are 1.1 Å for 305 Cα atoms with a Z-score of 47.1, and 1.6 Å for 310 Cα atoms with a Z-score of 46.2, respectively, as determined with Dali (17Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The main difference is the two-stranded β-hairpin of E. coli DhaK. Inserted in the two-layered αβ fold it covers the hydrophobic edge strand of the EDD fold and possibly prevents edge-to-edge aggregation (7Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In DhaK of L. lactis aggregation may be prevented by a different mechanism, namely electrostatic repulsion (21Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), between charged residues protruding from the edge, for instance Glu-130 in DhaK of L. lactis or a lysine, arginine, and aspartate in other homologues.Structure of the Transient DhaM·DhaL Complex—Two molecules of DhaL are complexed to one DhaM dimer (Fig. 2A). The structure of the DhaM subunit has been described above, that of the homologous E. coli DhaL subunit before (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Oberholzer A.E. Schneider P. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In summary, DhaL is an eight-helix barrel of regular up-down topology and slightly conical shape. The ADP cofactor is complexed to the narrower end of the barrel. The phosphates are coordinated by two Mg2+ ions, which in turn are anchored to the protein scaffold by three aspartates in the loop connecting helices 1 and 2 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Structur of the L. lactis DhaM·DhaL transient complex. A, the DhaM subunit A is green, B is yellow, and DhaL is cyan colored. Each DhaL subunit interacts with both DhaM subunits. The active site His-10 of DhaM and ADP bound to DhaL are shown as black sticks. Magnesium ions are shown as red spheres. B, the DhaM·DhaL contact interface. Top: T-shaped aromatic-aromatic interaction between Tyr-97B of DhaM (yellow) and Tyr-164 of DhaL (cyan), and hydrogen bond between Tyr-97B and the active site Arg-161 of DhaL. Center: catalytic dyad between Asp-66A and His-10A of DhaM (green). There is a 4.9-Å gap between Nϵ2 of His-10A and theβ-phosphate oxygen of the ADP. Bottom: intersubunit salt bridges between DhaMA and DhaL: Glu-79A to Lys-113 and Arg-114, and Glu-75A to Lys-116. Shown in red are Asp-29, Asp-34, and Asp-36 of DhaL, which coordinate the two magnesium ions. C, superposition of free DhaM and DhaM complexed with DhaL. The formation of the salt bridges between DhaMA (green) and DhaL (cyan) results in a slight anticlockwise rotation of helix α3 relative to its orientation in free DhaM (red). Compare the orientation of the α3 side chains involved in salt bridges (green) and free form (red). At the same time, Arg-161 of DhaL pushes Tyr-97 of DhaMB (yellow) toward Tyr-164 of DhaL, thereby reducing the edge to plane stacking distance from 4.7 Å to 3.6 Å. D, Fo - Fc omit map of the DhaM·DhaL transient complex contoured at 3 σ. The ADP cofactor (black sticks)inthe anti-conformation fits into the electron density, whereas an ADP in syn-conformation shown for comparison (transparent gold sticks) does not. The anti-conformation of the adenine ring might be fixed by the hydrogen bonding network (black dotted lines) of a crystal water molecule (yellow sphere). Images were prepared with PyMOL (W. L. DeLano (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The orientation of DhaM and DhaL in the complex is conducive to phosphoryl transfer between His-10 of DhaM and ADP of DhaL. The distance between the imidazole Nϵ2 and the β-phosphate oxygen is 4.9 Å (Fig. 2B), allowing enough space for a γ-phosphate that is missing in the model (the complex is formed of non-phosphorylated DhaM and DhaL complexed with ADP). This distance is only 30! more than the experimentally determined distance of the pentacoordinate phosphate observed in phosphoglucomutase near the transition state (23Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Science. 2003; 299: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the physiological state of the complex is Arg-161 of DhaL. Reaching from the lid (loop between helices 7 and 8) into the empty space, Arg-161 is appropriately positioned to stabilize the putative trigonal bipyramidal transition state of the γ-phosphate. This Arg is invariant in all DhaL sequences and is part of the strongly conserved “signature sequence” GRAsYXGERsiG.The total buried surface area is 1953 Å2 per DhaM·DhaL binding site of which 566 Å2 and 383 Å2 are from DhaM subunit A (contributing the active site His-10) and B, and 1003 Å2 from DhaL. About 50! of the total interaction surface is contributed by hydrophobic residues located at the center of the interface around the phosphotransfer site, His-10 of DhaMA and the ADP cofactor of DhaL. Salt bridges are formed between Asp-75A and Glu-79A of DhaM and Lys-113, Arg-114, and Lys-116 of DhaL (Fig. 2B). A prominent hydrogen bond is formed between the hydroxyl group of Tyr-97B of DhaM and Arg-161 of DhaL, the Arg that is being implicated in transition state stabilization of the γ-phosphate. Tyr-97B of DhaM in addition forms a T-shaped aromatic-aromatic interaction with Tyr-164 of DhaL (24Chelli R. Gervasio F.L. Procacci P. Schettino V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6133-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). A comparison with homologous DhaM and DhaL sequences reveals strong conservation of the acidic residues 75 and 79 of DhaM and the basic residues 113, 114, and 116 of DhaL, suggesting that these interactions may play an important role in orienting the subunits. The tyrosines also are strongly conserved in DhaM and invariant in the signature sequence GRAsYXGERsiG of DhaL.DhaL of L. lactis and E. coli (PDB code 2BTD) display 35! sequence identity, a Z-score of 30.1, and an r.m.s.d. of 1.5 Å for 209 Cα atoms (17Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The only obvious difference between the two DhaLs is the glycosidic bond rotational isomer of the adenosine, anti in L. lactis and syn in E. coli (Fig. 2D). The reason for this difference is not clear. There is one hydrogen bond between the purine N6 and the Gly-119 carbonyl, which is invariant in both conformations and therefore unlikely to determine it. However, a water molecule bridging the purine ring and the protein backbone could tip the balance toward the anti conformation (Fig. 2D). It has been reported that about one-third of the purine nucleoside analogues in the Cambridge data bank are syn isomers, indicating that the free energy difference between the two conformations is quite small (26Bressi J.C. Choe J. Hough M.T. Buckner F.S. Van Voorhis W.C. Verlinde C.L. Hol W.G. Gelb M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4135-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Functional Characterization of the L. lactis Dha Kinase and of the DhaM·DhaL Active Site Mutants—The L. lactis Dha kinase utilizes PEP as a source of high energy phosphate. The phosphoryl group is transferred from PEP through EI, HPr, and DhaM to ADP of DhaL, and hence to Dha bound to the DhaK subunit. DhaL of L. lactis and E. coli have similar phosphotransferase activities. In contrast, the activity of L. lactis DhaK is 800-fold lower than of the orthologous E. coli DhaK (supplemental Fig. S1B), although the apparent binding constants for Dha are the same range (supplemental Fig. S2). A search for a better substrate, such as a C4 and C5 aldose/ketose, was unsuccessful. Only d-glyceraldehyde turned out to be a moderately competitive substrate (results not shown). DhaL and DhaM do not form a stable complex in solution. The Dha kinase activity is proportional to the product of the DhaM and DhaL concentrations suggesting that the rate of phosphoryl transfer is diffusion-controlled. The Kd of the complex is unknown, but was found to be 30 μm in a comparable “complex” between HPr and EIIAMan (27Williams Jr., D.C. Cai M. Suh J.Y. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20775-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).To evaluate the importance of the ionic and aromatic-aromatic interactions for Dha kinase function, the activities of the wild-type and mutant DhaM·DhaL 1:1 complexes were assayed in the presence of E. coli DhaK (supplemental Fig. S1A). Wild-type DhaM and DhaL were used as the positive control, a combination of wild-type DhaM with DhaL R161A as the negative one. The results are summarized in Table 1. The missing activity of the DhaL R161A mutant confirms that this invariant residue indeed is functionally important and might stabilize the transition state of the ATP γ-phosphate. The disruption of the ionic interaction between DhaM Glu-79 and DhaL Arg-114 by exchange of one or both charged residues with an alanine reduced the activity 3-fold. Inverting putative Coulomb attraction into repulsion has a stronger effect. DhaM E79R paired with wild-type DhaL has <25! of control activity, and wild-type DhaM paired with DhaL R114E is inactive. The T-shaped aromatic-aromatic interaction between DhaM Tyr-97 and DhaL Tyr-164 appears to be important, too. The DhaM Y97A mutant is inactive and the DhaL Y164A mutant retains only 4! activity. A possible explanation for this difference is that Tyr-97 of DhaM strikes an intersubunit hydrogen bond to the invariant active site Arg-161 of DhaL, whereas Tyr-164 is partly surface-exposed and probably less constrained.TABLE 1Dha kinase activity of DhaM·DhaL with mutations at the subunit contact interface kcat values ar"

Proteases regulate processes as diverse as apoptosis, blood clotting, angiogenesis, embryogenesis, and inflammation. Furthermore, proteolytic activity shapes the most distinctive and devastating feature of invasive cancers: their ability to break the boundaries of intact tissue structures and form colonies at a distance from their origin (1Ludwig T.

The most obvious mediators of such localized proteolytic activity are the transmembrane- and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane type (MT) MMPs (10Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J.

Because MMPs have broadly overlapping substrate targets, most MMP knockout mice display no dramatic phenotypes (4Ludwig T. Kumar C. Nanomaterials for Cancer Diagnosis. ed.

The majority of MMPs and most other proteases are secreted as inactive pro-enzymes that undergo limited proteolysis for their activation. MT1-MMP is activated intracellularly and has the potential to activate other proteases such as MMP-2 on the cell surface. This makes it an important trigger of proteolytic cascades. In general, the activity of MT1-MMP is closely controlled post-translationally by its activation, inactivation, various endogenous inhibitors, oligomerization, protein trafficking, and glycosylation (4Ludwig T. Kumar C. Nanomaterials for Cancer Diagnosis. ed. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., New York2006Google Scholar). It is this last mechanism that has most recently received major attention (4Ludwig T. Kumar C.

Unglycosylated mutants retained the ability to degrade collagen-I and induce autocleavage but lost the important ability to activate pro-MMP-2 (18Shaw L.M. Methods Mol.

The information about the molecular and cellular processes that regulate the O-linked glycosylation of proteins is limited. Consequently, no cellular mechanisms that are involved in the generation of distinctive glycosylation species of MT1-MMP have been identified until now. We hypothesized in this context that a mutual interdependency exists between MT1-MMP trafficking and glycosylation. The function for the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP in determining this protein's subcellular trafficking has been well established (for example see Refs. 20Lehti K. Valtanen H. Wickstrom S. Lohi J.

A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail's dileucine motif LL572 also influences the O-glycosylation pattern of MT1-MMP. This influence appears to be independent of major effects on MT1-MMP distribution, as demonstrated by metabolic pulse-chase experiments and assessments of steady-state surface expression levels. In addition, a comprehensive model for the sequential, post-translational processing of MT1-MMP is elaborated and presented. General Reagents—Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sequence Analysis of MT1-MMP—The amino acid sequence of MT1-MMP was obtained from Swiss-Prot (P50281). Protein alignment and identification of domains were performed on the T-coffee server (www.ch.embnet.org/software/Tcoffee.html). The prediction of O- and N-glycosylation sites was performed by analyzing the full-length sequences on the NetOGlyc 3.1 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc) and NetNGlyc 1.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) server (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark) (23Julenius K. Molgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The prediction of N-glycosylation sites was based on identification of Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr consensus sequences. DNA Constructs—cDNAs of FLAG-tagged (FL), human MT1-MMP constructs were kindly provided by the laboratory of Prof. Motoharu Seiki (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) (24Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced between residues Gly501 and Gly502 in the stalk (linker-2) region of all FL-tagged MT1-MMP constructs (Fig. 1a) by a two-step overlapping PCR strategy, followed by subcloning XhoI/FseI digestion fragments into the MT1-MMP FL constructs. In short, the first step of the PCR yielded two fragments from separate PCR reactions that covered the complete coding sequence of WT MT1-MMP, with the HA tag in the overlapping region. In the second step, both fragments were combined and served as templates to generate the complete cDNA carrying the HA tag. The outer primers in this strategy were 5′-TAGTAGATGTCTCCCGCCCCAAGACCCCCCCG-3′ and 5′-GATGATTCAGACCTTGTCCAGCAGGGAACGC-3′. The inner primers were 5′-AGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTATCCCGATGGGCAGCCCATCC-3′ and 5′-TACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGGCCGGCCGGATGAGGGGACTGAGG-3′. Prior to XhoI and FseI digestion, the final PCR product was gel-purified and cloned into the pCRIITopo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Point mutations were introduced by PCR with site-directed mutagenesis using mismatch primers. The primers were 5′-GGTGGCTGTGCACGCGCTGGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCAGCGCGTGCACAGCCACC-3′ for E240A; 5′-ACCCCCAGGCGAGCGGCCTACTGCCAGCGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAACGCTGGCAGTAGGCCGCTCGCCTGGGGGT-3′ for LL571/572AA (LeuLeu571/572 to Ala); 5′-GCGACTGCTCGCCTGCCAGCGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAACGCTGGCAGGCGAGCAGTCGC-3′ for Y573A; 5′-CGACTGCTCTACGCCCAGCGTTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAACGCTGGGCGTAGAGCAGTCG-3′ for C574A; 5′-TTCCCCGCTAAGATGCCCCCTCAACCCAGGGCTGCTGCTCGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGAGCAGCAGCCCTGGGTTGAGGGGGCATCTTAGCGGGGAA-3′ for CHO-4 (Thr291/Thr299/Thr300/Ser301 to Ala); 5′-GCTGCTGCTCGGCCTGCTGTTCC-3′ and 3′-GGAACAGCAGGCCGAGCAGCAGC-5′ for CHO-5 (Thr291/Thr299/Thr300/Ser301/Ser304 to Ala). The CHO-4 construct served as the template for the CHO-5 construct. Correctness of all DNA constructs was confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing. Tissue Culture—Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. COS cells were grown in flasks under standard conditions (37 °C and 5! CO2) in minimal essential medium supplemented with l-glutamine (GlutaMAX), 10! fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. Procedures for cDNA Transfection and Sample Preparation—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected at 85–90! confluency 24 h after seeding. Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfections according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise noted, cells were lysed 24 h after transfection according to the following protocol. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) before the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with 1! Triton X-100, pH 7.5) per well, containing a 2× final concentration of complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets with EDTA (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). Cells were scraped from the wells and rocked on ice for 45 min. Cells lysates were cleared by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). 10-μl aliquots of cell lysates were mixed with reducing, 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (350 mm Tris-HCl, 10! (w/v) SDS, 30! (v/v) glycerol, 600 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01! (w/v) bromphenol blue; pH 6.8) and heated (10 min and 56 °C). SDS-PAGE, Western Blot Analysis, and Antibodies—Standard protocols for Western blot analysis have been described elsewhere (25Roush D.L. Gottardi C.J. Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, Western blots were blocked with 5! dry milk in TBS-T and incubated overnight with a mouse anti-β actin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (ab6276, Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA; 1:4000), anti-HA mAb (MMS-101R, Covance, Berkeley, CA; 1:1000), anti-MT1-MMP hinge region rAb (AB815; Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1:2500) or anti-FLAG (M2) mAb (F1804; Sigma; 1:500). Lectin Precipitation Assay—Cells were transfected with double tagged MT1-MMP constructs and lysed according to the protocol described above. For lectin precipitation, 900 μl of cell lysate were preincubated with 25 μg of biotinylated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) or biotinylated, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 4 h at 4 °C before 60 μl of a washed 50! slurry of streptavidin conjugated beads (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) were added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C on a rotating platform, beads were washed five times in 1! Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Proteins were released by adding 2× sample buffer and heating (10 min and 56 °C). Blots of WGA precipitates were incubated with anti-HA mAb. Western blots of lysate samples were incubated with anti-HA, anti-FL, and anti-β-actin mAb. Direct Metabolic Labeling of GalNAc—The basic principle and chemistry of the metabolic in vivo labeling of O-linked glycosides by bioorthogonal chemical tags have been described elsewhere in detail (26Laughlin S.T. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2930-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Vocadlo D.J. Hang H.C. Kim E.J. Hanover J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The method is based on the metabolic incorporation of an azide modified sugar, here 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-N-azidoacetyl-α,β-d-galactosamine (Ac4-GalNAz), into protein glycan structures. The glycoproteins which have incorporated the modified sugar are detected by the specific reaction of the azide modified sugar with an alkyne. In brief, COS cells were transfected with double tagged MT1-MMP constructs and incubated for 48 h under tissue culture conditions at a 40 μm final concentration of Ac4-GalNAz (C33365, Invitrogen). Cells were lysed according to the protocol described above, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb (compare below). Proteins were released by boiling (5 min at 95 °C) the protein A beads (Pierce) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1! SDS. Covalent binding of glycoside incorporated Ac4-GalNAz to 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) alkyne (C33370, Invitrogen) followed by protein precipitation by methanol and chloroform was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. TAMRA fluorescence was detected in the polyacrylamide gels with a UV-light source and a charge-coupled device camera system with an ethidium bromide filter set (Gel iX Imager, Intas Science Imaging Instruments GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). Cell-surface Biotinylation—Protocols and standard procedures for cell-surface protein biotinylation have been described previously (29Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, manipulations were performed on a rocking platform at 4 °C with ice-cold reagents and buffers. Cell-surface biotinylation was carried out 24 h after transfection of cells in 6 well with double tagged MT1-MMP constructs. Cells were washed twice with PBS and once with biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, 125 mm NaCl, pH 8.9). 1 ml of biotinylation buffer supplemented with 2.5 mm sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (EZ-Link, Pierce) was added twice per well for incubations of 25 min each. Cells were washed twice for 5 min with PBS supplemented with 100 mm glycine and once with PBS before they were lysed. Biotinylated proteins were captured with streptavidin beads (see protocol for the lectin precipitation assay). Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were prepared according to the procedures described for the lectin precipitation assay. For immunoprecipitations, cells were transfected with MT1-MMP constructs. 15μg of anti-HA mAb (MMS-101R, Covance, Berkeley, CA) were added to the cleared lysates. Immobilized protein A beads (Pierce) were washed, blocked with 3! bovine serum albumin in lysis buffer for 4 h and washed again prior to the addition of 50 μl of a 50! slurry of these beads to each preincubated lysate-Ab mix. Enzymatic Desialylation—Enzymatic desialylation with sialidase A (GK80040, Prozyme Inc., San Leandro, CA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In short, transfected cells were lysed, and 10 μl of lysate was mixed and incubated with 3 μl of 5× reaction buffer and 2 μl of sialidase A (activity > 5 units/ml) or solvent control for 12 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 6× reducing sample buffer and heating (10 min for 56 °C). Samples were immunoblotted with anti-HA mAb. Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-chase Experiments—Experiments were performed according to the procedures described elsewhere (30Caplan M.J. Forbush III, B. Palade G.E. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3528-3534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, COS cells were transfected with double tagged MT1-MMP constructs. 24 h after transfection, COS cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in depletion media (serum, methionine, and cysteine-free minimal essential medium) before pulse labeling with 150μCi of l-[35S]methionine/cysteine in 1 ml of depletion medium per 35-mm dish for 25 min at 37 °C. Cells were placed on ice after 30 min and washed twice with ice-cold chase media (minimal essential medium supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum and 10 mm l-methionine and 10 mm l-cysteine, pH 7.4, at 5! CO2). Cells were then switched back to 37 °C and incubated with chase media. After the time intervals indicated in Fig. 5, individual dishes were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb. Lysates of untransfected cells and lysates of transfected cells without addition of precipitating Ab were used as controls (Fig. 5). Sequence and Glycosylation Analysis of MT1-MMP—To generate a glycosylation-defective CHO mutant of MT1-MMP that could be used as an appropriate control for lectin precipitation assays, ezymatic dessialylation, and pulse-chase experiments, the glycosylated residues of MT1-MMP first had to be identified. Analysis of potential N-glycosylation sites in MT1-MMP with the NetNGlyc server software revealed the absence of the canonical Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr N-glycosylation sequence, indicating that this protein cannot be subject to this post-translational modification. The prediction of O-glycosylated residues is less straightforward, because no consensus recognition sequence is known for O-glycosyltransferases (23Julenius K. Molgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Five residues were predicted by the trained neural network of the NetOGlyc server as potential sites for O-glycosylation (Fig. 1b). All residues are within the small hinge domain, which connects the large catalytic and hemopexin domains. The prediction identifies 76! of glycosylated and 93! of non-glycosylated residues correctly (23Julenius K. Molgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Consequently, the possibility of a false-positive prediction of a glycosylated residue is higher than missing one. If the G-score (the score from the best general predictor) of a residue is above the threshold of 0.5, it is predicted to be glycosylated. The confidence of the prediction increases with the score. Five residues of MT1-MMP received scores above 0.5 (Thr291, Thr299, Thr300, Ser301, and Ser304), however, one of these residues (Ser304) had a G-score of only 0.508 (Fig. 1b). To examine the potential glycosylation status of these residues two mutant constructs, CHO-4 and CHO-5, were prepared. CHO-5 includes all of the mutations present in CHO-4 (T291A, T299A, T300A, S301A) as well as the mutation S304A (Fig. 1b). Because the electrophoretic mobilities of the MT1-MMP putative glycosylation mutants CHO-4 and CHO-5 did not differ from one another (Fig. 2a) we conclude that Ser304 is not glycosylated. Furthermore, although enzymatic deglycosylation produces a dramatic shift in the electrophoretic mobility of wild-type MT1-MMP (Fig. 2d), no such shift was observed after the enzymatic deglycosylation of CHO-4 (Fig. 2b), demonstrating that the mutations incorporated into CHO-4 are sufficient to abrogate O-glycosylation of the MT1-MMP protein. Accordingly, CHO-4 was used for all subsequent experiments. Expression of MT1-MMP and Glycosylation Analysis of Its Metabolites—The extensive post-translational processing of MT1-MMP produces a diversity of discrete metabolites. It was critical for our study to distinguish the protein's glycosylated and unglycosylated species. The location of the HA tag close in the protein's sequence to its single transmembrane-spanning segment permits the detection of all membrane-tethered metabolites. Western blot analysis (with an anti-HA Ab) displays a distinct expression pattern of HA-tagged CHO-4 and WT MT1-MMP expressed in COS cells. Both proteins comprise several metabolites, of which they share only one with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa (Fig. 2c). Besides the common 63-kDa protein, expression of the CHO-mutant generates additional bands of 53 and two bands of ∼34 kDa, whereas the WT protein's other metabolites have apparent molecular masses of ∼69, 57, and 44 kDa (Fig. 2, c and d). Because enzymatic deglycosylation is expected to alter only the electrophoretic mobility of glycosylated proteins, we conclude that any of the multiple forms of MT1-MMP that exhibit a change in apparent molecular mass after sialidase A treatment possess sialic acid-containing glycosylation. Based upon this criterion, all of the MT1-MMP forms (Fig. 2d, arrows 1, 3, and 4) detected except for the 63-kDa protein (Fig. 2d, arrow 2) are glycosylated. Accordingly, we suggest that the 63-kDa protein is the biosynthetic precursor from which all of the glycosylated protein species must be derived. This hypothesis is explored further in the pulse-chase analysis presented below and in Fig. 5. Autocleavage of MT1-MMP—Expression of the wild-type MT1-MMP protein in COS cells results in the appearance of a glycosylated 44-kDa metabolite that is likely to be the product of autocatalytic cleavage (Fig. 2, c and d). The catalytically inactive MT1-MMP construct E240A was used to rule out a possible role of endogenously expressed COS cell proteases in this proteolytic cleavage of MT1-MMP (Fig. 3a). Because expression of E240A did not result in the generation of a membrane-tethered 44-kDa product, we conclude that this product is generated by self-proteolysis. It has been suggested that glycosylation exerts a major effect on the self-proteolysis of MT1-MMP (31Remacle A.G. Chekanov A.V. Golubkov V.S. Savinov A.Y. Rozanov D.V. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16897-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This conclusion was mainly based on the observation that the prevalence of the 44-kDa autocleavage product increased after inhibition of O-glycosylation in cells by a synthetic inhibitor (31Remacle A.G. Chekanov A.V. Golubkov V.S. Savinov A.Y. Rozanov D.V. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16897-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In our hands, the MT1-MMP WT and the glycosylation-defective mutant CHO-4 proteins yielded similar amounts of autocleavage product, when the anti-HA-Ab was used for detection (Figs. 2c,4e, and 6a). In contrast, results obtained utilizing the anti-hinge domain Ab (AB815, Chemicon), which has been used in previous studies for immunoblotting, suggested enhanced generation of self-cleavage product in CHO-4 compared with WT (arrow, Fig. 3b). Interestingly, enzymatic desialylation of MT1-MMP WT in vitro also considerably increased the detection of the autocleavage product with the anti-hinge domain Ab (arrow, Fig. 3c). Because MT1-MMP activity was blocked during the in vitro desialylation, this increase cannot be attributed to enhanced autocleavage induced by desialylation. Instead, we conclude that the affinity of the anti-hinge region antibody varies dramatically with the glycosylation status of this domain.FIGURE 6Sequential processing of MT1-MMP. a, schematic model based on data from enzymatic desialylation, site-directed mutagenesis, and metabolic pulse-chase experiments of MT1-MMP. b, Western blot analysis of MT1-MMP WT and its carbohydrate-deficient CHO-4 mutant expressed in COS.

Signal-induced interaction of the IKKγ (NEMO) subunit with the C-terminal IKKγ/NEMO-binding domain (γBD) of IKKβ is an essential interaction for IKK regulation. Underlying regulatory mechanism(s) of this interaction are not known. Phosphorylation of γBD has been suggested to play a regulatory role for IKK activation. However, a kinase that phosphorylates γBD has not been identified. In this study, we used a C-terminal fragment of IKKβ as substrate and purified Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) from HeLa cell extracts by standard chromatography as a γBD kinase. Plk1 phosphorylates serines 733, 740, and 750 in the γBD of IKKβ in vitro. Phosphorylating γBD with Plk1 decreased its affinity for IKKγ in pulldown assay. We generated phosphoantibodies against serine 740 and showed that γBD is phosphorylated in vivo. Expressing a constitutively active Plk1 in mammalian cells reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced IKK activation, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of endogenous IκBα and reduced NF-κB activation. To activate endogenous Plk1, cells were treated with nocodazole, which reduced TNF-induced IKK activation, and increased the phosphorylation of γBD. Knocking down Plk1 in mammalian cells restored TNF-induced IKK activation in nocodazole-treated cells. Activation of Plk1 inhibited TNF-induced expression of cyclin D1. In cells in which Plk1 was knocked down, TNFα increased expression of cyclin D1 and the proportion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, this study shows that phosphorylation regulates the interaction of γBD of IKKβ with IKKγ and therefore plays a critical role for IKK activation. Moreover, we identify Plk1 as a γBD kinase, which negatively regulates TNF-induced IKK activation and cyclin D1 expression, thereby affecting cell cycle regulation. Untimely activation of cyclin D1 by TNFα can provide a potential mechanism for an involvement of TNFα in inflammation-induced cancer. IκB kinase (IKK) complex is a key regulator of NF-κB pathways.

Additional IKK-related proteins have been identified, but it does not appear that they are associated with IKK. Native IKK is found in large protein complexes ranging from 600 to 900 kDa (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

The kinase domain of IKKα and IKKβ contains the signature domain of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and the corresponding activation T loop sequences (6Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The T loop phospho-acceptor sites, serines 176 and 180 in IKKα and serines 177 and 181 in IKKβ, are phosphorylated by kinases such as NIK, DNA-PK, NAK, and LKB (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). The T loop serines can also be autophosphorylated within the IKK complex in an IKKγ-dependent manner in the reconstituted IKK complex in yeast (8Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of IKKβ has been implicated in the regulation of the IKK complex. Delhase et al. (18Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) showed that the C terminus of IKKβ is phosphorylated in vivo on several serine residues, and this phosphorylation increases upon cell stimulation by TNFα. They further showed that expression of an IKKβ mutant in which 10 serines immediately adjacent to the HLH (not including the serines within and adjacent to the γBD) are mutated to alanine in HeLa cells generates IKK complexes with prolonged activation kinetics (18Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). This suggested that TNF-induced phosphorylation of the C terminus of IKKβ is important for down-regulation of IKK (18Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). May et al. (19May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that mutating a serine residue in the γBD (Ser-740) to glutamate reduced inducibility of the IKK complex by TNFα. In recent work, using the IKK complex reconstituted in yeast and the MEFβ–/– system, we showed that the 10 serines immediately adjacent to HLH are indeed autophosphorylated within the complex, and their phosphorylation did not prolong activation kinetics of the IKK complex in a null background of IKKβ in MEF (20Schomer-Miller B. Higashimoto T. Lee Y.K. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15268-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using the yeast system and MEFβ–/–, we also showed that mimicking phosphorylation of serine 740 within γBD and serine 750 in IKKβ significantly reduced IKKγ-induced activation of the IKK complex (20Schomer-Miller B. Higashimoto T. Lee Y.K. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15268-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation events at the C terminus of IKKβ can be divided into the autophosphorylation of the 10 serines adjacent to the HLH domain and phosphorylation of the serines within and adjacent to the γBD. This conclusion is consistent with the May et al. findings (19May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and suggests that phosphorylation of the γBD may play a role in signal-induced IKK regulation. A third region of IKKβ that plays an essential role in signal-induced IKK regulation is the γBD (also called NEMO binding domain) (8Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that a small conserved region containing the hexapeptide, LDWSWL, in the C terminus of IKKα and IKKβ is a site of interaction for IKKγ (γBD) and is critical for the activation of IKK by TNFα (19May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). It is important to note that γBD is the immediate C terminus of the 10 serines discussed above. Mutating serines 740 (within the γBD) and 750 (C-terminal to γBD) to glutamic acid significantly reduced activation of the IKK complex in an IKKγ-dependent manner in mammalian cells and in reconstituted IKK in yeast (8Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol.

This indicates that phosphorylation of the γBD and the adjacent serine 750 may play a role in IKK regulation. Recently, the co-crystal structure of the C terminus of IKKβ with the N terminus of IKKγ (NEMO) was solved, and it shows that phosphorylation of serine 740 could play an important role in determining the affinity of the interaction (22Rushe M. Silvian L. Bixler S. Chen L.L. Cheung A. Bowes S. Cuervo H. Berkowitz S. Zheng T. Guckian K. Pellegrini M. Lugovskoy A. Structure (Lond.). 2008; 16: 798-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study we identify Plk1 as a γBD kinase, which negatively regulates IKK and inhibits TNF-induced expression of cyclin D1. We show that serine 740 of IKKβ is indeed phosphorylated in vivo, and it regulates the interaction of γBD of IKKβ with IKKγ, and therefore plays a critical role for IKK activation. The mechanism of inhibition of IKK by Plk1 provides a paradigm for how phosphorylation of γBD of IKKβ is involved in regulation of the IKK complex. Cell Culture, Cell Transfection, and siRNA—COS-7 and HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10! fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C, 5! CO2. 1 × 106 cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate for transfection using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cell transfection for siRNAs was done using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Wang L.C. Okitsu C.Y. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7634-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The sequence of three sense and antisense oligonucleotides targeting three different regions of human Plk1 are as follows: Plk1 number 1, sense (5′-GAUCACCCUCCUUAAAUAUTT) and antisense (5′-AUAUUUAAGGAGGGUGAUCTT); Plk1 number 2, sense (5′-CAACCAAAGUCGAAUAUGATT) and antisense (5′-UCAUAUUCGACUUUGGUUGTT); and Plk1 number 3, sense (5′-AGACCUACCUCCGGAUCAATT) and antisense (5′-UUGAUCCGGAGGUAGGUCUTT). Cells were stimulated 48 h after transfection with 20 ng/ml TNFα or 10 ng/ml IL-1β unless otherwise stated. After stimulation, media were removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, pH 7.6, containing the following: 1× all purpose buffer, 1! Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris, 40 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm metabisulfite, 10 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10! glycerol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 8.5 μg/ml bestatin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 13 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 2 mm DTT. Purification and Identification of Polo-like Kinase 1—HeLa S3 cells were grown in suspension at the Norris Cancer Center Tissue Culture and Reagent Core. Untreated or TNFα (20 ng/ml for 10 min)-treated cells (for each case about 1010 cells) were harvested, and lysates in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 19 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 500 μm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10! glycerol, pH 7.6) were supplemented with 2 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml bestatin, and 150 mm NaCl as described previously (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The S-100 fractions were purified over a 70-ml Q-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with buffer A, the column was eluted with a linear 0.15–1 m NaCl gradient using buffer B (buffer A plus 1 m NaCl). Flowthrough fractions were pooled and applied to a HiPrep 16/10 heparin FF column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with buffer A, the column was eluted with a linear 0.15–1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions with peak kinase activity were pooled and diluted 1:4 in buffer A and applied to 25 ml of CM-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column. After the column was washed with buffer A, the column was eluted with a linear 0.1–1 m NaCl gradient. Peak fractions containing kinase activity were diluted 1:4 in phosphate buffer with 50 mm NaCl and 10! glycerol and loaded onto a 5-ml poly(U)-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column and washed with phosphate buffer with 50 mm NaCl and 10! glycerol. The column was eluted isocratically with phosphate buffer containing 570 mm NaCl and 10! glycerol. Fractions with kinase activity were pooled, diluted 1:4 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, and applied to a 1-ml substrate affinity column consisting of His-Myc-3SC-WT cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 10! glycerol, and proteins were eluted with a linear 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Mass Spectrometry Identification of Plk1 and PAK4—Because the fraction containing the peak Plk activity from the substrate affinity column contained many polypeptides (see Fig. 1E), proteins were digested in solution by trypsin, and the peptides were identified by an on-line reverse phase chromatography with mass spectrometry at the Stanford Mass Spectrometry Core. Two protein kinases Plk1 and PAK4 were among the top 50 identified proteins. Plasmid Construction and Expression of IKKβ C-terminal Fragments—The C-terminal fragments, with or without the HLH region, of wild type and different serine to alanine mutants (see Fig. 1A for the position of mutations) of IKKβ were amplified by PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-Hel-N1 using NcoI and NotI cloning sites (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). In this vector, all constructs were fused in-frame at their C terminus to six histidines and a Myc epitope. The fragments with the HLH domain contain IKKβ amino acid 588 to its C terminus. The 3SC fragments (lacking the HLH region) contain IKKβ amino acid 660 to its C-terminal end. IKKβ wild type and IKKβM10 (18Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) were used as PCR templates. The following PCR primers were used for the amplification of the HLH wild type and M10 mutant: forward primer p1 5′-AAACCATGGTTCAGAGCTTCGAGAAGAAAGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGCGGCCGCTGAGGCCTGCTCCAGGCAGCT-3′. To generate HLH-cS14A, cS12A, cS10L2A, and L3SA (Fig. 1A), IKKβM10 was used as template and amplified with forward primer p1 in combination with reverse primers containing the corresponding serine to alanine mutations. The reverse primers are as follows: HLH-cS14A, 5′-AAGCGGCCGCTGCGGCCTGCTCCAGGCAGGCGTGCTCTTCTTCTTCCGTCTGTAACCAGGCCCAGTCTAGGGCCGTGAAAGCCTGGT-3′; HLH-cS12A, AAGCGGCCGCTGAGGCCTGCTCCAGGCAGCTGTGCTCTTCTTCTTCCGTCTGTAACCAGGCCCAGTCTAGGGCCGTGAAAGCCTGGT-3′; HLH-cS10L2A, AAGCGGCCGCTGCGGCCTGCTCCAGGCAGGCGTGCTCTTCTTCTTCCGTCTGTAACCAGCTCCAGTCTAGGGCCGTGAAACTCTGGT-3′; HLH-L3SA, AAGCGGCCGCTGAGGCCTGCTCCAGGCAGGCGTGCTCTTCTTCTTCCGTCTGTAACCAGGCCCAGTCTAGGGCCGTGAAAGCCTGGT-3′. The underlined bases show the serine to alanine mutations. For amplification of the IKKβ C-terminal fragments lacking the HLH domain (3SC constructs), the forward primer 5′-AAACCATGGAGATTGCTTGTAGCAAGGTCCGT-3′ was combined with the same reverse primers used for HLH containing constructs. These fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified by nickel-nitrilotri-acetic acid-agarose chromatography (Qiagen). Cloning of plk1 and PAK4 and in Vitro Transcription/Translation—After identification of Plk1 (GenBank™ accession number U01038) and PAK4 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005884), their corresponding cDNAs were amplified by PCR from a HeLa cell library (25Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The following oligodeoxynucleotides were used to amplify Plk1 and PAK4: Plk1 forward primer, 5′-ATGGGTCATATGACTGCAGCGGTGACTG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTCTAGATTAGGAGGCCTTGAGAC-3′; PAK4, 5′-ATGGGTCATATGTTTGGGAAGAGGAAGAAGCGGGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTCTAGATCATCTGGTGCGGTTCTG-3′. Amplified inserts were cloned into pBluescript (Invitrogen) containing 3× HA tag using NdeI and XbaI sites (26Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). To generate a FLAG-tagged version of the Plk1, the HindIII and NdeI sites containing the 3× HA sequence were replaced with the oligodeoxynucleotides 5′-CGCCAAGCTTATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAGGGCATATGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCATATGCCCTTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCATAAGCTTGGCG-3′ that were annealed and digested with HindIII and NdeI. The Plk1-K82M (kinase-defective mutant (27Jang Y.J. Ma S. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44115-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)) was constructed by using the Plk1 forward primer (see above) and the reverse primer 5′-ATATTTCCATGGACATCTTCTCCCTCTGGTGCGGCTTGACCAGCAGAGACTTAGGCACAATCATCGGGC-3′, in which lysine 82 in Plk1 is mutated to methionine by PCR. The amplified fragment was cloned into pBS-FLAG-Plk1 digested with HindIII and NcoI. The Plk1-S137D (a constitutively active mutant) was generated by using the following primers 5′-CTGCCGCCGGAGGGACCTCCTGGAGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGCTCCAGGAGGTCCCTCCGGCGGCAG-3′. The Plk1-T210D was generated by using the following primers 5′-GAGAGGAAGAAGGACCTGTGTGGGACT-3′ and 5′-AGTCCCACACAGGTCCTTCTTCCTCTC-3′. pBS-FLAG-WT-Plk1 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using a similar method as described in the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mammalian expression vectors were constructed for the Plk1 wild type and mutants and PAK4 by subcloning the corresponding cDNAs into the pRC-β-actin (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar) and pRC-CMV (Invitrogen) vectors using HindIII and NotI restriction sites. The pBS-HA-WT-Plk1 and HA-PAK4 was used as template for in vitro transcription/translation using TnT (T3)-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Construction, Bacterial Expression, and Affinity Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion IKKβ—GST-IKKβ were constructed by digesting pRC/β-actin IKKβ wild type and S740A/S750A mutant by BstXI (New England Biolabs) and blunt ending the 5′ end. The 3′ end was digested with NotI (New England Biolabs). HA IKKβ insert was then cloned into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences) plasmid and was digested with SmaI and XbaII. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)psLys using 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were spun down and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1! (v/v) Triton X-100. Cells were sonicated and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 relative centrifugal force. Supernatant was incubated with GST-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted according to manufacturer's protocol. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cell lysates (50–100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal IKKγ (IKK kinase activity), goat polyclonal Plk1(for Plk1 activity) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), JNK1 (for JNK activity) (BD Biosciences), or monoclonal HA antibody (Tissue Culture and Reagent Core, University of Southern California) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer. The precipitates were washed once with lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer containing the following: 20 mm Tris and 20 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6. The precipitates were then incubated with kinase mixture containing 2 mm DTT, 20 mm ATP, 0.1 μCi of [32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C, and 4 μgofIKKβ 3SCWT (for Plk1 activity, unless otherwise noted), 2 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–54) (for IKK activity), or 2 μg of GST-c-JUN-(1–79) (for JNK1 activity) were used as substrates in the kinase reaction. The kinase reaction was quenched with 6× SDS containing loading dye, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected and analyzed by PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Generation of Phosphoantibody against γ-Binding Domain—Phosphoantibodies were generated in rabbit against phosphorylated EQDQSFTADWpSWLQTEE peptide using an outside vendor (Antagene Inc.). The nonphosphoantibodies were removed by passing the sera through the nonphosphorylated peptide affinity column. Phosphoantibodies were then purified and enriched on phosphopeptide affinity column. Western Blot—In general for most Western blots, 20 μgof cell lysates were loaded and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with the indicated antibodies. IKKβ (1:500 dilution) was purchased from Abgent (San Diego, CA). IKKα antibody (1:1000) was purchased from Pharmingen. HA and Myc antibodies (1:1000 dilution) were purchased from Tissue Culture and Reagent Core (University of Southern California, CA). Plk1 antibody (1:1000 dilution) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. β-Actin (1:10,000 dilution) and FLAG antibody (1:1000 dilution) were purchased from Sigma. IKKγ antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. IκBα and phospho-IκBα antibodies (1:1000 dilution) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). All Western blots were imaged and quantified using the Fluor-S max quantification system (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Whole cell lysates (4 μg) were incubated with labeled NF-κB or Oct-1 (octamer factor 1) oligonucleotides (25Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 28Zandi E. Tran T.N. Chamberlain W. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1299-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in gel shift mixture containing the following: 4! Ficoll-400, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 25 μg/ml single-stranded DNA. The complexes were resolved on a 6! native polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Luciferase Assay—The transcriptional activity of NF-κB was measured using the IL-8 luciferase reporter gene (5DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 25 ng of IL-8 luciferase, 25 ng of pRL-Renilla (Promega), and 25 ng of pRC/CMV FLAG-Plk1 constructs. COS-7 cells were transfected with 50 ng of IL-8 luciferase, 50 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega), and 50 ng of pRC/CMV FLAG-Plk1 constructs. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml of TNFα for 12 h and harvested. Effect of Plk1 expression on NF-κB transcriptional activity was determined by luciferase assay normalized by the expression of Renilla luciferase. Identification of Polo-like Kinase 1 as an IKKβ C-terminal Kinase—Studies from our laboratory and others (19May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol.

To test this hypothesis, we biochemically searched for a kinase activity in HeLa cell extracts that could phosphorylate the C terminus of IKKβ. We also asked whether such kinase activity is modulated by TNFα. We constructed bacterial expression vectors for t"

In addition to the availability of the appropriate receptors, intracellular ATP plays an important role in determining whether erythrocytes are suitable for merozoite invasion. Recent work has shown that ATP secreted from erythrocytes signals a number of cellular processes. To determine whether ATP signaling might be involved in merozoite invasion, we investigated whether known plasmodium invasion proteins contain nucleotide binding motifs. Domain mapping identified a putative nucleotide binding region within all members of the reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (RBL) family analyzed. A representative domain, termed here nucleotide binding domain 94 (NBD94), was expressed and demonstrated to specifically bind to ATP. Nucleotide affinities of NBD94 were determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, where an increase in the binding of ATP is observed compared with ADP analogues. ATP binding was reduced by the known F1F0-ATP synthase inhibitor 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. Fluorescence quenching and circular dichroism spectroscopy of NBD94 after binding of different nucleotides provide evidence for structural changes in this protein. Our data suggest that different structural changes induced by ATP/ADP binding to RBL could play an important role during the invasion process.

Malaria is caused by unicellular protozoan parasites and is considered to be one of the most important infectious diseases still affecting mankind today. The complex life cycle of the parasite is characterized by three invasive forms: the sporozoite and merozoite that invade hepatocytes and erythrocytes in the vertebrate host, respectively, and the ookinetes inside the insect vector that penetrates the mosquito midgut epithelium (1Huber M.

In general, the members of RBL are large transmembrane proteins with molecular masses above 200 kDa that get proteolytically cleaved during the invasion process (14Rayner J.C. Vargas-Serrato E.

In Plasmodium yoelii, members of the RBL termed Py235 (P. yoelii 235-kDa rhoptry protein) have been shown to be potential virulence factors that enable the parasite to invade a wider range of host erythrocytes (18Freeman R.R.

In addition, Py235 is also involved in clonal phenotypic variation of merozoites (21Preiser P.R. Jarra W. Capiod T. Snounou G. Nature. 1999; 398: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) enabling the parasite to evade immune responses and adapt to changes in the host environment during the invasion step (22Snounou G. Jarra W. Preiser P.R. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 28-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that variation in the amount of Py235 expressed in merozoites defines the host cell repertoire that a parasite can invade (20Iyer J.K. Amaladoss A. Ganesan S. Preiser P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Studies carried out on the RBLs of Plasmodium falciparum (PfRH1, -2a, -2b, -3, and -4) (10Duraisingh M.T.

Immun. 2002; 70: 5779-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have provided additional evidence that different RBL members interact with different receptors on the erythrocyte and that these interactions are crucial for invasion. Previously work in Plasmodium vivax has indicated that RBLs may have an initial sensing role preceding and possibly enabling the subsequent interaction of the erythrocyte binding ligand member with its corresponding receptor (25Galinski M.R. Barnwell J.W. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 20-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In a more recent study the erythrocyte binding region of PfRH1 and PfRH4 has been identified (26Gaur D. Singh S. Singh S. Jiang L. Diouf A. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17789-17794Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 71Gao X. Yeo K.P. Aw S.S. Kuss C. Iyer J.K. Genesan S. Rajamanonmani R. Lescar J. Bozdech Z. Preiser P.R. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000104Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), showing that only a relatively small region of these proteins is actually involved in receptor binding. Recognition of the appropriate receptor on the erythrocyte by RBL is expected to lead to downstream effects that ultimately enable the parasite to continue the invasion process. Although all the studies done on RBLs in the different Plasmodium species have highlighted the importance of this protein family, they have given us little insight in terms of the underlying biochemistry that allows RBL to mediate its function. This problem is due in part to the fact that the overall sequence conservation between the different members of the RBL family is very low and that no conserved domains have been identified so far that would indicate important functional regions within this class of proteins. reticulocyte-binding protein homologue nucleotide binding domain Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool dithiothreitol adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization/time-of-flight fluorescence correlation spectroscopy laser scanning microscopy 2′/3′-O-(2-aminoethylcarbamoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate 8-azido-3′-biotinyl adenosine 5′-triphosphate dichroic beam splitter emission filter 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole phosphate-binding loop reticulocyte-binding protein homologue nucleotide binding domain Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool dithiothreitol adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization/time-of-flight fluorescence correlation spectroscopy laser scanning microscopy 2′/3′-O-(2-aminoethylcarbamoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate 8-azido-3′-biotinyl adenosine 5′-triphosphate dichroic beam splitter emission filter 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole phosphate-binding loop Although the availability of erythrocyte surface proteins is a key step in the recognition and subsequent invasion by the merozoite it is not clear what and whether other factors are important for the invasion process. ATP released by erythrocytes under normal physiological conditions has recently been shown to serve as a signaling molecule regulating vascular tone (27Ellsworth M.L. Med. Sci.

These findings imply that merozoites can sense the intracellular ATP level of the erythrocyte. To explore this further, we investigated merozoite proteins that are thought to play a role in host cell recognition for the presence of putative nucleotide binding domains. Here a nucleotide binding domain that is highly conserved among the RBLs is described. We report for the first time the property of ATP/ADP binding of this expressed domain, termed nucleotide binding domain 94 (NBD94), independently observed by photoaffinity labeling and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Decreased tyrosine fluorescence and changes of circular dichroism spectra in the presence and absence of nucleotides are discussed in light of structural alterations in NBD94 and its possible role in serving as an ATP/ADP sensor during the invasion process. Biochemicals—P. yoelii YM frozen stabilates in liquid nitrogen were obtained from the National Institute of Medical Research. Pfu DNA polymerase and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Ni2+-Sepharose™ High Performance chromatography resin was obtained from GE Healthcare. Chemicals for gel electrophoresis were received from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were at least of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Amersham Biosciences, BIOMOL (Hamburg, Germany), and Merck. Bioinformatics—The nucleotide sequence data for the various Py235 members were obtained from PlasmoDB, Plasmodium genome resource, Version 4.4. PlasmoDB was also used to obtain nucleotide sequences of other Plasmodium erythrocyte- and reticulocyte-binding proteins. The protein sequences were then predicted based on the gene sequences obtained using PlasmoDB. Manipulation of nucleotide and protein sequences was carried out using Vector NTI and The Sequence Manipulation Suite. Alignment of these sequences was done using ClustalW (European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute). The protein sequences were further analyzed using Normal SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) program (36Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J.

Genomic DNA was extracted from infected blood using the Easy DNA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated DNA was stored at -20 °C. Cloning of the NBD94 Domain of PY01365 from P. yoelii—The predicted nucleotide binding domain of PY01365 (hereafter termed NBD94) was amplified using ∼100 ng of genomic YM DNA as a template and oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTGAGTCCATGGTATCTGACAAAAATGAATATG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AATTACGAGCTCTTAATCTTTACCATCTACAG-3′ (reverse primer). These primers were designed specially to include NcoI and SacI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. After digestion with NcoI and SacI, the PCR products were ligated into pET9d-His6 vector (39Grüber G. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Link T.A. Coskun Ü. Rizzo V.F. Betz C. Bailer S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the recombinant was then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells. Successful transformants were screened and verified by DNA sequencing. The correctly sequenced recombinant was then transformed into Rosetta-gami™(DE3) cells (Novagen) and grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression and Purification of NBD94—To express His6-NBD94, liquid cultures were incubated with agitation in LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C for about 3 h at 200 rpm until an A600 of 0.6–0.8 was reached. To induce the production of His6-NBD94, the cultures were supplemented with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and further incubated for another 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested at 8,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. These cells were then subsequently lysed on ice by sonication (Sonopuls HD2200, Bandelin, KE76, 20%) for 3 × 1 min in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 4 mm PefablocSC (BIOMOL), 0.7 mm DTT). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 35 min at 6 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm-pore size filter and added to the Ni-Sepharose™ resin. Binding of the His-tagged proteins to the matrix was carried out for 90 min at 4 °C, and proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (0–250 mm) in buffer A. Fractions containing His6-NBD94 were identified by SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), pooled, and applied on an ion exchanger (DEAE column HiPrep™ 16/10, GE Healthcare), which was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.7 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient with buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.7 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 3 ml/min. Following elution, concentration was carried out using Centriprep YM-50 (50-kDa cutoff) spin concentrators (Millipore), and the purity of the eluted protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The SDS gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Western blot analyses using mouse anti-penta-His (Qiagen) were performed as described previously (41Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured according to Heinonen and Lahti (42Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) and Chan et al. (43Chan K.M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) in which the spectrophotometric quantification of the phosphomolybdate-malachite green complex is used. Cloning, Production, and Purification of NBD94-(1–550)—A truncated version of the full-length NBD of PY01365 (hereafter termed NBD94-(1–550)) was cloned, expressed, and purified in a manner similar to that above with the following changes. The reverse primer used for amplification is 5′-AATTACGAGCTCTTAATCTGTTACATCTTCTAA-3′. The recombinant plasmid was eventually transformed in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and grown on LB agar plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. NBD94-(1–550) was purified using Ni2+-Sepharose followed by an ion exchanger as described for full-length NBD94 (see above). It was further purified via size exclusion chromatography using Superdex™ 75 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Measurements of steady state CD spectra were carried out in the far-UV light (185–260 nm) using a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics). The CD spectroscopy measurements of NBD94 and NBD94-(1–550) in Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 160 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm DTT and Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, respectively, were done using a 60-μl quartz cell (Hellma) at 18 °C with 1-nm step points. Independent of the presence or absence of nucleotides all samples were incubated for 15 min with rocking at 4 °C before the start of each measurement. The spectrum for the buffer was subtracted from the spectrum of the protein. The ellipticity values were calculated by the average of triple determinations for each sample with a bandwidth of 1 nm from 185 to 260 nm (1-nm step points). The CD data were converted to mean residue ellipticity (Θ) in units of degrees × dmol-1 × amino acid-1 using the software Chirascan version 1.2.1 (Applied Photophysics). Base line-corrected spectra were used as input for computer methods to obtain predictions of secondary structure. To analyze the CD spectrum the following algorithms were used: Varselec (44Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), Selcons (45Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal.

Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), and all methods as incorporated into the program Dicroprot (48Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar) and NeuralNet (49Böhm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity Labeling—Photoaffinity labeling was done as described by Schäfer et al. (50Schäfer H.J. Coskun Ü. Eger O. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Wieczorek H. Kagawa Y. Grüber G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein was incubated with 5 × 10-4 m 8-N3-3′-biotinyl-ATP and 5 × 10-4 m MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm DTT for 5 min on ice in the dark followed by irradiation with an ultraviolet lamp at 366 nm for 30 min on ice. The samples were applied on SDS-PAGE after which a Western immunoblot was carried out to identify the labeled (biotinylated) protein using streptavidin/peroxidase conjugate. The competition assay was also done concurrently with nucleotide analogues (ATP, ADP, and AMP-PNP). In-gel Tryptic Protein Digestion and Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The 8-N3-3′-biotinyl-ATP-labeled and unlabeled bands were cut out from the SDS-PAGE gel and destained with a solution of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile for 12 h. The gel band was cut into small pieces of 1 mm3, washed three times with acetonitrile, dried for 30 min in a speed vacuum concentrator, and digested with trypsin overnight (51Hong-Hermesdorf A. Brux A. Grüber A. Grüber G. Schumacher K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 52Roos M. Soskic V. Poznanovic S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 924-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry, aliquots of digested samples were applied to a target disk and allowed to air dry. Subsequently matrix solution (1% (w/v) α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and again allowed to dry. Peptide mass mapping was performed using an ABI 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer. For interpretation of the protein fragments, the PEPTIDEMASS (53Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) program available from ExPASy was used. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)—FCS was performed on an LSM-FCS system at room temperature (ConfoCor 3, Zeiss, Jena/Germany) using the ATP analogue EDA-ATP ATTO-647N and the ADP analogue EDA-ADP ATTO-TEC, (Siegen, Germany). The FCS experiments were performed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with 1 mm DTT. The 633 nm laser line of a 5-milliwatt HeNe633 laser was focused into the aqueous solution by a water immersion objective (40×/1.2 W Corr UV-VIS-IR, Zeiss). FCS was measured in 15- or 50-μl droplets, which were placed on a gelatin-treated Nunc 8-well chambered cover glass according to Hunke et al. (54Hunke C. Chen W.J. Schäfer H.J. Grüber G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 53: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The following filter sets were used: main beam splitter, Hauptfarbteiler, main color splitter 488/543/633; EF1 (emission filter), LP 655; EF, none; dichroic beam splitter (DBS), none; 633 nm, 3% transmission. Out-of-focus fluorescence was rejected by a 90-μm pinhole in the detection pathway, resulting in a confocal detection volume ∼0.25 fl. Fluorescence autocorrelation functions were measured for 30 s each with 10 repetitions. Cyanine 5 solutions in buffer were used as references for the calibration of the ConfoCor 3 system. To study the effect of 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl), protein solution, magnesium chloride, and NBD-Cl were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After addition of EDA-ATP ATTO-647N the solution was incubated for further 10 min. The following filter sets were used: main beam splitter, Hauptfarbteiler, main color splitter 514/633; EF1, BP 655–710R; EF, none; DBS, none; DBS1, plate; DBS3, mirror; 633 nm, 3% transmission. To analyze the autocorrelation functions, a standard model was used for fitting (FCS-LSM software, ConfoCor 3, Zeiss). The calculations were done by the ConfoCor 3 software 4.2, Microsoft Excel 2003, and Origin 7.5. Tyrosine Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer was used, and all experiments were carried out at 20 °C. The samples were excited at 277 nm, and the emission was recorded from 295 to 350 nm with excitation and emission band passes set to 5 nm. Preparation of P. yoelii YM Culture Supernatant—YM parasites were harvested from BALB/c mice, and schizonts were purified by centrifugation on a 50–80% step gradient of Nycodenz (Sigma). Purified schizonts were placed back into culture containing incomplete RPMI 1640 medium with 25% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 16 h. To remove residual nucleotides the supernatant was dialyzed against incomplete RPMI 1640 medium at 4 °C overnight and stored in aliquots at -80 °C for further erythrocyte binding assays. Erythrocyte Binding Assay Using Untreated and Nucleotide-treated Dialyzed P. yoelii YM Parasite Culture Supernatant—Erythrocyte binding assays were performed with minor modifications as described previously (13Ogun S.A. Scott-Finnigan T.J. Narum D.L. Holder A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 95: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 55Ogun S.A. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly 30 μl of dialyzed supernatant were incubated with a final concentration of 3 mm MgATP (ratio of 1:1), 3 mm MgADP (ratio of 1:1), or no nucleotide addition in incomplete RPM"

https://openalex.org/W1564983002,"FcγRIIA is a key activating receptor linking immune complex formation with cellular effector functions. FcγRIIA has 93% identity with an inhibitory receptor, FcγRIIB, which negatively regulates FcγRIIA. FcγRIIA is important in the therapeutic action of several monoclonal antibodies. Binding molecules that discriminate FcγRIIA from FcγRIIB may optimize receptor activity and serve as a lead for development of therapeutics with FcγRIIA as a key target. Here we report the use of phage display libraries to select short peptides with distinct FcγRIIA binding properties. An 11-mer peptide (WAWVWLTETAV) was characterized that bound FcγRIIA with a Kd of 500 nm. It mediated cell internalization and degradation of a model antigen. The peptide-binding site on FcγRIIA was shown to involve Phe163 and the IgG binding amino acids Trp90 and Trp113. It is thus overlapping but not identical to that of IgG. Neither activating receptors FcγRI and FcγRIII, nor FcγRIIB, all of which lack Phe163, bound the peptide.

Leukocyte IgG receptors (FcγRs) play a crucial role in immune protection by providing a link between antibody-antigen complexes and cellular effector functions. Two general classes of FcγRs are recognized: in humans they are the activating FcγRs I, IIA, and IIIA and the inhibitory FcγR IIB. The activating FcγRs are characterized by an intracellular tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), 4The abbreviations used are: ITAM, intracellular tyrosine-based activation motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TU, transducing unit; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; RU, resonance units; skm, skimmed milk.4The abbreviations used are: ITAM, intracellular tyrosine-based activation motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TU, transducing unit; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; RU, resonance units; skm, skimmed milk. which triggers an activating signaling cascade leading to phagocytosis, endocytosis, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, and release of inflammatory mediators (1Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 2Gessner J.E. Heiken H. Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Ann.

By contrast, the inhibitory FcγRIIB contains an intracellular tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Co-ligation of FcγRIIB with ITAM-containing receptors results in inhibition of ITAM-mediated functions (4Hunter S. Indik Z.K. Kim M.K. Cauley M.D. Park J.G. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 1762-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Van den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Capel P.J. van der Bruggen T. Van de Winkel J.G.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The balance of activation and inhibition through FcγRs is important for the regulation of immune function, setting thresholds for and ultimately determining the magnitude of the response. FcγRIIA is the most widely expressed FcγR that is present on subgroups of leukocytes such as neutrophiles and mononuclear phagocytes, where the receptor exists in two common allelic forms at amino acid 134. The FcγRIIA-H134 allelotype (histidine) has higher binding efficiency for human IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies when compared with FcγRIIA-R131 (arginine) (7Shields R.L. Namenuk A.K. Hong K. Meng Y.G.

The inhibitory FcγRIIB is expressed on the same cell types as FcγRIIA. In addition, FcγRIIB is expressed by B-cells, where this receptor is the only Fc receptor expressed. Several studies have recognized that FcγRIIA is of particular importance in the anti-tumor activity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. FcγRIIA on leukocytes from patients undergoing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment known to up-regulate FcγRIIA expression was shown to be the major trigger molecule for antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity induced by an anti-HER-2/neu-specific IgG when various breast cancer cell lines were target cells in vitro (8Stockmeyer B. Valerius T. Repp R. Heijnen I.A. Buhring H.J. Deo Y.M. Kalden J.R. Gramatzki M. van de Winkel J.G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 696-701PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a study by Weng and Levy (9Weng W.K. Levy R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 3940-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) showed a positive association of response rates in rituximab-treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with FcγRIIA-H134. Similarly, Zhang et al. (10Zhang W. Gordon M. Schultheis A.M. Yang D.Y. Nagashima F. Azuma M. Chang H.M. Borucka E. Lurje G. Sherrod A.E. Iqbal S. Groshen S. Lenz H.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 3712-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) observed that metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody showed an FcγRIIA-R134-dependent progression-free survival. Taken together, these studies clearly demonstrate that FcγRIIA-dependent anti-tumor effects mediated by mononuclear phagocytes and/or neutrophils have considerable impact. Furthermore, FcγRIIA has a predominant role in infectious diseases (11Platonov A.E. Shipulin G.A. Vershinina I.V. Dankert J. van de Winkel J.G. Kuijper E.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Yuan F.F. Wong M. Pererva N. Keating J. Davis A.R. Bryant J.A. Sullivan J.S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and enhanced phagocytosis by this receptor may have a broad application in antibacterial therapy. Although all FcγRs bind IgG immune complexes, individual FcγRs bind with affinities that vary depending on the IgG subclass involved (13Nimmerjahn F. Bruhns P. Horiuchi K. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 2005; 23: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). A high activating/inhibitory FcγR binding ratio was found to correlate with biological activity in models of tumor clearance and platelet depletion (14Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Science. 2005; 310: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, blocking FcγRIIB in mice resulted in enhanced tumor immunity (15Kalergis A.M. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Whereas FcγRIIIA-expressing NK cells implicated in antitumor antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (16Sulica A. Morel P. Metes D. Herberman R.B. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 371-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have been shown to infiltrate solid tumors poorly (17Albertsson P.A. Basse P.H. Hokland M. Goldfarb R.H. Nagelkerke J.F. Nannmark U. Kuppen P.J. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the FcγRIIA/IIB-expressing cells (macrophages, DCs, neutrophils) do this very efficiently (18Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Locati M. Allavena P. Sica A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3701) Google Scholar). Therefore, in such cases, selective engagement of FcγRIIA might be very efficacious, also because of the essential role of FcγRIIA in promoting uptake and presentation of antigens to both CD4+ (19Benitez-Ribas D. Adema G.J. Winkels G. Klasen I.S. Punt C.J. Figdor C.G. de Vries I.J. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1629-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and CD8+ T-cells (20Liu Y. Gao X. Masuda E. Redecha P.B. Blank M.C. Pricop L. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 8440-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because the extracellular domains of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB are closely related in structure, having 93% amino acid identity in their extracellular domains, it has been challenging to design modified IgGs with mutations in the Fc region that distinguish between the two receptors (21Armour K.L. van de Winkel J.G. Williamson L.M. Clark M.R. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Strategies have been utilized to identify smaller molecules that target Fcγ receptors, including design of IgG-derived peptide sequences that mimic the part of IgG-Fc that binds Fcγ receptors (22Medgyesi D.

Recognit. 2004; 17: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but still neither of these discriminates between the two receptors. In the present study we performed selection from randomized phage display libraries to identify short novel peptides with distinct FcγRIIA binding properties. We identified, compared, and characterized several binders, and a phage displaying an 11-mer peptide (NNK11-C1) was characterized as the best binder. Binding of the NNK11-C1 phage was competed with free synthetic peptide with the same amino acid sequence, demonstrating that the peptide alone was sufficient for binding. The free peptide bound similarly to both allelic variants (Arg134 and His134) with a Kd of 500 nm, whereas only very weak binding to FcγRIIB and no binding to FcγRI and FcγRIIIB was observed. The peptide was further shown to interfere with IgG binding. Comparing a panel of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB mutants for their ability to bind the peptide, this was found to depend on the presence of Trp90 and Trp113 in addition to the proximal Phe163 in FcγRIIA. Notably, whereas FcγRI, FcγRIIB, and FcγRIII harbor both Trp90 and Trp113, amino acid 163 is a valine in FcγRIII and a tyrosine in FcγRI and FcγRIIB. Thus, the presence of an aromatic, hydrophobic amino acid in position 163 was found to be the key to the actual binding specificity. Biotinylated peptide complexed on streptavidin-bound FcγRIIA on PMN and monocytes and mediated internalization and degradation of streptavidin coupled to 1 μm magnetic beads. This peptide may be an interesting candidate for development of therapeutics for optimal engagement of the immune system. Cells and Antibodies—K562 (CCL-243) and 293E (CRL-10852) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Promochem, UK) and cultured as described (26Berntzen G. Brekke O.H.

Leukocytes were drawn from peripheral blood from normal human volunteers as detailed elsewhere (27Michaelsen T.E. Ihle O. Beckstrom K.J. Herstad T.K. Kolberg J. Hoiby E.A. Aase A. Infect.

Heat aggregation of IgG was done by incubation at 63 °C for 10 min. Soluble FcγRs—Recombinant soluble human FcγRI was obtained from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), whereas recombinant soluble human FcγRIIIB (29Zhang Y. Boesen C.C. Radaev S. Brooks A.G. Fridman W.H. Sautesx-Fridman C. Sun P.D.

The extracellular domains of FcγRIIA-R134, FcγRIIA-H134, and FcγRIIB as well as the mutants IIA W90A, IIA W113A, IIA F163Y, IIB K130Q, IIB S135L, IIB N138T, IIB Y163F, and IIB K130Q/S135L/N138T/Y163F (IIB 4mut) were cloned and expressed as soluble fusions to GST in 293E cells as described in the supplemental text. The IIA mutants were all in Arg134. In addition, FcγRIIA-R134 and FcγRIIB were cloned and expressed as fusions to a His6 tag (Supplementary methods). ELISA—The FcγRII-GST and FcγRII-His fusion proteins were investigated for binding to hIgG by ELISA essentially as described (26Berntzen G. Brekke O.H. Mousavi S.A. Andersen J.T. Michaelsen T.E. Berg T. Sandlie I. Lauvrak V. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the FcγRII proteins were coated in MaxiSorp microtiter strips (Nunc, Denmark). hIgG-biot or hIgG was added to FcγRII-GST or FcγRII-His, respectively, and bound IgG was detected by streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences) (FcγRII-GST) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) (FcγRIIA-His). Phage Display Peptide Libraries and Phage Clones—The vector fUSE5 (30Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), which supports phage fd protein III (pIII) peptide expression, was used for library constructions. Two such libraries, Cys6 and Cys9, that represent 2.2 × 107 and 5 × 107 different cysteine-flanked peptides of six or nine random amino acids, respectively, have been described (31Lauvrak V. Berntzen G. Heggelund U. Herstad T.K. Sandin R.H. Dalseg R. Rosenqvist E. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 59: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A library of 11 random amino acids (NNK11) and three motif libraries, Evo1, Evo2, and Evo3, were similarly constructed using the primer NNK11 for the NNK11 library and the primers Evo1, Evo2, and Evo3 (supplemental Table S1) (all from DNA Technology, Risskov, Denmark) for the three evolution libraries. The number of different clones in each library was estimated based on the number of primary transformants with insert. Control phages were randomly chosen from the Cys6 and Cys9 libraries. The Cys6 phage clone C6-1, with peptide insert CLRSGLGC, has previously been described and is selected for binding to FcγRI (26Berntzen G. Brekke O.H. Mousavi S.A. Andersen J.T. Michaelsen T.E. Berg T. Sandlie I. Lauvrak V. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Selection of FcγRIIA-binding Peptides—Three consecutive rounds of selection from the Cys6, NNK11, Cys9, as well the three evolution libraries were performed. For the first round, wells precoated with 100 μl of goat anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% PBS/skm. Aliquots of 100 μl of FcγRIIA-R134-GST (10 μg/ml) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS/T. A total of 2 × 1011 Escherichia coli K91K transducing units (TUs) from the libraries diluted in 400 μl of PBS/skm were added to a total of four wells. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature followed by 10 washes with PBS/T, bound phages were eluted with 400 μl of 0.1 m HCl-glycine (pH 2.2), and eluates were neutralized with 28 μl of 1.5 m Tris (pH 8.8). Eluted phages were rescued as E. coli K91K transfectants, titrated, and amplified as described (30Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Phage supernatant of the amplified eluate (E1A) was prepared essentially as described (30Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). For the second round of selection, two wells of MaxiSorp strips (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of FcγRIIA-R134-GST (10 μg/ml), blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% PBS/skm, and washed three times with PBS/T. A portion of E1A corresponding to 2.5 × 109 TU in PBS/skm was added to the wells. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature followed by 10 washes with PBS/T, bound phages were eluted, neutralized, rescued, and amplified as before. A third round of selection was performed with an input of 5 × 108 TU of the amplified second eluate (E2A) followed by the same procedure as described for the second round. Phage supernatants from single TUs were prepared as described (30Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Characterization of Phages—Aliquots of 5 or 50 μl of phage supernatants from amplified eluates or individual clones in a total of 100 or 200 μl 1% PBS/skm were allowed to react with FcγRII-GST fusion proteins, GST or PBS/skm coated in microtiter wells for 1 h at room temperature. The phage recovery was determined as described above. The amino acid sequences of peptides displayed by selected phages were determined by DNA sequencing (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany) of PCR products as previously described (31Lauvrak V. Berntzen G. Heggelund U. Herstad T.K. Sandin R.H. Dalseg R. Rosenqvist E. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 59: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Synthetic Peptides—Synthetic peptides were in the form ADGAXnGAAK-Bio (Alta Bioscience), where ADGA and GAA are flanking amino acids as found in the fUSE5 phage, K-Bio represents a biotinylated lysine residue, and Xn represents selected peptides CPWFQWPC (C6-D), WAWVWLTETAV (NNK11-C1), and CTLRLGVGVRC (C9-E11) as well as a control peptide CWTSGARWRLC (RB-14). Peptides flanked by cysteines (C6-D, C9-E11, and RB-14) were produced as cyclic peptides. The RB-14 sequence has previously been selected for binding to poly(Ig) receptor (32Braathen R. Sandvik A. Berntzen G. Hammerschmidt S. Fleckenstein B. Sandlie I. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. Lauvrak V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7075-7081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and was used as negative control. The synthetic peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to more than 80% purity (Alta Bioscience). The peptides were dissolved to 10 mm in Me2SO (Sigma) and kept at -20 °C. Competition Assays with a Free Synthetic NNK11-C1 Peptide—Portions of 40 μm or 400 μm synthetic NNK11-C1 peptide were added to aliquots of 10 μl of supernatant of the NNK11-C1, C6-D phage, or a control phage displaying the peptide CDIF-GRDC and incubated in wells coated with 5 μg/ml FcγRIIA-R134-GST at 1 h at room temperature. The phage recovery was determined as described above. ELISA Assays with Biotinylated Peptides—ELISA assays with biotinylated peptides were performed essentially as the ELISA for detection of bound hIgG to FcγRIIs as described (26Berntzen G. Brekke O.H. Mousavi S.A. Andersen J.T. Michaelsen T.E. Berg T. Sandlie I. Lauvrak V. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic biotinylated peptides in PBS were added in wells coated with FcγRII-GSTs and bound peptide detected by streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analyses—The instrument used for the SPR analysis was BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The running buffer for all of the experiments was BIA-certified HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20). chIgG3 was covalently immobilized to ∼1000 RU on a CM5 chip (BIAcore AB) with the amine coupling procedure. Serial dilutions (0.078–4 μm) of FcγRIIA-R134-His and FcγRIIB-His were injected over the sensor chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, and the binding reactions were allowed to reach (near) equilibrium. KD was derived by nonlinear regression analysis of plots of Req (the equilibrium binding response) versus the analyte (chIgG3) concentration. The NNK11-C1-biotin peptide was captured on an SA chip (BIAcore AB) as described by the manufacturer, to ∼50–100 RU followed by injection of recombinant human FcγRI (2 μm), FcγRIIA-R134-His (1 μm), FcγRIIB-His (1 and 2 μm), and FcγRIIIB (2 μm) or serial dilutions (0.078–4 μm) of FcγRIIA-R134-His and FcγRIIB-His at a flow rate of 70 μl/min at 25 or 37 °C. For competitive studies 0.5 μm FcγRIIA-R134-His or FcγRIIB-His were preincubated with the NNK11-C1 peptide (2 and 50 μm) or chIgG3 (1 and 2 μm) and injected over immobilized chIgG3 or NNK11-C1 peptide, respectively. For all sensorgrams the signal from an uncoated reference cell was subtracted. Data evaluation was performed using BIAevaluation 4.1 Software (BIAcore AB). FcγRII Sequence Analysis—ClustalW was used for sequence alignment of the extracellular domains of human FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB. The NCBI nucleotide accession numbers are NM_021642 (human FcγRIIA) and NM_004001 (human FcγRIIB). The stereo ribbon representation of the FcγRIIA structure was designed using MOLMOL with the crystallographic data of the FcγRIIA (33Maxwell K.F. Powell M.S. Hulett M.D. Barton P.A. McKenzie I.F. Garrett T.P. Hogarth P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) available on the Protein Data Bank site. The structure of FcγRIIA (33Maxwell K.F. Powell M.S. Hulett M.D. Barton P.A. McKenzie I.F. Garrett T.P. Hogarth P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was superimposed onto the structure of FcγRIIB (34Sondermann P. Huber R. Jacob U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—The CD sample was dissolved in water. Trifluoroethanol was titrated to the water solution of the peptide at concentrations from 0 to 50%, and the CD data were recorded. The concentration of peptide was determined by absorption measurements at 280 nm using a Shimadzu UV-instrument (Shimadzu Corperation, Kyoto, Japan) before and after CD measurements. CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) calibrated with d-camphor-10-sulfonate (Icatayama Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). All of the measurements were taken up using a quartz cuvette (Starna, Essex, UK) with a path length of 0.1 cm. The samples were scanned five times at 50 nm/min with a bandwidth of 0.5 nm and a response time of 1 s, over the wavelength range 190–260 nm. The data were averaged, and the spectrum of a sample-free control was subtracted. The α-helical content of the peptide was determined by application of the single point method using the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222) and the equation: fH = 100% × [θ]222/(×40,000(1–2.5 n)), where fH is the α-helical content in %, and n is the number of residues (35Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Two repetitions of each measurement were done. Flow Cytometry Analysis—The PMN and monocyte populations of prepared leukocytes were identified in the scatter diagram in the flow cytometer and also verified by staining with mouse IgM anti-FcγRIIIB-FITC (Immunotech, Quebec, Canada) as a specific marker for human PMN, and mouse IgM anti-CD14-FITC conjugated to FITC (Coulter, Fullerton, CA) as a specific marker for human monocytes. Mouse IgM-FITC (Coulter) was used as negative isotype control. The binding of synthetic NNK11-C1-biotin (final concentration, 4 μm) was either detected by preformed complexes with streptavidin-FITC (Dako, Denmark) or with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (Dako). Fluorescence and scatter properties of cells were analyzed in Partec Cyto-Flow ML (Munster, Germany) flow cytometer. Receptor-mediated Internalization and Degradation—Peptide-mediated internalization and degradation of streptavidin coupled to 1 μm magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were investigated essentially as described (26Berntzen G. Brekke O.H. Mousavi S.A. Andersen J.T. Michaelsen T.E. Berg T. Sandlie I. Lauvrak V. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-labeled streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads were charged with the NNK11-C1 peptide and incubated with K562 cells, in the presence or absence of 0.6 μm concanamycin A (Sigma) or a combination of 1.6 μm leupeptin (Roche Applied Science) and 80 μm E64d (Calbiochem, Germany). Samples of supernatants were collected after 0, 3, and 6 h of incubation. Following precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, acid-insoluble material, which represents cell-degraded 125I-labeled streptavidin, was counted. Production of Recombinant FcγRII-GST Fusion Proteins—The extracellular domains of FcγRIIA-R134, FcγRIIA-H134, and FcγRIIB were produced as recombinant GST fusion proteins as described in the supplemental text. All were purified on GST column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis where they appeared as bands of expected size (55 kDa) (not shown). Furthermore, all three variants bound heat-aggregated hIgG, the FcγRIIA variants slightly better than FcγRIIB (26Berntzen G. Brekke O.H. Mousavi S.A. Andersen J.T. Michaelsen T.E. Berg T. Sandlie I. Lauvrak V. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with data for FcγRs produced by others (36Sondermann P. Jacob U. Kutscher C. Frey J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8469-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Maenaka K. van der Merwe P.A. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Sondermann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44898-44904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Affinity Selection of FcγRIIA-binding Peptides from a Cys6 Library—Initially, a phage library of six random amino acids flanked by cysteines (the Cys6 library) was searched for binders to FcγRIIA-R134-GST as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After three rounds of selection resulting in increasing output titer, individual clones were sequenced. Among 29 selected clones, seven different amino acid sequences were found (Table 1) five of which shared the consensus motif XW(F/Y/W)(Q/E)(W/F)P. They revealed up to 10 times increased recovery from wells coated with FcγRIIA-R134-GST compared with wells coated with skm or GST only (results not shown), and clone C6-D (CPWFQWPC) showed the highest recovery (Fig. 1a). Neither an FcγRI-binding phage clone, C6-1 (Fig. 1a) nor unselected phage clones (not shown) bound the target. Furthermore, the C6-D phage clone bound better to wells coated with FcγRIIA-R134-GST than to wells coated with FcγRIIB-GST (Fig. 1b).TABLE 1Sequences of selected FcγRIIA-binding peptides from the Cys6 librarySequenceName/frequencyCAWYQFPCaThe consensus motif is showed in bold typeC6-A (6)bThe number of clones with the peptide insert is shown in parenthesesCAWYEWPCC6-B (12)CVWWQWPCC6-C (1)CPWFQWPCC6-D (1)CKWFQWPCC6-E (7)CFWVNTDCC6-F (1)CLYLSIRCC6-G (1)a The consensus motif is showed in bold typeb The number of clones with the peptide insert is shown in parentheses Open table in a new tab In Vitro Evolution and Selections of New FcγRIIA Peptide Binders—To improve affinity by increasing the putative contact surface area between peptide and target, three evolution libraries based on the C6-D sequence were prepared. In the Evo1 library, the C6-D sequence was extended by three random amino acids (X) on each side (XXXCPWFQWPCXXX). In the Evo2 and Evo3 libraries, one proline and one of the flanking cysteines were excluded from the C6-D motif, and six random amino acids added to either side (XXXXXXWFQWPC and CPWFQWXXXXXX). In addition, a phage library of 11 random amino acids (NNK11) was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sizes of the evolution libraries and the NNK11 library were estimated to be 1–3 × 107 and 9 × 108 different clones, respectively. DNA sequencing revealed the presence of diverse inserts of expected length (not shown). Three rounds of selection were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and selection from the three evolution libraries was compared with selection from the NNK11 library and also a Cys9 library of nine random amino acids flanked by cysteines, previously described (31Lauvrak V. Berntzen G. Heggelund U. Herstad T.K. Sandin R.H. Dalseg R. Rosenqvist E. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 59: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S2). Characterization of Individual Phage Clones—To characterize individual phage clones, supernatants from 10 to 30 individual isolates after three rounds of selection from each library were sequenced. The sequences are presented in Table 2, and an analysis of the sequences is"
