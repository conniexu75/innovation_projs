https://openalex.org/W2015067929,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health problem with over 170,000,000 chronic carriers and infection rates increasing worldwide. Chronic HCV infection is one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma which was estimated to result in ∼10,000 deaths in the United States in the year 2011. Current treatment options for HCV infection are limited to PEG-ylated interferon alpha (IFN-α), the nucleoside ribavirin and the recently approved HCV protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. Although showing significantly improved efficacy over the previous therapies, treatment with protease inhibitors has been shown to result in the rapid emergence of drug-resistant virus. Here we report the activity of two proteins, originally isolated from natural product extracts, which demonstrate low or sub-nanomolar in vitro activity against both genotype I and genotype II HCV. These proteins inhibit viral infectivity, binding to the HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 and block viral entry into human hepatocytes. In addition, we demonstrate that the most potent of these agents, the protein griffithsin, is readily bioavailable after subcutaneous injection and shows significant in vivo efficacy in reducing HCV viral titers in a mouse model system with engrafted human hepatocytes. These results indicate that HCV viral entry inhibitors can be an effective component of anti-HCV therapy and that these proteins should be studied further for their therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1979676825,"Experience of mice in a complex environment enhances neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of wild type and transgenic mice harboring familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-linked APPswe/PS1ΔE9. In FAD mice, this experience also reduces levels of tau hyperphosphorylation and oligomeric β-amyloid. Although environmental enrichment has significant effects on brain plasticity and neuropathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Here we show that environmental enrichment upregulates the Akt pathway, leading to the downregulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), in wild type but not FAD mice. Several neurotrophic signaling pathways are activated in the hippocampus of both wild type and FAD mice, including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), and this increase is accompanied by the upregulation of the BDNF receptor, tyrosine kinase B (TrkB). Interestingly, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is upregulated in the brains of wild type mice but not FAD mice, while insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is upregulated exclusively in the brains of FAD mice. Upregulation of neurotrophins is accompanied by the increase of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus following environmental enrichment. Most importantly, we observed a significant increase in levels of cAMP response element- binding (CREB) transcripts in the hippocampus of wild type and FAD mice following environmental enrichment. However, CREB phosphorylation, a critical step for the initiation of learning and memory-required gene transcription, takes place in the hippocampus of wild type but not of FAD mice. These results suggest that experience of wild type mice in a complex environmental upregulates critical signaling that play a major role in learning and memory in the hippocampus. However, in FAD mice, some of these pathways are impaired and cannot be rescued by environmental enrichment."

Among the several hypotheses, insulin resistance (IR), obesity and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) play significant role/s in RPL. This study was conducted to assess the link between elevated levels of homocysteine and IR in PCOS-associated women with RPL in Kolkata, India. A retrospective study was conducted of one hundred and twenty six PCOS women (<30 years) who experienced two or more spontaneous abortions during the first trimester presenting to Institute of Reproductive Medicine (IRM) in Kolkata during the period of March 2008 through February 2011. One hundred and seventeen non-PCOS subjects with matching age range were randomly chosen as controls. Incidence of HHcy and IR was 70.63% (n = 89) and 56.34% (n = 71), respectively, in RPL-affected PCOS population which was significantly higher (p<0.04; p<0.0001) when compared to the non-PCOS set (HHcy: 57.26%; IR: 6.83%). Rates of miscarriage were significantly higher (p<0.008; p<0.03) in hyperhomocysteinemia-induced miscarriage when compared to the normohomocysteinemic segment (PCOS: 70.63% vs.29.36% & non-PCOS: 57.26% vs. 42.73%) along with the insulin resistant (p<0.04; p<0.0001) population (PCOS: 70.63% vs. 56.34% & non-PCOS: 57.26% vs. 6.83%) in both groups. A probabilistic causal model evaluated HHcy as the strongest plausible factor for diagnosis of RPL. A probability percentage of 43.32% in the cases of HHcy- mediated RPL suggests its increased tendency when compared to IR mediated miscarriage (37.29%), further supported by ROC-AUC (HHcy: 0.778vs. IR: 0.601) values. Greater susceptibility towards HHcy may increase the incidence for miscarriage in women in India and highlights the need to combat the condition in RPL control programs in the subcontinent."
https://openalex.org/W2008599012,"Recent advance in sequencing technology has enabled comprehensive profiling of genetic alterations in cancer. We have established a targeted sequencing platform using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for clinical use, which can provide mutation and copy number variation data. NGS was performed with paired-end library enriched with exons of 183 cancer-related genes. Normal and tumor tissue pairs of 60 colorectal adenocarcinomas were used to test feasibility. Somatic mutation and copy number alteration were analyzed. A total of 526 somatic non-synonymous sequence variations were found in 113 genes. Among these, 278 single nucleotide variations were 232 different somatic point mutations. 216 SNV were 79 known single nucleotide polymorphisms in the dbSNP. 32 indels were 28 different indel mutations. Median number of mutated gene per tumor was 4 (range 0–23). Copy number gain (>X2 fold) was found in 65 genes in 40 patients, whereas copy number loss (<X0.5 fold) was found in 103 genes in 39 patients. The most frequently altered genes (mutation and/or copy number alteration) were APC in 35 patients (58%), TP53 in 34 (57%), and KRAS in 24 (40%). Altered gene list revealed ErbB signaling pathway as the most commonly involved pathway (25 patients, 42%). Targeted sequencing platform using NGS technology is feasible for clinical use and provides comprehensive genetic alteration data."
https://openalex.org/W2085736670,"Aim The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha and PPARgamma by Bezafibrate (BZ) could attenuate hepatic and white adipose tissue (WAT) abnormalities in male offspring from diet-induced obese dams. Materials and Methods C57BL/6 female mice were fed a standard chow (SC; 10% lipids) diet or a high-fat (HF; 49% lipids) diet for 8 weeks before mating and during gestation and lactation periods. Male offspring received SC diet at weaning and were subdivided into four groups: SC, SC/BZ, HF and HF/BZ. Treatment with BZ (100 mg/Kg diet) started at 12 weeks of age and was maintained for three weeks. Results The HF diet resulted in an overweight phenotype and an increase in oral glucose intolerance and fasting glucose of dams. The HF offspring showed increased body mass, higher levels of plasmatic and hepatic triglycerides, higher levels of pro-inflammatory and lower levels of anti-inflammatory adipokines, impairment of glucose metabolism, abnormal fat pad mass distribution, higher number of larger adipocytes, hepatic steatosis, higher expression of lipogenic proteins concomitant to decreased expression of PPARalpha and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1) in liver, and diminished expression of PPARgamma and adiponectin in WAT. Treatment with BZ ameliorated the hepatic and WAT abnormalities generated by diet-induced maternal obesity, with improvements observed in the structural, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the animals' livers and epididymal fat. Conclusion Diet-induced maternal obesity lead to alterations in metabolism, hepatic lipotoxicity and adverse liver and WAT remodeling in the offspring. Targeting PPAR with Bezafibrate has beneficial effects reducing the alterations, mainly through reduction of WAT inflammatory state through PPARgamma activation and enhanced hepatic beta-oxidation due to increased PPARalpha/PPARgamma ratio in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2006034496,"Clostridial collagenases are among the most efficient enzymes to degrade by far the most predominant protein in the biosphere. Here we present crystal structures of the peptidases of three clostridial collagenase isoforms (ColG, ColH, and ColT). The comparison of unliganded and liganded structures reveals a quaternary subdomain dynamics. In the unliganded ColH structure, this globular dynamics is modulated by an aspartate switch motion that binds to the catalytic zinc. We further identified a calcium binding site in proximity to the catalytic zinc. Both ions are required for full activity, explaining why calcium critically affects the enzymatic activity of clostridial collagenases. Our studies further reveal that loops close to the active site thus serve as characteristic substrate selectivity filter. These elements explain the distinct peptidolytic and collagenolytic activities of these enzymes and provide a rational framework to engineer collagenases with customized substrate specificity as well as for inhibitor design."
https://openalex.org/W1983144185,"Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (Nr1h4, FXR) is a bile acid activated nuclear receptor mainly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney and adrenal glands. Upon activation, the primary function is to suppress cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic or neutral bile acid synthesis pathway. In the present study, a novel Fxr deficient mouse line was created and studied with respect to metabolism and liver function in ageing mice fed chow diet. The Fxr deficient mice were similar to wild type mice in terms of body weight, body composition, energy intake and expenditure as well as behaviours at a young age. However, from 15 weeks of age and onwards, the Fxr deficient mice had almost no body weight increase up to 39 weeks of age mainly because of lower body fat mass. The lower body weight gain was associated with increased energy expenditure that was not compensated by increased food intake. Fasting levels of glucose and insulin were lower and glucose tolerance was improved in old and lean Fxr deficient mice. However, the Fxr deficient mice displayed significantly increased liver weight, steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation together with elevated plasma levels of ALT, bilirubin and bile acids, findings compatible with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cholestasis. In conclusion, ageing Fxr deficient mice display late onset leanness associated with elevated energy expenditure and improved glucose control but develop severe NASH-like liver pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2035046236,"In the present study, we investigated the structure and function of hainantoxin-III (HNTX-III), a 33-residue polypeptide from the venom of the spider Ornithoctonus hainana. It is a selective antagonist of neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels. HNTX-III suppressed Nav1.7 current amplitude without significantly altering the activation, inactivation, and repriming kinetics. Short extreme depolarizations partially activated the toxin-bound channel, indicating voltage-dependent inhibition of HNTX-III. HNTX-III increased the deactivation of the Nav1.7 current after extreme depolarizations. The HNTX-III·Nav1.7 complex was gradually dissociated upon prolonged strong depolarizations in a voltage-dependent manner, and the unbound toxin rebound to Nav1.7 after a long repolarization. Moreover, analysis of chimeric channels showed that the DIIS3-S4 linker was critical for HNTX-III binding to Nav1.7. These data are consistent with HNTX-III interacting with Nav1.7 site 4 and trapping the domain II voltage sensor in the closed state. The solution structure of HNTX-III was determined by two-dimensional NMR and shown to possess an inhibitor cystine knot motif. Structural analysis indicated that certain basic, hydrophobic, and aromatic residues mainly localized in the C terminus may constitute an amphiphilic surface potentially involved in HNTX-III binding to Nav1.7. Taken together, our results show that HNTX-III is distinct from β-scorpion toxins and other β-spider toxins in its mechanism of action and binding specificity and affinity.

https://openalex.org/W1993230600,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most pernicious malignancies, but the mechanisms underlying its development and progression are poorly understood. One of the key pathways implicated in OSCC is the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Previously, we reported that canonical Wnt signaling functions in a positive feedback loop with the DPAGT1 gene, a principal regulator of the metabolic pathway of protein N-glycosylation, to hyperglycosylate E-cadherin and reduce intercellular adhesion. Here, we show that in OSCC, DPAGT1 and canonical Wnt signaling converge to up-regulate CTHRC1 (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1), an N-glycoprotein implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We found that in human OSCC specimens, amplification of the levels of CTHRC1 was associated with its hyperglycosylation. Partial inhibition of DPAGT1 expression in OSCC CAL27 cells reduced CTHRC1 abundance by increasing protein turnover, indicating that N-glycosylation stabilizes CTHRC1. Additionally, canonical Wnt signaling promoted β-catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional activity at the CTHRC1 promoter to further elevate CTHRC1 levels. We demonstrate that DPAGT1 promotes cell migration and drives the localization of CTHRC1 to cells at the leading edge of a wound front coincident with drastic changes in cell morphology.

Evolutionarily conserved and essential for viability, N-glycosylation controls a wide spectrum of activities, including protein folding, sorting, targeting, and secretion, as well as cell adhesion and signaling events (16.Helenius A.

DPAGT1 encodes the first enzyme in the dolichol pathway, dolichol-P-dependent N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase (GPT), which initiates the synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor for protein N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Many components of canonical Wnt signaling are N-glycoproteins, and their N-glycosylation status controls Wnt signaling by regulating secretion and membrane localization of a canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt3a, and a co-receptor, LRP6 (17.Sengupta P.K. Bouchie M.P. Nita-Lazar M. Yang H.Y. Kukuruzinska M.A. Coordinate regulation of N-glycosylation gene DPAGT1, canonical Wnt signaling and E-cadherin adhesion.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In turn, canonical Wnt activates DPAGT1 expression via β-catenin at a transcriptional level. Furthermore, N-glycosylation inhibits E-cadherin adhesion and interferes with E-cadherin antagonism of canonical Wnt signaling (17.Sengupta P.K. Bouchie M.P. Nita-Lazar M. Yang H.Y.

Recently, we reported that OSCC specimens display an aberrantly amplified DPAGT1/canonical Wnt feedback loop (6.Jamal B. Sengupta P.K. Gao Z.N. Nita-Lazar M. Amin B. Jalisi S. Bouchie M.P. Kukuruzinska M.A. Aberrant amplification of the crosstalk between canonical Wnt signaling and N-glycosylation gene DPAGT1 promotes oral cancer.Oral Oncol. 2012; 48: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), where overexpression of DPAGT1 is due to increased occupancy of β-catenin at the DPAGT1 promoter. This leads to hyperglycosylation of E-cadherin and reduced intercellular adhesion, resulting in a continuous activation of N-glycosylation and canonical Wnt signaling. Inappropriate activation of N-glycosylation and canonical Wnt signaling early in OSCC pathogenesis is likely to trigger downstream events leading to cancer progression. For OSCC tumors to spread, cells must migrate off the primary tumor epithelium. Thus, another consequence of amplified DPAGT1/canonical Wnt signaling could be the activation of key components driving OSCC cell migration. Recently, CTHRC1 (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1), a secreted N-glycoprotein highly conserved in evolution, has emerged as a key player in tumor invasion and metastasis (22.Pyagay P.

First identified in a screen for novel genes associated with vascular injury and repair, CTHRC1 can be tethered to the cell surface to promote actin polymerization and cell polarity (23.Yamamoto S.

Here, we report that human OSCC specimens display dramatic up-regulation of CTHRC1, which coincides with its hyperglycosylation. We show that N-glycosylation stabilizes the CTHRC1 protein by decreasing its turnover rate. At the same time, canonical Wnt signaling further induces CTHRC1 expression at a transcriptional level via increased recruitment of β-catenin to the CTHRC1 promoter. In scratch wound assays, N-glycosylation drives the localization of CTHRC1 to cells at the migrating wound front and promotes cell migration, in part, through a non-canonical Wnt pathway. Collectively, our studies show that in OSCC, CTHRC1 is up-regulated by the amplified DPAGT1/canonical Wnt feedback loop. We propose that this aberrant up-regulation of CTHRC1 drives OSCC tumor cell migration and the subsequent invasion and metastasis. Anti-CTHRC1 monoclonal antibody was used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analyses. A polyclonal antibody to the last 11 amino acids of the C terminus of GPT was prepared commercially (Covance). For immunofluorescence studies, anti-CTHRC1 antibody was purchased from Abcam, as was anti-Wnt5a polyclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies to β-catenin, Rac1, and the IgG isotype control were obtained from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal antibodies to TCF3/4 and Fzd6 were from Exalpha Biologicals and R&D Systems, respectively. Anti-RhoA antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibody to active GTP-bound RhoA was from NewEast Biosciences. Anti-Dvl2 polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling. Antibodies to GAPDH and FLAG were from Sigma and anti-pan-actin antibody was from NeoMarkers. Cultures of OSCC CAL27 cells were grown to 70% confluence in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as described (6.Jamal B. Sengupta P.K. Gao Z.N. Nita-Lazar M. Amin B. Jalisi S. Bouchie M.P. Kukuruzinska M.A. Aberrant amplification of the crosstalk between canonical Wnt signaling and N-glycosylation gene DPAGT1 promotes oral cancer.Oral Oncol. 2012; 48: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were prepared by extraction with Triton X-100/β-octyl glucoside buffer. When indicated, CAL27 cells were treated with 50% Wnt3a-containing conditioned medium for 24 h as described (18.Liwosz A. Lei T.

Chem. 2006; 281: 23138-23149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CAL27 cells expressing recombinant DPAGT1 were obtained by transfection of passage 2 CAL27 cells with full-length DPAGT1 (RefSeq NM_001382) or transcript variant (Refseq NM_203316) cDNA clones (OriGene) at 80–90% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000. Controls included untransfected cells and cells transfected with a control pCMV6-Entry vector. After 14 h, the media were changed, and cells were divided into several plates and grown in the presence of G418. Media were changed every 2–3 days and supplemented with G418. After 2 weeks, cells were processed for RNA isolation and preparation of total cell lysates. For immunofluorescence analyses, stable transfectants were plated in chamber slides at a density of 5–6 × 103/cm2 and processed as described (32.Parri M. Chiarugi P. Rac and Rho GTPases in cancer cell motility control.Cell Commun. Signal. 2010; 8: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). SMARTpool siRNAs targeting CTHRC1 and DPAGT1 (referred to as S siRNA) were obtained from Dharmacon. The non-silencing negative control siRNA (referred to as NS siRNA) was from Qiagen. CAL27 cells were transfected at 60% confluence with either NS or S siRNA (150 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and cultured for 48 h. Total RNAs isolated from CAL27 cells transfected with either NS or S siRNA were used for cDNA synthesis to assess CTHRC1 and DPAGT1 expression by real-time PCR. The gene expression profiles were generated by normalizing the Ct (threshold cycle numbers) of CTHRC1 and DPAGT1 with a housekeeping gene (18 S rRNA) and comparing the gene expression of cells treated with NS or S siRNA. For cell migration assays, serum-free medium containing 1 × 105 cells was placed into the upper compartment of Transwell inserts (Corning), and the lower compartment was filled with medium containing 10% FBS. Cells in Transwells were then incubated for 20 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell migration was quantified by counting crystal violet-positive cells (Fisher). For wounding studies, CAL27 cells transfected with either NS or S siRNAs, as well as CAL27 cells transfected with DPAGT1 cDNA, were grown to confluence in P60 plates and wounded with a sterile 200- or 1000-μl pipette tip, washed three times with growth medium, and returned to the incubator. At the indicated times, wound edges were photographed using a phase-contrast Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and 10× objective. For immunofluorescence analyses of wounded cells, confluent cultures of CAL27 cells transfected with non-silencing RNAs or siRNAs to DPAGT1 were grown in chamber slides. At 18 h post-wounding, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence localization of CTHRC1 and for F-actin organization by counterstaining with rhodamine-phalloidin. Cells were then examined on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. All studies with surgical OSCC specimens were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Boston University Medical Campus. Fresh tissues were obtained from patients with moderately differentiated to poorly differentiated OSCC of the tongue, maxillary gingiva, and floor of mouth. Regions of OSCC and adjacent epithelia (AE), defined by an on-site pathology analysis, were snap-frozen at −80 °C. Tissues were divided for H&E analyses, biochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. OCT-embedded fresh tumor tissues were used for preparation of frozen sections (5 μm). One frozen section was set aside for H&E staining, whereas the remaining sections were processed for immunofluorescence analyses as described below. For biochemical analyses, total tissue lysates (TTLs) from AE and OSCC were prepared by extraction with Triton X-100/β-octyl-glucoside buffer as described previously (24.Turashvili G. Bouchal J. Baumforth K. Wei W. Dziechciarkova M. Ehrmann J. Klein J. Fridman E. Skarda J. Srovnal J. Hajduch M. Murray P. Kolar Z. Novel markers for differentiation of lobular and ductal invasive breast carcinomas by laser microdissection and microarray analysis.BMC Cancer. 2007; 7: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Cell and tissue lysates were fractionated on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk, and incubated with primary antibodies to selected proteins. Protein-specific detection was carried out with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, equal amounts of protein (500 μg) were precleared with antibody isotype controls and protein G beads (Sigma). The resulting supernatants were incubated with anti-CTHRC1 antibody (2 μg) and 50 μl of protein G beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. Due to the similar migration of CTHRC1 and the 25-kDa IgG chain, CTHRC1 immunoprecipitates were fractionated on 10% nonreducing gels. Immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ software. Tissue lysates were digested with 100 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting. Control samples were incubated without the enzyme. CAL27 cells were stimulated with conditioned medium overexpressing Wnt3a for 24 h and then transfected with either NS siRNA or siRNA to DPAGT1 and grown for 48 h. Next, cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) was added to NS and S siRNA-transfected cells, and cells were harvested at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h. CTHRC1 protein levels were examined by immunoblotting and quantified with ImageJ. The half-life of CTHRC1 in NS and S siRNA-transfected cells was determined by calculating the time when 50% of CTHRC1 remained using a line of best fit in Excel. For indirect immunofluorescence analyses, CAL27 cells were grown to 80% confluence, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% goat serum, and incubated with primary antibodies. Cells were then incubated with FITC-tagged secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), counterstained for F-actin with rhodamine-phalloidin, mounted in VECTASHIELD, and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. For indirect immunofluorescence analyses of human AE and OSCC specimens, tissue sections were blocked with 10% goat serum and incubated with antibodies against selected proteins, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC. Negative controls lacked primary antibodies. The slides were mounted in VECTASHIELD, and optical sections were analyzed with either a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. ChIP assays were carried out with chromatin cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde from CAL27 cells. For tissue ChIP analyses, AE and OSCC were incubated in DMEM containing 1% formaldehyde, homogenized, and sonicated at 4 °C. The sonicated extract was immunoprecipitated, and genomic DNA was isolated from the complex after reverse cross-linking. The primers and the TaqMan probe surrounding the Wnt-responsive element of human CTHRC1 were designed using the Primer Express program (Applied Biosystems). They were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TGC AGT GAT CCC TTT ACC ATT ATA TAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGC AAT CCT AGT CTC TGA TAA AAC AGA-3′; and TaqMan probe, 6Fam-TCCTTCTTTGTCTTTTCTG-MGB. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed Student's t tests. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Previously, we reported that aberrantly amplified DPAGT1 leads to hyperglycosylation of E-cadherin and consequently reduced intercellular adhesion (6.Jamal B. Sengupta P.K. Gao Z.N. Nita-Lazar M. Amin B. Jalisi S. Bouchie M.P.

Recent studies have identified an N-glycoprotein, CTHRC1, as a key regulator of cell motility in cancer (25.Tang L. Dai D.L. Su M. Martinka M. Li G. Zhou Y.

Thus, we hypothesized that increased DPAGT1-mediated N-glycosylation may promote additional molecular events that influence OSCC progression, such as cell migration. We therefore examined the expression and localization of the protein encoded by the DPAGT1 gene (GPT), a canonical Wnt effector (β-catenin), and a pro-migratory N-glycoprotein (CTHRC1) in nine moderately to poorly differentiated human OSCC tongue tumor specimens and corresponding cytologically normal AE. A representative H&E image of AE and OSCC used in this study is shown in Fig. 1A. As reported previously (6.Jamal B. Sengupta P.K. Gao Z.N. Nita-Lazar M. Amin B. Jalisi S. Bouchie M.P. Kukuruzinska M.A. Aberrant amplification of the crosstalk between canonical Wnt signaling and N-glycosylation gene DPAGT1 promotes oral cancer.Oral Oncol. 2012; 48: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), immunoblots of TTLs showed that β-catenin was up-regulated by ∼2-fold in OSCC compared with AE (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence analyses indicated that in AE, β-catenin was highly expressed in the proliferating basal layer of the epithelium, with diminished levels in the cytodifferentiating spinous layer. A similar localization pattern was observed for GPT (Fig. 1C). In contrast, in OSCC, β-catenin and GPT exhibited robust expression throughout tumor regions (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis confirmed that similar to β-catenin, GPT was more abundant in OSCC compared with AE (Fig. 1E). Although GPT overexpression in these OSCC tumors averaged 4-fold, even a modest increase in DPAGT1 expression has been shown to result in a robust activation of canonical Wnt pathway activity and hyperglycosylation of proteins (17.Sengupta P.K. Bouchie M.P. Nita-Lazar M. Yang H.Y. Kukuruzinska M.A. Coordinate regulation of N-glycosylation gene DPAGT1, canonical Wnt signaling and E-cadherin adhesion.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analyses revealed low levels of CTHRC1 in AE, but prominent expression in OSCC (Fig. 1D), with the majority of CTHRC1 localizing to cells at the invasive tumor front (data not shown). Immunoblots confirmed that AE had very low levels of CTHRC1 compared with OSCC, which exhibited increases in CTHRC1 abundance of >50-fold (n = 9) (Fig. 1F). Next, we examined the N-glycosylation status of CTHRC1 in OSCC. Immunoblot analyses revealed tha"

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in airway remodelling. In this study, we hypothesized that infiltrating eosinophils promote airway remodelling in bronchial asthma. To demonstrate this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of eosinophils on EMT by in vitro and in vivo studies. EMT was assessed in mice that received intra-tracheal instillation of mouse bone marrow derived eosinophils and in human bronchial epithelial cells co-cultured with eosinophils freshly purified from healthy individuals or with eosinophilic leukemia cell lines. Intra-tracheal instillation of eosinophils was associated with enhanced bronchial inflammation and fibrosis and increased lung concentration of growth factors. Mice instilled with eosinophils pre-treated with transforming growth factor(TGF)-β1 siRNA had decreased bronchial wall fibrosis compared to controls. EMT was induced in bronchial epithelial cells co-cultured with human eosinophils and it was associated with increased expression of TGF-β1 and Smad3 phosphorylation in the bronchial epithelial cells. Treatment with anti-TGF-β1 antibody blocked EMT in bronchial epithelial cells. Eosinophils induced EMT in bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting their contribution to the pathogenesis of airway remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W2077118198,"Transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool to obtain large amount genome-scale gene expression profiles. Despite its extensive usage to diverse biological problems in the last decade, transcriptomic researches approaching the zebrafish embryonic development have been very limited. Several recent studies have made great progress in this direction, yet the large gap still exists, especially regarding to the transcriptome dynamics of embryonic stages from early gastrulation onwards. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis about the transcriptomes of 9 different stages covering 7 major periods (cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, hatching and early larval stage) in zebrafish development, by recruiting the RNA-sequencing technology. We detected the expression for at least 24,065 genes in at least one of the 9 stages. We identified 16,130 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between stages and were subsequently classified into six clusters. Each revealed gene cluster had distinct expression patterns and characteristic functional pathways, providing a framework for the understanding of the developmental transcriptome dynamics. Over 4000 genes were identified as preferentially expressed in one of the stages, which could be of high relevance to stage-specific developmental and molecular events. Among the 68 transcription factor families active during development, most had enhanced average expression levels and thus might be crucial for embryogenesis, whereas the inactivation of the other families was likely required by the activation of the zygotic genome. We discussed our RNA-seq data together with previous findings about the Wnt signaling pathway and some other genes with known functions, to show how our data could be used to advance our understanding about these developmental functional elements. Our study provides ample information for further study about the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W1997284339,"Parasitic salmon lice are potentially harmful to salmonid hosts and farm produced lice pose a threat to wild salmonids. To control salmon lice infections in Norwegian salmonid farming, numbers of lice are regularly counted and lice abundance is reported from all salmonid farms every month. We have developed a stochastic space-time model where monthly lice abundance is modelled simultaneously for all farms. The set of farms is regarded as a network where the degree of contact between farms depends on their seaway distance. The expected lice abundance at each farm is modelled as a function of i) lice abundance in previous months at the same farm, ii) at neighbourhood farms, and iii) other, unspecified sources. In addition, the model includes explanatory variables such as seawater temperature and farm-numbers of fish. The model gives insight into factors that affect salmon lice abundance and contributing sources of infection. New findings in this study were that 66% of the expected salmon lice abundance was attributed to infection within farms, 28% was attributed to infection from neighbourhood farms and 6% to non-specified sources of infection. Furthermore, we present the relative risk of infection between neighbourhood farms as a function of seaway distance, which can be viewed as a between farm transmission kernel for salmon lice. The present modelling framework lays the foundation for development of future scenario simulation tools for examining the spread and abundance of salmon lice on farmed salmonids under different control regimes."

However, there have been no investigations comparing the effects of exercise during verbal encoding versus exercise prior to encoding on long-term memory performance. In this current psychoneuroendocrinological study we aim to test whether light to moderate ergometric bicycling during vocabulary encoding enhances subsequent recall compared to encoding during physical rest and encoding after being physically active. Furthermore, we examined the kinetics of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in serum which has been previously shown to correlate with learning performance. We also controlled for the BDNF val66met polymorphism. We found better vocabulary test performance for subjects that were physically active during the encoding phase compared to sedentary subjects. Post-hoc tests revealed that this effect was particularly present in initially low performers. BDNF in serum and BDNF genotype failed to account for the current result. Our data indicates that light to moderate simultaneous physical activity during encoding, but not prior to encoding, is beneficial for subsequent recall of new items."
https://openalex.org/W1990613850,"Beclin-1 is a key regulator of autophagy that functions in the context of two phase-specific complexes in the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes. Its known interacting proteins include autophagy effectors, Bcl-2 family members, and organelle membrane anchor proteins. Here we report a newly identified interaction between Beclin-1 and the protein tyrosine kinase receptor Her2. We demonstrate that in Her2-expressing breast carcinoma cells that do not succumb to lapatinib, this Her1/2 inhibitor disrupts the cell surface interaction between Her2 and Beclin-1. The data suggest that the ensuing autophagic response is correlatively associated with the release of Beclin-1 from its complex with Her2 and with the subsequent increase in cytosolic Beclin-1. Upon its interaction with Her2, Beclin-1 up-regulates the phosphorylation levels of Her2 and Akt. The Beclin-1 evolutionarily conserved domain is required both for the interaction of Beclin-1 with Her2 and for the increased Her2 and Akt phosphorylation. These findings shed new light on mechanisms involved in lapatinib-mediated autophagy in Her2-expressing breast carcinoma cell lines and in Beclin-1 signaling in these cells."

In animal models, mesenchymal stem cells have been used successfully to regenerate cartilage and bones. However, there have been no follow-up studies on humans treated with adipose-tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the chondromalacia patellae. To obtain ADSCs, lipoaspirates were obtained from lower abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. The stromal vascular fraction was separated from the lipoaspirates by centrifugation after treatment with collagenase. The stem-cell-containing stromal vascular fraction was mixed with calcium chloride-activated platelet rich plasma and hyaluronic acid, and this ADSCs mixture was then injected under ultrasonic guidance into the retro-patellar joints of all three patients. Patients were subjected to pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Pre- and post-treatment subjective pain scores and physical therapy assessments measured clinical changes. One month after the injection of autologous ADSCs, each patient's pain improved 50–70%. Three months after the treatment, the patients' pain improved 80–90%. The pain improvement persisted over 1 year, confirmed by telephone follow ups. Also, all three patients did not report any serious side effects. The repeated magnetic resonance imaging scans at three months showed improvement of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages) on the patellae-femoral joints. In patients with chondromalacia patellae who have continuous anterior knee pain, percutaneous injection of autologous ADSCs may play an important role in the restoration of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages). Thus, ADSCs treatment presents a glimpse of a new promising, effective, safe, and non-surgical method of treatment for chondromalacia patellae."

The association between concentrations of serum carotenoids, and intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery wall was explored in 840 middle-aged men (aged 46-65 years) from Eastern Finland. Ultrasonography of the common carotid arteries were performed at baseline and 7-year follow-up. Serum levels of carotenoids were analyzed at baseline. Changes in mean and maximum intima media thickness of carotid artery wall were related to baseline serum carotenoid levels in covariance analyses adjusted for covariates.In a covariance analysis with adjustment for age, ultrasound sonographer, maximum intima media thickness, examination year, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, physical activity, serum LDL cholesterol, family history of coronary heart disease, antihypertensive medication and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein, 7-year change in maximum intima media thickness was inversely associated with lycopene (p = 0.005), α-carotene (p = 0.002) and β-carotene (p = 0.019), respectively.The present study shows that high serum concentrations of carotenoids may be protective against early atherosclerosis."

Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is clinical used in treating severe EV71 infections. However, the discovery of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of EV71 infection illustrates the complex roles of antibody in controlling EV71 infection. In this study, to identify the distinct role of each IgG subclass on neutralization and enhancement of EV71 infection, different lots of pharmaceutical IVIG preparations manufactured from Chinese donors were used for IgG subclass fractionation by pH gradient elution with the protein A-conjugated affinity column. The neutralization and ADE capacities on EV71 infection of each purified IgG subclass were then assayed, respectively. The neutralizing activity of human IVIG is mainly mediated by IgG1 subclass and to less extent by IgG2 subclass. Interestingly, IgG3 fraction did not have neutralizing activity but enhanced EV71 infection in vitro. These results revealed the different roles of human IgG subclasses on EV71 infection, which is of critical importance for the rational design of immunotherapy and vaccines against severe EV71 diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2133527488,"Biomarkers are required for pre-symptomatic diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a favored source because its proteome reflects the composition of the brain. Ideal biomarkers have low technical and inter-individual variability (subject variance) among control subjects to minimize overlaps between clinical groups. This study evaluates a process of multi-affinity fractionation (MAF) and quantitative label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for CSF biomarker discovery by (1) identifying reparable sources of technical variability, (2) assessing subject variance and residual technical variability for numerous CSF proteins, and (3) testing its ability to segregate samples on the basis of desired biomarker characteristics.Fourteen aliquots of pooled CSF and two aliquots from six cognitively normal individuals were randomized, enriched for low-abundance proteins by MAF, digested endoproteolytically, randomized again, and analyzed by nano-LC-MS. Nano-LC-MS data were time and m/z aligned across samples for relative peptide quantification. Among 11,433 aligned charge groups, 1360 relatively abundant ones were annotated by MS2, yielding 823 unique peptides. Analyses, including Pearson correlations of annotated LC-MS ion chromatograms, performed for all pairwise sample comparisons, identified several sources of technical variability: i) incomplete MAF and keratins; ii) globally- or segmentally-decreased ion current in isolated LC-MS analyses; and iii) oxidized methionine-containing peptides. Exclusion of these sources yielded 609 peptides representing 81 proteins. Most of these proteins showed very low coefficients of variation (CV<5%) whether they were quantified from the mean of all or only the 2 most-abundant peptides. Unsupervised clustering, using only 24 proteins selected for high subject variance, yielded perfect segregation of pooled and individual samples.Quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS can measure scores of CSF proteins with low technical variability and can segregate samples according to desired criteria. Thus, this technique shows potential for biomarker discovery for neurological diseases."

Moreover, a reduced reelin expression has been observed in several brain regions of subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Since a number of reports have documented presence of vocal and neuromotor abnormalities in patients with autism and suggested that these dysfunctions predate the onset of the syndrome, we performed a fine-grain characterization of the neonatal vocal and motor repertoire in reelin mutant mice to explore the developmental precursors of the disorder. Our findings evidence a general delay in motor and vocal development in heterozygous (50% reduced reelin) and reeler (lacking reelin gene) mutant mice. As a whole, an increased number of calls characterized heterozygous pup's emission. Furthermore, the typical ontogenetic peak in the number of calls characterizing wild-type pups on postnatal day 4 appeared slightly delayed in heterozygous pups (to day 6) and was quite absent in reeler littermates, which exhibited a flat profile during development. We also detected a preferential use of a specific call category (two-components) by heterozygous and reeler mice at postnatal days 6 and 8 as compared to their wild-type littermates. With regard to the analysis of spontaneous movements, a differential profile emerged early in development among the three genotypes. While only slight coordination difficulties are exhibited by heterozygous pups, all indices of motor development appear delayed in reeler mice. Overall, our results evidence a genotype-dependent deviation in ultrasonic vocal repertoire and a general delay in motor development in reelin mutant pups."
https://openalex.org/W2076671137,"Bats have been proposed as major reservoirs for diverse emerging infectious viral diseases, with rabies being the best known in Europe. However, studies exploring the ecological interaction between lyssaviruses and their natural hosts are scarce. This study completes our active surveillance work on Spanish bat colonies that began in 1992. Herein, we analyzed ecological factors that might affect the infection dynamics observed in those colonies. Between 2001 and 2011, we collected and tested 2,393 blood samples and 45 dead bats from 25 localities and 20 bat species. The results for dead confirmed the presence of EBLV-1 RNA in six species analyzed (for the first time in Myotis capaccinii). Samples positive for European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1)–neutralizing antibodies were detected in 68% of the localities sampled and in 13 bat species, seven of which were found for the first time (even in Myotis daubentonii, a species to date always linked to EBLV-2). EBLV-1 seroprevalence (20.7%) ranged between 11.1 and 40.2% among bat species and seasonal variation was observed, with significantly higher antibody prevalence in summer (July). EBLV-1 seroprevalence was significantly associated with colony size and species richness. Higher seroprevalence percentages were found in large multispecific colonies, suggesting that intra- and interspecific contacts are major risk factors for EBLV-1 transmission in bat colonies. Although bat-roosting behavior strongly determines EBLV-1 variability, we also found some evidence that bat phylogeny might be involved in bat-species seroprevalence. The results of this study highlight the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding EBLV-1–prevalence patterns in bat colonies and also provide useful information for public health officials."

Significance: The Pgp3 structure provides insight into its role in chlamydial pathogenesis. Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterial pathogen of different serovars that infect human ocular and urogenital tract epithelial cells. C. trachomatis infection of the urogenital tract is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the world (1.Da Ros C.T. Schmitt Cda S. Global epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases.Asian J. Androl. 2008; 10: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate 50 million new cases occur every year. Left untreated, the infection can lead to complications such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility (2.den Hartog J.E. Morré S.A. Land J.A.

Host inflammatory responses induced by C. trachomatis infection are thought to contribute to pathogenicity (4.Stephens R.S. The cellular paradigm of chlamydial pathogenesis.Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 44-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The infection starts with the entry of an infectious elementary body into an epithelial cell via pathogen-induced endocytosis (5.Clifton D.R. Fields K.A. Grieshaber S.S. Dooley C.A. Fischer E.R.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9947-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The internalized elementary body rapidly differentiates to become a noninfectious but metabolically active reticulate body. After replication, the progeny reticulate bodies differentiate back to elementary bodies before exiting to invade adjacent cells (7.Hybiske K. Stephens R.S.

All C. trachomatis organisms possess a highly conserved cryptic plasmid encoding eight open reading frames, the protein products of which are designated Pgp1–8 (8.Li Z. Chen D. Zhong Y. Wang S.

Plasmid gene products are also known to regulate the expression of more than 20 genome-encoded genes (11.Carlson J.H. Whitmire W.M. Crane D.D. Wicke L. Virtaneva K. Sturdevant D.E. Kupko 3rd, J.J.

When depleted of the cryptic plasmid, C. trachomatis ocular serovar A is unable to induce pathology in monkey ocular tissues (12.Kari L. Whitmire W.M. Olivares-Zavaleta N. Goheen M.M. Taylor L.D.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 4027-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that the plasmid-encoded factors act in chlamydial pathogenesis. A recently developed chlamydial plasmid transformation system (14.Wang Y. Kahane S. Cutcliffe L.T. Skilton R.J. Lambden P.R. Clarke I.N. Development of a transformation system for Chlamydia trachomatis. Restoration of glycogen biosynthesis by acquisition of a plasmid shuttle vector.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002258Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) permits investigation of plasmid-encoded protein function (15.Song L.

Pgp1, 2, 6, and 8 are required for plasmid maintenance. Pgp4 deletion transformants demonstrate reduced expression of Pgp3 and other plasmid-encoded genes as well as glgA in the chlamydial genome, resulting in a lack of glycogen accumulation in the inclusion. Pgp4 therefore appears to be a regulator of chlamydial gene expression (11.Carlson J.H. Whitmire W.M. Crane D.D. Wicke L. Virtaneva K. Sturdevant D.E. Kupko 3rd, J.J. Porcella S.F. Martinez-Orengo N.

Immun. 2008; 76: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the roles of Pgp3, 5, and 7 in chlamydial biology remain unknown. Pgp3 is a ∼84-kDa homotrimeric protein (16.Chen D. Lei L. Lu C. Galaleldeen A. Hart P.J. Zhong G. Characterization of Pgp3, a Chlamydia trachomatis plasmid-encoded immunodominant antigen.J.

The chlamydial plasmid-encoded protein pgp3 is secreted into the cytosol of Chlamydia-infected cells.Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3415-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is one of the most immunodominant antigens in mammals infected by chlamydial organisms (18.Budrys N.M. Gong S. Rodgers A.K. Wang J. Louden C. Shain R. Schenken R.S. Zhong G.

A genome-wide profiling of the humoral immune response to Chlamydia trachomatis infection reveals vaccine candidate antigens expressed in humans.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 1670-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Human antibody recognition of Pgp3 is dependent on its trimeric quaternary structure (16.Chen D. Lei L. Lu C. Galaleldeen A. Hart P.J. Zhong G. Characterization of Pgp3, a Chlamydia trachomatis plasmid-encoded immunodominant antigen.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 6017-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Purified Pgp3 is known to stimulate macrophages to release inflammatory cytokines (8.Li Z. Chen D. Zhong Y. Wang S. Zhong G. The chlamydial plasmid-encoded protein pgp3 is secreted into the cytosol of Chlamydia-infected cells.Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3415-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and vaccination with Pgp3 provides partial protection against challenge infection with chlamydial organisms (20.Donati M. Sambri V. Comanducci M. Di Leo K. Storni E. Giacani L. Ratti G. Cevenini R. DNA immunization with pgp3 gene of Chlamydia trachomatis inhibits the spread of chlamydial infection from the lower to the upper genital tract in C3H/HeN mice.Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that the protein plays a prominent role in chlamydial pathogenesis and as such could be a promising vaccine antigen candidate. However, the precise role of Pgp3 in chlamydial pathogenesis and immunity remains unknown despite being the subject of extensive microbiological, immunological, and biochemical studies. To better understand its action, we determined the structure of Pgp3 using the established tools of single crystal x-ray diffraction. The structure determination was a challenge, however, because crystals of the full-length protein suffer from diffuse scattering (21.Caspar D.L. Clarage J. Salunke D.M. Clarage M. Liquid-like movements in crystalline insulin.Nature. 1988; 332: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), limiting the resolution of the experimental electron density map. Although the protein backbone of the C-terminal domain (CTD) 4The abbreviations used are: CTDC-terminal domainNTDN-terminal domainTHCCtriple-helical coiled-coilPDBProtein Data BankRMSDroot mean square deviation. could be traced, the density for most of the triple helical coiled-coil and the N-terminal domain (NTD) was too weak and/or convoluted to permit interpretation. C-terminal domain N-terminal domain triple-helical coiled-coil Protein Data Bank root mean square deviation. A “divide-and-conquer” approach yielded high resolution structures of two Pgp3 truncation variants, providing detailed visualizations of the globular NTD and the trimeric arrangement of independently folded CTDs. The refined structures of these globular domains were positioned into the experimental electron density map of the full-length protein. Phase combination substantially improved the electron density and permitted the determination and refinement of the full-length molecule. The structure reveals that Pgp3 is an elongated baton-like molecule with CTDs similar to members of the TNF family of cytokines. The NTD possesses a previously unobserved fold with internal pseudo-3-fold symmetry in which the three polypeptide chains intertwine and swap structural elements. The globular domains are connected by a parallel, triple-helical coiled-coil (THCC) with an unusual right-handed twist. The recent development of a chlamydial plasmid transformation system (14.Wang Y. Kahane S. Cutcliffe L.T. Skilton R.J. Lambden P.R. Clarke I.N. Development of a transformation system for Chlamydia trachomatis. Restoration of glycogen biosynthesis by acquisition of a plasmid shuttle vector.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002258Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), combined with knowledge of the Pgp3 structure presented here, provides powerful tools to probe the role of the molecule in chlamydial pathogenesis and may assist in vaccine development. DNA encoding full-length C. trachomatis Pgp3 from serovar D was PCR-amplified, subcloned into a pGEX vector, and transformed into Escherichia coli strain B834 (DE3). This construct encodes GST fused to the N terminus of Pgp3 separated by a protease cleavage site. Six liters of cells were grown at 37 °C for 20 h in minimal medium lacking methionine but containing selenomethionine (22.Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. Selenomethionyl proteins produced for analysis by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD). A vehicle for direct determination of three-dimensional structure.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The temperature was decreased to 16 °C when the cells reached an A600 of 0.6, and expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were shaken overnight, harvested by centrifugation, and frozen at −20 °C. Thawed cells were resuspended in ∼50 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 400 mm NaCl, and Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, disrupted by sonication on ice, and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Pharmacia) in batch mode, and after washing with column buffer, the fusion protein was cleaved with GST-tagged PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). Cleaved Pgp3 was released into the supernatant, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), loaded onto a mono Q column (Pharmacia), washed with five column volumes of buffer, and eluted in a single step using 0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). All of the solutions used in this process (as well as the purification processes below) contained the reducing agent tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine at a concentration of 2 mm. The full-length Pgp3 protein, estimated to be ∼98% pure by SDS-PAGE, was dialyzed into crystallization buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and concentrated to 17 mg/ml using the calculated extinction coefficient of 14,440 m−1 cm−1. Truncation variant constructs were generated by PCR with C. trachomatis serovar D plasmid DNA and the appropriate primers. The first encoded the CTD alone (residues 113–264). The second construct was engineered to encode Pgp3 lacking the THCC (residues 72–116), resulting in a NTD-CTD fusion (hereafter referred to as the NCD fusion). DNA fragments encoding the Pgp3 truncation variants were subcloned into pAG8H, a modified pET19d vector with a tobacco etch virus-cleavable His8 tag fused to the N terminus of the target protein (23.Seetharaman S.V. Taylor A.B. Holloway S. Hart P.J. Structures of mouse SOD1 and human/mouse SOD1 chimeras.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 503: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both variants were expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3) cells as described previously, except frozen cells were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, and Sigma protease inhibitor mixture. Cleared supernatants were loaded onto a GE Healthcare Life Sciences His-Trap nickel column, washed with buffer made 0.1 m in imidazole, and eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (0.1–0.5 m). The Pgp3-containing fractions, identified by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and incubated with His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease overnight at 20 °C. The solution was again passed over the His-Trap nickel column, and the His tag-free proteins were collected. Pgp3 truncation variants were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), loaded onto a mono Q column, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1–0.5 m) in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The proteins were dialyzed into crystallization buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using extinction coefficients of 9970 and 12,950 m−1 cm−1 for the CTD and NCD fusion proteins, respectively. The mass of each purified Pgp3 truncation variant was verified using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Full-length, CTD, and NCD fusion Pgp3 crystals were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (24.McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1999Google Scholar). Selenomethionine-substituted full-length Pgp3 was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 30% PEG 550 MME and 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8). Irregular prisms appeared within 2 days and were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen using the same solution as the cryoprotectant. Selenomethionine-substituted Pgp3 CTD protein was mixed with an equal volume of solution containing 1.2 m sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 8.2). Hexagonal plates appeared in 2 days. Reservoir solution made 20% (v/v) in glycerol was used as the cryoprotectant for flash cooling. The NCD fusion protein was mixed with an equal volume of solution containing 20% PEG 6000 and 0.1 m trisodium citrate. Rod-shaped crystals appeared within 1 week. Reservoir solution made 8% (v/v) in glycerol was used as the cryoprotectant for flash cooling. All diffraction data were taken at the Northeastern Collaborative Access Team Beamlines 24-ID-E or 24-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source. The data sets were indexed, processed, and scaled using the HKL-2000 program suite (25.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38520) Google Scholar). The program SHELXD (26.Sheldrick G.M. A short history of SHELX.Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80533) Google Scholar) identified 22 of the 24 expected selenium sites in the full-length Pgp3 protein. Useful multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phases were calculated in autoSHARP (27.Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Automated structure solution with autoSHARP.Methods Mol.

Cowtan K. Coot. Model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23213) Google Scholar). This CTD trace of the full-length protein was used to guide the design of a Pgp3 CTD expression construct, the structure of which was determined using SAD phasing in the program autoSHARP. The 2.0 Å electron density map was of quality sufficient to permit ARP/WARP (30.Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. The ARP/WARP suite for automated construction and refinement of protein models.in: Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography.

Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14423) Google Scholar) using the CTD structure from above as the search model. noncrystallographic symmetry averaging over the three trimers in the asymmetric unit permitted the tracing of the intertwined NTD portion of the molecule. The NCD fusion protein structure was refined with the PHENIX program suite. The newly refined structures of the CTD and the NTD were positioned into the original full-length Pgp3 electron density map with PHASER and refined in PHENIX. Phase combination with phase extension to 3.1 Å in SHARP improved the quality of the electron density map, permitting the THCC to be constructed. Alternating cycles of crystallographic refinement in PHENIX and manual model adjustment in COOT yielded the full-length Pgp3 structure. The figures were created using PyMOL (version 1.5.0.4; Schrödinger). Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic calculations were performed using the programs PDB2QR (33.Dolinsky T.J. Czodrowski P. Li H. Nielsen J.E. Jensen J.H. Klebe G. Baker N.A. PDB2PQR.

Protein structure refinement statistics are presented in Table 2. The experimental electron density map revealed Pgp3 to be an elongated protein with two globular domains connected by weak density for a coiled-coil. Only the CTD portion of the map permitted confident tracing of the polypeptide chain.

The backbone atoms of the subunits superimpose with RMSDs averaging 0.20 Å. Each subunit possesses a β-barrel jelly roll fold consisting of 10 antiparallel β-strands, with a sheet containing β1, β4, β7, and β10 at the trimer interface and a sheet containing β3, β5, β6, and β8 facing the solvent (Fig. 1c). The short strands β2 and β9 “cap” one end of the β-barrel. β9 harbors Trp-234, the only tryptophan residue in the Pgp3 sequence. Trp-234 sits in a shallow groove formed by β2, β9, and the loop connecting β9 to β10, such that both polar and apolar portions of its indole ring are solvent-exposed. The walls of the depression prevent the Trp-234 side chain from sampling other conformations (see “Discussion”). The loop elements connecting β2 to β3 and β5 to β6 project outward, normal to the barrel's long axis. A metal ion coordinated by symmetry-related side chain hydroxyl moieties of Tyr-197 side chains and three water molecules is positioned at the entrance of a solvent-filled channel that penetrates the trimer (Fig. 1d). The octahedral coordination geometry, the presence of 1.2 m sodium/potassium phosphate, and the absence of “difference” features in electron density maps calculated with coefficients Fo − Fc suggest that the metal is a fully occupied potassium ion.

https://openalex.org/W2097588082,"Atherosclerosis is considered a disease of chronic inflammation largely initiated and perpetuated by macrophage-dependent synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) expressed on macrophages plays a key role in this process. However, how SR-A-mediated pro-inflammatory response is modulated in macrophages remains ill defined. Here through immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, we reported major vault protein (MVP) as a novel binding partner for SR-A. The interaction between SR-A and MVP was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and chemical cross-linking assay. Treatment of macrophages with fucoidan, a SR-A ligand, led to a marked increase in TNF-α production, which was attenuated by MVP depletion. Further analysis revealed that SR-A stimulated TNF-α synthesis in macrophages via the caveolin- instead of clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway linked to p38 and JNK, but not ERK, signaling pathways. Importantly, fucoidan invoked an enrichment of MVP in lipid raft, a caveolin-reliant membrane structure, and enhanced the interaction among SR-A, caveolin, and MVP. Finally, we demonstrated that MVP elimination ameliorated SR-A-mediated apoptosis in macrophages. As such, MVP may fine-tune SR-A activity in macrophages which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1986410584,"Background Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes through the past years. In previous studies, the usefulness of these genetic markers for prediction of diabetes was found to be limited. However, differences may exist between substrata of the population according to the presence of major diabetes risk factors. This study aimed to investigate the added predictive value of genetic information (42 single nucleotide polymorphisms) in subgroups of sex, age, family history of diabetes, and obesity. Methods A case-cohort study (random subcohort N = 1,968; incident cases: N = 578) within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Potsdam study was used. Prediction models without and with genetic information were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the integrated discrimination improvement. Stratified analyses included subgroups of sex, age (<50 or ≥50 years), family history (positive if either father or mother or a sibling has/had diabetes), and obesity (BMI< or ≥30 kg/m2). Results A genetic risk score did not improve prediction above classic and metabolic markers, but – compared to a non-invasive prediction model – genetic information slightly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (difference [95%-CI]: 0.007 [0.002–0.011]). Stratified analyses showed stronger improvement in the older age group (0.010 [0.002–0.018]), the group with a positive family history (0.012 [0.000–0.023]) and among obese participants (0.015 [−0.005–0.034]) compared to the younger participants (0.005 [−0.004–0.014]), participants with a negative family history (0.003 [−0.001–0.008]) and non-obese (0.007 [0.000–0.014]), respectively. No difference was found between men and women. Conclusion There was no incremental value of genetic information compared to standard non-invasive and metabolic markers. Our study suggests that inclusion of genetic variants in diabetes risk prediction might be useful for subgroups with already manifest risk factors such as older age, a positive family history and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2093431146,"Plants have evolved complex processes to ward off attacks by insects. In parallel, insects have evolved mechanisms to thwart these plant defenses. To gain insight into mechanisms that mediate this arms race between plants and herbivorous insects, we investigated the interactions between gramine, a toxin synthesized by plants of the family Gramineae, and glutathione S transferase (GST), an enzyme found in insects that is known to detoxify xenobiotics. Here, we demonstrate that rice (Oryza sativa), a hydrophytic plant, also produces gramine and that rice resistance to brown planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens, BPHs) is highly associated with in planta gramine content. We also show that gramine is a toxicant that causes BPH mortality in vivo and that knockdown of BPH GST gene nlgst1-1 results in increased sensitivity to diets containing gramine. These results suggest that the knockdown of key detoxification genes in sap-sucking insects may provide an avenue for increasing their sensitivity to natural plant-associated defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2098162697,"Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an often fatal disease caused by the reactivation of the JC virus (JCV). Better understanding of viral-host interactions has been hampered by the lack of an animal model. Engrafting NOD/SCID/IL-2-Rg (null) mice with human lymphocytes and thymus, we generated a novel animal model for JCV infection. Mice were inoculated with either a PML isolate, JCV Mad-4, or with JCV CY, found in the kidney and urine of healthy individuals. While mice remained asymptomatic following inoculation, JCV DNA was occasionally detected in both the blood and the urine compartments. Mice generated both humoral and cellular immune responses against JCV. Expressions of immune exhaustion marker, PD-1, on lymphocytes were consistent with response to infection. Using this model we present the first in vivo demonstration of virological and immunological differences between JCV Mad-4 and CY. This model may prove valuable for studying JCV host immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2005874157,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has properties that can be exploited for the development of gene therapy vectors. The neurotropism of HSV enables delivery of therapeutic genes to the nervous system. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), we constructed an HSV-1(17(+))-based replicative vector deleted of the neurovirulence gene γ134.5, and expressing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a transgene for treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE is an inducible T-cell mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is used as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Demyelination and inflammation are hallmarks of both diseases. LIF is a cytokine that has the potential to limit demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss in CNS autoimmune diseases and to affect the T-cell mediated autoimmune response. In this study SJL/J mice, induced for EAE, were treated with a HSV-LIF vector intracranially and the subsequent changes in disease parameters and immune responses during the acute disease were investigated. Replicating HSV-LIF and its DNA were detected in the CNS during the acute infection, and the vector spread to the spinal cord but was non-virulent. The HSV-LIF significantly ameliorated the EAE and contributed to a higher number of oligodendrocytes in the brains when compared to untreated mice. The HSV-LIF therapy also induced favorable changes in the expression of immunoregulatory cytokines and T-cell population markers in the CNS during the acute disease. These data suggest that BAC-derived HSV vectors are suitable for gene therapy of CNS disease and can be used to test the therapeutic potential of immunomodulatory factors for treatment of EAE."
https://openalex.org/W1981532594,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are resistant to environmental degradation and can cause multitude of health problems. Cytochrome P450 1A (Cyp1a) is often up-regulated by POPs through the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway and is thus usually used as a biomarker for xenobiotics exposure. To develop a convenient in vivo tool to monitor xenobiotic contamination in the water, we have established GFP transgenic medaka using the inducible cyp1a promoter, Tg(cyp1a:gfp). Here we tested Tg(cyp1a:gfp) medaka at three different stages, prehatching embryos, newly hatched fry and adult with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodiebnzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a dioxin. While GFP induction was observed in all three stages, newly hatched fry were the most sensitive with the lowest observed effective concentration of 0.005 nM or 16.1 ng/L. The highly sensitive organs included the kidney, liver and intestine. With high concentrations of TCDD, several other organs such as the olfactory pit, tail fin, gills, lateral line neuromast cells and blood vessels also showed GFP expression. In addition, Tg(cyp1a:gfp) medaka fry also responded to two other AhR agonists, 3-methylcholanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene, for GFP induction, but no significant GFP induction was observed towards several other chemicals tested, indicating the specificity of this transgenic line. The GFP inducibility of Tg(cyp1a:gfp) medaka at both fry and adult stages may be useful for development of high-throughput assays as well as online water monitoring system to detect xenobiotic toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1999871368,"We identified an IARS (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase) c.235G>C (p.Val79Leu) substitution as the causative mutation for neonatal weakness with intrauterine growth retardation (perinatal weak calf syndrome). In Japanese Black cattle, the syndrome was frequently found in calves sired by Bull A. Hence, we employed homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis. In order to identify the perinatal weak calf syndrome locus in a 4.04-Mb region of BTA 8, we analysed a paternal half-sibling family with a BovineSNP50 BeadChip and microsatellites. In this critical region, we performed exome sequencing to identify a causative mutation. Three variants were detected as possible candidates for causative mutations that were predicted to disrupt the protein function, including a G>C (p.Val79Leu) mutation in IARS c.235. The IARS c.235G>C mutation was not a homozygous risk allele in the 36 healthy offspring of Bull A. Moreover, the IARS Val79 residue and its flanking regions were evolutionarily and highly conserved. The IARS mutant (Leu79) had decreased aminoacylation activity. Additionally, the homozygous mutation was not found in any of 1526 healthy cattle. Therefore, we concluded that the IARS c.235G>C mutation was the cause of hereditary perinatal weak calf syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2004354217,"Sensory experience powerfully shapes cortical sensory representations during an early developmental ""critical period"" of plasticity. In the rat primary auditory cortex (A1), the experience-dependent plasticity is exemplified by significant, long-lasting distortions in frequency representation after mere exposure to repetitive frequencies during the second week of life. In the visual system, the normal unfolding of critical period plasticity is strongly dependent on the elaboration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which promotes the establishment of inhibition. Here, we tested the hypothesis that BDNF signaling plays a role in the experience-dependent plasticity induced by pure tone exposure during the critical period in the primary auditory cortex. Elvax resin implants filled with either a blocking antibody against BDNF or the BDNF protein were placed on the A1 of rat pups throughout the critical period window. These pups were then exposed to 7 kHz pure tone for 7 consecutive days and their frequency representations were mapped. BDNF blockade completely prevented the shaping of cortical tuning by experience and resulted in poor overall frequency tuning in A1. By contrast, BDNF infusion on the developing A1 amplified the effect of 7 kHz tone exposure compared to control. These results indicate that BDNF signaling participates in the experience-dependent plasticity induced by pure tone exposure during the critical period in A1."
https://openalex.org/W2094200623,"DNA damage can occur due to environmental insults or intrinsic metabolic processes and is a major threat to genome stability. The DNA damage response is composed of a series of well coordinated cellular processes that include activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, transient cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and reentry into the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that mutant cells defective for TOR complex 2 (TORC2) or the downstream AGC-like kinase, Gad8, are highly sensitive to chronic replication stress but are insensitive to ionizing radiation. We show that in response to replication stress, TORC2 is dispensable for Chk1-mediated cell cycle arrest but is required for the return to cell cycle progression. Rad52 is a DNA repair and recombination protein that forms foci at DNA damage sites and stalled replication forks. TORC2 mutant cells show increased spontaneous nuclear Rad52 foci, particularly during S phase, suggesting that TORC2 protects cells from DNA damage that occurs during normal DNA replication. Consistently, the viability of TORC2-Gad8 mutant cells is dependent on the presence of the homologous recombination pathway and other proteins that are required for replication restart following fork replication stalling.

Significance: TORC2 is required to maintain genome stability in fission yeast, a function that may be evolutionarily conserved. TOR is an atypical protein kinase that was isolated as the target of the immunosuppressive and anticancer drug rapamycin. TOR belongs to the PIKK (phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase) family of proteins and plays central roles in growth, proliferation, and survival (1Dazert E.

Other members of this family include the ATM and ATR protein kinases, which have well established roles in maintaining genome integrity (3Lovejoy C.A. Cortez D. Common mechanisms of PIKK regulation.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Abnormal regulation of the human homologue, mTOR, is the cause of several human diseases, including cancer, multiple hamartoma syndrome, diabetes, and obesity (1Dazert E. Hall M.N. mTOR signaling in disease.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 744-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 2Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). TOR proteins can be found in two distinct evolutionarily conserved complexes, known as TORC1 3The abbreviations used are: TORC1 and -2, TOR complex 1 and 2, respectively; HU, hydroxyurea; MMS, methyl-methane sulfonate; IR, ionizing radiation; HR, homologous recombination; CPT, camptothecin; Ch16, minichromosome 16. and TORC2. TORC1 is the main target for inhibition by rapamycin, whereas TORC2 is insensitive or far less sensitive to the drug (4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H.

The ability to inhibit TORC1 by rapamycin facilitated extensive studies of the TORC1 complex, whereas the cellular roles of TORC2 are less well understood. However, recent studies have revealed key roles of TORC2 in metabolism, cell survival, and proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 2Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). Accordingly, TORC2 deregulation has been implicated in cancer and metabolic disorders (1Dazert E. Hall M.N. mTOR signaling in disease.Curr. Opin.

Several features of TORC2 appear highly conserved in evolution, including the composition of the subunits that make up the complex and several cellular functions, such as actin organization and protein synthesis (7Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. TOR signaling in growth and metabolism.Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4671) Google Scholar). More recently, it was suggested that activation of TORC2 by association with the ribosomes is also conserved (8Zinzalla V. Stracka D. Oppliger W. Hall M.N. Activation of mTORC2 by association with the ribosome.Cell. 2011; 144: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, in fission yeast, TORC1 and TORC2 oppositely regulate several cellular functions, including expression of nitrogen starvation-induced genes, sexual development, and mitotic entry (16Weisman R.

Biol. 2011; 1: 110007Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, an underlying mechanism(s) for TORC2 activity in cell biology is largely missing in fission yeast as well as in other model systems. TORC2 mediates most if not all of its functions via phosphorylation and activation of the AGC kinase, Gad8 (19Matsuo T. Kubo Y. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M.

Accordingly, deletion of gad8+ results in a very similar phenotype to that of Δtor1 mutants (19Matsuo T. Kubo Y. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M.

Fission yeast TOR complex 2 activates the AGC-family Gad8 kinase essential for stress resistance and cell cycle control.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). More recently, it was also shown that in fission yeast, TORC2 is activated by the Rab family GTPase, Ryh1 (27Tatebe H. Shiozaki K. Rab small GTPase emerges as a regulator of TOR complex 2.Small Gtpases. 2010; 1: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recently, our genome-wide expression profiling of Δtor1 cells revealed an extensive overlap between gene expression in Δtor1 and in cells mutated for chromatin remodelers (21Schonbrun M. Laor D. López-Maury L. Bähler J. Kupiec M. Weisman R. TOR complex 2 controls gene silencing, telomere length maintenance, and survival under DNA-damaging conditions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4584-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that TORC2 is required for gene silencing at heterochromatic regions, such as the mating type locus and the subtelomeric regions. TORC2 mutant cells (Δtor1 or Δste20) or Δgad8 cells also show elongated telomeres (21Schonbrun M. Laor D. López-Maury L. Bähler J. Kupiec M. Weisman R. TOR complex 2 controls gene silencing, telomere length maintenance, and survival under DNA-damaging conditions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4584-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Like many chromatin-modulating mutants, the TORC2-Gad8 module is required for cell survival under DNA-damaging conditions. Loss of function of TORC2 or Gad8 results in severe sensitivity to chronic exposure to hydroxyurea (HU) or to methyl-methane sulfonate (MMS). Initial studies showed that TORC2 mutant cells transiently arrest cell cycle progression in response to HU but fail to dephosphorylate and activate Cdc2 upon removal of HU (21Schonbrun M. Laor D. López-Maury L. Bähler J. Kupiec M. Weisman R. TOR complex 2 controls gene silencing, telomere length maintenance, and survival under DNA-damaging conditions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4584-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, about 40% of TORC2 mutant cells (Δtor1) arrested in HU with septa, indicating a delay in cytokinesis. Because this delay may represent an effect of HU that is not linked with DNA damage (28Moynihan E.B. Enoch T.

Cell division defects of Schizosaccharomyces pombe liz1− mutants are caused by defects in pantothenate uptake.Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we set out to examine the effect of additional DNA-damaging agents on TORC2 mutant cells and to explore in more detail the DNA damage-sensitive phenotype of TORC2-Gad8 mutant cells. We show here that, in striking contrast to the extreme sensitivity to replication stresses, such as HU, MMS, or camptothecin, TORC2-Gad8 mutant cells are not sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR), which produces double strand breaks that are repaired at the G2 phase of the cell cycle. We show that in the absence of TORC2-Gad8, cells spontaneously accumulate Rad52 foci, which may represent DNA damage sites (30Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Rad52 forms DNA repair and recombination centers during S phase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 31Alvaro D. Lisby M. Rothstein R. Genome-wide analysis of Rad52 foci reveals diverse mechanisms impacting recombination.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 2439-2449Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Consistent with accumulation of DNA damage, we uncovered synthetic genetic interactions between mutations in TORC2-Gad8 and mutations in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. TORC2 mutant cells are sensitive to chronic but not transient replication stress. This sensitivity is independent of checkpoint activation through Chk1 phosphorylation, but termination of the checkpoint signal is delayed. We suggest that the inability of TORC2 mutant cells to cope with chronic DNA-damaging conditions represents a failure to terminate the checkpoint signal, either through a direct mechanism or due to accumulation of unrepaired lesions. S. pombe strains are described in Table 1. All experiments were performed by using standard genetic and molecular yeast techniques as described (32Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Molecular genetic analysis of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured in YES medium at 30 °C, as described previously (9Weisman R. Choder M.

For cell survival assays, HU (H8627, Sigma), MMS (129925, Sigma) or camptothecin (CPT) (C9911, Sigma) was added at the indicated concentrations. For UV and ionizing radiation, logarithmic growing cells were serially diluted, plated on YES medium, and exposed to UV using a UV Stratalinker 1800 cross-linker (Stratagene) or exposed to ionizing radiation using γ-radiation at 7.4 grays/min from a cesium-137 source.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceTA000972 h−Laboratory stockTA298tor1::his1+ leu1-32 ura4-D18 ade6-M216 his1-102 h+ pIRT2-tor1+Laboratory stockTA390tor1::ura4+ ura4-D18Laboratory stockTA788swi1::kanMX leu1-32 ura4-D18 h−P.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence imaging of nuclei and septa was carried out as described previously (33Forsburg S.L. Rhind N. Basic methods for fission yeast.Yeast. 2006; 23: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using a Nikon eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope and photographed using a Nikon digital camera (DXM1200) and the ACT1 software. Rad52-YFP-expressing strains were cultured in yeast extract and imaged live using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. For quantification of foci, at least 750 nuclei were scored in three independent experiments. For Western blot analysis, proteins were extracted with TCA as described previously (34Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. The B subunit of the DNA polymerase α-primase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae executes an essential function at the initial stage of DNA replication.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-PAGE using 8% acrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% milk in TBST (0.05% Tween). Chk1 activation was detected by probing the membrane with anti-HA antibody (catalog no. 7392, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)). Cdc2 was detected by anti-PSTAIRE (catalog no. 53, Santa Cruz). Recombination frequencies were determined by fluctuation tests as described previously (35Osman F. Adriance M. McCready S. The genetic control of spontaneous and UV-induced mitotic intrachromosomal recombination in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Curr. Genet. 2000; 38: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For each strain, 12 independent colonies were used for each assay, and each assay was repeated independently at least three times. For each assay, single colonies grown on YE medium were resuspended in sterile water, and cells were plated onto EMMG without adenine for the selection of Ade+ recombinants and onto complete EMMG (supplemented with adenine, uracil, leucine, and histidine at a final concentration of 225 mg/liter each) for determination of cell titers. The Ade+ recombinants on the selective plates were replica-plated onto EMMG lacking adenine and histidine to determine the proportion of conversion type (Ade+ His+) and deletion type (Ade+ His−) recombinants. For each strain, the average recombinant rate was determined using the median method as described (36Lea D. Coulson C. The distribution of the numbers of mutants in bacterial populations.J. Genet. 1949; 49: 264-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Cells from individual Ade+ colonies were plated on adenine-limiting YE plates, incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days and then at 4 °C for 1–2 overnight periods to allow deepening of the red color in Ade− colonies. The frequency of chromosome loss was determined as the number of colonies with a red sector equal to half of the colony divided by the sum of white and sectored colonies. We previously reported that Δtor1, Δste20, Δsin1, or Δgad8 strains, defective in the TORC2-Gad8 pathway, are highly sensitive to chronic exposure to HU or MMS (21Schonbrun M. Laor D. López-Maury L. Bähler J. Kupiec M. Weisman R. TOR complex 2 controls gene silencing, telomere length maintenance, and survival under DNA-damaging conditions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4584-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1). These two drugs are known to interfere with S phase progression, either by depletion of dNTPs in the case of HU or via blocking the progression of the replication fork by DNA alkylation in the case of MMS. We further assessed the sensitivity of TORC2-Gad8 mutant cells to additional DNA-damaging agents: CPT, UV, and IR. The cytotoxicity associated with CPT is highly S phase-specific. CPT stabilizes covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complexes by preventing the religation step of topoisomerase I, thus leading to collision of DNA replication forks with the drug-enzyme-DNA complex (37Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F.

Capasso H. Walworth N.C. The topoisomerase I poison camptothecin generates a Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint signal in fission yeast.Yeast. 1999; 15: 821-828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UV irradiation halts DNA replication by producing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that block the progression of replicative polymerases (39Sinha R.P. Häder D.P. UV-induced DNA damage and repair. A review.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2002; 1: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 40Michel B. Grompone G. Florès M.J. Bidnenko V. Multiple pathways process stalled replication forks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12783-12788Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, the primary toxic effect of IR is the induction of double strand breaks, which are repaired in G2 phase (41Rhind N. Russell P. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe S-phase checkpoint differentiates between different types of DNA damage.Genetics. 1998; 149: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that deletion of each of the genes encoding specific TORC2 components resulted in cells that are highly sensitive to chronic exposure to CPT (Fig. 1A). The sensitivity of Δtor1 or Δgad8 deletion strains to CPT is rescued by deletion of top1+, which encodes topoisomerase I (Fig. 1B), indicating that TORC2 mutant cells are sensitive to CPT due to its toxic effect when associated with Top1. Deletion mutants in the TORC2-Gad8 pathway were also mildly sensitive to UV irradiation (Fig. 1A). In striking contrast, Δtor1, Δste20, Δsin1, or Δgad8 mutant strains are as resistant as wild type cells to high doses of IR, unlike the strong sensitivity of Δrad3 mutant cells to these conditions (Fig. 1A). Because HU, MMS, and CPT are known to impair fork replication progress, these findings suggest that the TORC2-Gad8 pathway is particularly required for tolerance of ge"

Here, we investigated the response of the salivary proteins alpha-amylase (sAA), chromogranin A (sCgA), and the concentration of total protein (sTP) as well as salivary nitrite (sNO2) in relation to plasma catecholamines and plasma nitrite (pNO2), respectively. The variation in these markers was compared to the intensity and load of training during a 21-week training season in 12 elite swimmers. Overall, the salivary proteins tracked the concentration of plasma adrenaline and were inversely correlated with the training outcomes. No correlations were observed between sNO2 and pNO2. However, sNO2 correlated positively with the intensity and load of training. We argue that the decrease in sympathetic activity is responsible for the decrease in the concentration of proteins throughout the training season. Furthermore, the increase in nitrite is likely to reflect changes in hemodynamics and regulation of vascular tone. The association of the salivary markers with the training outcomes underlines their potential as noninvasive markers of training status in professional athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2022400971,"The timing and progression of axonal myelination are precisely controlled by intercellular interactions between neurons and glia in development. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that Nectin like 4 (Necl-4, also known as cell adhesion molecule Cadm-4 or SynCAM-4) plays an essential role in axonal myelination by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the role of Necl-4 protein in axonal myelination in the developing central nervous system (CNS) has remained unknown. In this study, we discovered upregulation of Necl-4 expression in mature oligodendrocytes at perinatal stages when axons undergo active myelination. We generated Necl4 gene knockout mice, but found that disruption of Necl-4 gene did not affect oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation in the CNS. Surprisingly, disruption of Necl-4 had no significant effect on axonal myelination in the PNS either. Therefore, our results demonstrated that Necl-4 is dispensable for axonal myelination in the developing nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1989753828,"Activation of the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors on progenitor cells may be a viable approach to enhance the effects of stem cell-based therapies by improving cell retention and engraftment. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of the first small molecule agonist identified for the integrin α4β1 (also known as very late antigen-4 or VLA-4). The agonist, THI0019, was generated via two structural modifications to a previously identified α4β1 antagonist. THI0019 greatly enhanced the adhesion of cultured cell lines and primary progenitor cells to α4β1 ligands VCAM-1 and CS1 under both static and flow conditions. Furthermore, THI0019 facilitated the rolling and spreading of cells on VCAM-1 and the migration of cells toward SDF-1α. Molecular modeling predicted that the compound binds at the α/β subunit interface overlapping the ligand-binding site thus indicating that the compound must be displaced upon ligand binding. In support of this model, an analog of THI0019 modified to contain a photoreactive group was used to demonstrate that when cross-linked to the integrin, the compound behaves as an antagonist instead of an agonist. In addition, THI0019 showed cross-reactivity with the related integrin α4β7 as well as α5β1 and αLβ2. When cross-linked to αLβ2, the photoreactive analog of THI0019 remained an agonist, consistent with it binding at the α/β subunit interface and not at the ligand-binding site in the inserted (""I"") domain of the αL subunit. Co-administering progenitor cells with a compound such as THI0019 may provide a mechanism for enhancing stem cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2066122361,"Background & Aims Our previous results showed that the knockdown of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) by RNA interference (RNAi) led to upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in primary hepatocytes. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the cellular signaling pathways recognizing RNA molecules may be involved the ISG stimulation by RNAi. Methods Primary murine hepatocytes (PMHs) from wild type mice and WHV transgenic (Tg) mice were prepared and treated with defined siRNAs. The mRNA levels of target genes and ISGs were detected by real-time RT-PCR. The involvement of the signaling pathways including RIG-I/MDA5, PKR, and TLR3/7/8/9 was examined by specific inhibition and the analysis of their activation by Western blotting. Results In PMHs from WHV Tg mice, specific siRNAs targeting WHV, mouse β-actin, and GAPDH reduced the levels of targeted mRNAs and increased the mRNA expression of IFN-β, MxA, and IP-10. The enhanced ISG expression by siRNA transfection were abolished by siRNA-specific 2′-O-methyl antisense RNA and the inhibitors 2-AP and chloroquine blocking PKR and other TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Furthermore, Western blotting revealed that RNAi results in an increase in PKR phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-êB, indicating the possible role of IRF3 in the RNAi-directed induction of ISGs. In contrast, silencing of RIG-I and MDA5 failed to block RNAi-mediated MxA induction. Conclusions RNAi is capable of enhancing innate immune responses through the PKR- and TLR-dependent signaling pathways in primary hepatocytes. The immune stimulation by RNAi may contribute to the antiviral activity of siRNAs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2162303245,"Heteromerization can play an important role in regulating the activation and/or signal transduction of most forms of receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The study of receptor heteromerization has evolved extensively with the emergence of resonance energy transfer based approaches such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Here, we report an adaptation of our Receptor-Heteromer Investigation Technology (Receptor-HIT) that has recently been published as the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Heteromer Identification Technology (GPCR-HIT). We now demonstrate the utility of this approach for investigating RTK heteromerization by examining the functional interaction between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR; also known as erbB1/HER1) and heregulin (HRG) receptor 3 (HER3; also known as erbB3) in live HEK293FT cells using recruitment of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) to the activated receptors. We found that EGFR and HER3 heteromerize specifically as demonstrated by HRG inducing a BRET signal between EGFR/Rluc8 and Grb2/Venus only when HER3 was co-expressed. Similarly, EGF stimulation promoted a specific BRET signal between HER3/Rluc8 and Grb2/Venus only when EGFR was co-expressed. Both EGF and HRG effects on Grb2 interaction are dose-dependent, and specifically blocked by EGFR inhibitor AG-1478. Furthermore, truncation of HER3 to remove the putative Grb2 binding sites appears to abolish EGF-induced Grb2 recruitment to the EGFR-HER3 heteromer. Our results support the concept that EGFR interacts with Grb2 in both constitutive and EGF-dependent manners and this interaction is independent of HER3 co-expression. In contrast, HER3-Grb2 interaction requires the heteromerization between EGFR and HER3. These findings clearly indicate the importance of EGFR-HER3 heteromerization in HER3-mediated Grb2-dependent signaling pathways and supports the central role of HER3 in the diversity and regulation of HER family functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2055491033,"Objective To investigate factors associated with a woman’s willingness to pay (WTP) for injectable contraceptives in Tigray, Ethiopia. Methods We used a multistage random sampling design to generate a representative sample of reproductive age women from the Central Zone of Tigray, Ethiopia to participate in a survey (N = 1490). Respondents who had ever used injectable contraceptives or who were interested in using them were asked whether they would be willing to pay, and if so, how much. Logistic regression odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values were used to assess which factors were associated with WTP in our final model. Findings On average, respondents were willing to pay 11 birr ($0.65 USD) per injection. Being married, completing any amount of education, having given birth, and having visited a health facility in the last 12 months (whether received family planning information or not) were associated with statistically significantly increased odds of WTP. Having initiated sexual activity and having 1–2 children (compared to 0 children) were associated with statistically significantly decreased odds of WTP. We also detected two significant interactions. Among women who prefer injectable contraceptives, their odds of WTP for injectable contraceptives vary across length of time they have used them. And among women who work for pay, their odds of WTP for injectable contraceptives vary by whether they agree with their husband/partner about the ideal number of children. Conclusion In a sector that continually struggles with funding, cost recovery for contraceptive services may offer a means of improved financial sustainability while increasing rural access to injectable contraceptives. Results indicate there are opportunities for cost recovery in rural Tigray, Ethiopia and highlight factors that could be leveraged to increase WTP for injectable contraceptives."
https://openalex.org/W2026290633,"ATP hydrolysis fuels the ability of helicases and related proteins to translocate on nucleic acids and separate base pairs. As a consequence, nucleic acid binding stimulates the rate at which a helicase catalyzes ATP hydrolysis. In this study, we searched a library of small molecule helicase inhibitors for compounds that stimulate ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase, which is an important antiviral drug target. Two compounds were found that stimulate HCV helicase-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, both of which are amide derivatives synthesized from the main component of the yellow dye primuline. Both compounds possess a terminal pyridine moiety, which was critical for stimulation. Analogs lacking a terminal pyridine inhibited HCV helicase catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Unlike other HCV helicase inhibitors, the stimulatory compounds differentiate between helicases isolated from various HCV genotypes and related viruses. The compounds only stimulated ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by NS3 purified from HCV genotype 1b. They inhibited helicases from other HCV genotypes (e.g. 1a and 2a) or related flaviviruses (e.g. Dengue virus). The stimulatory compounds interacted with HCV helicase in the absence of ATP with dissociation constants of about 2 μm. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the stimulatory compounds bind in the HCV helicase RNA-binding cleft near key residues Arg-393, Glu-493, and Ser-231.Background: DNA/RNA stimulates the ATPase function of a helicase by an unclear mechanism.Results: A primuline derivative specifically stimulates the ATPase function of only the HCV genotype 1b NS3 helicase.Conclusion: Small molecules can mimic RNA to stimulate the NS3 ATPase by binding near NS3 residues Arg-393, Glu-493, and Ser-231.Significance: Compounds reveal key residues needed for ATP hydrolysis to fuel helicase movements. ATP hydrolysis fuels the ability of helicases and related proteins to translocate on nucleic acids and separate base pairs. As a consequence, nucleic acid binding stimulates the rate at which a helicase catalyzes ATP hydrolysis. In this study, we searched a library of small molecule helicase inhibitors for compounds that stimulate ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase, which is an important antiviral drug target. Two compounds were found that stimulate HCV helicase-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, both of which are amide derivatives synthesized from the main component of the yellow dye primuline. Both compounds possess a terminal pyridine moiety, which was critical for stimulation. Analogs lacking a terminal pyridine inhibited HCV helicase catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Unlike other HCV helicase inhibitors, the stimulatory compounds differentiate between helicases isolated from various HCV genotypes and related viruses.

They inhibited helicases from other HCV genotypes (e.g. 1a and 2a) or related flaviviruses (e.g. Dengue virus).

https://openalex.org/W2074559497,"While shared decision making (SDM) promotes health-related decisions that are informed, value-based and adhered to, few studies report on theory-based approaches to SDM adoption by healthcare professionals. We aimed to identify the factors influencing dietitians' intentions to adopt two SDM behaviours: 1) present dietary treatment options to patients and 2) help patients clarify their values and preferences.We conducted a cross-sectional postal survey based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour among 428 randomly selected dietitians working in clinical practice across the Province of Quebec, Canada. We performed descriptive analyses and multiple regression analyses to determine the variables that explained the variance in intention to perform the behaviours.A total of 203 dietitians completed the questionnaire. Their ages were from 23 to 66 and they had been practising dietetics for 15.4±11.1 years (mean ± SD). On a scale from 1 to 7 (from strongly disagree to strongly agree), dietitians' intentions to present dietary treatment options and to clarify their patients' values and preferences were 5.00±1.14 and 5.68±0.74, respectively. Perceived behavioural control (β = 0.56, ρ<0.0001), subjective norm (β = 0.16, ρ<0.05), and moral norm (β = 0.22, ρ<0.0001), were the factors significantly predicting the intention to present dietary treatment options, while perceived behavioural control (β = 0.60, ρ<0.0001), attitude (β = 0.20, ρ<0.05), and professional norm (β = 0.22, ρ<0.001), significantly predicted the intention to help patients' clarify their values and preferences.Our results showed that dietitians intend to adopt the two SDM behaviours studied. Factors influencing intention were different for each behaviour, except for perceived behavioural control which was common to both behaviours. Thus, perceived behavioural control could be a key factor in interventions aiming to encourage implementation of SDM by dietitians."
https://openalex.org/W2046212785,"The motor output for walking is produced by a network of neurons termed the spinal central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion. The basic building block of this CPG is a half-center oscillator composed of two mutually inhibitory sets of interneurons, each controlling one of the two dominant phases of locomotion: flexion and extension. To investigate symmetry between the two components of this oscillator, we analyzed the statistics of natural variation in timing during fictive locomotion induced by stimulation of the midbrain locomotor region in the cat. As a complement to previously published analysis of these data focused on burst and cycle durations, we present a new analysis examining the strength of phase locking at the transitions between flexion and extension. Across our sample of nerve pairs, phase locking at the transition from extension to flexion (E to F) is stronger than at the transition from flexion to extension (F to E). This pattern did not reverse when considering bouts of fictive locomotion that were flexor vs. extensor dominated, demonstrating that asymmetric locking at the transitions between phases is dissociable from which phase dominates cycle duration. We also find that the strength of phase locking is correlated with the mean latency between burst offset and burst onset. These results are interpreted in the context of a hypothesis where network inhibition and intrinsic oscillatory mechanisms make distinct contributions to flexor-extensor alternation in half-center networks."
https://openalex.org/W2049580551,"Many proteins are observed to localize to the poles within bacterial cells. Some bacteria show unipolar localization, yet under different conditions bipolar patterns can emerge. One mechanism for spontaneous polar localization has been shown to involve the combination of protein aggregation and nucleoid occlusion. Whether the different observed patterns represent global energy minima for the cellular system remains to be determined. In this paper we show that for a model consisting only of protein aggregation along with an excluded volume effect due to the DNA polymer, that unipolar patterns are the global energy ground state regardless of protein concentration and DNA density. We extend the model to allow for proteins to be added to the cellular volume at a constant rate and show that bipolar (or multi-foci) patterns emerge as the result of the system being kinetically trapped in a local energy minimum. Lastly we also consider the situation of a growing cell that starts with a pre-existing aggregate at one of the poles and determine conditions under which either unipolar or bipolar patterns can exist at the point when it is ready to divide. This work sheds new interpretations on recently published experimental data and suggests experiments to test whether such a mechanism can drive patterning in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2077540375,"Background Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) commonly co-exist. Some patients with unidentified ARAS may undergo cardiac surgery. While acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent and serious complication of cardiac surgery, we aim to evaluate the influence of ARAS on the occurrence of postoperative AKI in patients with normal or near-normal baseline renal function following cardiac surgery. Methods A total of 212 consecutive patients undergoing aortography after coronary angiography and cardiac surgery were retrospectively studied for their preoperative and intraoperative conditions. AKI was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl (≥26.4 µmol/l) or a percentage increase in creatinine of more than or equal to 50% (1.5-fold from baseline) after cardiac surgery. A propensity score-adjusted logistic regression models was used in estimating the effect of ARAS on the risk of postoperative AKI. Results ARAS (≥50%) was observed in 50 (23.6%) patients, and 83 (39.2%) developed AKI after cardiac surgery. A correlation existed between renal artery patency and preoperative–to–postoperative %ΔCr in patients with ARAS (r = 0.297, P<0.0001). The propensity score-adjusted regression model showed the occurrence of postoperative AKI in patients with ARAS was significantly higher than those without ARAS (OR 2.858, 95% CI 1.260–6.480, P = 0.011). Conclusion ARAS is associated with postoperative AKI in patients with normal or near-normal baseline renal function after cardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2090465374,"Animals are able to learn to identify persistent threats to themselves and their offspring. For example, birds are able to quickly learn to discriminate between humans that have previously threatened their nests from humans with whom they have had no prior experience. However, no study has yet examined whether a bird's ability to discriminate between humans is related to the bird's underlying behavioural type. In this study, we examined whether there were differences among North Island (NI) robins (Petroica longipes), based on their underlying behavioural type, in their abilities to discriminate between familiar and novel human observers. Using a simple feeding experiment, we timed how long it took birds to attack a food item placed next to an observer on each of 7 days. On the eighth day, a different observer timed the birds. We found that birds could be split into two behaviour types based on their attack behaviour: fast attackers (latencies <20 sec) and slow attackers (latencies >20 secs). Interestingly, the fast birds did not increase their attack latency in response to the novel observer whereas the slow attackers did. This result, for the first time, demonstrates that a bird's ability to discriminate between humans can vary among birds based on their behavioural type."
https://openalex.org/W2016749948,"Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) has become a major leading cause of nosocomial endocarditis. Treatment of such infections remains problematic and new therapeutic options are needed. Nine E. faecalis strains were tested: six obtained from patients presenting endocarditis, one with isolated bacteremia, and two reference strains. Antibiotics included daptomycin, alone or in combination, linezolid, tigecycline, rifampicin, gentamicin, teicoplanin, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin. Time-kill studies included colony counts at 1, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Significant bactericidal activity was defined as a decrease of ≥3log10CFU/ml after 24 h of incubation. Antibiotics were tested at a low (10(6) CFU/ml) and high (10(9) CFU/ml) inoculum, against exponential- and stationary-phase bacteria. We also performed time kill studies of chemically growth arrested E. faecalis. Various pH conditions were used during the tests. In exponential growth phase and with a low inoculum, daptomycin alone at 60 µg/ml and the combination amoxicillin-gentamicin both achieved a 4-log10 reduction in one hour on all strains. In exponential growth phase with a high inoculum, daptomycin alone was bactericidal at a concentration of 120 µg/ml. All the combinations tested with this drug were indifferent. In stationary phase with a high inoculum daptomycin remained bactericidal but exhibited a pH dependent activity and slower kill rates. All combinations that did not include daptomycin were not bactericidal in conditions of high inoculum, whatever the growth phase. The results indicate that daptomycin is the only antibiotic that may be able of overcoming the effects of growth phase and high inoculum."
https://openalex.org/W2041130442,"Objective An experienced sonographer can by listening to the Doppler audio signals perceive various timbres that distinguish different types of umbilical artery flow despite an unchanged pulsatility index (PI). Our aim was to develop an objective measure of the Doppler audio signals recorded from fetoplacental circulation in a sheep model. Methods Various degrees of pathological flow velocity waveforms in the umbilical artery, similar to those in human complicated pregnancies, were induced by microsphere embolization of the placental bed (embolization model, 7 lamb fetuses, 370 Doppler recordings) or by fetal hemodilution (anemia model, 4 lamb fetuses, 184 recordings). A subjective 11-step operator auditory scale (OAS) was related to conventional Doppler parameters, PI and time average mean velocity (TAM), and to sound frequency analysis of Doppler signals (sound frequency with the maximum energy content [MAXpeak] and frequency band at maximum level minus 15 dB [MAXpeak-15 dB] over several heart cycles). Results We found a negative correlation between the OAS and PI: median Rho −0.73 (range −0.35– −0.94) and −0.68 (range −0.57– −0.78) in the two lamb models, respectively. There was a positive correlation between OAS and TAM in both models: median Rho 0.80 (range 0.58–0.95) and 0.90 (range 0.78–0.95), respectively. A strong correlation was found between TAM and the results of sound spectrum analysis; in the embolization model the median r was 0.91 (range 0.88–0.97) for MAXpeak and 0.91 (range 0.82–0.98) for MAXpeak-15 dB. In the anemia model, the corresponding values were 0.92 (range 0.78–0.96) and 0.96 (range 0.89–0.98), respectively. Conclusion Audio-spectrum analysis reflects the subjective perception of Doppler sound signals in the umbilical artery and has a strong correlation to TAM-velocity. This information might be of importance for clinical management of complicated pregnancies as an addition to conventional Doppler parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1994163205,"This study describes a simple technique that improves a recently developed 3D sub-diffraction imaging method based on three-photon absorption of commercially available quantum dots. The method combines imaging of biological samples via tri-exciton generation in quantum dots with deconvolution and spectral multiplexing, resulting in a novel approach for multi-color imaging of even thick biological samples at a 1.4 to 1.9-fold better spatial resolution. This approach is realized on a conventional confocal microscope equipped with standard continuous-wave lasers. We demonstrate the potential of multi-color tri-exciton imaging of quantum dots combined with deconvolution on viral vesicles in lentivirally transduced cells as well as intermediate filaments in three-dimensional clusters of mouse-derived neural stem cells (neurospheres) and dense microtubuli arrays in myotubes formed by stacks of differentiated C2C12 myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2016020119,"Purpose To assess the optimal time point of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for early prognosis of breast cancer following tamoxifen therapy using a methylnitrosourea (MNU)-induced ER-positive breast-cancer model. Methods Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 15 for group 1; n = 10 for group 2) were used. All animals (50 days old) were intravenously injected with MNU (50 mg/kg body weight) to induce ER-positive mammary tumors. When tumors were approximately 2 cm in diameter, DWI was performed on days 0, 3, and 7, and intratumoral apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured. Therapy started on day 0 with tamoxifen (10 mg/kg diet) and continued for 4 weeks for group 1, but only 1 week for group 2, while tumor volume was measured by caliper twice weekly. All animals of group 2 were euthanized on day 7 after imaging, and Ki-67, TUNEL, ERα, and ERβ staining were performed on tumor tissue. Results DW images of MNU-induced mammary tumors were successfully obtained with minimal motion artifact. For group 1, ADC change for 3 days after therapy initiation (ADC3D) was significantly correlated with tumor-volume change until day 11, but the significant correlation between ADC change for 7 days (ADC7D) and the tumor-volume change was observed until day 18. Similarly, for group 2, either ADC7D or ADC3D was significantly correlated with the tumor-volume change, but the higher significance was observed for ADC7D. Furthermore, ADC7D was significantly correlated with apoptotic (TUNEL stained), proliferative (Ki-67 stained), and ERβ-positive cell densities, but ADC3D was not significantly correlated with any of those. Conclusions ADC7D might be a more reliable surrogate imaging biomarker than ADC3D to assess effectiveness of tamoxifen therapy for ER-positive breast cancer, which may enable personalized treatment. The significant correlation between ADC7D and ERβ-positive cell density suggests that ERβ may play an important role as a therapeutic indicator of tamoxifen."
