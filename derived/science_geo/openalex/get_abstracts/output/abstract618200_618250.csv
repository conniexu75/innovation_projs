https://openalex.org/W2890457018,"Multiple clinical and epidemiological studies have provided estimates of fibromyalgia prevalence and sex ratio, but different criteria sets and methodology, as well as bias, have led to widely varying (0.4%->11%) estimates of prevalence and female predominance (>90% to <61%). In general, studies have failed to distinguish Criteria based fibromyalgia (CritFM) from Clinical fibromyalgia (ClinFM). In the current study we compare CritFM with ClinFM to investigate gender and other biases in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.We used a rheumatic disease databank and 2016 fibromyalgia criteria to study prevalence and sex ratios in a selection biased sample of 1761 referred and diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and in an unbiased sample of 4342 patients with no diagnosis with respect to fibromyalgia. We compared diagnostic and clinical variables according to gender, and we reanalyzed a German population study (GPS) (n = 2435) using revised 2016 criteria for fibromyalgia.In the selection-biased sample of referred patients with fibromyalgia, more than 90% were women. However, when an unselected sample of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was studied for the presence of fibromyalgia, women represented 58.7% of fibromyalgia cases. Women had slightly more symptoms than men, including generalized pain (36.8% vs. 32.4%), count of 37 symptoms (4.7 vs. 3.7) and mean polysymptomatic distress scores (10.2 vs. 8.2). We also found a linear relation between the probability of being females and fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia severity. Women in the GPS represented 59.2% of cases.The perception of fibromyalgia as almost exclusively (≥90%) a women's disorder is not supported by data in unbiased studies. Using validated self-report criteria and unbiased selection, the female proportion of fibromyalgia cases was ≤60% in the unbiased studies, and the observed CritFM prevalence of fibromyalgia in the GPS was ~2%. ClinFM is the public face of fibromyalgia, but is severely affected by selection and confirmation bias in the clinic and publications, underestimating men with fibromyalgia and overestimating women. We recommend the use of 2016 fibromyalgia criteria for clinical diagnosis and epidemiology because of its updated scoring and generalized pain requirement. Fibromyalgia and generalized pain positivity, widespread pain (WPI), symptom severity scale (SSS) and polysymptomatic distress (PSD) scale should always be reported."

To achieve the most suitable option for their degradation, it is necessary to implement chemical, physical and biological treatments, as well as combining procedures. Best treatment was prognosticated by Plackett-Burman Experimental Design (PB), evaluating five factors with two levels (0.25 mM or 1.0 gL-1 glucose, 1.0 or 2.0 mM CuSO4, 0.1 or 0.2 mM ABTS [2, 20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)], pH 4.5 ± 0.2 or 7.0 ± 0.2 and 30 or 90 day incubation), which was reproduced for 150 days. Therefore, PB identified a sequential treatment (plasma followed by fungus) for partial LDPE biodeterioration. Sheets were pretreated with glow discharge plasma (O2, 3.0 x 10(-2) mbar, 600 V, 6 min.), followed by Pleurotus ostreatus biodeterioration. Fungus growth, colonization percentage, and pigment generation followed. Laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activities were appraised. Additionally, contact angle (CA), functional group presence and changes and carbonyl and vinyl indices (Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy) were evaluated. LDPE surface changes were assessed by Young's modulus, yield strength, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Plasma discharge increased hydrophilicity, decreasing CA by 76.57% and increasing surface roughness by 99.81%. P. ostreatus colonization was 88.72% in 150 days in comparison with untreated LDPE (45.55%). After this treatment carbonyl groups (C = O), C = C insaturations, high hydrophilicity CA (16 ± 4) °, and low surface roughness (7 ± 2) nm were observed. However, the highest Lac and LiP activities were detected after 30 days (Lac: 2.817 U Lac g-1 and LiP: 70.755 U LiP g-1). In addition, highest MnP activity was observed at day 120 (1.097 U MnP g-1) only for P. ostreatus treated LDPE. Plasma favored P. ostreatus adsorption, adherence, growth and colonization (88.72%), as well as partial LDPE biodeterioration, supported by increased hydrophilicity and presence of specific functional chemical groups. The approximate 27% changes in LDPE physical properties support its biodeterioration."
https://openalex.org/W2890219652,"Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the major diseases that impact rice production in Asia. The bacteria use transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) to hijack the host transcription machinery and activate key susceptibility (S) genes, specifically members of the SWEET sucrose uniporters through the recognition of effector-binding element (EBEs) in the promoter regions. However, natural variations in the EBEs that alter the binding affinity of TALEs usually prevent sufficient induction of SWEET genes, leading to resistance phenotypes. In this study, we identified candidate resistance alleles by mining a rice diversity panel for mutations in the promoter of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET14, which are direct targets of three major TALEs PthXo2, PthXo3 and AvrXa7. We found natural variations at the EBE of both genes, which appeared to have emerged independently in at least three rice subspecies. For OsSWEET13, a 2-bp deletion at the 5th and 6th positions of the EBE, and a substitution at the 17th position appear to be sufficient to prevent activation by PthXo2. Similarly, a single nucleotide substitution at position 10 compromised the induction of OsSWEET14 by AvrXa7. These findings might increase our opportunities to reduce pathogen virulence by preventing the induction of SWEET transporters. Pyramiding variants along with other resistance genes may provide durable and broad-spectrum resistance to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2890374132,"Background While links between intimate-partner violence (IPV) and HIV risk have been established, less is known about violence perpetrated by people other than intimate partners. In addition, much of the research on IPV has been conducted with adults, while relatively little is known about violence experienced by adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). We examined experiences of sexual violence and associated sexual and mental health among AGYW in Kenya and Zambia. Methods Using cross-sectional surveys with women aged 15–24 years, we assessed experience of partner sexual violence among respondents who reported a boyfriend/husband in the last 12 months (Kenya N = 597; Zambia N = 426) and non-partner sexual violence among all respondents (Kenya N = 1778; Zambia N = 1915). We conducted logistic regression analyses to examine experiences of sexual violence and health outcomes. Results Sexual violence from intimate partners over the last year was reported by 19.1 percent of AGYW respondents in Kenya and 22.2 percent in Zambia; sexual violence from non-partners was reported by 21.4 percent in Kenya and 16.9 percent in Zambia. Experience of sexual violence was associated with negative health outcomes. Violence from non-partners was associated with increased odds of STI symptoms and increased levels of anxiety and depression. Results were similar for violence from partners, although only significant in Kenya. While sexual violence from a non-partner was associated with increased HIV risk perception, it was not associated when the violence was experienced from an intimate partner. Conclusions AGYW reported high levels of sexual violence from both intimate partners and non-partners. These experiences were associated with negative health outcomes, though there were some differences by country context. Strengthening sexual violence prevention programs, increasing sexual violence screening, and expanding the provision of post-violence care are needed to reduce intimate and non-partner violence and the effects of violence on AGYW."
https://openalex.org/W2892159932,"Responding to modern day environmental challenges for societal well-being and prosperity necessitates the integration of science into policy and practice. This has spurred the development of novel institutional structures among research organisations aimed at enhancing the impact of environmental science on policy and practice. However, such initiatives are seldom evaluated and even in cases where evaluations are undertaken, the results are rarely made publicly available. As such there is very little empirically grounded guidance available to inform other organisations in this regard. To help address this, the aim of this study is to evaluate the Baltic Eye Project at Stockholm University–a unique team consisting of researchers from different fields, science communicators, journalists and policy analysts–working collectively to support evidence-informed decision-making relating to the sustainable management of the Baltic Sea environment. Specifically, through qualitative interviews, we (1) identify the impacts achieved by the Baltic Eye Project; (2) understand the challenges and barriers experienced throughout the Baltic Eye Project; and (3) highlight the key features that are needed within research organisations to enhance the impact of science on policy and practice. Results show that despite only operating for three years, the Baltic Eye Project has achieved demonstrable impacts on a range of levels: impacts on policy and practice, impacts to individuals working within the organisation and impacts to the broader University. We also identify a range of barriers that have limited impacts to date, such as a lack of clear goals at the establishment of the Baltic Eye Project and existing metrics of academic impact (e.g. number of publications). Finally, based on the experiences of employees at the Baltic Eye Project, we identify the key organisational, individual, financial, material, practical, political, and social features of university-based boundary organisations that have impact on policy and practice. In doing so this paper provides empirically-derived guidance to help other research organisations increase their capacity to achieve tangible impacts on environmental policy and practice."
https://openalex.org/W2892286309,"Head-fixed behavioral tasks can provide important insights into cognitive processes in rodents. Despite the widespread use of this experimental approach, there is only limited knowledge of how differences in task parameters, such as motivational incentives, affect overall task performance. Here, we provide a detailed methodological description of the setup and procedures for training mice efficiently on a two-choice lick left/lick right visual discrimination task. We characterize the effects of two distinct restriction regimens, i.e. food and water restriction, on animal wellbeing, activity patterns, task acquisition, and performance. While we observed reduced behavioral activity during the period of food and water restriction, the average animal discomfort scores remained in the ‘sub-threshold’ and ‘mild’ categories throughout the experiment, irrespective of the restriction regimen. We found that the type of restriction significantly influenced specific aspects of task acquisition and engagement, i.e. the number of sessions until the learning criterion was reached and the number of trials performed per session, but it did not affect maximum learning curve performance. These results indicate that the choice of restriction paradigm does not strongly affect animal wellbeing, but it can have a significant effect on how mice perform in a task."
https://openalex.org/W2891920733,"Recent studies demonstrate that astroglial cells can be directly converted into functional neurons or oligodendrocytes. Here, we report that a single transcription factor Sox10 could reprogram astrocytes into oligodendrocyte-like cells, in vivo. For transdifferentiation, Sox10-GFP expressing viral particles were injected into cuprizone-induced demyelinated mice brains after which we assessed for the presence of specific oligodendrocyte lineage cell markers by immunohistofluorescence (IHF). As control, another group of demyelinated mice received GFP expressing viral particles. After 3 weeks, the majority of transduced (GFP+) cells in animals which received control vector were astrocytes, while in animals which received Sox10-GFP vector, the main population of GFP+ cells were positive for oligodendrocyte lineage markers. We also extracted primary astrocytes from mouse pups and purified them. Primary astrocytes were transduced in vitro and then transplanted into demyelinated brains for later fate mapping. After three weeks, in vitro transduced and then transplanted astrocytes showed oligodendrocyte progenitor and mature oligodendrocyte markers. Further confirmation was done by transduction of astrocytes with lentiviral particles that expressed Sox10 and GFP and their culture in the oligodendrocyte progenitor medium. The induced cells expressed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (iOPCs) markers. Our findings showed the feasibility of reprogramming of astrocytes into oligodendrocyte-like cells in vivo, by using a single transcription factor, Sox10. This finding suggested a master regulatory role for Sox10 which enabled astrocytes to change their fate to OPC-like cells and establish an oligodendroglial phenotype. We hope this approach lead to effective myelin repair in patients suffering from myelination deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2949742050,"The cerebellum is involved in coordinating motor behaviour, but how the cerebellar network regulates locomotion is still not well understood. We characterised the activity of putative cerebellar Purkinje cells, Golgi cells and mossy fibres in awake mice engaged in an active locomotion task, using high-density silicon electrode arrays. Analysis of the activity of over 300 neurons in response to locomotion revealed that the majority of cells (53%) were significantly modulated by phase of the stepping cycle. However, in contrast to studies involving passive locomotion on a treadmill, we found that a high proportion of cells (45%) were tuned to the speed of locomotion, and 19% were tuned to yaw movements. The activity of neurons in the cerebellar vermis provided more information about future speed of locomotion than about past or present speed, suggesting a motor, rather than purely sensory, role. We were able to accurately decode the speed of locomotion with a simple linear algorithm, with only a relatively small number of well-chosen cells needed, irrespective of cell class. Our observations suggest that behavioural state modulates cerebellar sensorimotor integration, and advocate a role for the cerebellar vermis in control of high-level locomotor kinematic parameters such as speed and yaw."
https://openalex.org/W2889702478,"The mesoscale eddies off the coast of Chile significantly impact the distribution of local chlorophyll and the development of marine ecosystem. Multiple processes, including eddy trapping, pumping, advection, Ekman-pumping, and submesoscale dynamics, exert their impacts simultaneously on transport of water masses at different distances with respect to the eddy center. The cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies are generally characterized by upwelling (downwelling) within the eddy, which elevates (depresses) chlorophyll inside the eddy. Outside the eddy periphery, multiple processes are involved simultaneously, but their corresponding influences on chlorophyll are not well identified. In this study, the amplitudes of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are distinguished as positive and negative values, respectively. A linear regression method is applied to seek the connection between eddy’s amplitude and chlorophyll distribution at different locations w.r.t. the eddy center. The regression slope between eddy amplitude and chlorophyll anomaly is found to be negative in the eddy interior and along the periphery, which gradually changes to positive away from the periphery. The location where the response of chlorophyll to an eddy switches its sign is defined as the transition zone. The location of the transition zone varies with offshore distance and is impacted by topography, such as the presence of islands, which can change the dynamics of eddies. Thus, the distance from eddy center and offshore distance from coast should be taken into consideration when investigating their influences on nutrient transport and chlorophyll distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2891811027,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a global public health problem, which threatens Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) including Nigeria. Civil servants are at risk of NCDs because of the stressful and sedentary nature of their work. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of the major risk factors of NCDs among civil servants in Ibadan, Nigeria.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 606 civil servants in Oyo State using a two-stage cluster sampling technique. The WHO Stepwise approach was used to assess the behavioural and metabolic risk factors. Anthropometric (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences), blood pressure and biochemical measurements (fasting blood sugar) were obtained. Prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Multivariate logistic models with adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the associated factors of NCD risk factors. Multiple Poisson regression was also performed to determine the effects of certain socio-demographic factors on the clustering of NCD risk factors.The mean age of the civil servants was 43.0±10.3 and 53.8% were males. The prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the risk factors were 6.5% (95% CI:4.5-8.5) for current smoking, 7.8% (95% CI:5.1-10.5) for harmful use of alcohol, 62.2% (95% CI:58.2-66.2) for low physical activity, 69.7% (95% CI:66.0-73.4) for insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, 37.1% (95% CI:33.2-41.0) for abdominal obesity, 57.3% (95% CI:53.3-61.3) for overweight and obesity, 33.1% (95% CI:29.3-36.8) for raised blood pressure and 7.1% (95% CI:5.0-9.1) for raised blood sugar. Over 75% of the population had at least two NCD risk factors and the study participants had an average of 3 NCD risk factors 3.01 (95% CI: 2.88-3.14) The female gender was significantly associated with an increased risk for abdominal obesity (AOR 27.9; 95% CI: 12.09-64.6) and being overweight or obese (AOR 6.78; 95% CI: 3.53-13.01), but was protective of smoking (AOR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.07-0.61) and binge drinking (AOR 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01-0.45). Also, the risk of hypertension increased with age- 30-39 years (AOR 12.29; 95% CI: 1.06-141.8), 40-49 years (AOR 14.28; 95% CI: 1.10-181.4) and 50 years and above (AOR 32.43; 95% CI: 2.44-413.7). Raised blood pressure was a strong correlate for having raised blood sugar (AOR 5.63; 95% CI: 1.48-21.3). Increasing age (IRR 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02) and being female (IRR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.23-1.49) were also important predictors of the clustering of risk factors.The feminization (i.e. the preponderance of risk factors among the females) and clustering of non-communicable disease risk factors were observed among Oyo State civil servants. Our findings highlight the high prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors among the working class. Hence the need for targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions among this population."
https://openalex.org/W2890254241,"Background Nepal has one of the highest prevalence of hypertension in South Asia. However, no national studies have examined the gender differences in the determinants of prehypertension and hypertension in the country to inform targeted interventions. This study aimed to investigate gender differences in factors associated with prehypertension and hypertension in Nepal using the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). Methods Sociodemographic, behavioural, anthropometric and health status data and information on hypertension were obtained from 14,857 (males: 6,245 and females: 8,612) individuals aged 15 years or above from the biomarker sample of the 2016 NDHS. Factors associated with prehypertension and hypertension by gender were investigated using generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAM) with the mlogit link and binomial family that adjusted for clustering and sampling weights. Results The overall prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension was 26.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 25.7, 28.1] and 17.2% (95% CI 16.1, 18.3), respectively. Prehypertension was present in 30.4% (95%CI: 28.7, 32.2) of males and 24.3% (95% CI: 23.1, 25.6) of females, while hypertension was present in 20.4%, (95% CI 18.9, 22.0) of males and 14.8% (95% CI: 13.7, 16.0) of females. Key modifiable factors that were strongly associated with prehypertension and hypertension in both genders included overweight and obesity, caffeine intake, tobacco use, no schooling, previously informed of hypertension in a health facility, and alcohol consumption (for males). Other significant factors associated with prehypertension and hypertension included increasing age (> 30 years), ecological zone (Hill), Developmental zone (Western) and being married. Conclusion Our results suggest that prehypertension and hypertension were higher in males compared to females. Interventions to improve awareness, screening, treatment and control of prehypertension and hypertension in Nepal are warranted and should target key modifiable factors, as well as people aged 30 years and above."
https://openalex.org/W2890190124,"HIV testing is often undermined by lack of confidentiality, stigma, shortage of counselors and long distances to testing centers. Self-testing has the potential to circumvent these constraints.To determine the performance and usability characteristics of the INSTI® HIV-1/HIV-2 Self-Test.The performance evaluation was a cross sectional study and the usability a mixed methods study. For method comparison, Bioelisa HIV-1+2 Ag/Ab test was used as the reference test. When the test results were discrepant, results from Alere Determine™ HIV-1/2 and First Response HIV-1-2 Antibody tests were used for confirmation of status.Sensitivity of the INSTI HIV Self-Test was 98.99% (95% CI 96.05-99.75%), and specificity 98.15% (95% CI 95.63-99.23%). The concordance was therefore 97.27%. A total of 354 participants took part in the usability study. Of those, 343 (98.00%) found instructions for use easy to follow, 330 (94.29%) found the finger prick device easy to use, 303 (86.57%) were confident while performing the test, 342 (97.71%) felt result interpretation was easy, while 304 (86.86%) declared results within the recommended five minutes. Three hundred and forty two (342, 97.71%) were willing to use the test again while 344 (98.29%) would recommend the kit to a sexual partner. None of the 350 participants quit the process at any stage. Three hundred and eighteen (318, 91.12%) participants felt the test needed no further improvement. All 91 lay users correctly identified cartridges that showed positive, negative and invalid results. Only 31 (34.07%) participants correctly identified weak positive dummy test results.The excellent performance and usability characteristics of INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 self-test make the kit a viable option for HIV self-testing. To improve the identification of weak positive results, the manufacturer should indicate on the IFU that even a faint test spot should be interpreted as positive."
https://openalex.org/W2891636423,"In order to ensure the provision of goods and services from forests, many governments have promoted less-traditional conservation initiatives such as programs of payments for ecosystem services called, more broadly, direct payments for conservation. The Socio Bosque Program (SBP) is a governmental program in Ecuador that directly provides economic incentives to rural families and local and indigenous communities who have voluntarily agreed to comply with some conservation activities. An impact evaluation method (matching) was used to assess the impact of the SBP between 2008 and 2014. This study revealed that on average, the SBP reduced deforestation by 1.5% in those forests that received the SBP’s direct payment. These forests would have been deforested if the SBP had not been implemented. Assessment of the impact of the SBP on individual and collective contracts, using the matching method, revealed that 3.4% and roughly 1% of the forest would have been deforested in the absence of the program, respectively. In other words, the protected area in the collective SBP was 1,247,500 ha and, if the SBP had not been implemented, an area of 11,227 ha would have been lost between 2008 and 2014. The 165,700 ha protected by the individual SBP, it was estimated that 5,733 ha were not deforested due to the implementation of the conservation program. Conventional estimates of the impact of the SBP tend to overestimate avoided deforestation because they do not control for observable covariates that correlate with or affect both SBP participation and deforestation. The conclusions are robust, even given potential hidden biases. The present study demonstrated that the SBP serves to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially with those contracts that are intended for individual owners."
https://openalex.org/W2889602342,"The nature of species distribution boundaries is a key subject in ecology and evolution. Edge populations are potentially more exposed to climate-related environmental pressures. Despite research efforts, little is known about variability in fitness-related traits in leading (i.e., colder, high latitude) versus trailing (i.e., warmer, low latitude) edge populations. We tested whether the resilience, i.e. the resistance and recovery, of key traits differs between a distributional cold (Greenland) and warm (Portugal) range edge population of two foundation marine macrophytes, the intertidal macroalga Fucus vesiculosus and the subtidal seagrass Zostera marina. The resistance and recovery of edge populations to elevated seawater temperatures was compared under common experimental conditions using photosynthetic efficiency and expression of heat shock proteins (HSP). Cold and warm edge populations differed in their response, but this was species specific. The warm edge population of F. vesiculosus showed higher thermal resistance and recovery whereas the cold leading edge was less tolerant. The opposite was observed in Z. marina, with reduced recovery at the warm edge, while the cold edge was not markedly affected by warming. Our results confirm that differentiation of thermal stress responses can occur between leading and trailing edges, but such responses depend on local population traits and are thus not predictable just based on thermal pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2889907695,"There are no registered veterinary drugs for treating insulin dysregulation and preventing insulin-associated laminitis in horses. Velagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transport 2 inhibitor that reduces renal glucose reabsorption, promotes glucosuria, and consequently, decreases blood glucose and insulin concentrations. This study aimed to determine if velagliflozin reduced hyperinsulinemia and prevented laminitis in insulin-dysregulated ponies fed a challenge diet high in non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). An oral glucose test (1 g dextrose/kg BW) was used to screen 75 ponies for insulin dysregulation, of which 49 ponies with the highest insulin concentrations were selected. These animals were assigned randomly to either a treated group (n = 12) that received velagliflozin (0.3 mg/kg BW, p.o., s.i.d.) throughout the study, or a control group (n = 37). All ponies were fed a maintenance diet of alfalfa hay for 3 weeks, before transferring to a challenge diet (12 g NSC/kg BW/d) for up to 18 d. Blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations were measured over 4 h after feeding, on d 2 of the diet. The maximum glucose concentration was 22% lower (P = 0.014) in treated animals, with a geometric mean (95% CI) of 9.4 (8.0–11.0) mM, versus 12.1 (10.7–13.7) mM in the controls. This was reflected by lower (45%) maximum insulin concentrations in the treated group (P = 0.017), of 149 (97–228) μIU/mL, versus 272 (207–356) μIU/mL for controls. The diet induced Obel grade 1 or 2 laminitis in 14 of the 37 controls (38%), whereas no velagliflozin-treated pony developed laminitis (P = 0.011). Velagliflozin was well-tolerated, with no hypoglycemia or any clinical signs of adverse effects. The main limitation of this study was the sample size. Velagliflozin shows promise as a safe and effective compound for treating insulin dysregulation and preventing laminitis by reducing the hyperinsulinemic response to dietary NSC."
https://openalex.org/W2890181605,"Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) provide guidance to policy makers, the private sector and consumers to redesign food systems and to improve diets of vulnerable populations. As appropriate FBDGs are based on the actual dietary patterns and their costs, it is assumed that the recommended foods are available, affordable and acceptable for the population under study. Using quantitative dietary intake data of young children in rural Northern Ghana, we developed local FBDGs and studied whether these are supported by the diversity and quantity of the production of a household among 329 households. We found that 40% of rural Northern Ghanaian infants and young children were stunted and their nutrient intakes were far below the recommendations: the probability of adequacy for most nutrient intakes was less than 50%. At household level, the developed FBDGs were, on average, unable to sufficiently cover the household requirements for fat (60.4% of recommended nutrient intake (RNI)), calcium (34.3% RNI), iron (60.3% RNI), vitamin A (39.1% RNI), vitamin B12 (2.3% RNI) and vitamin C (54.6% RNI). This implies that even when these FBDGs are fully adopted the requirements for these nutrients will not be met. In addition, the nutrient needs and food needs (according to the developed FBDGs) of a household were only marginally covered by their own food production. The food production of over half the households supplied insufficient calcium (75.7%), vitamin A (100%), vitamin B12 (100%) and vitamin C (77.5%) to cover their needs. The food production of about 60% of the households did not cover their required quantities of grains and legumes and none covered their required quantities of vegetables. Further analysis of the food gaps at district and national level showed that sufficient grains were available at both levels (267% and 148%, respectively) to meet requirements; availability of legumes was sufficient at district level (268%) but not at national level (52%); and vegetables were insufficient at both levels (2% and 49%, respectively). Diversifying household food production is often proposed as a means to increase the diversity of foods available and thereby increasing dietary diversity of rural populations. We found that the diversity of the production of a household was indeed positively related with their food and nutrient coverage. However, the diversity of the production of a household and their food and nutrient coverage were not related with children's dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy. Our results show that the production of a households does not support the adoption of FBDGs in rural Northern Ghana, especially for vegetables. This suggests that the promotion of FBDGs through nutrition education or behaviour change communications activities alone is insufficient to lead to improvements in diets. Additional strategies are needed to increase the food availability and accessibility of the households, especially that of fruits and vegetables, such as diversification of the crops grown, increased production of specific crops and market-based strategies."

The present study aimed to investigate the potential risks of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and their correlation with the disease severity. A total of 338 pediatric patients with OSAHS (polysomnography (PSG) diagnosis) were enrolled between June 2008 and October 2010. These pediatric patients were divided into mild, moderate and severe subgroups according to the obstructive apnea index (OAI) and/or apnea hypoventilation index (AHI). A total of 338 pediatric patients with vocal nodules who were without obstruction of the upper respiratory tract were enrolled as the control group. The patients were analyzed retrospectively. The average number of upper respiratory tract infections each year and tonsil hypertrophy, adenoid hypertrophy, positive serum tIgE, chronic sinusitis, nasal stenosis, craniofacial features and obesity were significantly higher in OSAHS compared with controls (P<0.01). The parameters the average number of upper respiratory tract infections each year (OR: 1.395, 95% CI: 1.256-1.550), adenoid hypertrophy (OR: 8.632, 95% CI: 3.990-18.672), tonsil hypertrophy (OR: 9.138, 95% CI: 4.621-18.073), nasal stenosis (8.023, 95% CI: 3.633-17.717) and chronic sinusitis (OR: 27.186, 95% CI: 13.310-55.527) were independent factors of pediatric OSAHS (P<0.01). The distribution of chronic sinusitis, nasal stenosis, craniofacial features and obesity indicated a gradual increasing trend in the severity of OSAHS (P<0.01). Number of upper respiratory tract infections per year, adenoid hypertrophy, tonsil hypertrophy, chronic sinusitis, nasal stenosis, infections, allergic reactions, craniofacial features and obesity may be potential risk factors of pediatric OSAHS."
https://openalex.org/W2892180043,"Background The Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay technology allows rapid and sensitive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from sputum specimens. However, diagnosis of PTB is difficult for patients who cannot produce sputum. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of Xpert assay for successful detection of PTB using stool samples from adult subjects. Methods Both stool and sputum samples from known smear and Xpert positive PTB patients were collected from a TB hospital in Dhaka. Stool samples were collected from healthy individuals without TB symptoms from a slum area of Dhaka. Stool and sputum samples were decontaminated and concentrated using NALC-NaOH-Na-citrate solution and the resultant sediment was used for Xpert, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy and culture. Results A total of 102 stool samples were collected from PTB patients and another 50 stool samples from healthy individuals without TB. The sensitivity of the Xpert assay for detection of M. tuberculosis in stool samples of PTB patients was 90.2% (95% CI, 82.9–95.0). All 50 stool samples from healthy individuals were negative by the assay (Specificity 100%; 95% CI, 92.9–100). Compared with the sputum culture positive results the sensitivity of the stool Xpert assay was 94.8% (95% CI, 88.5–97.8). Moreover, stool Xpert demonstrated full concordant results with the sputum culture for detection of rifampicin susceptibility. The cycle threshold values of rpoB probes obtained from Xpert assay correlated significantly with the bacilli load in the corresponding stool (Spearman correlation = -0.40, P < 0.01) and sputum (Spearman correlation = -0.77, P < 0.01) samples as determined by microscopy. Conclusions Stool Xpert can be applied as a potential alternative of sputum testing for detection of M. tuberculosis and accurate determination of RIF susceptibility in adult PTB patients. The assay would be beneficial for rapid diagnosis of PTB for those adult patients who cannot expectorate sputum."
https://openalex.org/W2890229172,"Introduction Post-operative infections occur frequently following major surgery. The magnitude of the post-operative immune response is associated with an increased risk of post-operative infections, although the mechanisms driving post-operative immune-dysfunction and the potential reversibility of this response with immune stimulants are not well understood. This study aims to describe the immediate immune response to major surgery and establish links to both post-operative infection and functional aspects of immune dysregulation. We also investigate the potential of clinically available immune stimulants to reverse features of post-operative immune-dysfunction. Methods Patients over 45 years old undergoing elective gastro-intestinal surgery with planned post-operative surgical ICU admission were recruited. The expression of selected genes was determined pre-operatively and at 2, 24 and 48 hours post-operatively using qRT-PCR. Circulating levels of Interleukin-10 protein were determined by ELISA. Peri-operative cell surface monocyte HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) expression was determined using flow cytometry. Gene expression and mHLA-DR levels were determined in healthy monocytes cultured in peri-operative serum with and without neutralising antibodies and immune stimulants. Results 119 patients were recruited; 44 developed a post-operative infection. Interleukin-10 mRNA and protein increased 4-fold post-operatively (P<0.0001), peaking within 2 hours of the procedure. Higher post-operative Interleukin-10 mRNA (P = 0.007) and protein (P = 0.001) levels were associated with an increased risk of infection. Cell surface mHLA-DR expression fell post-operatively (P<0.0001). Reduced production, rather than intracellular sequestration, accounted for the post-operative decline in cell surface mHLA-DR expression. Interleukin-10 antibody prevented the decrease in mHLA-DR expression observed when post-operative serum was added to healthy monocytes. GM-CSF and IFN-γ prevented the decline in mHLA-DR production through distinct pathways. Conclusions Monocyte dysfunction and features of immune suppression occur frequently after major surgery. Greater post-operative Interleukin-10 production is associated with later infection. Interleukin-10 is an important mediator of post-operative reductions in mHLA-DR expression, while clinically available immune stimulants can restore mHLA-DR levels."
https://openalex.org/W2890658865,"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common Critical Congenital Heart Defect (CCHD). The etiology of TOF is unknown in most cases. Preliminary data from our group and others suggest that epigenetic changes may play an important role in CHD. Epidemiologically, a significant percentage of CHD including TOF fail to be diagnosed in the prenatal and early newborn period which can negatively affect health outcomes. We performed genome-wide methylation assay in newborn blood in 24 non-syndromic TOF cases and 24 unaffected matched controls using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. We identified 64 significantly differentially methylated CpG sites in TOF cases, of which 25 CpG sites had high predictive accuracy for TOF, based on the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC ROC) ≥ 0.90). The CpG methylation difference between TOF and controls was ≥10% in 51 CpG targets suggesting biological significance. Gene ontology analysis identified significant biological processes and functions related to these differentially methylated genes, including: CHD development, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, immunological, inflammation and other plausible pathways in CHD development. Multiple genes known or plausibly linked to heart development and post-natal heart disease were found to be differentially methylated in the blood DNA of newborns with TOF including: ABCB1, PPP2R5C, TLR1, SELL, SCN3A, CREM, RUNX and LHX9. We generated novel and highly accurate putative molecular markers for TOF detection using leucocyte DNA and thus provided information on pathogenesis of TOF."
https://openalex.org/W2890851878,"Persistence may be defined as high sustained yield over multi-harvest. Genetic insights about persistence are essential to ensure the success of breeding programs and any biomass-based project. This paper focuses on assessing the biomass yield persistence for bioenergy purpose of 100 elephantgrass clones measured in six growth seasons in Brazil. To assess the clones' persistence, an index based on random regression models and genotype-ideotype distance was proposed. Results suggested the existence of wide genetic variability between elephantgrass clones, and that the yield trajectories along the harvests generate genetic insights into elephantgrass clones’ persistence and G x E interaction. A gene pool that acts over the biomass yield (regardless of the harvest) was detected, as well as other gene pools, which show differences on genes expression (these genes are the major responsible for clones’ persistence). The lower and higher clones’ persistence was discussed based on genome dosage effect and natural biological nitrogen fixation ability applied to bioenergy industry. The huge potential of energy crops necessarily is associated with genetic insights into persistence, so just this way, breeding programs could breed a new cultivar that fulfills the bioenergy industries."
https://openalex.org/W2892058294,"Violacein is a violet pigment produced by Chromobacterium violaceum that possesses several functions such as antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antioxidant activities. The search for potential compounds and therapies that may interfere with and modulate the gut microbial consortia without causing severe damage and increased resistance is important for the treatment of inflammatory, allergic, and metabolic diseases. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the ability of violacein to change microbial patterns in the mammalian gut by favoring certain groups over the others in order to be used as a therapy for diseases associated with changes in the intestinal microflora. To do this, we used male Wistar rats, and administered violacein orally, in low (50 μg/ml) and high (500 μg/ml) doses for a month. Initially, the changes in the microbial diversity were observed by DGGE analyses that showed that the violacein significantly affects the gut microbiota of the rats. Pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA was then employed using a 454 GS Titanium platform, and the results demonstrated that higher taxonomic richness was observed with the low violacein treatment group, followed by the control group and high violacein treatment group. Modulation of the microbiota at the class level was observed in the low violacein dose, where Bacilli and Clostridia (Firmicutes) were found as dominant. For the high violacein dose, Bacilli followed by Clostridia and Actinobacteria were present as the major components. Further analyses are crucial for a better understanding of how violacein affects the gut microbiome and whether this change would be beneficial to the host, providing a framework for the development of alternative treatment strategies for intestinal diseases using this compound."
https://openalex.org/W2951989761,"There is a notable absence of consensus on how to generate estimates of population-level incidence. Incidence is a considerably more sensitive indicator of epidemiological trends than prevalence, but is harder to estimate. We used a novel hybrid method to estimate HIV incidence by age and sex in a rural district of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Our novel method uses an 'optimal weighting' of estimates based on an implementation of a particular 'synthetic cohort' approach (interpreting the age/time structure of prevalence, in conjunction with estimates of excess mortality) and biomarkers of 'recent infection' (combining Lag-Avidity, Bio-Rad Avidity and viral load results to define recent infection, and adapting the method for age-specific incidence estimation). Data were obtained from a population-based cross-sectional HIV survey conducted in Mbongolwane and Eshowe health service areas in 2013.Using the combined method, we find that age-specific HIV incidence in females rose rapidly during adolescence, from 1.33 cases/100 person-years (95% CI: 0.98,1.67) at age 15 to a peak of 5.01/100PY (4.14,5.87) at age 23. In males, incidence was lower, 0.34/100PY (0.00-0.74) at age 15, and rose later, peaking at 3.86/100PY (2.52-5.20) at age 30. Susceptible population-weighted average incidence in females aged 15-29 was estimated at 3.84/100PY (3.36-4.40), in males aged 15-29 at 1.28/100PY (0.68-1.50) and in all individuals aged 15-29 at 2.55/100PY (2.09-2.76). Using the conventional recency biomarker approach, we estimated HIV incidence among females aged 15-29 at 2.99/100PY (1.79-4.36), among males aged 15-29 at 0.87/100PY (0.22-1.60) and among all individuals aged 15-59 at 1.66/100PY (1.13-2.27).HIV incidence was very high in women aged 15-30, peaking in the early 20s. Men had lower incidence, which peaked at age 30. The estimates obtained from the hybrid method are more informative than those produced by conventional analysis of biomarker data, and represents a more optimal use of available data than either the age-continuous biomarker or synthetic cohort methods alone. The method is mainly useful at younger ages, where excess mortality is low and uncertainty in the synthetic cohort estimates is reasonably small.Application of this method to large-scale population-based HIV prevalence surveys is likely to result in improved incidence surveillance over methods currently in wide use. Reasonably accurate and precise age-specific estimates of incidence are important to target better prevention, diagnosis and care strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2891041905,"Objective Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and associates with high mortality after surgery. Since abnormal heart rate variability (HRV) is predictive of postoperative complications, we investigated the relations of HRV with PAD, OSA and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Materials and methods Seventy-five patients (67±9 years) scheduled for sub-inguinal revascularization and 15 controls (63±6 years) underwent polysomnography and HRV analyses. OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥20/hour was considered significant. HRV was measured during wakefulness, S2, S3-4 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with time and frequency domain methods including beat-to-beat variability, low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). MACCE was defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, hospitalized angina pectoris and stroke. Results Thirty-six patients (48%) had AHI≥20/hour. During follow-up (median 52 months), 22 patients (29%) suffered a MACCE. Compared to controls, fractal correlation of HRV (scaling exponent alpha 1 measured with DFA) was weaker during S2 and evening wakefulness in all subgroups (+/-AHI≥20/hour, +/-MACCE) but only in patients with AHI≥20/hour during morning wakefulness. The LF/HF ratio was lower in all subgroups during S2 but only in patients with AHI ≥20/hour during evening or morning wake. In the covariance analysis adjusted for age, body mass index, coronary artery disease and PAD duration, the alpha 1 during morning wakefulness remained significantly lower in patients with AHI≥20/hour than in those without (1.12 vs. 1.45; p = 0.03). Decreased HF during REM (p = 0.04) and S3-4 sleep (p = 0.03) were predictive of MACCE. In analyses with all sleep stages combined, mean heart rate as well as very low frequency, LF, HF and total power were associated with OSA of mild-to-moderate severity (AHI 10-20/hour). Conclusions HRV is altered in patients with PAD. These alterations have a limited association with OSA and MACCE."
https://openalex.org/W2889821152,"Empathy enables people to vicariously experience the other’s pain. At the same time, the focus of empathy can be narrow and reserved for a limited number of people. In sacrificial dilemmas, non-empathic people are more likely to sacrifice one person for greater good. However, no study has investigated the role of diminished empathic concern for the victim in utilitarian choices of action. In two studies, we investigated how empathy actually experienced in sacrificial dilemmas affects a decision to perform a harmful action onto the victim. In Study 1 (N = 275), participants were asked to rate the extent to which they were feeling two divergent tropes of affective empathy: other-oriented empathy (empathic concern) and self-oriented empathy (personal distress). Results showed that lower levels of other-focused empathy for the victim predicted utilitarian choices of action. In Study 2 (N = 170), participants were asked to rate the extent to which they empathized with the victim and the saved. We also assessed dispositional empathy and psychopathy to test a hypothesis that psychopathy mediates the relationship between lower empathy for the victim and utilitarian choices of action. Results supported this hypothesis, whereas dispositional empathy was not significantly correlated with utilitarian choices of action. Overall, lower empathy experienced in the dilemma situation was associated with utilitarian choices of action, and this was specific to reduced empathic concern for the victim. People choose to pursue the utilitarian end that accompanies harm onto the other as a mean when the victim is out of their empathic focus."
https://openalex.org/W2891675201,"To investigate the effect of pupil dilation on ocular biometric parameters and intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation in schoolchildren using the Lenstar LS 900.One hundred forty eyes of 140 healthy schoolchildren were included in the analysis. Axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), aqueous depth (AD), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), flat keratometry (K), steep K, astigmatism, white-to-white (WTW), and iris/pupil barycenter distance were measured, before and after pupil dilation. Anterior segment length (ASL) was defined as the sum of ACD and LT, and lens position (LP) was defined as ACD plus half of the LT. The relative lens position (RLP) was defined as LP divided by AL. IOL power was calculated using the eight formulas (Hill-RBF, Barrett, Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay, Olsen, SRK II, and SRK/T) integrated in the Lenstar LS 900. Parameters before and after pupil dilation were compared.AL, AD, ACD, LT, ASL, LP, RLP, flat K, iris barycenter distance, pupil barycenter distance, and PD differed significantly after pupil dilation (P < 0.001 in all cases), as compared to before dilation. The Olsen formula demonstrated significant differences in the magnitude of astigmatism (P = 0.010) and IOL power (P = 0.003) after pupil dilation. Using the different formulas, 23.6-40.7% of participants had IOL power changes of more than 0.50 diopters, while 0.7-1.4% had IOL changes of more than 1.0 diopter after pupil dilation.Dilated and undilated pupil size affected the Lenstar LS 900 measurement of some ocular biometric parameters, and pupil dilation led to IOL power changes exceeding 0.50 diopters with a high percentage (from 23.6% to 40.7%) in schoolchildren, which should be noticed in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2890117070,"In this study, we suggest optimizing the methodology to determine the Cohesion Index (Icd) in order to avoid mistaken characterizations due to powder bulk density. For this purpose, five different excipients, with different bulk densities and of different chemical nature, were compressed at different heights. Their compression and their tablet characterization enable establishing a powder weight for compression in accordance with its bulk density. Therefore, the resulting tablet will have a height within a defined range of heights where it has no critical effects on its hardness. Then, the impact of this optimization is shown in a formula development, one of the main SeDeM’s applications. A mathematical equation was used to calculate the theoretical amount of excipient to formulate the API according to both methodologies. The compression results demonstrate that the characterization with the NM-Icd is more accurate than the previous one while preserving its simplicity."

Methods 50 consecutive patients (82.6±6.9 years; 56% female) were prospectively enrolled and underwent a TAVR planning using a 320-row CT, with ECG-gated aortic root CTA immediately followed by a non-gated aorto-iliac acquisition, all within a single bolus of 40-70mL of Iohexol 350mgI/mL. The Iodine load, image quality, SNR, CNR and radiation dose were compared using a Mann-Whitney test to that of 24 consecutive patients (84.3±4.8 years, 58% female) previously imaged on a 64-row scanner with a conventional two-step protocol. Results Iodine load was reduced by 44%. All examinations were of diagnostic quality, with improvement of the aortic root CTA image quality (4.9±0.3 versus 4.6±0.5, p<0.01) and a non-significant decrease of the aorto-iliac CTA image quality (4.7±0.6 versus 4.9±0.3, p = 0.07). SNR and CNR were significantly improved in the aortic root CTA (14.0±5.3 and 10.4±4.5 versus 10.3±4.2 and 6.8±3.3, p<0.01 for both) and non-significantly higher in the aorto-iliac CTA (16.5±8.0 and 14.1±7.9 versus 14.7±5.5 and 12.5±5.0, p = 0.42 and p = 0.66). Total radiation dose was reduced by 32%. Conclusion 320-row CT scanner enables a 44% reduction of iodine load in TAVR planning, while maintaining excellent aorto-ilio-femoral arterial enhancement and lowering radiation dose."
https://openalex.org/W2891859655,"Zirconia (3Y-TZP) dental prostheses are widely used in clinical dentistry. However, the effect of ultrasonic scaling performed as a part of professional tooth cleaning on 3Y-TZP dental prostheses, especially in conjunction with low-temperature degradation (LTD), has not been fully investigated. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of ultrasonic scaling and LTD on the surface properties of 3Y-TZP in relation to bacterial adhesion on the treated surface. 3Y-TZP specimens (4 × 4 × 2 mm) were polished and then subjected to autoclaving at 134°C for 100 h to induce LTD, followed by 10 rounds of ultrasonic scaling using a steel scaler tip for 1 min each. Surface roughness, crystalline structure, wettability, and hardness were analyzed by optical interferometry, X-ray diffraction analysis, contact angle measurement, and nano-indentation technique, respectively. Subsequently, bacterial adhesion onto the treated 3Y-TZP surface was evaluated using Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis. The results demonstrated that the combination of ultrasonic scaling and LTD significantly increased the Sa value (surface roughness parameter) of the polished 3Y-TZP surface from 1.6 nm to 117 nm. LTD affected the crystalline structure, causing phase transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase, and decreased both the contact angle and surface hardness. However, bacterial adhesion was not influenced by these changes in surface properties. The present study suggests that ultrasonic scaling may be acceptable for debridement of 3Y-TZP dental prostheses because it did not facilitate bacterial adhesion even in the combination with LTD, although it did cause slight roughening of the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2889616186,"Maternal mortality is one of the significant health indicators of any country and it's a frequent subject in many global heath discussions. Even though the global trends have shown a decrease on maternal mortality, many countries in sub-Saharan Africa failed to achieve the MDG 5 target in 2015.There is no specific single solution for reducing maternal mortality but there is unanimity that a reliable health system with skilled personal is vital for addressing maternal mortality. This study therefore seeks to identify the risk factors for maternal mortality in typical rural sub-Saharan African countries.A longitudinal population based cohort study was conducted using data from 2000-2014 in Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI).The Cox regression method was used to assess the influence of selected risk factors using the Mosley-Chen model on maternal mortality. A total of 20701 women aged 15-49 years were included in the study.The study found 212 maternal deaths from 32,620 live births with a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 650 per 100,000 live births. The main causes of death were Communicable diseases (38.2%), Aids and TB (31%) and Unknown causes (11.8%). An increased risk of death was identified on, poor wealth index (HR 3.92[1.01, 15.3]), period of death 2000-2006(HR32.1 [3.79, 71.5]) and number of deliveries (6.76[2.70, 16.9]) were associated with a high risk of maternal mortality after adjusting for other independent variables included in the study.Socio-economic status, number of deliveries and period of death were found to be associated with maternal death in rural South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2890917848,"Background Current German and EU package leaflets (PLs) do not distinguish to what extent listed side effects are indeed side effects caused by drug intake or instead symptoms that occur regardless of drug use. We recently showed that most health professionals misinterpret the frequencies of listed side effects as solely caused by the drug. The present study investigated whether (1) these misinterpretations also prevail among laypeople and (2) alternative PLs reduce these misinterpretations. Methods In March 2017, 397 out of 400 laypeople approached completed an online survey. They were randomized to one of four PL formats: three alternative PLs (drug facts box with/without reading instruction, narrative format with numbers) and one standard PL. Each PL listed four side effects for a fictitious drug: two were presented as occurring more often, one as equally often, and one as less often with drug intake. The alternative formats (interventions) included information on frequencies with and without drug intake and included a statement on the causal relation. The standard PL (control) only included information on frequency ranges with drug intake. Questions were asked on general occurrence and causality of side effects. Results Participants randomized to the standard PL were unable to answer questions on causality. For side effects occurring more often (equally; less often) with drug intake, only 1.9% to 2.8% (equally: 1.9%; less often: 1.9%) provided correct responses about the causal nature of side effects, compared to 55.0% to 81.9% (equally: 23.8% to 70.5%; less often: 21.0% to 43.2%) of participants who received alternative PLs. It remains unclear whether one alternative format is superior to the others. Conclusion In conclusion, information on the frequency of side effects in current package leaflets is misleading. Comparative presentation of frequencies for side effects with and without drug intake including statements on the causal relation significantly improves understanding."

During a median follow-up of 38 months, 30% (125/411) of patients without known AF at implant were diagnosed with silent AF, 62% of those had or were prescribed anticoagulation. Heart failure (p = 0.03) and age >75 years (p = 0.0002) were risk markers for incident silent AF. In patients with known AF at implant, 80% (216/267) were on anticoagulation at implant. The annual stroke incidence was 2.1% in patients with known AF at implant, as compared to 1.9% in patients who developed silent AF during follow-up, and 1.4% in patients without AF. Vascular dementia developed in 11.2% and 6.2% respectively in patients with known AF versus no AF (p = 0.048) as well as in 5.6% of those with silent AF (p = 0.09).The stroke risk in our study population with an incident silent AF diagnosis may have been significantly decreased by the high proportion of anticoagulation treatment. This could imply that without this treatment the stroke risk might have been high enough to justify anticoagulation. Development of vascular dementia was twice as common among patients with known AF as compared to those witht silent AF or no AF. More data is needed to inform the optimal treatment for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2890029244,"Athletic prowess in both males and females is negatively correlated with the ratio between the lengths of the second and fourth fingers (2D:4D), a correlate of prenatal testosterone exposure. Because multiple lines of evidence suggest that prenatal testosterone exposure is associated with sports interest, motivation, and athletic performance we measured the digit ratios of 77 non-athletes, 103 varsity athletes, and 78 club sport athletes to test 8 hypotheses about the relationship between digit ratio and the athletic behavior of college-age women in the USA. Using independent samples t-tests, we found no significant differences between the digit ratios of women that (1) were athletes and non-athletes, (2) were varsity or club sport athletes, (3) had played or were currently playing individual or team sports, (4) played contact and non-contact sports, (5) played sports involving a ball and those that do not, (6) played sports where the outcome was determined by a score or the outcome of direct physical competition or subjectively by judges, or (7) were starters or reserves on their teams. However, women that played overhand throwing sports softball and water polo had significantly smaller digit ratios than did women that played other sports. These differences were not due to scaling effects. The independent samples t-test results were supported by subsequent Monte Carlo bootstrap, Bayesian, Random Forest, and multiple linear regression analyses. We suggest that the organizational consequences of prenatal testosterone exposure may influence the anatomy and physiology of women that leads to success playing overhand throwing sports."

This study aimed to reveal in a simple manner whether there is olfactory modulation of colour working memory using an odour that induces a citrus-like smell and is associated with orange colours. We assumed that the odour would have modulatory effects on the colour information stored in working memory. To clarify whether these effects are supportive or disruptive, during the colour working memory task we measured an event-related potential component, P3, which is involved in attentional processes of working memory. The results indicated that odour presentation mediated a decline in the rate of correct guesses for orange colours. Furthermore, the odour suppressed P3 during reddish-colour retrieval, including orange. These results suggest that colour working memory in orange can be disrupted via olfactory modulation with citrus-like odours."
https://openalex.org/W2891135175,"The weak interlayer refers to the filling material in shear belts or large-scale structural planes, which is usually composed of soil, fine sand and gravels. It is prone to argillization when encountering water and its mechanical strength and stiffness are generally low, which has adverse effects on the stability of underground structures. In recent years, research on reinforcement techniques for weak interlayers has been a hot topic in geotechnical field. As a new reinforcement method for structural planes, the microbial healing technique has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, a study on the healing technique for weak interlayer based on microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) and related mechanical properties was conducted for the interlayer shear belt at Baihetan Hydropower Station in China. First, Sporosarcina pasteurii was activated in laboratory. Reinforcement of the weak interlayer was realized by utilizing calcium carbonate precipitation on the weak interlayer. Continuous monitoring of the precipitates on the weak interlayer by XRD and SEM indicated that the precipitates on the weak layer were microbially induced calcium carbonate. Its crystals were irregular fish scale-shaped cubes with size in the range of 5~20μm. With favorable crystal growth, the crystals and the particles of the weak interlayer were cemented together. Finally, the mechanical properties of the healed weak interlayer were tested and the variations of uniaxial compressive strength, shear strength and triaxial compressive strength with bacteria concentration were discussed. The test results indicated that the maximum uniaxial compressive strength, peak shear strength and triaxial compressive strength can be increased by 149%, 162% and 119%, respectively, which subsequently improve the overall strength of the shear zone or structural plane. This can provide a new idea for soft ground reinforcement in underground projects."

Supporting maternal mental health and family health is a core aspect of home visiting. Increasingly the benefits of family focused treatments to maternal mental illness are being recognised. However, there are few reliable and valid measures that attempt to assess this type of practice. Objectives To explore the psychometric properties of the Family Focused Mental Health Practice Questionnaire in a population of home visitors. Methods Home visitors (n = 230) from across a single region of the United Kingdom completed the Family Focused Mental Health Practice Questionnaire. Participants were all females, had a mean age of 44 years, and had an average of 11 years’ experience of home visiting. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the factor structure of the questionnaire in this population while Cronbach’s alpha was used to assess the internal consistency of questionnaire subscales. Results Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 3-factor solution where each factor contained at least three questionnaire items and had eigenvalues ≥ 1.0. Checks for internal consistency revealed that one factor was unsatisfactory (α < 0.6), which was subsequently discarded. A further exploratory factor analysis supported a 2 factor solution. The factors were named: professional influences on family focused practice and organisational influences on family focused practice. Cronbach’s alpha for the new scale was 0.949. Conclusion As home visitors play a key role in supporting parents who have mental illness and their families, it is important to assess their practice using a reliable measure. Our psychometric evaluation has created a more valid, reliable and concise measure that can be used to examine home visitors’ family focused practice."
https://openalex.org/W2891451650,"Aggregation behaviors of kaolinite particles with different surfactants were studied in this paper. Aggregation settling yield and fractal dimension analysis were used to determine the aggregation results. Zeta potential measurements, adsorption tests, Infrared spectroscopy analysis and scanning electron microscope measurements were conducted for further investigation into the mechanism. Experimental results showed that much better aggregation results was obtained in the presence of cationic surfactant than that in the presence of anionic and non-ionic surfactants. 98% aggregation setting yield was obtained in the presence of dodecylamine. Adsorption tests indicated that the adsorption capacity of dodecylamine on kaolinite surface was larger than that of sodium oleate and Tween80. Zeta potential measurements confirmed that dodecylamine was more beneficial to the aggregation of kaolinite particles. Infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that the adsorption of dodecylamine on kaolinite surface was attributed to electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Sodium oleate was adsorbed by chemical adsorption. However, Tween80 can hardly be adsorbed by kaolinite surface."
https://openalex.org/W2892004200,"Objective: This study aimed to assess the oral impact on daily performance and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, tooth pain, need for prosthesis, and periodontal disease of adults in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This was a cross-sectional epidemiological study with secondary data obtained from the Oral Health Conditions Project– 2015 conducted in 163 municipalities in the state of São Paulo with the participation of 17,560 individuals. This study evaluated adults in the age-range between 35–44 years (n = 5,855), selected by means of probabilistic cluster sampling in two stages. The outcome variable was the OIDP (Oral Impacts on Daily Performances), obtained by using this instrument to assess daily activities (eating, speaking, oral hygiene, relaxation, sports practice, smile, study/work, social contact, and sleep). The independent variables were collected and grouped into three blocks: Block 1 (sex, age group, and ethnic group); Block 2 (household income and education); and Block 3 (tooth pain, need for prosthesis, bleeding, calculus, and periodontal pockets). A hierarchical multiple logistic regression analysis was performed considering the complex cluster sampling plan. Each observation was assigned a specific weight, depending on the location, which resulted in weighted frequencies adjusted for the effect of outlining. Results: the female sex (p<0.0001), ethnic group black/mulatto (p<0.0001), low household income (p = 0.0112), up to 8 years of education (p<0.0001), tooth pain (p<0.0001), presence of bleeding (p<0.0001), and presence of periodontal pockets (p<0.0001) had greater oral impact on daily performance. Conclusion: sociodemographic characteristics, tooth pain, and presence of periodontal disease were associated with oral impact on daily performance of the adult population in the state of São Paulo, Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2890168317,"Plant phosphorus (P) remobilisation during leaf senescence has fundamental implications for global P cycle fluxes. Hypothesising that genes involved in remobilisation of P from leaves during grain filling would show altered expression in response to P deprivation, we investigated gene expression in rice flag leaves at 8 days after anthesis (DAA) and 16 DAA in plants that received a continuous supply of P in the nutrient solution vs plants where P was omitted from the nutrient solution for 8 consecutive days prior to measurement. The transcriptional response to growth in the absence of P differed between the early stage (8 DAA) and the later stage (16 DAA) of grain filling. At 8 DAA, rice plants maintained production of energy substrates through upregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis. In contrast, at 16 DAA carbon substrates were produced by degradation of structural polysaccharides and over 50% of highly upregulated genes in P-deprived plants were associated with protein degradation and nitrogen/amino acid transport, suggesting withdrawal of P from the nutrient solution led to accelerated senescence. Genes involved in liberating inorganic P from the organic P compounds and vacuolar P transporters displayed differential expression depending on the stage of grain filling stage and timing of P withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W2890241566,"Esophageal cancer remains one of the hardest cancers to treat with rising incidence rates, low overall survival and high levels of treatment resistance. The lack of clinically available biomarkers hinder diagnosis and treatment stratification. While large scale sequencing approaches have uncovered a number of molecular makers, little has translated in the routine treatment of esophageal cancer patients.We evaluate the treatment response towards a panel of 215 FDA-approved and 163 epigenetic compounds of 4 established and 2 patient-derived esophageal cancer cell lines. Cell viability was evaluated after 72h of treatment using cell titer glow. The drug sensitivity testing results for gemcitabine and cisplatin were validated using clonogenic assays.The tested cell lines display different drug sensitivity profiles, although we found compounds that display efficacy in all of the tested established or patient-derived cell lines. Clonogenic assays confirmed the validity of the drug sensitivity testing results. Using the epigenetic library, we observed high sensitivity towards a number of epigenetic modifiers.Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing may present a viable option for the treatment stratification of esophageal cancer patients and holds the potential to greatly improve patient outcome while reducing treatment toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2890813446,"Antenatal overexposure to glucocorticoids causes fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and adult metabolic disorders. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) 1 and 2 are key enzymes for glucocorticoid metabolism, however, the detailed effects of antenatal overexposure to glucocorticoids on placental 11β-HSD1 and 2 expression and adult metabolic disorders remain obscure. Here, we report that, in placenta 11β-HSD1 is diffusely localized, whereas 11β-HSD2 is specifically expressed in labyrinthine layer. Exposure of pregnant dams to betamethasone significantly increases the expression of placental 11β-HSD2 but not 11β-HSD1, and decreases the weights of fetuses but not placentas. Antenatal exposure to betamethasone leads to either significant weight loss in the offspring younger than 10-week-old, or weight gain in those older than 14-week-old. Furthermore, antenatal exposure to betamethasone results in coexistence of various metabolic disorders in adult offspring, including hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, low insulin secretory capacity and hyperlipidemia. The present study demonstrates that exposure of pregnant dams to betamethasone induces the expression of placental 11β-HSD2 but not 11β-HSD1, leads to fetal IUGR and causes adult metabolic disorders, providing evidence for fetal origins of adult diseases and the potential role of placental 11β-HSD2 in them."
https://openalex.org/W2891460363,"Bronchiolitis sometimes triggers the development of subsequent recurrent wheezing. Treatment with either acetaminophen or ibuprofen during the initial episode may affect the occurrence of subsequent wheezing.We did a retrospective study comparing the effect of prescribing acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or neither for a first episode of bronchiolitis on medical attendances for subsequent wheezing in infants younger than 12 months. We created our cohorts using California Medicaid data from 2003 to 2010. We used propensity score derived inverse probability weights to adjust for non-random drug assignment. We used robust negative binomial regression to model incident rate ratios (IRR) for medical attendances at 365, 30, and 14-day follow-up. We did similar analyses for the effect of antipyretics for a first medically attended upper respiratory tract infection (URI) on subsequent wheezing.Compared with no antipyretic, treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen for a first episode of bronchiolitis was associated with decreased wheezing at 365-day follow-up (IRR 0.18, 95% CI 0.15-0.22), and ibuprofen plus acetaminophen over ibuprofen (IRR at 0.12, 95% CI 0.05-0.32). The results were similar at 30 and 14-day follow-up. Ibuprofen alone and ibuprofen plus acetaminophen were associated with decreased visits for subsequent wheezing at 365-day (IRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.92), but not earlier timepoints, when compared with acetaminophen. A smaller effect was seen for ibuprofen at one year if prescribed for a URI (IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-1.00) but not at earlier follow-up.Children who are prescribed antipyretics for a first episode of bronchiolitis may have less subsequent wheezing than those who are not. We found fewer visits for subsequent wheezing for those prescribed ibuprofen, and ibuprofen combined with acetaminophen, compared with acetaminophen alone."
https://openalex.org/W2889854771,"To evaluate normal and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) eyes for differences in peripapillary and macular choroidal area measurements.This cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 52 normal subjects and 35 NTG patients. Peripapillary and macular choroidal images were recorded by enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), with conversion of the luminal and interstitial areas to binary images performed using the Niblack method.While there was a significant difference between normal subjects and NTG patients for the peripapillary choroidal area (1,853,672 ± 626,501 μm2 vs. 1,606,448 ± 418,214 μm2, P = 0.047), there were no significant differences between the normal subjects and NTG patients observed for the macular choroidal area (345,365 ± 119,248 μm2 vs. 316,442 ± 85,732 μm2, P = 0.23). In the NTG patients, multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a correlation between the macular choroidal area and the axial length (β = -0.345, P = 0.04). Furthermore, there was also a significant correlation between the peripapillary choroidal area and the age of the NTG patients (β = -0.469, P = 0.004). In addition, there was no relationship between the glaucoma severity and the peripapillary and macular choroidal areas in the NTG patients.There was no correlation between the peripapillary choroidal area and glaucoma severity in NTG patients, even though the area was smaller in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2890421172,"Small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infection manifests itself mainly with chronic progressive arthritis affecting mainly carpal joints. The data from serological and questionnaire surveys were retrospectively analyzed to determine how the dissemination of SRLV infection in the herd influenced farmer's subjective opinion on the occurrence of swelling of carpal joints (considered as a proxy of arthritis). Between 1996 and 2017 153 different Polish dairy goat herds counting at least 20 adult goats were serologically screened for CAE and their owners were asked about their opinion on the occurrence of arthritis (never, rarely, often). Of them 73 SRLV-seropositive herds, in which true seroprevalence had been estimated, were included in the analysis. The ordinal logistic regression model was developed to determine the relationship between the true within-herd seroprevalence and the probability that the farmer would observe arthritis in the herd never, rarely or often. True within-herd seroprevalence ranged from 0.2% to 100% with the median of 34.6%. Farmers declared not to have observed arthritis in 40 (54.8%) herds, to have seen it rarely in 9 (12.3%) of herds, and to have observed it often in 24 (32.9%) of herds. The model proved that the probability of observing goats with carpal arthritis in the herd was significantly linked to the true within-herd seroprevalence (OR = 1.058, CI 95% from 1.037 to 1.078; p<0.001), but this relationship was not linear and SRLV infection proved to remain unapparent to farmers even when a considerable part of the herd had already become infected. Concluding, the study shows that when the farmer realizes that goats in the herd suffer from arthritis, SRLV infection is almost certainly already widespread in the herd."
https://openalex.org/W2890895494,"Research on meditation is advancing, but few studies about the motivations of meditators exist. Additionally, many forms and traditions of meditation have yet to be investigated. This study addresses both of these issues by presenting an overview of different forms of motivations found in contemporary Anthroposophic meditation practice. 30 Anthroposophic meditators were interviewed about their meditation experiences. The interviews were examined using thematic analysis. 14 data-driven themes were extracted and organized within a framework consisting of three superordinate theory-driven forms of motivation: External, internal and service. A developmental trajectory running from external and internal to service motivations is indicated. This approach improves upon a scheme developed by Shapiro by including additional types of motivations and being able to differentiate between forms of motivations that are fundamentally different: Self-related (heteronomous and autonomous) motivations and other-related motivations."
https://openalex.org/W2891084139,"3D-body scanning anthropometry is a suitable method for characterization of physiological development of children and adolescents, and for understanding onset and progression of disorders like overweight and obesity. Here we present a novel body typing approach to describe and to interpret longitudinal 3D-body scanning data of more than 800 children and adolescents measured in up to four follow-ups in intervals of 1 year, referring to an age range between 6 and 18 years. We analyzed transitions between body types assigned to lower-, normal- and overweight participants upon development of children and adolescents. We found a virtually parallel development of the body types with only a few transitions between them. Body types of children and adolescents tend to conserve their weight category. 3D body scanning anthropometry in combination with body typing constitutes a novel option to investigate onset and progression of obesity in children."
https://openalex.org/W2889634290,"Different explanations exist on how HIV-1 subtype B spread in Central America, but the role of Guatemala, the Central American country with the highest number of people living with the virus, in this scenario is unknown. We investigated the evolutionary history and spatiotemporal dynamics of HIV-1 subtype B in Guatemala. A total of 1,047 HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences, from newly diagnosed ART-naïve, HIV-infected Guatemalan subjects enrolled between 2011 and 2013 were combined with published subtype B sequences from other Central American countries (n = 2,101) and with reference sequences representative of the BPANDEMIC and BCAR lineages from the United States (n = 465), France (n = 344) and the Caribbean (n = 238). Estimates of evolutionary, demographic, and phylogeographic parameters were obtained from sequence data using maximum likelihood and Bayesian coalescent-based methods. The majority of Guatemalan sequences (98.9%) belonged to the BPANDEMIC clade, and 75.2% of these sequences branched within 10 monophyletic clades: four also included sequences from other Central American countries (BCAM-I to BCAM-IV) and six were mostly (>99%) composed by Guatemalan sequences (BGU clades). Most clades mainly comprised sequences from heterosexual individuals. Bayesian coalescent-based analyses suggested that BGU clades originated during the 1990s and 2000s, whereas BCAM clades originated between the late 1970s and mid 1980s. The major hub of dissemination of all BGU, and of BCAM-II, and BCAM-IV clades was traced to the Department of Guatemala, while the root location of BCAM-I and BCAM-III was traced to Honduras. Most Guatemalan clades experienced initial phases of exponential growth (0.23 and 3.6 year-1), followed by recent growth declines. Our observations suggest that the Guatemalan HIV-1 subtype B epidemic is driven by dissemination of multiple BPANDEMIC founder viral strains, some restricted to Guatemala and others widely disseminated in the Central American region, with Guatemala City identified as a major hub of viral dissemination. Our results also suggest the existence of different sub-epidemics within Guatemala for which different targeted prevention efforts might be needed."
https://openalex.org/W2891996207,"Large conductance voltage- and calcium-gated channels (BK) control fundamental processes, including smooth muscle contractility and artery diameter. We used a baboon (Papio spp) model of pregnancy that is similar to that of humans to characterize BK channels in the middle cerebral artery and its branches in near-term (165 dGa) primate fetuses and corresponding pregnant mothers. In cell-attached patches (K+pipette = 135 mM) on freshly isolated fetal cerebral artery myocytes, BK currents were identified by large conductance, and voltage- and paxilline-sensitive effects. Their calcium sensitivity was confirmed by a lower Vhalf (transmembrane voltage needed to reach half-maximal current) in inside-out patches at 30 versus 3 μM [Ca2+]free. Immunostaining against the BK channel-forming alpha subunit revealed qualitatively similar levels of BK alpha protein-corresponding fluorescence in fetal and maternal myocytes. Fetal and maternal BK currents recorded at 3 μM [Ca2+]free from excised membrane patches had similar unitary current amplitude, and Vhalf. However, subtle differences between fetal and maternal BK channel phenotypes were detected in macroscopic current activation kinetics. To assess BK function at the organ level, fetal and maternal artery branches were pressurized in vitro at 30 mmHg and probed with the selective BK channel blocker paxilline (1 μM). The degree of paxilline-induced constriction was similar in fetal and maternal arteries, yet the constriction of maternal arteries was achieved sooner. In conclusion, we present a first identification and characterization of fetal cerebral artery BK channels in myocytes from primates. Although differences in BK channels between fetal and maternal arteries exist, the similarities reported herein advance the idea that vascular myocyte BK channels are functional near-term, and thus may serve as pharmacological targets during the perinatal-neonatal period."
https://openalex.org/W2892237591,"There is no available training programme with standard elements for health workers treating clubfoot in Africa. Standardised training with continued mentorship has the potential to improve management of clubfoot. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of such a training programme among clubfoot providers in Africa, and assess implications for training effectiveness and scale up.We used participatory research with trainers from 18 countries in Africa over two years to devise, pilot and refine a 2-day basic and a 2-day advanced clubfoot treatment course. (The Africa Clubfoot Training or 'ACT' Course.) The pilots involved training 113 participants. Mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative) were used for evaluation. We describe and synthesise the results using the eight elements proposed by Bowen et al (2010) to assess feasibility. All participants completed feedback questionnaires, and interviews were conducted with a subset of participants. We undertook a narrative description of themes raised in the participant questionnaires and interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to compare pre- and post-course scores for confidence and knowledge.113 participants completed pre and post-course measures (response rate = 100%). Mean participant confidence increased from 64% (95%CI: 59-69%) to 88% (95%CI: 86-91%) post course. Mean participant knowledge increased from 55% (95%CI: 51-60%) to 78% (95%CI: 76-81%) post course. No difference was found in mean for either subscale of cadre or sex. The qualitative analysis generated themes under four domains: 'practical learning in groups', 'interactive learning', 'relationship with the trainer' and 'ongoing supervision and mentorship'.The Africa Clubfoot Training package to teach health care workers to manage clubfoot is likely to be feasible in Africa. Future work should evaluate its impact on short and long term treatment outcomes and a process evaluation of implementation is required."
https://openalex.org/W2797625239,"The Ligon-Schaaf regularization (LS mapping) was introduced in 1976 and has been used several times. However, we are not aware of any direct usage of the inverse mapping, perhaps since it appears at first sight to be quite complex, involves the use of a transcendental equation (referred to as the generalized Kepler equation) that cannot be solved in closed form, and lacks smoothness near the collision point. Here, we provide some insight into the significance of this equation, along with a very simple derivation and confirmation of the inverse LS mapping. Then we use numerical methods to investigate three applications: 1) solutions of the Kepler function, 2) calculation of orbits including time-of-flight data based on the Delaunay Hamiltonian, and 3) numerical evidence for the Birkhoff conjecture for the circular restricted 3-body problem."
