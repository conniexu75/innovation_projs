Chemical treatments engineer the interparticle spacing, electronic coupling, and doping while passivating electronic traps. These nanocrystal field-effect transistors allow reversible switching between n- and p-transport, providing options for complementary metal oxide semiconductor circuits and enabling a range of low-cost, large-area electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric, and sensing applications."
https://openalex.org/W2001917660,"As the sole Ca2+ entry mechanism in a variety of non-excitable cells, store-operated calcium (SOC) influx is important in Ca2+ signalling and many other cellular processes. A calcium-release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel in T lymphocytes is the best-characterized SOC influx channel and is essential to the immune response, sustained activity of CRAC channels being required for gene expression and proliferation. The molecular identity and the gating mechanism of SOC and CRAC channels have remained elusive. Previously we identified Stim and the mammalian homologue STIM1 as essential components of CRAC channel activation in Drosophila S2 cells and human T lymphocytes. Here we show that the expression of EF-hand mutants of Stim or STIM1 activates CRAC channels constitutively without changing Ca2+ store content. By immunofluorescence, EM localization and surface biotinylation we show that STIM1 migrates from endoplasmic-reticulum-like sites to the plasma membrane upon depletion of the Ca2+ store. We propose that STIM1 functions as the missing link between Ca2+ store depletion and SOC influx, serving as a Ca2+ sensor that translocates upon store depletion to the plasma membrane to activate CRAC channels."

Here we demonstrate that intracellular Abeta is present in mitochondria from brains of transgenic mice with targeted neuronal overexpression of mutant human amyloid precursor protein and AD patients. Abeta progressively accumulates in mitochondria and is associated with diminished enzymatic activity of respiratory chain complexes (III and IV) and a reduction in the rate of oxygen consumption. Importantly, mitochondria-associated Abeta, principally Abeta42, was detected as early as 4 months, before extensive extracellular Abeta deposits. Our studies delineate a new means through which Abeta potentially impairs neuronal energetics, contributing to cellular dysfunction in AD."

https://openalex.org/W2167504726,"Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are bright, brief flashes of high energy photons that have fascinated scientists for 30 years. They come in two classes: long (>2 s), softspectrum bursts and short, hard events. The major progress to date on understanding GRBs has been for long bursts which are typically at high redshift (z ~ 1) and are in sub-luminous star-forming host galaxies. They are likely produced in core-collapse explosions of massive stars. Until the present observation, no short GRB had been accurately (<10"") and rapidly (minutes) located. Here we report the detection of X-ray afterglow from and the localization of short burst GRB050509b. Its position on the sky is near a luminous, non-starforming elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, exactly the type of location one would expect if the origin of this GRB is the long-proposed fiery merger of neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) binaries. The X-ray afterglow is found to be weak and fading below detection within a few hours and no optical afterglow is detected to stringent limits, explaining the past difficulty in localizing short GRBs."
https://openalex.org/W2152414522,"The proton transfer mechanism between aqueous Brønsted acids and bases, forming an encounter pair, has been studied in real time with ultrafast infrared spectroscopy. The transient intermediacy of a hydrated proton, formed by ultrafast dissociation from an optically triggered photoacid proton donor ROH, is implicated by the appearance of an infrared absorption marker band before protonation of the base, B – . Thus, proton exchange between an acid and a base in aqueous solution is shown to proceed by a sequential, von Grotthuss–type, proton-hopping mechanism through water bridges. The spectra suggest a hydronium cation H 3 O + structure for the intermediate, stabilized in the Eigen configuration in the ionic complex RO – ···H 3 O + ···B – ."

https://openalex.org/W2082865060,"The final chapter in the long-standing mystery of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) centres on the origin of the short-hard class of bursts, which are suspected on theoretical grounds to result from the coalescence of neutron-star or black-hole binary systems. Numerous searches for the afterglows of short-hard bursts have been made, galvanized by the revolution in our understanding of long-duration GRBs that followed the discovery in 1997 of their broadband (X-ray, optical and radio) afterglow emission. Here we present the discovery of the X-ray afterglow of a short-hard burst, GRB 050709, whose accurate position allows us to associate it unambiguously with a star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.160, and whose optical lightcurve definitively excludes a supernova association. Together with results from three other recent short-hard bursts, this suggests that short-hard bursts release much less energy than the long-duration GRBs. Models requiring young stellar populations, such as magnetars and collapsars, are ruled out, while coalescing degenerate binaries remain the most promising progenitor candidates."

https://openalex.org/W2145099378,"Most people hold beliefs about personality characteristics typical of members of their own and others' cultures. These perceptions of national character may be generalizations from personal experience, stereotypes with a “kernel of truth,” or inaccurate stereotypes. We obtained national character ratings of 3989 people from 49 cultures and compared them with the average personality scores of culture members assessed by observer ratings and self-reports. National character ratings were reliable but did not converge with assessed traits. Perceptions of national character thus appear to be unfounded stereotypes that may serve the function of maintaining a national identity."
https://openalex.org/W2172273387,"With the long-term goal of producing nanometer-scale machines, we describe here the unidirectional rotary motion of a synthetic molecular structure fueled by chemical conversions. The basis of the rotation is the movement of a phenyl rotor relative to a naphthyl stator about a single bond axle. The sense of rotation is governed by the choice of chemical reagents that power the motor through four chemically distinct stations. Within the stations, the rotor is held in place by structural features that limit the extent of the rotor's Brownian motion relative to the stator."
https://openalex.org/W2104068398,"The large-scale spatial dynamics and population structure of marine top predators are poorly known. We present electronic tag and photographic identification data showing a complex suite of behavioral patterns in white sharks. These include coastal return migrations and the fastest known transoceanic return migration among swimming fauna, which provide direct evidence of a link between widely separated populations in South Africa and Australia. Transoceanic return migration involved a return to the original capture location, dives to depths of 980 meters, and the tolerance of water temperatures as low as 3.4°C. These findings contradict previous ideas that female white sharks do not make transoceanic migrations, and they suggest natal homing behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1965203972,"Understanding the nature of solid-liquid interfaces is important for many processes of technological interest, such as solidification, liquid-phase epitaxial growth, wetting, liquid-phase joining, crystal growth, and lubrication. Recent studies have reported on indirect evidence of density fluctuations at solid-liquid interfaces on the basis of x-ray scattering methods that have been complemented by atomistic simulations. We provide evidence for ordering of liquid atoms adjacent to an interface with a crystal, based on real-time high-temperature observations of alumina-aluminum solid-liquid interfaces at the atomic-length scale. In addition, crystal growth of alumina into liquid aluminum, facilitated by interfacial transport of oxygen from the microscope column, was observed in situ with the use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy."

In the Connections Map database at Science 's Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment (STKE), the pathways that define the mitochondrial pathway of apotosis are illustrated, with the bulk of control occurring “upstairs” of MOMP."
https://openalex.org/W2048819092,"Climate models predict that the concentration of water vapor in the upper troposphere could double by the end of the century as a result of increases in greenhouse gases. Such moistening plays a key role in amplifying the rate at which the climate warms in response to anthropogenic activities, but has been difficult to detect because of deficiencies in conventional observing systems. We use satellite measurements to highlight a distinct radiative signature of upper tropospheric moistening over the period 1982 to 2004. The observed moistening is accurately captured by climate model simulations and lends further credence to model projections of future global warming."
https://openalex.org/W1973912576,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are either ‘long and soft’, or ‘short and hard’. The long-duration type leave a strong afterglow and have been extensively studied. So we have a good idea of what causes them: explosions of massive stars in distant star-forming galaxies. Short GRBs, with no strong afterglow, were harder to pin down. The Swift satellite, launched last November, is designed to study bursts as soon as they happen. Having shown its worth with long GRBs (reported in the 18 August issue of Nature), Swift has now bagged a short burst, GRB 050509B, precisely measured its location and detected the X-ray afterglow. Four papers this week report on this and another recent short burst. Now, over 20 years after they were first recognized, the likely origin of the short GRBs is revealed as a merger between neutron stars of a binary system and the instantaneous production of a black hole. It has long been known that there are two classes1 of γ-ray bursts (GRBs), mainly distinguished by their durations. The breakthrough in our understanding of long-duration GRBs (those lasting more than ∼2 s), which ultimately linked them with energetic type Ic supernovae2,3,4, came from the discovery of their long-lived X-ray5 and optical6,7 ‘afterglows’, when precise and rapid localizations of the sources could finally be obtained. X-ray localizations have recently become available8,9 for short (duration <2 s) GRBs, which have evaded optical detection for more than 30 years. Here we report the first discovery of transient optical emission (R-band magnitude ∼23) associated with a short burst: GRB 050709. The optical afterglow was localized with subarcsecond accuracy, and lies in the outskirts of a blue dwarf galaxy. The optical and X-ray10 afterglow properties 34 h after the GRB are reminiscent of the afterglows of long GRBs, which are attributable to synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic ejecta. We did not, however, detect a supernova, as found in most nearby long GRB afterglows, which suggests a different origin for the short GRBs."
https://openalex.org/W2160204546,"The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a collection of stem cells that resides at the tip of each shoot and provides the cells of the shoot. It is divided into functional regions. The central zone (CZ) at the tip of the meristem is the domain of expression of the CLAVATA3 ( CLV3 ) gene, encoding a putative ligand for a transmembrane receptor kinase, CLAVATA1, active in cells of the rib meristem (RM), located just below the CZ. We show here that CLV3 restricts its own domain of expression (the CZ) by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells (PZ), which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate."

In SNFUH, the phase and amplitude of the scattered specimen ultrasound wave, reflected in perturbation to the surface acoustic standing wave, are mapped with a scanning probe microscopy platform to provide nanoscale-resolution images of the internal substructure of diverse materials. We have used SNFUH to image buried nanostructures, to perform subsurface metrology in microelectronic structures, and to image malaria parasites in red blood cells."

https://openalex.org/W1584477200,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) fall into two classes: short-hard and long-soft bursts. The latter are now known to have X-ray and optical afterglows, to occur at cosmological distances in star-forming galaxies, and to be associated with the explosion of massive stars. In contrast, the distance scale, the energy scale and the progenitors of the short bursts have remained a mystery. Here we report the discovery of a short-hard burst whose accurate localization has led to follow-up observations that have identified the X-ray afterglow and (for the first time) the optical afterglow of a short-hard burst; this in turn led to the identification of the host galaxy of the burst as a late-type galaxy at z = 0.16 (ref. 10). These results show that at least some short-hard bursts occur at cosmological distances in the outskirts of galaxies, and are likely to be caused by the merging of compact binaries."

We used a satellite tag attached to the dorsal fin to track salmon sharks ( Lamna ditropis ) for up to 3.2 years. Here we show that salmon sharks have a subarctic-to-subtropical niche, ranging from 2° to 24°C, and they spend winter periods in waters as cold as 2° to 8°C. Functional assays and protein gels reveal that the expression of excitation-contraction coupling proteins is enhanced in salmon shark hearts, which may underlie the shark's ability to maintain heart function at cold temperatures and their niche expansion into subarctic seas."

Here we illustrate their roles in embryonic stem cells and in the differentiation of neural, hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and gastrointestinal epithelial stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037262355,"As key molecular chaperone proteins, heat shock proteins (HSPs) represent an important cellular protective mechanism against neuronal cell death in various models of neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect as well as the molecular mechanism of geldanamycin (GA), an inhibitor of Hsp90, on 1-methyl-4-pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a mouse model of Parkinson disease. Neurochemical analysis showed that pretreatment with GA (via intracerebral ventricular injection 24 h prior to MPTP treatment) increased residual dopamine content and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the striatum 24 h after MPTP treatment. To dissect out the molecular mechanism underlying this neuroprotection, we showed that the GA-mediated protection against MPTP was associated with a reduction of cytosolic Hsp90 and an increase in Hsp70, with no significant changes in Hsp40 and Hsp25 levels. Furthermore, in parallel with the induction of Hsp70, striatal nuclear HSF1 levels and HSF1 binding to heat shock element sites in the Hsp70 promoter were significantly enhanced by the GA pretreatment. Together these results suggested that the molecular cascade leading to the induction of Hsp70 is critical to the neuroprotection afforded by GA against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and that pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for Parkinson disease.

Genetic studies in Drosophila showed that overexpression of Hsp70 attenuated the death of dopaminergic neurons induced by transgene expression of α-synuclein (30Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q.

Moreover, induction of Hsp70 by prior exposure to heat shock protects against 1-methyl, 4-phenyl, pyridinium ion (MPP+)-induced neuronal cell death in cultured PC12 cells (36Quigney D.J. Gorman A.M. Samali A. Brain Res. 2003; 993: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and against α-synuclein aggregation in human H4 neuroglioma cells (32Klucken J. Shin Y. Masliah E. Hyman B.T.

Similarly, overexpression of Hsp70 in dopaminergic neurons using adeno-associated virus inhibits MPTP-induced nigrostriatal degeneration in mice (37Dong Z. Wolfer D.P. Lipp H.P. Bueler H. Mol. Ther. 2005; 11: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hsp70 was found in the Lewy bodies of the postmortem tissues of a sporadic PD patient (30Auluck P.K.

Breakefield X.O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These experimental findings are further supported by a recent epidemiological study showing that the susceptibility to PD may be associated with a potential polymorphism in the 5′ promoter region of the hsp70-1 gene (39Wu Y.R. Wang C.K. Chen C.M. Hsu Y. Lin S.J. Lin Y.Y. Fung H.C. Chang K.H. Lee-Chen G.J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, HSPs may represent an important molecular target for neuroprotective strategies in PD treatment. Pharmacological manipulation of HSPs in the brain may provide a potential approach to halt or slow down dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD. Geldanamycin (GA) is a naturally occurring benzoquinone ansamycin that specifically binds to and inhibits the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (40Neckers L. Mimnaugh E. Schulte T.W. Drug Resist Updates. 1999; 2: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 41Chiosis G. Vilenchik M. Kim J. Solit D. Drug Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). GA has been shown to protect against neuronal damage induced by ischemia and huntingtin aggregates, through the induction of Hsp70 in the brain (17Lu A. Ran R. Parmentier-Batteur S. Nee A. Sharp F.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Sittler A. Lurz R. Lueder G. Priller J. Lehrach H. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Wanker E.E. Hum. Mol.

Bonini N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2873-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and attenuates α-synuclein aggregation and neurotoxicity in human H4 neuroglioma cells (32Klucken J.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, these studies have been limited to cultured cell models and Drosophila, and it is not known whether GA can offer a neuroprotective effect in an in vivo rodent model of PD. In this study, we examined the effect of GA on MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice. We further investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the potential neuroprotective actions of GA in the MPTP model of PD. Animals and Drug Treatments—All experiments were performed in accordance with the Boston University School of Medicine and National Institutes of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals. Male C57BL/6 mice (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, weight 25–30 g) were housed in plastic cages and provided free access to food and water. Animals were maintained in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms with a 12-h light-dark cycle (light from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.). Mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups (as described in the legend for Fig. 1): S+S, saline pretreatment followed by saline treatment; S+M, saline pretreatment followed by MPTP treatment; G+S, GA pretreatment followed by saline treatment; G+M, GA pretreatment followed by MPTP treatment. Pretreatment with GA (Sigma) or saline was perfused by stereotaxical (intracerebral ventricular) injection, under anesthesia, into the lateral cerebral ventricles in a dosage of 1 or 10 μg/kg at a rate of 1 μl/min using a micro syringe pump. GA was administered at 72 or 24 h prior to, or co-administered with, or 6 h after the MPTP treatment (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or saline treatment. Mice were sacrificed at 24 h or 7 days after the MPTP treatment. Dopamine Measurements—The striatum was dissected out from the right cerebral hemisphere, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C until used. Each striatum was weighed and homogenized in 150 mm phosphoric acid and 0.2 mm EDTA and placed on ice for 1 h. The homogenate then was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was analyzed for dopamine content using standard reverse-phase HPLC with electrochemical detection as described previously (42Chen J.F. Xu K. Petzer J.P. Staal R. Xu Y.H. Beilstein M. Sonsalla P.K. Castagnoli K. Castagnoli Jr., N. Schwarzschild M.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, biogenic amines were separated on a C-18, 5-μm sphere column. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 m sodium phosphate monobasic, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.18 mm sodium octyl sulfate, and 8% methanol in filtered distilled water. The final pH of 3.3 was obtained with the addition of concentrated phosphoric acid, and the mobile phase was filtered and degassed before use. Tyrosine Hydroxylase Immunohistochemistry—For TH immunohistochemistry, mice were anesthetized with avertin (2% tribromoethanol, 1% tertiary amyl alcohol) and fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The brains were post-fixed in the same solution overnight and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline. Brains were cut coronally in 25-μm sections with a sliding microtome. Immunostaining was performed using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (1:1,000; CHEMICON, Temecula, CA) in free-floating sections following standard avidin-biotin procedures described previously (43Moratalla R. Elibol B. Vallejo M. Graybiel A.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Six representative sections from anterior, medial, and lateral striata from each animal were stained and quantified for TH-IR by densitometric analysis using a UVP BioImaging acquisition and image analysis system (Lab Works, Ver.4.0). Isolation of Whole Cell, Nuclear, and Cytosolic Proteins—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and decapitation. Since it is not feasible to dissect out substantia nigra from MPTP-treated mice for Western blot analysis and gel shift analysis, we focused on analyzing HSP expression in striata that provide HSP levels of striatal cells as well as dopaminergic terminals. Striata were dissected on an ice plate, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C. Whole cell proteins were isolated from striatum as described previously (17Lu A. Ran R. Parmentier-Batteur S. Nee A. Sharp F.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, striatal tissue was homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteinase inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were incubated on ice for 10 min, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as whole cell proteins. Nuclear proteins were isolated from striatum as described previously (44Yasmineh W.G. Yunis J.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1974; 8: 151-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Briefly, striatal tissue was homogenized in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Igepal-CA-630, and the proteinase inhibitor mixture tablet) and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant, the cytosolic protein fractions, was collected, and after washing twice with Buffer A, the pellets were resuspended in Buffer B (containing 20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 840 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as nuclear proteins. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit and albumin standard (Pierce). Western Immunoblotting—For Western blots, the whole cell extracts (30 μg) or nuclear proteins (10–20 μg) were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and applied to a 10–20% gradient Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). After blotting, the membranes were incubated with antibodies against Hsp90 (dilution 1:2,000), Hsp70 (1:4,000), Hsp40 (1:2,000), Hsp25 (1:1,000), and HSF1 (1:4,000) (all HSP antibodies from Stressgene, Victoria, BC Canada). The specific HSP bands were developed by incubating the blot with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody or antimouse antibody (1:5,000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Quantification of the immunoblot was performed by optical densitometric (OD) scanning using a UVP BioImaging acquisition and image analysis system (Lab Works). To normalize HSP immunoreactivity, β-actin protein was measured on the same blot with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:5,000; Sigma), and the OD ratio of the HSPs/β-actin was calculated. Gel Shift Mobility Assay—To determine HSF binding activity, 10 μg of the nuclear extracts were analyzed in gel mobility shift assays using the 32P-labeled double-stranded HSE oligonucleotide (5′-ACCAGACGCGAAACTGCTGGAAGATTCCTGGCCCCAAGGC-3′, genomic DNA sequence –156 to –117 bp of the Hsp70 promoter (46Gorzowski J.J.

After incubating in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCI, 1.0 mm MgCI2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min at room temperature, the samples were loaded onto non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed for 2 h at 200 V. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at –80 °C. Supershift studies were carried out using an antibody against HSF1 (Stressgene, Victoria, BC Canada). The protein sample was incubated with HSF1 antibody at 1:10 dilution for 30 min prior to incubate with HSE oligonucleotides. Statistical Analysis—Data from all experiments were analyzed using parametric statistics with Student's t test or one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni test, as appropriate. Intraventricular Administration of GA Attenuates MPTP-induced Depletion of Dopamine and Tyrosine Hydroxylase Immunoreactivity in Mouse Striatum—Since GA is a large molecule (molecular weight 560.64) with poor blood-brain barrier permeability, we employed intracerebral ventricular injection to deliver GA into the brain to test its ability to protect against MPTP-induced dopaminergic toxicity in mice. Twenty-four hours after pretreatment of GA (1 or 10 μg/kg of body weight = 0.03–0.3 μg/mice), mice were treated with a single dose of MPTP and examined at 24 h after the MPTP treatment (Fig. 1A). HPLC analysis showed that striatal dopamine content in the GA-saline group was slightly higher than the saline-saline group but did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1A). MPTP treatment reduced striatal dopamine content by ∼50% when compared with the saline-treated mice (n = 6, p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni). Importantly, pretreatment with GA at the dose of 10 μg/kg completely prevented the loss of striatal dopamine content by MPTP treatment (n = 9 for Fig. 1A, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni), whereas GA at the dose of 1 μg/kg was not effective (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, GA pretreatment increased not only residual dopamine content but also striatal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR, a marker of dopaminergic terminals) in the striatum (Fig. 1B) and substantia nigra (data not shown). Representative striatal sections of TH-IR are shown in Fig. 1B (left panel). Although MPTP treatment markedly reduced TH-IR in the striatum, intracerebral ventricular injection of GA (24 h prior to MPTP treatment) significantly increased striatal TH-IR levels when compared with the vehicle-pretreated group (Fig. 1B). Densitometric analysis of TH-IR showed that GA pretreatment significantly attenuated the reduction of TH-IR by MPTP in the striatum (Fig. 1B, right panel, n = 4, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni). Together, these data clearly demonstrate that intraventricular pretreatment with GA protects against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity (i.e. depletion of striatal dopamine content as well as dopaminergic terminals). Moreover, we further examined the effect of pretreatment with GA (10 μg/kg) when delivered 72 and 24 h prior to, as well as co-administration with, or 6 h after the MPTP treatment on residual dopamine content in the striatum (Fig. 1C). GA pretreatment alone did not alter dopamine content in the striatum after the saline treatment. Again, the neuroprotective effect of GA was observed when delivered 24 h prior to the MPTP (Fig. 1C, n = 6, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni). The experiment was repeated for the third time and showed similar neuroprotective effect by GA (10 μg/kg) pretreatment at 24 h prior to the MPTP injection in the striatum (data not shown). In contrast, all the other three time points examined (i.e. treatment with GA at 72 h prior to, or co-administration with, or 6 h after the MPTP treatment) were not effective in protecting against striatal dopamine depletion (Fig. 1C, n = 6–9, p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni). Finally, we also examined the effect of GA pretreatment (24 h prior to MPTP treatment) on striatal dopamine content at 7 days after the MPTP treatment. Although GA pretreatment tended to enhance striatal dopamine content at 7 days after the MPTP treatment (Fig. 1C, right panel), the residual dopamine contents between the saline-pretreated group and the GA-pretreated group did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08, n = 6, one-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni). Intraventricular Injection of GA Decreased Hsp90 Protein Level in the Striatum of Control and MPTP-treated Mice—To understand the molecular mechanism underlying GA-mediated neuroprotection in MPTP-treated mice, we examined the effect of GA pretreatment on Hsp90 levels in the striatum of MPTP-treated mice. Twenty-four hours after the saline or MPTP treatment, the Hsp90 levels were significantly lower in the G+S group when compared with the S+S group (Fig. 2A, n = 6, p < 0.05). Similarly, striatal Hsp90 levels in the G+M group were also lower than the S+M group (Fig. 2A, n = 6, p < 0.05). However, MPTP treatment alone did not affect striatal Hsp90 level (Fig. 2A, comparing the S+M group with the S+S group). The combined GA pretreatment and MPTP treatment did not further reduce Hsp90 when compared with the G+S group (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the reduction of Hsp90 level following GA pretreatment (either in saline- or MPTP-treated mice) was observed only when GA was delivered 24 h prior to the MPTP treatment. When GA was delivered 72 h prior to the MPTP treatment, Hsp90 levels in GA-pretreated mice were not different from the saline-treated group. GA Pretreatment Induces Expression of Hsp70 in the Striatum of MPTP-treated Mice—Since the expression of Hsp70 has been shown to protect against α-synuclein toxicity in Drosophila (31Auluck P.K.

Lack of immune response in microgravity occurs at the cellular level. We analyzed differential gene expression to find gravity-dependent genes and pathways. We found inhibited induction of 91 genes in the simulated freefall environment of the random positioning machine. Altered induction of 10 genes regulated by key signaling pathways was verified using real-time RT-PCR. We discovered that impaired induction of early genes regulated primarily by transcription factors NF-κB, CREB, ELK, AP-1, and STAT after crosslinking the T-cell receptor contributes to T-cell dysfunction in altered gravity environments. We have previously shown that PKA and PKC are key early regulators in T-cell activation. Since the majority of the genes were regulated by NF-κB, CREB, and AP-1, we studied the pathways that regulated these transcription factors. We found that the PKA pathway was down-regulated in vg. In contrast, PI3-K, PKC, and its upstream regulator pLAT were not significantly down-regulated by vectorless gravity. Since NF-κB, AP-1, and CREB are all regulated by PKA and are transcription factors predicted by microarray analysis to be involved in the altered gene expression in vectorless gravity, the data suggest that PKA is a key player in the loss of T-cell activation in altered gravity."
https://openalex.org/W1481415019,"Aquaculture, the farming of shrimp and other useful aquatic and marine plants and animals in artificially confined and tended ponds, pens, and cages, ranks as a phenomenal success story in global food production. In 1975, aquaculture contributed 8% to the overall yield of the world's fish harvest; now it provides more than one-third of the yield. Total aquaculture production in 2003 was 54.8 million metric tons valued at 67.3 billion in U.S. dollars. More than 90% of this output comes from Asia, where aquaculture has its origins and where this month's essay author has lived and worked all of her life. In her essay, Jurgenne H. Primavera, senior scientist of the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center based in Iloilo, Central Philippines, traces the recent history of aquaculture and the socioeconomic and environmental challenges that its rapid growth has wrought, especially for the mangrove ecosystems in which much of brackishwater pond aquaculture occurs. With an eye on all stakeholders, Primavera lays out how aquaculture is now falling short of the goal of sustainability and what steps might be taken to move the industry in that direction."
https://openalex.org/W1964734807,"After an earthquake, numerous smaller shocks are triggered over distances comparable to the dimensions of the mainshock fault rupture, although they are rare at larger distances. Here we analyse the scaling of dynamic deformations (the stresses and strains associated with seismic waves) with distance from, and magnitude of, their triggering earthquake, and show that they can cause further earthquakes at any distance if their amplitude exceeds several microstrain, regardless of their frequency content. These triggering requirements are remarkably similar to those measured in the laboratory for inducing dynamic elastic nonlinear behaviour, which suggests that the underlying physics is similar."
https://openalex.org/W2046518480,"Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) plays an important role in signal transduction through modulating the balance between two signaling lipids, diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. Here we identified a tenth member of the DGK family designated DGKκ. The κ-isozyme (1271 amino acids, calculated molecular mass, 142 kDa) contains a pleckstrin homology domain, two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like structures, and a separated catalytic region as have been found commonly for the type II isozymes previously cloned (DGKδ and DGKη). The new DGK isozyme has additionally 33 tandem repeats of Glu-Pro-Ala-Pro at the N terminus. Reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that the DGKκ mRNA is most abundant in the testis, and to a lesser extent in the placenta. DGKκ, when expressed in HEK293 cells, was persistently localized at the plasma membrane even in the absence of cell stimuli. Deletion analysis revealed that the short C-terminal sequence (amino acid residues 1199–1268) is necessary and sufficient for the plasma membrane localization. Interestingly, DGKκ, but not other type II DGKs, was specifically tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr<sup>78</sup> through the Src family kinase pathway in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. Moreover, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> selectively inhibited DGKκ activity in a Src family kinase-independent manner, suggesting that the isozyme changes the balance of signaling lipids in the plasma membrane in response to oxidative stress. The expression patterns, subcellular distribution, and regulatory mechanisms of DGKκ are distinct from those of DGKδ and DGKη despite high structural similarity, suggesting unique functions of the individual type II isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W2084715195,"The biological ramifications of phosphorylation of the androgen receptor (AR) are largely unknown. To examine the phosphorylation of AR at serine 213, a putative substrate for Akt, a phosphorylation site-specific antibody was generated. The use of this antibody indicated that AR Ser-213 is phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation is tightly regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, Ser-213 phosphorylation took place with rapid kinetics and was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Phosphorylation occurred in response to R1881 and dihydrotestosterone but weakly if at all in response to testosterone. It did not occur in response to AR antagonists or growth factor stimulation in the absence of an AR agonist. Transcription assays using an AR-responsive reporter gene construct showed that activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibited transcription mediated by wild type AR but not that of a mutant AR variant (S213A), which could not be phosphorylated at Ser-213. By immunohistochemistry, the AR Ser(P)-213 antigen was detected in prostate epithelial but not stromal cells despite the fact that an antibody recognizing both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of AR demonstrates that AR is present in both cell types as expected. In fetal tissue the AR-Ser(P)-213 antigen was present in epithelial cells of the urogenital sinus when endogenous androgen levels were high and activated Akt was prevalent, but absent at a later stage of development when endogenous androgen levels were low and Akt activation was minimal.

In addition, it has been reported that Akt, a cytoplasmic protein kinase activated by the lipid products of PI3K, phosphorylates AR at serines 213 and 791 in vitro (6Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B.

Multiple laboratories have investigated the functional link between the AR and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Overexpression of the constitutively active EGF receptor family member Her-2/neu has been implicated in AR activation and is proposed to play a role in hormone-independent prostate cell growth (9Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 10Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Further, Her-2/neu activation of AR was blocked by the pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, or by dominant interfering Akt, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a role in AR activation (6Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the mechanism of AR activation via this pathway occurs through Akt inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, resulting in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (11Sharma M. Chuang W.W. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30935-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Previously, β-catenin has been shown to interact with AR and enhance AR ligand-dependent activity (12Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang F.

Whereas Her-2/neu activation of PI3K/Akt enhances AR-mediated transcription, PTEN, the lipid phosphatase that acts to inhibit PI3K/Akt signaling, also inhibits AR transcriptional activation (14Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20444-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Nan B. Snabboon T. Unni E. Yuan X.J. Whang Y.E. Marcelli M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to PI3K/Akt activation of the AR, there have also been reports suggesting that the opposite may also occur and that androgen can activate PI3K via interaction of p85, Src, and the AR (16Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C.

These findings may suggest that androgens can directly activate the PI3K pathway and therefore circumvent the need for growth factor activation of cellular kinases to phosphorylate the AR. To examine AR phosphorylation at a putative site of Akt phosphorylation, a phosphorylation site-specific antibody was generated against AR phosphorylated at serine 213. The AR Ser(P)-213 antibody recognized the agonist but not the antagonist-bound receptor. The work described in this report utilized this new reagent to examine phosphorylation of AR Ser-213 in fetal development and in adult prostate tissue, because the prostate requires AR-mediated cell signaling for both growth and maintenance of a differentiated phenotype. Antibody Production—Phosphopeptide corresponding to human AR sequence 202EGSSSGRAREAS(PO4)GAPTSS219 was synthesized by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). The consensus sequence for Akt phosphorylation within this peptide is RAREASG. A cysteine residue was added to the N terminus of the peptide to facilitate chemical cross-linking. The phosphopeptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin prior to immunization (Covance Research Products, Inc., Denver, PA). Six rabbits were immunized, and the serum from each was tested separately for immunoblotting. Antibody was affinity-purified from a column prepared with immunizing peptide (Covance Research Products, Inc.). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed using an affinity-purified AR Ser(P)-213 antibody. Prostate specimens from human fetuses 14 and 24 weeks of gestational age were obtained following surgical abortion performed for reasons unrelated to this investigation. Approval for the collection of specimens was obtained by the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated, and washed in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. For antigen retrieval, paraffin sections were heated in a microwave oven (900 watts) in 10 mm citrate buffer followed by treatment with 3% H2O2 and blocking with 20% normal goat serum. Sections were then incubated with antibody against AR (1:500 dilution; N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AR Ser(P)-213 (described above), Ki67 (NCL-Ki67P, Novacastra Laboratories), Akt (Cell Signaling) or phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (Cell Signaling), followed by incubation with a biotinylated rabbit secondary. An avidin-biotin complex was formed and developed using diaminobenzidine substrate. Slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin. The immunohistochemistry shown in Figs. 7 and 8 is representative of experiments conducted on tissue from three different fetuses between the ages of 14 and 16 weeks and tissue from two different fetuses at 24 weeks of age. Fig. 9 is representative of immunohistochemistry conducted on >10 different human adult prostate tissue samples.FIGURE 8Akt in fetal prostate development.

Antibody against total AR stained all cells within the luminal epithelial cell layer (B), whereas AR Ser(P)-213 antibody stained luminal epithelial cells intensely but sporadically (A). In addition, whereas the antibody against total AR stained stromal cells (see panel B, inset, arrows), the antibody against AR Ser(P)-213 did not (see panel A, inset).

The processing and antigen retrieval of paraffin-embedded tissue sections was conducted as described for immunohistochemistry (above). Sections were then incubated with antibody against AR Ser(P)-213 and Ki67 followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500; Invitrogen) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen). Sections were mounted, and immunofluorescence was detected using an Axio-plan 2 Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The S213A, S791A, and S213A/S791A AR mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein expression of the construct was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-AR antibody (1:400 dilution; AR (441), Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—A human embryonic kidney cell line (293) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 50 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). LAPC4 cells (gift of Robert Reiter, UCLA) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. The androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). For the transfections shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4.2 × 106 293 cells were seeded into each 10-cm dish and transfected with 5 μg of wild type AR or 5 μg of mutant AR and 5 μg of vector alone (10 μg of total DNA per plate) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. After 3 h the medium was removed and replaced with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. 18 h later the cells were fed with fresh phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum with either the synthetic androgen ligand, 10 nm R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), or an identical volume of 100% ethanol and incubated for the indicated time. Cells were lysed in sodium orthovanadate-containing buffer prior to Western blot analysis.FIGURE 2Ligand dependence of AR Ser-213 phosphorylation. A, 293 cells were transfected with wild type AR (WT AR) or with the AR serine 213 to alanine mutant. The cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 nm R1881, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with AR Ser(P)-213 (AR-P-S213) or total AR antibody. Wild type AR shows robust phosphorylation at 10 nm R1881 but at not lower levels and, as expected, the AR S213A mutant does not show phosphorylation. B, 293 cells were transfected with wild type AR and treated with 1 or 10 nm R1881, DHT, testosterone (T), or estrogen (E2). As expected, estrogen treatment did not result in AR phosphorylation and testosterone resulted in little if any phosphorylation, whereas DHT and R1881 caused robust AR phosphorylation (AR-P-S213). C, AR antagonists did not promote Ser-213 phosphorylation. 293 cells were transfected with wild type AR and treated for 1 h with AR agonist R1881 (10 nm), the antagonists Casodex (Cdx) or flutamide (Flu)at10 μm, or both agonists and antagonists (Cdx plus R1881 and Flu plus R1881).

A, IGF-1 treatment alone does not result in AR phosphorylation in the absence of R1881. 293 cells were transfected as described above and treated with 50 ng/ml IGF-1 alone for 5 min (5 m), 10 min (10 m), or 2 h (lanes 1-4) or with 10 nm R1881 alone (lane 5) or 10 nm R1881 (2 h), followed by 50 ng/ml IGF-1 for 5 min or 10 min (lanes 6 and 7). Cell lysates were made and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against AR Ser(P)-213 (AR P-S213), total AR, phospho-MAPK (P-MAPK), total MAPK, Akt Ser(P)-473 (P-Akt), or total Akt. Although MAPK is phosphorylated in response to IGF-1, activation of MAPK does not correlate with AR Ser-213 phosphorylation. Akt is constitutively active in these experiments under all conditions and therefore could play a role in AR phosphorylation. B, EGF did not stimulate AR Ser-213 phosphorylation in the absence of R1881.

Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation, swelled in a hypotonic buffer, and lysed by extruding the cells through a 25-gauge hypodermic needle. This homogenate was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the nuclei, and the supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The proteins were extracted by resuspension of the nuclear pellet in a high salt buffer and separation of debris by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was retained as the nuclear fraction. AR Serine 213 Is Phosphorylated in Response to Androgen Receptor Agonists—Recent reports indicate that AR and Akt physically interact, resulting in effects on AR-mediated transcription, AR stability, and cell survival (6Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence analysis of AR indicates that it possesses two Akt consensus sites (RXRXX(S/T)), one located within the amino-terminal domain and one within the carboxyl-terminal domain (20Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) as diagrammed in Fig. 1A. To determine whether AR Ser-213 is phosphorylated in vivo and to study the biological importance of phosphorylation at this site, we generated antibodies that specifically recognize the AR Ser(P)-213. Polyclonal antibodies were generated the AR phospho-peptide 202EGSSSGRAREAS(PO4)GAPTSS219 against, and the anti-sera were tested by Western blot analysis. The specificity of the antibodies is demonstrated by recognition of wild type AR but not a serine-to-alanine mutant (S213A) that cannot be phosphorylated at this site (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the experiment showed that phosphorylation of Ser-213 occurs only in the presence of the synthetic androgen ligand, R1881, suggesting that ligand binding induces a conformational change in the N terminus that reveals the AR Ser-213 site to cellular kinases. Treatment of the cell lysates with λ phosphatase diminished antibody recognition of Ser-213 and confirmed that the antibody is recognizing phosphorylated Ser-213 (not shown). As a further test of antibody specificity, AR S791A was also mutated singly or in the context of the AR S213A mutant (Fig. 1C). Cells were co-transfected with HA epitope-tagged variants of wild type AR, AR S213A, AR S791A, or AR S213A/S791A. Fig. 1C shows total cell lysate from each transfection following immunoblot analysis with AR Ser(P)-213 antibody. As expected, the antibody detected Ser-213 in wild type AR and in the AR Ser-791 mutant, but not in the AR S213A or AR S213A/S791A mutants. Because both Ser-213 and Ser-791 are embedded within similar Akt phosphorylation consensus sequences, this finding confirmed that the antibody recognizes serine 213 specifically. Titration of R1881 ligand indicated that AR Ser-213 is phosphorylated at higher androgen concentrations (10 nm) but not at lower concentrations (Fig. 2A). As expected, the AR S213A mutant was not phosphorylated at any concentration of R1881. Consistent with these results, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment also resulted in phosphorylation of Ser-213 at 10 nm, but not 1 nm (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, testosterone treatment resulted in low levels of phosphorylation compared with DHT (Fig. 2B, lane 5 versus 7), even at treatment with 100 nm testosterone (not shown). As expected, estrogen stimulation did not result in AR Ser-213 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, lane 9). To determine whether AR Ser-213 is phosphorylated in the presence of AR antagonists, AR-transfected cells were treated with R1881, 5′-hydroxyflutamide, or Casodex (bicalutamide). Although AR Ser-213 was phosphorylated upon R1881 treatment, it was not phosphorylated upon treatment with the antagonists 5′-hydroxyflutamide or bicalutamide, indicating that AR Ser(P)-213 antibody specifically recognizes the agonist-bound but not antagonist-bound form of the receptor (Fig. 2C). To verify that the antagonists are functional, we showed that they diminish Ser-213 phosphorylation in the presence of R1881 (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6 versus lane 2). To evaluate the kinetics of AR phosphorylation, cells were treated with ligand for the indicated times (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation above background was apparent between 10 and 20 min and increased over time (Fig. 3A). The rapidity of this phosphorylation is consistent with a role in transcriptional activation, such as recruitment of coactivators or alteration of chaperone binding. To assess the subcellular localization of AR Ser(P)-213, fractionation studies were conducted following 2 h of R1881 treatment. AR was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with AR Ser(P)-213 antibody. Because AR translocates to the nucleus upon hormone binding, total AR levels were normalized by overloading the cytoplasmic extract lanes (Fig. 3B, bottom, lanes marked cyto) relative to the nuclear extract lanes (Fig. 3B, bottom, lanes marked nucl). Consistent with the ligand dependence of Ser-213 phosphorylation and the immunohistochemical analysis shown below, detection of AR Ser(P)-213 is predominantly nuclear (Fig. 3B, top, row marked AR-P-S213). Based on these findings, AR is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser-213, and the phosphorylated species is located predominantly in the nucleus. These observations do not indicate whether the phosphorylation takes place in the cytoplasm or nucleus, but phosphorylation at Ser-213 is not a prerequisite for transport into the nucleus, because we observed no defect in AR S213A transport into the nucleus (Fig. 3B, top, row marked Total AR). Kinase Phosphorylation of AR Ser(P)-213—To determine whether the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a role in the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser-213, cells were treated with R1881 in the presence or absence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. As expected, 50 μm LY294002 diminished endogenous levels of Akt autophosphorylat"

The (M1PM2)4 domain is predicted to cross the membrane eight times, which has been confirmed experimentally for three members of the SKT family (16Buurman E.T. Kim K.-T. Epstein W. J. Biol.

Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with a structure resembling the K+ pore of K+ channel tetramers (supplemental Fig. 4) (5Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M.

With a few exceptions, each p-loop of the SKT proteins contains a conserved glycine residue at a position structurally equivalent to the central glycine residue of the selectivity filter sequence Thr-Val-Gly-Tyr-Gly from the KcsA channel monomers (see Fig. 1). In analogy to the situation in K+ channels (23Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), these four glycines of the SKT protein KtrB from V. alginolyticus were labeled selectivity filter residues when there was little evidence that they play a role in the specificity of K+ transport (9Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since then, it has been confirmed experimentally that several of these conserved glycine residues from Escherichia coli KdpA (16Buurman E.T. Kim K.-T. Epstein W. J. Biol.

Inspection of Fig. 1 shows that the four p-loops from VaKtrB exhibit little sequence identity to either the p-loop from KcsA or each other. Hence, the presented folding model for KtrB needs further experimental support. An important issue is the question whether each of the four conserved glycine residues in the putative p-loops PA to PD belongs to the selectivity filter, forming a narrow central K+ permeation pathway (“pore”) through the membrane (1Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys.

Here, we report on experiments in which we systematically mutated these four conserved glycine residues in the SKT subunit KtrB of the K+ uptake system Ktr from the bacterium V. alginolyticus (29Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A few years ago, Ktr was recognized as a separate type of K+ uptake system, functionally different from the related Trk system (1Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54952-54962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or whether Ktr functions as a K+/Na+ symporter (10Kawano M. Abuki R. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2507-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). VaKtr consists of two types of subunits. KtrA is a peripheral membrane protein presumably bound to the inner side of the cell membrane (29Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It belongs to the KTN (K+ transport, nucleotide binding) protein/domain family (PFAM2254/COG0569; GOLD genomes online database) (33Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to regulate K+ transport via KtrB by a change in its binding from NAD+ to NADH according to a “ligand-mediated conformational switch” mechanism (33Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The second subunit, the integral membrane protein VaKtrB (called NtpJ in Enterococcus hirae) (10Kawano M. Abuki R. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2507-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10042-10047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is responsible for K+ transport across the membrane (2Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we mutated each of the four putative selectivity filter glycine residues in VaKtrB at positions 70, 185, 290, and 402 (see Fig. 1B) to alanine, aspartate, or serine. The effects of these changes on K+ and Na+ uptake by VaKtrAB were determined in E. coli mutants defective in the transport of either K+ or Na+ ions. A single change of any of these residues affected both the affinity of the transporter for K+ and its cation specificity, demonstrating that, in KtrB, all four conserved p-loop glycine residues are part of a K+ selectivity filter. Further studies in E. coli on VaKtrB without KtrA revealed an important role for KtrA in the substrate specificity and transport mechanism of the Ktr system. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental TABLE 1. Plasmids pNT11 to pNT13, pNT31 to pNT33, and pNT41 to pNT43 (containing mutations in codons 70, 402, and 185 of VaktrB, respectively) were generated from plasmid pKT84 (29Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pEL308 is a derivative of pKT84, encoding C-terminally His-tagged VaktrB. It was constructed with a PCR forward primer containing the intrinsic NsiI site in front of VaktrA and a reverse primer extending the 3′-end of VaktrB with a His6 codon sequence followed by a stop codon and a new AvaI site. The 2-kb PCR fragment was digested with NsiI and AvaI and ligated with the 4.7-kb fragment from pKT84, digested with the same enzymes. For the construction of plasmid pEL901, a SacI site in front of the ribosome-binding site of VaktrB and an SphI site immediately behind its stop codon were introduced by PCR. The product was trimmed with these enzymes and ligated with plasmid pBAD18 (35Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar), digested with the same enzymes. Plasmid pEL903 is a construct similar to pEL901, but encodes VaKtrB with six histidine residues fused to its C-terminal end. Plasmid pEL905 is a pBAD18 derivative containing VaktrAB with a His6 codon sequence attached to the 3′-end of ktrB. It was constructed with a PCR primer pair containing a KpnI site in front of ktrA and an SphI site behind ktrB-His6. The 2-kb PCR product was digested with KpnI and SphI and ligated with pBAD18, digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids pEL911 to pEL913 and pEL903-11 to pEL903-13 were generated from plasmids pEL901 and pEL903, respectively, by introducing mutations at codon 70 of ktrB. Plasmid-containing E. coli LB2003 cells (36Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C under aerobic conditions in K30 minimal mineral medium, which contains 12 mm K2HPO4, 6 mm KH2PO4, 34 mm Na2HPO4, and 17 mm NaH2PO4 as phosphate salts (37Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid-containing E. coli TO114 cells (38Sakuma T. Yamada N. Saito H. Kakegawa T. Kobayashi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were grown in K115 medium, which contains 46 mm K2HPO4 and 23 mm KH2PO4 as phosphate salts. For cells containing plasmid pKT84 and its derivatives, 10 mm glucose was used as the carbon source (37Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cells containing pBAD18 derivatives, 20 mm glycerol and 0.02% l-arabinose (an inductor) were used for this purpose (35Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar). Growth Tests at Different K+ Concentrations—For plate tests, single colonies of plasmid-containing LB2003 cells were grown on 1.5% agar plates containing K30 medium, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, and one of the carbon sources specified above. Cell material from these colonies was “patched” on a series of plates containing the same medium, but with a K+ concentration of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, 6, 10, 30, or 115 mm. These plates were incubated at 37 °C, and growth was scored after ∼16 h and checked after 24 and 40 h. Overnight growth tests in liquid minimal medium were done at the K+ concentrations listed above using a 1:300 inoculum of cells grown overnight in 30 mm K+. Depletion from Alkali Cations—Cells grown in liquid K30 medium were harvested during the late exponential phase and depleted of most of their K+ ions by a Tris/EDTA treatment (39Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 820-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). K+-depleted, Na+-loaded, plasmid-containing LB2003 cells were prepared by washing the EDTA-treated cells twice with 200 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.5), followed by suspension of the cells at 10-20 mg of cell dry weight/ml of the same medium (39Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 820-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells depleted of K+ and Na+ (and loaded with triethanolamine) were prepared by washing the Tris/EDTA-treated cells two times with 200 mm Hepes brought to pH 7.3 with concentrated triethanolamine base (triethanolamine/Hepes), followed by suspension at 10-20 mg of cell dry weight/ml of the same medium (9Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were shaken at 20 °C before being used for the transport experiment within 2 h after their preparation. Net K+ Uptake by K+-depleted Cells—K+-depleted, plasmid-containing E. coli LB2003 cells were suspended at 1 mg of cell dry weight/ml of 200 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.3) and shaken at 20 °C at 150 rpm. As an energy source, either 10 mm glucose or 20 mm glycerol plus 0.02% l-arabinose was added at t = -10 min, followed by KCl at the concentrations indicated in the figures at t = 0. At different time points, samples of 1.0 ml were transferred to a 1.5-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube containing 200 μl of AR200 silicone oil (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). The cells were immediately centrifuged for 2 min at 16,000 × g through the oil in an Eppendorf 5414 D centrifuge. The pellet was cut off from the tube and transferred to a tube containing 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Cations from the cell pellet were released by vigorous vortexing, a freeze/thaw cycle, vortexing, and heating the suspension to ∼95 °C. A volume of 3 ml of 6.25 mm CsCl was mixed with the sample, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The K+ and Na+ contents of the supernatants were determined with an ELEX 6361 flame photometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). To determine the Km for K+ uptake by KtrB alone, K+-depleted cells of LB2003/pEL901 were suspended at 0.67 mg/ml in Na-Hepes. At t = 0, three of these suspensions received K+ concentrations varying from 22 to 130 μm KCl, and the K+ concentration remaining in the medium after the centrifugation step was determined for 14 min (see Fig. 8B, ○, ▵, and □). Immediately afterward, a second assay was started in which the cells received K+ concentrations from 40 to 180 μm at t = 0 min (see Fig. 8B, •, ▴, and ▪). K+ was determined in a mixture of 0.8 ml of the sample supernatant with 0.8 ml of a solution containing 2.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm CsCl. The Na+ dependence of K+ uptake by plasmid-containing E. coli LB2003 cells depleted of K+ and Na+ was determined with cells suspended in 200 mm triethanolamine/Hepes (pH 7.3) as described (9Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Na+ Uptake by Plasmid-containing TO114 Cells—This assay was carried out as described above for K+ uptake by E. coli LB2003 cells, except that TO114 cells depleted of K+ and Na+ were suspended in 200 mm triethanolamine/Hepes (pH 7.3), and then uptake was initiated by the addition of NaCl at t = 0. Na+ was measured by flame photometry. For this purpose, deproteinated cell extracts were prepared according to the protocol described above. Detection of His-tagged KtrB in E. coli Membranes and Membrane Solubilizates—E. coli LB2003 cells containing plasmid pEL903 or one of its derivatives were grown in 200 ml of K30 medium in the presence of 20 mm glycerol and 0.02% (w/v) l-arabinose. After the suspension had reached OD578 nm = 1, the cells were isolated by centrifugation and washed once with and subsequently suspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and a 1:100 diluted protease inhibitor mixture for His-tagged proteins (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). Cells were broken by ultrasonification for 3 × 20 s (50% interval) in a Branson B15 cell disruptor using a medium sized tip. Unbroken cells and large cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged in 3-ml portions for 30 min at 250,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 table ultracentrifuge. The pellet (membrane fraction) was dissolved in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 600 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and stored frozen at -80 °C until used. Proteins from the membrane fraction were solubilized by diluting membranes to 5 mg of protein/ml of the same buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Ultrol, Merck Bioscience GmbH, Schwalbach/TS, Germany) and the protease inhibitor mixture. The suspension was stirred gently for 1 h at 4 °C. Solubilized protein was separated from the residual membrane fraction by centrifugation for 30 min at 230,000 × g in the table ultracentrifuge. The pellet fraction was suspended in the same volume of buffer as used for the solubilization assay. Equal volumes of the membrane fraction, solubilized protein fraction, and residual membrane fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and stained with Ponceau red. Subsequently, anti-pentahistidine monoclonal antibody (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany) was bound to His-tagged KtrB on this membrane. The amount of antibody present on the membrane was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Calculations and Presentation of Data—Transport parameters for the different types of cells were determined at least twice using different cell preparations. The data given are representative examples. Kinetic parameters for the uptake of K+ or Na+ by the cells were determined by plotting the data according to the Eadie-Hofstee method (see the supplemental material) (40Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 1985; Google Scholar) using the linear regression mode of the GraFit 5 program (Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK). For the calculation of the Na+ and K+ contents of the cells (in nmol/mg of cell dry weight), we assumed that a cell suspension with OD578 nm = 1.0 in a Shimadzu UV-120-01 spectrophotometer contains 0.3 mg of cell dry weight/ml, that the external water space of the cells is 1.25 μl/mg of cell dry weight for the Tris/EDTA-treated cells centrifuged through silicone oil (39Bakker E.P.

A model for the selectivity filter structure of VaKtrB was generated from that of KcsA by replacing the appropriate amino acids in KcsA (supplemental Fig. 4 (B-D)) using the change residue (homology) option of PdbViewer. Exchange of Glycine Residues in VaKtrB—Each of the four conserved glycine residues Gly70, Gly185, Gly290, and Gly402 from p-loops PA to PD of VaKtrB was replaced with alanine, aspartate, or serine (Fig. 1), and the effect of these changes on alkali cation transport by the VaKtrAB system was analyzed in E. coli. We chose these substitutions because, of all amino acids, alanine resembles glycine most closely, and for other SKT proteins, the replacement of glycine with aspartate or serine has been reported to produce large effects on the K+ selectivity of the transport process (24Schrader M.

Although both types of molecules are thought to be derived from p-hydroxybenzoic acid, the origin of this putative biosynthetic precursor in mycobacteria remained to be established. We describe the characterization of a transposon mutant of M. tuberculosis deficient in the production of all forms of p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. The transposon was found to be inserted in Rv2949c, a gene located in the vicinity of the polyketide synthase gene pks15/1, involved in the elongation of p-hydroxybenzoate to phenolphthiocerol in phenolic glycolipid-producing strains. A recombinant form of the Rv2949c enzyme was produced in the fast-growing non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis and purified to near homogeneity. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the removal of the pyruvyl moiety of chorismate to form p-hydroxybenzoate with an apparent Km value for chorismate of 19.7 μm and a kcat value of 0.102 s-1. Strong inhibition of the reaction by p-hydroxybenzoate but not by pyruvate was observed. These results establish Rv2949c as a chorismate pyruvate-lyase responsible for the direct conversion of chorismate to p-hydroxybenzoate and identify Rv2949c as the sole enzymatic source of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in M. tuberculosis.

The chorismate pathway, present only in bacteria, fungi, and plants, provides a wealth of compounds with diverse biological functions, including aromatic amino acids, folate cofactors, menaquinones, ubiquinones, pigments, and iron-chelating siderophores. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis in humans, is no exception to the rule, and chorismate in this species is the probable common precursor for the biosynthesis of a series of products (see Fig. 1) that are important both in the physiology and in the pathogenicity of the bacterium. In addition to folate and aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), M. tuberculosis produces salicylic acid-derived siderophores known as mycobactins (1De Voss J.J. Rutter K.

A few strains of M. tuberculosis also produce species-specific phenolic glycolipids (PGL), complex lipids of the cell envelope that share with p-HBADs the same glycosylated aromatic nucleus.

The synthesis of both p-HBADs and PGL is thought to proceed from p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Comparison of the chemical structures of these compounds suggested that, in the biosynthetic route of p-HBADs, p-hydroxybenzoic acid would be first methylated to p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester before being glycosylated and further methylated. In the case of PGL, p-hydroxybenzoic acid would be elongated by the specialized polyketide synthase Pks15/1 to give p-hydroxyphenylalkanoates, which would be in turn converted to phenolphthiocerol derivatives in catalytic reactions involving the PpsA-E synthases (3Constant P.

The resulting molecules or their diesters, the phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosates, would be then glycosylated and methylated by the same enzymes as those involved in the production of p-HBADs to yield the final PGL molecules (18Pérez E.

The origin of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) in mycobacteria remains, however, to be established. In Escherichia coli, 4-HB formation from chorismate is the first committed step in ubiquinone synthesis. The reaction consists of the removal of the pyruvyl moiety of chorismate and is catalyzed by the enzyme chorismate pyruvate-lyase (p-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase) encoded by the ubiC gene (23Siebert M.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent lack of production of isoprenoid quinones of the benzene series (ubiquinones) in M. tuberculosis (2Collins M.D. Jones D. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 316-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the absence of proteins sharing significant sequence similarities with UbiC in the genome of this bacterium made it unclear whether 4-HB formation in mycobacteria proceeded through the same route as in E. coli. In the present study, we report the isolation and characterization of a transposon mutant of M. tuberculosis deficient in the production of all forms of 4-HB derivatives and provide evidence that Rv2949c, the gene interrupted by the transposon insertion, encodes a chorismate pyruvate-lyase responsible for the formation of 4-HB from chorismate. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Mt103, the clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis used in this study, and the mutant 66C7 were grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.085% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase) and 0.05% Tween 80, in minimal Sauton's medium (25Sauton M.B.

Sci. 1912; 155: 860-861Google Scholar) or on solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supplemented with OADC (0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.085% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase). E. coli XL1-blue, the strain used for cloning experiments, was propagated in Luria Bertani (LB) broth (pH 7.5) (10 g liter-1 Bactotryptone, 5 g liter-1 Bacto™ yeast extract, 5 g liter-1 NaCl) (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) at 37 °C. M. smegmatis mc2155 (26Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with ADC and 0.05% Tween 80 or in LB broth supplemented with 0.025% tyloxapol at 30 and 37 °C. Where indicated, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and hygromycin B were added to final concentrations of 100 μg ml-1, 25 μg ml-1, 20 μg ml-1, and 50 μg ml-1, respectively. Identification of the Transposon Insertion Site—The transposon insertion site in 66C7 was identified by ligation-mediated PCR as described previously (27Prod'hom G. Lagier B. Pelicic V. Hance A.J. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 158: 75-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification were Salgd (5′-tagcttattcctcaaggcacgagc-3′), ISada (5′-tttgagctctacaccgtcaagtgcgaagagc-3′), IS1 (5′-cttctgcagcaacgccaggtccacact-3′), and 66C7 (5′-ctatctgatcaagagatccg-3′). The products were sequenced on a capillary Applied Biosystems ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Complementation of M. tuberculosis Mutant Strain 66C7 and Overexpression of Rv2949c in M. smegmatis—Standard PCR strategies with Vent DNA polymerase (Biolabs) were used to amplify the M. tuberculosis H37Rv Rv2949c gene. PCR amplification consisted of predenaturation step (95 °C, 5 min) followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 1 min), annealing (60 °C, 1 min), and primer extension (72 °C, 1.5 min), and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers, Rv2949c.1 (5′-gggcgcccatatgaccgagtgttttctatctgatc-3′) and Rv2949c.2 (5′-gggaagcttgcgcgccagagtgatggcatttg-3′), incorporating NdeI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined), were designed to amplify the entire Rv2949c gene for direct cloning into the NdeI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pVV16 (28Kordulaková J.

The recombinant Rv2949c protein produced by the resultant vector, pVV2949c, carried a six-histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus. 66C7 and M. smegmatis mc2155 were transformed with pVV2949c and transformants were selected for by plating on 7H11 agar containing kanamycin and hygromycin B. The production of recombinant Rv2949c protein in 66C7/pVV2949c and mc2155/pVV2949c transformants was analyzed by immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody (Penta-His antibody, Qiagen) as previously described (28Kordulaková J.

Extraction and Purification of Lipids—For the biochemical analyses of p-hydroxybenzoate derivatives, the M. tuberculosis strains Mt103, 66C7, and 66C7/pVV2949c were grown in Sauton's medium as surface pellicles. p-Hydroxybenzoate derivative production was investigated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of total lipids extracted from bacterial cells and culture media. Culture filtrates were collected and filtered through 0.2-μm pore-size sterile filters to yield sterile extracellular materials. Exocellular lipids were then extracted by adding 2 volumes of CH3OH and 1 volume of CHCl3 to 0.8 volumes of extracellular materials to yield a homogeneous single-phase mixture. The mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature and then partitioned into two phases by adding 1 volume of H2O/CHCl3 (1:1, vol:vol). The organic phase was recovered, washed with 0.9% NaCl, and dried to yield the subcellular lipid extracts. Total lipids from bacterial cells were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, vol:vol) for one night followed by two overnight extractions with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, vol:vol). Mycolic acid methyl esters were prepared from extractable lipids and from delipidated cells by incubation with 15% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Aldrich) overnight at 100 °C followed by methylation with iodomethane (Aldrich) for 4 h at room temperature and extraction with dichloromethane. In some experiments, whole M. tuberculosis cells grown in 7H9 broth were radiolabeled overnight with [1,2-14C]acetic acid (0.5 μCi ml-1; specific activity, 113 Ci mol-1, MP Biomedicals Inc.), a radiolabeled precursor incorporated in all classes of lipids. Lipids and fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed on silica gel 60-precoated TLC plates F254 (Merck) in the solvent systems CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (90:10:1, vol: vol:vol) for p-HBADs, petroleum ether (60/80 °C)/ethyl acetate (98:2, vol:vol, three developments) for dimycocerosates of phthiocerol and n-hexane(s)/ethyl acetate (95:5, vol:vol, three developments) for fatty acid and mycolic acid methyl esters. An α-naphthol spray (1% α-naphthol in ethanol) and a cupric sulfate spray (10% CuSO4 in a 8% phosphoric acid solution) were used to detect carbohydrate-containing lipids and all organic compounds, respectively. Radiolabeled lipids and fatty acids were visualized by exposure of TLC to Kodak BIOMAX MR films at -70 °C. Unmethylated p-HBAD-I standard was kindly provided by Drs. A. Liav and V. Vissa from Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO). Cell-associated and exocellular mycobactins were extracted in the presence of ferric chloride as described previously (29De Voss J.J. Rutter K. Schroeder B.G. Su H. Zhu Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and analyzed by TLC using the solvent system ethanol/petroleum ether (60/80 °C)/ethyl acetate (1:4:6, vol:vol:vol). p-HBADs were purified from the culture filtrate of the complemented strain 66C7/pVV2949c by preparative TLC using CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (90:10:1, vol:vol:vol) as the eluent. The products of interest were scraped off and eluted from the silica with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, vol:vol). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—MALDI mass spectrometry was performed using a voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a pulse nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm. Samples were analyzed in the Reflector mode using an extraction delay time set at 100 ns and an accelerating voltage operating in positive ion mode of 20 kV. The mass spectra were mass-assigned by external calibration. Samples (1 μl of a 1 mg ml-1 solution in CHCl3) were directly applied onto the sample plate. The matrix solution (0.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at 10 mg ml-1 in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, vol:vol)) was added. The samples were then allowed to crystallize at room temperature. Chemical Analysis— 4-HB derivatives were methanolized using CH3OH/HCl prepared by the acetyl chloride reaction on methanol in anhydrous conditions. Samples were dissolved in 500 μl of CH3OH/HCl (1 N) and incubated overnight at 80 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen and then co-evaporated three times with anhydrous CH3OH. For trimethylsilyl derivatization, samples were dissolved in 200 μl of anhydrous pyridine, followed by the addition of 100 μl of hexamethyldisilazane and 50 μl of trimethylchlorosilane. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was dried under nitrogen, and the trimethylsilyl derivatives were solubilized in either petroleum ether, for gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or in CHCl3 for MALDI-mass spectrometry. GC and GC/MS Analysis—GC analyses were performed using a Girdel series 30 instrument equipped with an OV1 capillary column (0.30 mm × 25 m) using helium gas (0.7 bar) with a flame ionization detector at 310 °C. The temperature program was from 60 to 310 °C, at 5 °C min-1. GC/MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5889 X mass spectrometer (electron energy, 70 eV) working in electron impact (EI) mode, coupled with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph fitted with a similar OV1 column (0.30 mm × 12 m). Production and Purification of Recombinant Enzymes from E. coli and M. smegmatis—The M. tuberculosis H37Rv Rv2949c gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using the pair of primers Rv2949c.tb1 (5′-ggccgcccatatgaccgagtgttttctatctgatc-3′) and Rv2949c.tb2 (5′-gccggatcctagcgcgccagagtgatggc-3′). Primers were designed to create NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined) enabling direct cloning of the PCR product into the corresponding restriction sites of the expression vector pET14b (Novagen). The resulting expression plasmid, pETRv2949c was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Recombinant bacteria were grown overnight in LB-chloramphenicol-ampicillin broth at 37 °C and then transferred to 200 ml of the same medium at 30 °C. When A600 reached 0.7-0.8, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mm, and incubation was continued for an additional 3 h at 30°C. Production of the recombinant protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue 250R staining and by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody (Penta-His antibody, Qiagen). E. coli cells producing recombinant enzyme were washed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were disrupted by probe sonication on ice (4 cycles of 30 s on and 90 s off), and the resulting sonicate was centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 20 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant containing the soluble M. tuberculosis His-tagged protein was loaded onto a cobalt-based immobilized metal affinity BD TALON™ Spin Column (Clontech). Unbound proteins were removed by washing the resin with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and His-tagged protein bound to the resin was then gradually eluted with buffer A containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (50, 150, 300, 500, and 1,000 mm). The recombinant Rv2949c protein was detected by SDS-PAGE in the fractions eluted with 150, 300, 500, and 1,000 mm imidazole. Fractions that were estimated to be at least 90% pure by Coomassie Blue staining were pooled, desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-15 (10,000 MWCO) (Millipore), and used for further characterization. mc2155/pVV2949c, the M. smegmatis strain overexpressing Rv2949c, was obtained upon transformation of mc2155 with the expression vector pVV2949c. Cells were grown in LB-kanamycin-tyloxapol broth at 30 °C and collected by centrifugation, and the production of recombinant Rv2949c protein was analyzed by Western blotting as described above. For the purification of recombinant His-tagged Rv2949c protein, mc2155/pVV2949c cells (1 g of wet weight) were washed and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A before probe sonication for 9 min at 4 °C in the form of nine 60-s pulses with 90-s cooling intervals between pulses. The unbroken cells and bacterial debris were removed by centrifugation of the sonicate at 700 × g for 10 min, and the recombinant His-tagged Rv2949c protein was purified from the supernatant of this centrifugation using a BD TALON™ Spin Column as described for the recombinant protein produced in E. coli. Recombinant Rv2949c protein was detected in the fractions eluted with 150, 300, 500, and 1,000 mm imidazole. These fractions were pooled, desalted, and concentrated as described above. Chorismate Pyruvate-lyase Assay—Chorismate pyruvate-lyase activity was monitored using a coupled photometric assay protocol similar to that of Siebert et al. (30Siebert M. Severin K. Heide L. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The release of pyruvate from chorismate, which occurs in the course of the reaction, was monitored by following NADH oxidation in a second reaction that was not rate-limiting. Decrease in absorbance was measured over time at 340 nm in a Beckman Coulter DU-800 spectrophotometer. The standard assay was performed at 37 °C and contained in a final volume of 1 ml: chorismate (25-500 μm) (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 μm NADH, 5.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and 0.472 μm (10 μg) of purified recombinant Rv2949c enzyme. For the determination of kinetic parameters, incubations were carried out for 2 min to measure accurately initial reaction velocities and to minimize product-inhibition effects. In some experiments (to analyze pH dependence and inhibition by pyruvate), NADH and lactate dehydrogenase were omitted from the reaction mixture, and the reactions were stopped at different time points by adding 600 μl of sodium acetate (0.75 m, pH 4). The p-hydroxybenzoate formed in the reaction was directly detected and quantitated by HPLC. 100 μl of each reaction mixture was applied to an HPLC system (Shimadzu) equipped with a reverse phase Hypersil ODS column (250 × 4.6 mm, particle size 5 μm) (Thermo). Elution was isocratic at 1 ml min-1 using water/acetonitrile/acetic acid (80:10:5, vol:vol:vol) as the solvent system. Analytes were detected at 240 nm. Isolation of a Rv2949c Mutant of M. tuberculosis Mt103 from a Transposon Mutant Library—Mutants of M. tuberculosis Mt103 carrying transposon insertions in a region of the chromosome associated with the synthesis of PGL and structurally related glycosylated p-HBADs were recently isolated (10Griffin R. Stadthagen Gomez G. Young D. Coade S. Bottová I. Nigou J. Brando T. Puzo G. Gicquel B. Lowrie D. Jackson M. Tascon R.E. Keystone Symposium, British Columbia, April 2-7, 2005, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Whistler, British Columbia, Canada2005Google Scholar). One of these mutants, 66C7, which carried an insertion 237 base pairs downstream from the predicted start codon of the previously uncharacterized gene Rv2949c, was selected for further studies. Rv2949c is located upstream from the pks15/1 genes (Rv2947c/Rv2946c) in the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and has orthologs in other PGL-producing species of mycobacteria such as M. leprae, M. bovis, and M. marinum. In fact, in the latter species, two orthologs of Rv2949c (sharing 75 and 67% similarity with Rv2949c at the amino acid level) were identified. At the amino acid level, Rv2949c (199 amino acids) shows some sequence similarities with putative chorismate pyruvate-lyases (p-hydroxybenzoic acid synthases) from Archaea (48% similarity on a 155-amino-acid overlap with the protein of Archaeoglobus fulgidus, 44% similarity on a 174-amino-acid overlap with the protein of Methanococcus jannaschii), and Streptomyces capreolus (44% similarity on a 180-amino-acid overlap) but no significant similarities with the chorismate pyruvate-lyase of E. coli, UbiC. As the location of Rv2949c on the chromosome suggested a possible involvement of this gene in the metabolism of p-HBADs and PGL, we sought to determine whether it participated in the synthesis of the aromatic nucleus of these important biological molecules. Biochemical Phenotype of the Rv2949c Mutant—Important differences were found between the p-HBAD content of Mt103 and 66C7 (Fig. 2). Although wild-type Mt103 released into the culture medium the mono- and triglycosylated forms of p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl esters, p-HBAD-I and p-HBAD-II (Fig. 1), there was no evidence for the production of either of these two glycosylated 4-HB derivatives in the culture medium or in bacterial cells of 66C7 (Fig. 2). 66C7 also clearly lacked two other glycoconjugates. One of these, UM-p-HBAD-I, was identified by co-migration with an authentic standard as being rhamnosyl-α-p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester, a truncated form of p-HBAD-I carrying an unmethylated rhamnosyl residue. The second compound (a) was purified and first analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The mass spectrum showed a pseudomolecular ion (M + Na)+ peak at m/z 641 Da (Fig. 3B). This mass value is 28 mass units lower than that observed for p-HBAD-II (Fig. 3A), suggesting that compound a corresponds to an undermethylated form of p-HBAD-II. To determine the number of free hydroxyl groups in compound a, the substance was trimethylsilylated and reanalyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The mass spectrum of the trimethylsilylated compound a showed pseudomolecular ion peaks at m/z 713, 785, 857, 929, and 1,001 Da (Fig. 3C). The peak at m/z 1,001 Da corresponds to the pertrimethylsilylated compound a bearing five trimethylsilyl groups; the remaining pseudomolecular ion peaks correspond to undertrimethylsilylated forms of compound a that contain either one, two, three, or four trimethylsilyl groups. These data indicated that the native compound a contains five free hydroxyl groups. Thus, compared with p-HBAD-II, and in agreement with the 28 mass units default, compound a corresponds to a substance lacking two O-methyl substituents on the sugar moiety. Acid methanolysis of the purified compound a, followed by GC and GC-MS analyses of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the methanolysate and of various standards, identified 2-O-methylfucose, 2-O-methylrhamnose, and rhamnose as the sugar constituents of compound a (data not shown). The non-carbohydrate moiety of the compound was identified by GC-MS as p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester (data not shown). We thus concluded that compound a corresponds to the triglycosylated form of p-HBAD in which the trisaccharide part consists of 2-O-methyl-α-l-Fucp-(1→3)-α-l-Rhap-(1→3)-2-O-methyl-α-l-Rhap. The 1→3 α-linkages between the three sugar units were assumed by analogy with the structure of p-HBAD-II (3Constant P. Pérez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.-A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol.

But if a colony becomes queenless, the workers start to lay eggs, stop policing and rear a last batch of males before the colony finally dies out. Here we show that workers of the Asian dwarf red honeybee Apis florea from other colonies exploit this interval as an opportunity to move in and lay their own eggs while no policing is in force. Such parasitism of queenless colonies does not occur in the western honeybee A. mellifera and may be facilitated by the accessibility of A. florea nests, which are built out in the open."
https://openalex.org/W2089248947,"Cell-surface expression and biological functions of several intracellular-retained G protein-coupled receptors are restored by membrane-permeable ligands called pharmacological chaperones. We have previously demonstrated that a mutation of the hydrophobic motif 341FNX2LLX3L350 in the C terminus of the human pituitary vasopressin V3 receptor (MUT V3R) led to it being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we establish the precise role of this motif and investigate whether SSR149415, a non-peptide V3R antagonist, behaves as a pharmacological chaperone for the ER-retained MUT V3R. The absence of the mutated receptor in the plasma membrane is linked to its prolonged association with the molecular chaperone calnexin in the ER and to its intensive degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasomal machinery. However, this is not because of a lack of oligomerization, as demonstrated by the presence of MUT V3R homodimers in the ER. Treatment with SSR149415 restores expression of the mutated receptor on the cell surface and its correct maturation, resulting into the functional recovery of its signaling properties. SSR149415 acts by stabilizing a native-like conformation of the V3R, reducing its association with calnexin and, thus, favoring a secretory pathway rather than the proteasomal degradation pathway. In conclusion, the FN(X)2LL(X)3L sequence is an important motif for the V3R conformation, and the misfolding resulting from its mutation alters the receptor export but can be reverted by SSR149415.

Natural mutations within the V2R gene are responsible for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and most of the 150 loss-of-function mutations so far identified cause retention of the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to folding defects (5Oksche A.

To date, no natural mutation of this receptor has been associated with disease, but its structure-function relationships have been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis (12Derick S. Pena A.

The transport from the ER of newly synthesized proteins is strictly regulated by a conformation-based process called quality control (QC) (14Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 15Kleizen B. Braakman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). During QC, different molecular chaperone proteins transiently interact with the nascent polypeptide chain, thus ensuring its proper conformation. Properly folded proteins are directed to the secretory pathway via the export machinery. Misfolded proteins remain persistently associated with the molecular chaperones, are retained in the ER, and are finally degraded by the proteasome after ubiquitination (16Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 17Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol.

This has been well documented for the δ opioid receptor (19Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For example, calnexin, an ER transmembrane lectin chaperone, interacts and assists in the maturation and folding of many secretory and membrane-bound glycoproteins, including several GPCRs, such as V2R (20Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Petaja-Repo U.E. Laperriere A. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Nabi I.R. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1588-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, calnexin interacts for longer durations with mutants of the V2R, which leads to their retention in the ER (20Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Petaja-Repo U.E. Laperriere A. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Nabi I.R. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6766-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Correcting these misfolding defects is a major therapeutic challenge in many genetic diseases that involve the ER retention of mutated proteins. A recent promising approach is the discovery of small membrane-permeable molecules called pharmacological chaperones that bind to the misfolded protein and allow it to be correctly addressed (23Welch W.J. Howard M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 853-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Morello J.P. Petaja-Repo U.E. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol.

For example, 11-cis-7-ring retinal, a rhodopsin inverse agonist, and SR121463A, a V2R antagonist, have been shown to restore the cell-surface expression and biological functions of the P23H-opsin mutant involved in retinitis pigmentosa and of several V2R mutants involved in NDI (26Noorwez S.M.

However, it is not known whether these pharmacological chaperones stabilize the newly synthesized protein, bypass the QC process, or prevent degradation of the protein. It is also possible that they promote GPCR oligomerization, which has been recently identified for the vasopressin receptors (28Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and is thought to be important in GPCR export (29Salahpour A. Angers S. Mercier J.F.

Here, we have examined the effects of SSR149415, the first, selective, non-peptide vasopressin V3R antagonist (30Serradeil-Le Gal C. Wagnon J. Simiand J. Griebel G. Lacour C. Guillon G. Barberis C.

We show that SSR149415 behaves as a pharmacological chaperone and rescues maturation, cell-surface expression, and the signaling functions of the mutant. This is due to shorter duration interactions with the QC chaperone calnexin and reduced proteasomal degradation without modifying oligomerization. Materials—Culture reagents were obtained from Sigma, BD Biosciences (Nu-serum), Hyclone (Fetalclone III) or Invitrogen. Enzymes for molecular cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs. Radioactive vasopressin, [3H]AVP (60–70 Ci/mmol), was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Arg8-vasopressin (AVP) was obtained from Bachem. Myo-[2-3H]Inositol with PT6–271 (16 Ci/mmol) and PRO-MIX™ l-35S in vitro cell labeling mix (1000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. TOPRO-3 iodide and Coelenterazine h substrate were purchased from Molecular Probes. We used the following antibodies: mouse anti-c-Myc (9E10), mouse anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-adaptin-γ, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-calnexin, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and rabbit anti-calnexin (StressGen). DNA Constructs—Human V3 wild-type (WT) (341FNX2LLX3L350) and mutated (MUT) (341TTX2TTX3T350) receptor sequences were inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and the ps-6Myc vector as previously described (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To construct the phV3-EGFP vector, the entire coding sequence of the wild-type V3R was amplified by PCR using 2 primers, which deleted the stop codon and introduced HindIII and KpnI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fragment. This HindIII/KpnI PCR fragment was subcloned into the polylinker of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The expression vectors coding for WT V3R and MUT V3R with Myc epitopes at their N terminus and the EGFP tag at their C terminus were called ps-6Myc-WT-V3R-EGFP and ps-6Myc-MUT-V3R-EGFP. For their construction, the starting material was the previously described ps-6Myc-EGFP-WT-V3R (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which was first deleted from the EGFP sequence using restriction enzymes and a linker. From this intermediate construction, a 1.1-kilobase NdeI/PstI fragment containing the cytomegalovirus promoter, the signal peptide (ps), the Myc epitopes (6Myc). and 350 bp of the V3R coding sequence, was used to substitute the homologous 730-bp NdeI/PstI fragment in the phV3-EGFP vector. The ps-6Myc-MUT-V3R-EGFP was obtained by substituting the 571 bp of EcoN1/SgrA1 wild-type V3R fragment by the mutated one in the ps-6Myc-WT-V3R-EGFP construct. EYFP and Rluc tagged-WT V3R constructions, WT-V3R-EYFP and WT-V3R-Rluc, were obtained after digestion of the phV3-EGFP vector with HindIII/KpnI or HindIII/BamHI and subcloning of the WT V3R insert into the polylinker of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) or hpRLuc-N3 (Biosignal Packard), respectively. From these two wild-type constructs, the corresponding mutant vectors MUT-V3R-EYFP and MUT-V3R-RLuc were obtained by substitution of a 1.7-kilobase NdeI/KpnI fragment containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and the entire V3R coding sequence by a corresponding 2-kilobase fragment of the ps-6Myc-MUT-V3R-EGFP construct. The ps-6Myc sequence was then deleted from these intermediate constructions using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Myc-GABABR1-RLuc was a gift from Dr. Marullo and has been previously described (29Salahpour A. Angers S. Mercier J.F. Lagace M. Marullo S. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Mouse corticotroph AtT20 cells (ATCC, CRL-1795) were cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 7.5% Fetalclone III, 7.5% Nu-serum, and 0.5 mm glutamine. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) and the Effecten reagent (Invitrogen), and AtT20 cells were transiently transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were pretreated with the non-peptide V3R antagonist SSR149415 (a gift from Dr. Serradeil-Le Gal of Sanofi Research, 31036 Toulouse Cedex, France) by incubation for 24 h or as indicated in the figure legends. All analyses were carried out 48 h after transfection. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with either the ps-6Myc-WT-V3R-EGFP or the ps-6Myc-MUT-V3R-EGFP constructs, incubated with primary monoclonal anti-c-Myc and secondary phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies, and analyzed by FACS using a BD Biosciences FAC-Scan flow cytometer, as previously described (13Robert J.

Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—We carried out selective labeling of cell-surface receptors and internal compartment markers using the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies on fixed and transiently transfected HEK-293 and AtT20 cells as previously described (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was detected using a LEICA TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—We carried out immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of the WT V3R and MUT V3R on transiently transfected HEK-293 cells as described previously (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Western blots of calnexin and ubiquitin were carried out according to similar procedures using a polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (1:2000 dilution) or a monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:200 dilution) incubated at 4 °C overnight. Protein Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—HEK-293 cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes (Fig. 3) or 6-well dishes (Fig. 8). After 48 h, the transient transfectants were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) and then labeled with 50 μCi/ml (Fig. 3) or 100 μCi/ml (Fig. 8) of PRO-MIX™ l-35S in vitro cell labeling mix in the same medium. After pulse incubation at 37 °C for 30 min (Fig. 3) or 15 min (Fig. 8), the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and chased for various periods of time in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mm glutamine at 37 °C and then finally rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline. The total pool of V3 receptors was immunoprecipitated as described above. V3 receptors interacting with calnexin were sequentially immunoprecipitated first by a polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads (12 h) and then by a monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (12 h). The immunopurified receptors were then resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and exposed to Biomax film at -80 °C.FIGURE 8SSR149415 modifies the kinetics of association of V3R with calnexin. A, metabolic labeling of the Myc-tagged-WT V3R (WT) (a and b) and the Myc-tagged-MUT V3R (MUT)(c and d) in HEK-293 cells incubated in the absence (a and c) or presence (b and d) of 10-5 m SSR149415. Metabolic labeling was carried out by incubation with 100 μCi/ml-1 [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min followed by the indicated times of chase. Sequential immunoprecipitations were carried out using anti-calnexin antibody and protein G-Sepharose followed by anti-c-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose.

Quantification was by densitometric analysis of the SDS-PAGE from A, with 100% being the signal determined at the time 0 for each receptor. The data were fitted to a one-phase exponential decay equation.

The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and distributed in a 96-well microplate. Coelenterazine h substrate (Molecular Probes) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were taken 20 min later using a lumino/fluorometer (FusionTM, Packard Instrument Co.) that allows the luminescence and fluorescence signals to be detected and sequentially integrated using two filter settings (Rluc filter, 485 ± 10 nm; EYFP filter, 530 ± 12.5 nm). The BRET ratio was defined as the difference between the emission ratio at 530 and 485 nm of the co-transfected RLuc and EYFP fusion proteins and the emission ratio at 530 and 485 nm of the RLuc fusion protein expressed alone. The results were expressed in milliBRET units, 1 milliBRET corresponding to the BRET ratio values multiplied by 1000. We also determined total fluorescence and luminescence signals for all samples to assess the level of expression of the EYFP and RLuc fusion constructs and to ensure that the ratios of receptor-EYFP/receptor-RLuc remained constant. For BRET titration experiments, cells were transfected with different amounts of WT-V3R-EYFP for a given quantity of WT-V3R-RLuc or Myc-GABABR1-RLuc. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the means (±S.D.). We used analysis of variance to analyze differences between groups. When significant differences were detected by analysis of variance, a posteriori comparisons between means were conducted using the Fisher least significant difference (LSD) test (α = 0.05). Calculations were carried out using the StatView program. Curves were fitted with the Prism program (Graph Pad Software). Functional Characterization of the WT V3R and MUT V3R—We carried out a comparative functional characterization of the WT V3 receptor and a mutated V3R in a proximal C-terminal hydrophobic motif (341FNX2LLX3L350 replaced by 341TTX2TTX3T350) in HEK-293 cells. This mutant (MUT V3R) was previously shown not to be targeted to the cell surface but to be retained in the ER (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We introduced Myc epitopes at the N terminus of the two human V3 receptor coding sequences to allow us to detect and immuno-purify the receptor proteins. The addition of an EGFP tag to the C terminus of the previous constructs helped us to quantify both receptor expression and cell-surface targeting by flow cytometry. The C-terminal position of the EGFP tag considerably improved the level of V3R cell-surface expression compared with the N-terminal position (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As expected, the affinities of the untagged, Myc-tagged, and Myc-EGFP-tagged WT V3R for [3H]AVP and their level of expression at the plasma membrane were similar and tag-independent (Kd = 3.9 nm ± 0.57, 3.5 nm ± 0.62, and 3.8 nm ± 0.73, respectively) (Fig. 1A). All WT receptors equally stimulated IP production (Fig. 1B). We found that the mutant receptor was unable to bind AVP at the cell surface independent of the presence of the tag and that this agonist did not promote IP production (Fig. 1, A and B). We used immunodetection to demonstrate the lack of cell-surface expression of the mutant MUT V3R and its sequestration in the endoplasmic reticulum in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1C), thus confirming previous data (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SSR149415 Treatment Promotes Cell-surface Targeting of the MUT V3R—HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the double-Myc-EGFP-tagged-WT V3R or -MUT V3R were treated or not for 24 h with SSR149415, a selective, membrane-permeant V3R antagonist. We then quantified changes in cell-surface targeting by flow cytometry using the ratio of Myc fluorescence (cell-surface expression) to EGFP fluorescence (total expression). We observed that treatment with SSR149415 for 24 h restored the level of cell-surface expression of the MUT V3R to that observed for the WT V3R (Fig. 2A). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of this effect was obtained for 1.2 × 10-6 m SSR149415 (Fig. 2B). Moreover, SSR149415 slightly increased the export of WT V3R (18.8%) compared with the corresponding untreated cells (Fig. 2A). We observed similar results in AtT20 corticotroph cells using immunofluorescence analysis. In the absence of SSR149415, the MUT V3R was totally retained in the ER and was absent from the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 2C, upper panels) and the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D, upper panels). In the presence of SSR149415, the intracellular-sequestrated MUT V3R was less retained in the ER, was processed through the secretory pathway, as shown by its presence in the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 2C, lower panels), and finally appeared at the cell surface (Fig. 2D, lower panels). SSR149415 Treatment Promotes the Correct Maturation of the MUT V3R—We used pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments in HEK-293 cells expressing the Myc-tagged WT V3R or MUT V3R to assess the role of SSR149415 on receptor processing and maturation. The WT V3R was synthesized as a 60-kDa receptor that was processed to form a 70-kDa receptor (Fig. 3A). Previous experiments have shown that the fast migrating band is sensitive to both endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycosidase F and, therefore, corresponds to an immature receptor, whereas the slower migrating band is resistant to endoglycosidase H and sensitive to peptide N-glycosidase F and, therefore, corresponds to a complex-glycosylated mature receptor (13Robert J. Clauser E. Petit P.X. Ventura M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2300-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Treatment with SSR149415 enhanced the efficiency and the speed of the WT V3R processing, as shown by the faster accumulation of the mature form and the faster disappearance of the immature form for similar amounts of loaded proteins (Fig. 3B). In the absence of SSR149415, the MUT V3R revealed only a 60-kDa band corresponding to the immature protein and accumulated longer (t½ of 59 min) compared with the WT V3R (t½ of 27 min) (Fig. 3C). In the presence of SSR149415, the MUT V3R matured to reveal a 70-kDa band, with the band from the immature 60-kDa form disappearing at a rate similar to the untreated WT V3R (compare Fig. 3, A and D). Altogether, these results suggest that SSR149415 reroutes the MUT V3R from a degradative to a secretory pathway. SSR149415 Treatment Restores the Signaling Properties of the MUT V3R—We then investigated whether SSR149415 also restores the signaling properties of the MUT V3R in addition to the rescue of its targeting to the plasma membrane. We pretreated HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the untagged-WT V3R or -MUT V3R with SSR149415 for 24 h. The cells were then washed to remove the antagonist and stimulated with AVP. AVP (1 μm) was able to stimulate the production of IP via the WT V3 receptor with the same efficacy in the presence or the absence of SSR149415 (Fig. 4A). However, the potency of AVP stimulation was greater in the absence of SSR149415 (EC50 = 1.5 × 10-9 m) than in its presence (EC50 = 4.9 × 10-8 m), indicating competition between AVP and the antagonist (Fig. 4C). This competition was confirmed in [3H]AVP binding assays (data not shown). AVP (1 μm) was able to stimulate IP production via the MUT V3R only after pretreatment with SSR149415 (Fig. 4B). In the presence of SSR149415, the potency of AVP for the IP response was the same for the MUT V3R (EC50 = 3.6 × 10-8 m) and WT V3R (Fig. 4C), indicating that SSR149415 fully restores the signaling properties of the mutant recep"
https://openalex.org/W2141560122,"Bacillus subtilis PaiA has been implicated in the negative control of sporulation as well as production of degradative enzymes. PaiA shares recognizable sequence homology with N-acetyltransferases, including those that can acetylate spermidine/spermine substrates. We have determined the crystal structure of PaiA in complex with CoA at 1.9 Å resolution and found that PaiA is a member of the N-acetyltransferase superfamily of enzymes. Unexpectedly, we observed the binding of an oxidized CoA dimer in the active site of PaiA, and the structural information suggests the substrates of the enzyme could be linear, positively charged compounds. Our biochemical characterization is also consistent with this possibility, since purified PaiA possesses N1-acetyltransferase activity toward polyamine substrates including spermidine and spermine. Further, conditional overexpression of PaiA in bacteria results in increased acetylation of endogenous spermidine pools. Thus, our structural and biochemical analyses indicate that PaiA is a novel N-acetyltransferase capable of acetylating both spermidine and spermine. In this way, the pai operon may function in regulating intracellular polyamine concentrations and/or binding capabilities. In addition to preventing toxicity due to polyamine excess, this function may also serve to regulate expression of certain bacterial gene products such as those involved in sporulation.

In this way, the pai operon may function in regulating intracellular polyamine concentrations and/or binding capabilities. In addition to preventing toxicity due to polyamine excess, this function may also serve to regulate expression of certain bacterial gene products such as those involved in sporulation. In Bacillus subtilis, the pai operon is involved in negative control of sporulation as well as the production of extracellular and cell-associated proteases and other enzymes such as α-amylase and alkaline phosphatase (1Honjo M. Nakayama A. Fukazawa K. Kawamura K. Ando K. Hori M. Furutani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pai operon contains two genes, paiA and paiB, encoding proteins of 172 (PaiA) and 207 (PaiB) amino acid residues, respectively. Chromosomal disruption of the paiA gene abolishes repression of protease synthesis in glucose-enriched medium, whereas disruption of paiB is lethal to the bacteria, suggestive of its importance for growth. On the other hand, overexpression of the two genes down-regulates the amount of transcripts for the extracellular metalloprotease, suggesting that this operon negatively controls the protease levels through transcriptional repression (1Honjo M. Nakayama A. Fukazawa K. Kawamura K. Ando K. Hori M. Furutani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A putative helix-turn-helix motif was recognized based on the amino acid sequence of the protein PaiA, and it was suggested that PaiA may be a DNA-binding protein (1Honjo M. Nakayama A. Fukazawa K. Kawamura K. Ando K. Hori M. Furutani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PaiA also contains motifs that are conserved among the members of the N-acetyltransferase superfamily (2Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), suggesting that PaiA may actually be an enzyme. N-Acetyltransferases perform a variety of cellular functions by transferring an acetyl group from the cofactor acetyl-CoA to a nitrogen atom in their protein or small molecule substrate (2Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Protein acetylation may be a covalent modification that is as important as phosphorylation for functional regulation (5Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Acetylation of small molecules such as serotonin, polyamines, and aminoglycoside also has crucial roles in the function and metabolism of these compounds. In B. subtilis, the BltD gene product was found to be a membrane-bound spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), 2The abbreviations used are: SSATspermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferaseDTTdithiothreitolIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. 2The abbreviations used are: SSATspermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferaseDTTdithiothreitolIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. which participates in the export of polyamines (6Woolridge D.P.

To understand the molecular mechanism for the biological functions of PaiA, we have determined the crystal structure of this protein in complex with CoA at 1.9 Å resolution. The structure confirms that PaiA is a member of the N-acetyltransferase superfamily. Unexpectedly, the structure contains an oxidized CoA dimer in the active site, linked by a disulfide bond. Whereas one of the CoA molecules is fully ordered and mimics the CoA substrate, the adenine nucleotide portion of the other CoA molecule is completely disordered. The presence of the pantotheine and β-mercaptoethylamine portion of this CoA molecule in the active site suggested that the substrate of PaiA could be a long, linear molecule. We therefore examined the activity of PaiA with respect to polyamine substrates, including spermine and spermidine. Our biochemical experiments demonstrate that PaiA has N-acetyltransferase activity toward spermine and spermidine. Our structural and biochemical analyses therefore assign a function to the PaiA protein as a non-membrane-bound SSAT. Expression and Purification of PaiA—The production of PaiA protein was carried out as part of the high throughput protein production process of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (8Acton T.B. Gunsalus K. Xiao R. Ma L. Aramini J. Baron M.C. Chiang Y. Clement T. Cooper B. Denissova N. Douglas S. Everett J.K. Palacios D. Paranji R.H. Shastry R. Wu M. Ho C.-H. Shih L. Swapna G.V.T. Wilson M. Gerstein M. Inouye M. Hunt J.F. Montelione G.T. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 394: 210-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PaiA corresponds to NESG Target SR64. The full-length paiA gene from B. subtilis was cloned into a pET21d (Novagen) derivative, generating plasmid pSR64-21. The resulting recombinant protein contains eight nonnative residues (LEHHHHHH) at the C terminus. The construct was sequence-verified by standard DNA sequence analysis. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pMGK cells, a rare codon enhanced strain, were transformed with pSR64-21. A single isolate was cultured in MJ9 minimal medium (9Jansson M. Li Y.-C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione G.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) supplemented with selenomethionine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine for the production of selenomethionine-labeled PaiA (10Doublie S. Kapp U. Aberg A. Brown K. Strub K. Cusack S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Initial growth was carried out at 37 °C until the A600 of the culture reached 0.6-0.8 units. The incubation temperature was then decreased to 17 °C, and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mm. Following overnight incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Selenomethionyl PaiA was purified by standard methods. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted by sonication. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and eluted in lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing partially purified PaiA were pooled, and buffer conditions providing monomeric samples were optimized by analytical gel filtration detected by static light scattering, as described elsewhere (8Acton T.B. Gunsalus K. Xiao R. Ma L. Aramini J. Baron M.C. Chiang Y. Clement T. Cooper B. Denissova N. Douglas S. Everett J.K. Palacios D. Paranji R.H. Shastry R. Wu M. Ho C.-H. Shih L. Swapna G.V.T. Wilson M. Gerstein M. Inouye M. Hunt J.F. Montelione G.T. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 394: 210-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Preparative gel filtration (Superdex 75; Amersham Biosciences) was then performed using a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 5 mm DTT. The purified PaiA protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, flash-frozen in aliquots, and used for crystallization screening. Sample purity (>97%) and molecular mass (21.2 kDa) were verified by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively. The yield of purified protein was ∼50 mg/liter. Crystallization of PaiA—Initially, PaiA was co-crystallized with acetyl-CoA at 4 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. However, none of the crystals grown at this temperature was suitable for data collection. When the crystallization plates containing small crystals of PaiA were transferred into a 20 °C incubator, large diffraction quality crystals appeared after 2 days. 2 μl of protein solution containing PaiA (10 mg/ml) and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm acetyl-CoA were mixed with 1 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 2 m ammonium sulfate, 30 mm spermidine, and 10 mm DTT. The crystals were transferred to a solution similar to that of the reservoir to which 25% (v/v) glycerol was added for cryoprotection and then flash-frozen in liquid propane for data collection at 100 K. It was essential to transfer the crystals to 4 °C before freezing, since those frozen at room temperature did not diffract well. The crystals belong to space group C2221, with cell parameters of a = 39.9 Å, b = 135.8 Å, and c = 132.4 Å. There are two molecules of PaiA in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—A single wavelength anomalous diffraction data set to 1.9 Å resolution was collected at the peak absorption wavelength of selenium at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source. The diffraction images were processed with the HKL package (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar), and the selenium sites were located with the program SnB (12Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). SOLVE/RESOLVE (13Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) was used for phasing the reflections and automated model building, which correctly placed 85% of the residues in the two monomers. A complete model of each monomer, except the initiating (seleno)methionine and residues 27-34 of the second monomer, was built with the program XtalView (14McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) and refined by CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

Noncrystallographic symmetry restraint was applied in the early stages of the refinement but released at the final stage, since the two monomers differ in their active site conformation.

Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (final volume 50 μl) included 10 μl of 0.5 m Tris buffer, 5 μl of 30 mm substrate (final concentration, 3.0 mm), 10 μl of double distilled H2O, 5 μl of 1 mm [14C]acetyl-CoA (60 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences; final concentration, 100 μm) and 20 μl containing 125 ng of purified PaiA protein. The assay was optimized for pH (9.0), enzyme concentration (2.5 μg/ml), and time (5 min) so as to be linear in nature. Substrates tested included polyamines, the agmatine, aminopropy-lcadaverine, N1-acetylspermine, N1-acetylspermidine, N8-acetylspermidine, cadaverine homospermidine, norspermidine, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, all at a final concentrations of 3.0 mm. In addition, the polyamine analog N1,N11-diethylnorspermine was examined as a substrate in order to evaluate the ability of the enzyme to acetylate secondary amines. Following a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the enzyme reaction mixture was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 m NH2OH-HCl and heating in boiling water for 3 min. The mixture was microcentrifuged, and 50 μl of the supernatant was spotted onto a p-81 phosphocellulose disc and counted in a scintillation counter. A detailed kinetic analysis was performed by varying the concentration of potential polyamine substrates from 10 μm to 3.0 mm in the presence of saturating levels (100 μm) of acetyl-CoA (17Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA kinetic analyses were performed in the presence of saturating spermine concentrations (3 mm), and the coenzyme was varied from 3 to 400 μm. Estimates of the kinetic constants Vmax and Km were obtained from Michaelis-Menten plots (18Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar) using Sigma Plot-Enzyme Kinetics Module software (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA). kcat was determined by calculation from the Vmax value. In Vivo Analysis of PaiA Activity—The activity of PaiA in the context of intact E. coli cells was determined by examining the effect of conditional PaiA overexpression on endogenous polyamine pools. Cells were transformed with the IPTG-inducible pSR64-21 plasmid (see above). Transformed cells were then cultured at 20 °C in the absence (PaiA-Off) or presence (PaiA-On) of 1 mm IPTG for 3 h in MJ9 medium containing or not containing 1 mm spermidine. The cells were then centrifuged and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were sonicated in 0.6 m perchloric acid to extract polyamines, which were then subjected to high performance liquid chromatography analysis as previously described (19Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Janne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38309-38318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The assay detects nonacetylated and acetylated polyamines, including N1-acetylspermidine, N8-acetylspermidine, and N,N12-diacetylspermine. Structure Determination—The crystal structure of B. subtilis PaiA has been determined at 1.9 Å resolution by the selenomethionyl single wavelength anomalous diffraction method (20Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The protein is enriched in methionine residues, with 8 such residues in each molecule of 172 amino acids. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two PaiA molecules, A and B, but they do not have strong interactions with each other. This is consistent with static light scattering data demonstrating that PaiA is monomeric in solution (data not shown). The current atomic model for the enzyme contains residues 2-172 for monomer A and residues 2-26 and 35-172 of monomer B. An oxidized CoA dimer and two oxidized DTT molecules are bound to monomer A, whereas only one CoA and a sulfate ion are bound to monomer B. The atomic model has low R values and excellent agreement with expected geometric parameters (TABLE ONE). None of the residues of the protein is located in the disallowed region, whereas 92% of the residues are located in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot (data not shown). Overall Structure of PaiA—The structure of PaiA contains seven β-strands (named β1 through β7) and 5 α-helices (αA through αE) (Fig. 2A). The β-strands are mostly antiparallel to each other and form a semicylindrical β-sheet. The N-terminal helices (αA, αB, and αC) connect strands β1 and β2 and are arranged on the convex face of this β-sheet, whereas helices αD and αE are located on the concave face (Fig. 2A). The C-terminal ends of the neighboring strands β4 and β5, the only two parallel β-strands in the sheet, are splayed apart from each other (Fig. 2B). This splits the β-sheet into two groups of antiparallel β-strands composed of β1-β4 and β5-β7. More importantly, this creates a tunnel in the center of the β-sheet for the binding of the CoA cofactor and the substrate (Fig. 2C; see “Binding Mode of CoA”). Our structural information confirms that PaiA has a similar overall backbone fold as that of N-acetyltransferases and that PaiA is a member of this superfamily of enzymes (3Dyda F. Klein D.C.

Based on the program Dali (23Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar), the closest structural homologs include phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (Protein Data Bank accession code 1VHS), Hpa2 histone N-acetyltransferase (22Marmorstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), aminoglycoside 6′-N-acetyltransferase (24Wybenga-Groot L.E. Draker K. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Structure. 1999; 7: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and serotonin N-acetyltransferase (Fig. 3) (25Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequence conservation with these other proteins is very low, in the 10-20% identity range. PaiA also possesses several unique structural features. Most notably, helix αB is unique to the PaiA structure (Fig. 3). This helix may be involved in binding the substrate of the enzyme (see below), suggesting that the acetylated target of PaiA is different from those of other N-acetyltransferases whose structures are already available in the Protein Data Bank. Besides helix αB, the loop connecting strands β3 and β4 as well as the C-terminal region comprising β6 and β7 show significant structural differences from other N-acetyltransferases (Fig. 3). Strands β6 and β7 may also be involved in substrate binding. The helix-turn-helix motif proposed earlier for DNA binding corresponds to residues 98-121 of PaiA (1Honjo M. Nakayama A. Fukazawa K. Kawamura K. Ando K. Hori M. Furutani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the structure, these residues form helix αD and the loop connecting strand β4 and this helix (Figs. 1 and 2A). Therefore, these residues do not form a helix-turn-helix motif in the structure of PaiA. Moreover, these residues actually contain the motif A of N-acetyltransferases (2Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and they interact with the pyrophosphate of CoA (see below). PaiA is unlikely to be a DNA-binding protein, and its effect on the regulation of gene transcription is indirect. Binding Mode of CoA—The CoA cofactor in each monomer has well defined electron density (Fig. 4A). However, the CoA molecule bound to monomer A has much lower temperature factor values as compared with that bound to monomer B. In fact, the overall average temperature factor value of monomer A of PaiA (16 Å2) is lower than that of monomer B (26 Å2), implying that monomer A is more ordered that monomer B. This may be related to the fact that monomer A contains an oxidized CoA dimer in the active site and has a different conformation compared with monomer B. The oxidized CoA dimer in the active site of molecule A contains a disulfide bond between the sulfur atoms of the two CoA molecules (Fig. 4A). One of the CoA molecules of this dimer (CoA1) is fully ordered and assumes a conformation that is similar to the CoA molecule in monomer B. Therefore, the binding mode of this CoA molecule probably corresponds to the CoA/acetyl-CoA substrate for catalysis and will be described in more detail here. The binding mode of the second CoA molecule (CoA2) of the oxidized dimer will be described under “Binding Mode of Second CoA and DTT.” The adenine moiety of the CoA molecule (CoA1) is situated on the surface of PaiA, having interactions with residues Ala140 and Phe141 in helix αE (Fig. 4B). The N6 amino group of the adenine base is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Asn137, but the N1 atom is not recognized by PaiA. The CoA molecule assumes a folded conformation, such that the N7 atom of adenine interacts with one of the oxygen atoms on the β-phosphate group through a water molecule (Fig. 4B). The 3′-phosphate group on the ribose ring is recognized by the side chains of Lys109 and Lys144. The α- and β-phosphates of CoA are placed near the N-terminal end of helix αD and hydrogen-bonded to the amide groups at the end of the helix as well as having favorable interactions with the dipole of this helix. The phosphates are also hydrogen-bonded to the main chain amide groups of residues in the loop connecting strand β4 and helix αD. This loop and the beginning of helix αD correspond to motif A that is conserved among all canonical N-acetyltransferases (2Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 26Sternglanz R. Schindelin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8807-8808Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this motif appears to be crucial for the recognition of the pyrophosphates of CoA. The pantothenate and the β-mercaptoethylamine moieties of CoA are inserted into the tunnel that is present between strands β4 and β5 (Fig. 2C). The two amide groups in this region are hydrogen-bonded to the open segment of strand β4, mimicking a β-strand (Fig. 4B). This mode of interaction has also been observed in canonical N-acetyltransferases (3Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 21Modis Y. Wierenga R.

Binding Mode of Second CoA and DTT—Molecule A of PaiA in the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains an oxidized CoA dimer and an oxidized DTT molecule in the active site (Fig. 2A). The second CoA molecule (CoA2) of this oxidized dimer as well as the DTT molecule (Fig. 4C) are bound in the other end of the tunnel in the enzyme (Fig. 2B), which is probably where the substrate of this enzyme is bound for catalysis (see below). In contrast to the first CoA molecule (CoA1), only the β-mercaptoethylamine, pantothenate, and β-phosphate moieties of the second CoA molecule (CoA2) are ordered in the structure (Fig. 2A). Half of the protein surface in this binding tunnel is highly hydrophobic and is formed by the side chains of residues from helices αA and αB (Phe24, Phe28, Asn32, Asn36, Met37, Tyr40) and strands β6 and β7 (Trp132, Phe155, Met157) (Fig. 5). The disulfide bond of the oxidized DTT molecule is placed in this hydrophobic portion of the tunnel, whereas its two hydroxyl groups are projected into the solvent (Fig. 5). The binding site for the CoA2 molecule is more hydrophilic in nature. There are two ion pairs in this region, between Glu53 and Arg95 and between Lys75 and Glu94 (Fig. 5). In addition, the side chain of Glu92 is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain amide and side chain hydroxyl of Ser83, which may help stabilize the conformation of the β3-β4 loop. These polar groups do not have specific recognition of the CoA2 molecule, since there is only one hydrogen bond between the molecule and this binding site. Conformational Changes Associated with Substrate Binding—The two molecules of PaiA in the asymmetric unit have different ligands bound in the active site. A comparison of the structures of the two PaiA molecules showed that there are major conformational differences between them in the binding site for CoA2 and oxidized DTT. Since this is the expected binding site for the substrate of PaiA, our structural information suggests that there might be major conformational changes in the enzyme upon substrate binding as well. In comparison, binding of the CoA1 molecule does not seem to induce significant conformational changes in the enzyme, since the structure of the free enzyme of PaiA (data not shown) is similar to that of the complex with CoA only (molecule B). Remarkably, the conformational changes in PaiA lead to an expanded active site for the binding of CoA2 and DTT and possibly the substrate as well. This is in contrast to most other enzymes, which adopt a more closed conformation upon substrate binding. In the binary complex with CoA only (molecule B), helix αB is in contact with strands β6 and β7 and their connecting loop, whereas residues 27-34 in the αA-αB loop are disordered (Fig. 6A). In the ternary complex with oxidized CoA dimer and oxidized DTT, helix αB and strands β6 and β7 retract from each other, each moving by about 3 Å (Fig. 6A), thereby creating an enlarged binding site that is sufficient for the binding of CoA2 and DTT (Fig. 6B). Coupled to this change, helices αB and αC and the loop connecting αB and αC also move by about 3 Å. Residues 27-34 become ordered in the ternary complex, since they interact with the disulfide bond in the oxidized DTT molecule. In contrast, the binding site in the binary complex with CoA only (molecule B) is too small to accommodate the CoA2 and the DTT molecules (Fig. 6C). In fact, the binding site for DTT does not exist in this binary complex with CoA. PaiA as a Possible SSAT—We suspected that the observed binding modes of the CoA2 and the oxidized DTT molecules might mimic that of the genuine substrate of the PaiA enzyme. The tunnel has only a small opening toward the CoA1 molecule, and only the linear portion (pantothenate and β-mercaptoethylamine) of the CoA2 molecule is located in this part of the tunnel. This suggested that the substrate could be a linear molecule. Second, the β-phosphate of CoA2 is placed on the surface of this binding site, suggesting that a negatively charged species may not be favored in this binding pocket. This led to the hypothesis that the substrates of PaiA could be polyamines, such as spermine and spermidine, which are linear, positively charged molecules. The structural observations are supported by the fact that PaiA shares weak but"

Studies using genetically modified mice suggest that Gαq mediates a hypertrophic response in cardiac myocytes. Gαq signaling in these models is modified during early growth and development, whereas most heart failure in humans occurs after cardiac damage sustained during adulthood. To determine the phenotype of animals that express increased Gαq signaling only as adults, we generated transgenic mice that express a silent Gαq protein (GαqQ209L-hbER) in cardiac myocytes that can be activated by tamoxifen. Following drug treatment to activate Gαq Q209L-hbER, these mice rapidly develop a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This phenotype does not appear to involve myocyte hypertrophy but is associated with dephosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity, and a decrease in L-type Ca2+ current density. Changes in Ca2+ handling and decreased cardiac contractility are apparent 1 week after GαqQ209L-hbER activation. In contrast, transgenic mice that express an inducible Gαq mutant that cannot activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) do not develop heart failure or changes in PLB phosphorylation, but do show decreased L-type Ca2+ current density. These results demonstrate that activation of Gαq in cardiac myocytes of adult mice causes a dilated cardiomyopathy that requires the activation of PLCβ. However, increased PLCβ signaling is not required for all of the Gαq-induced cardiac abnormalities. Receptors coupled to Gαq play a key role in the development of heart failure.

However, increased PLCβ signaling is not required for all of the Gαq-induced cardiac abnormalities. Gαq is a member of the heterotrimeric G protein superfamily. Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of three subunits (α, β, and γ). Receptor activation leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit, which causes Gα to dissociate from the tightly bound βγ complex. Both Gα and βγ can then interact with specific effector proteins, resulting in changes in cellular function.

Activated Gαq binds to PLCβ and increases its enzymatic activity to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to form inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol.

Following cardiac injury, up-regulation of angiotensin II and catecholamines leads to activation of Gαq and progression to heart failure. The signaling pathway that mediates Gαq-induced cardiomyopathy is unclear. The presumption has been that activation of PLCβ by Gαq is responsible for the cardiac pathology, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Activation of PLCβ leads to the release of Ca2+ from inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate-sensitive stores, but the role of this signaling event in cardiac myocytes is unknown. Activation of PLCβ also leads to the diacylglycerol-dependent activation of some protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes. Although there are a number of mouse models with genetically altered PKC function in cardiac myocytes, it remains unclear whether activation of PKC is responsible for Gαq-induced cardiomyopathy (4Dorn II, G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The presence of several PKC isozymes in the myocardium complicates the interpretation of animal studies that examine the cardiac effect of a particular PKC isozyme. Results from genetically modified mouse models suggest that Gαq signaling mediates a hypertrophic response in cardiac myocytes (5D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A.

Med. 2001; 7: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Targeted overexpression of wild-type Gαq at supraphysiologic levels in cardiac myocytes using the α myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter resulted in cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent decompensation into heart failure (5D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn II, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Because wild-type Gαq can sequester βγ subunits, its expression might interfere with signals initiated by βγ. Mutation of Gln209 to Leu of Gαq produces a mutant (GαqQ209L) that no longer hydrolyzes GTP, resulting in constitutive signaling to downstream effectors. GαqQ209L does not bind to βγ, so expression of this mutant does not interfere with βγ signaling. Conventional αMHC-driven expression of GαqQ209L in cardiac myocytes also led to cardiac hypertrophy. Surprisingly, these mice developed heart failure with age even though the mutant protein became undetectable (6Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Standard transgenic and gene knock-out models impose a genetic alteration during embryonic and postnatal periods that can drastically affect the phenotype of the animals. This is a weakness for studying heart failure, which mostly occurs in humans subsequent to a cardiac injury suffered during adulthood. Indeed, when wild-type Gαq was overexpressed in myocytes of adult mice using an inducible Cre-lox-based system, the animals did not develop cardiac hypertrophy or other phenotypes seen in the conventional transgenic animals (9Syed F. Odley A. Hahn H.S. Brunskill E.W. Lynch R.A. Marreez Y. Sanbe A. Robbins J. Dorn 2nd., G.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 1200-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This dramatic difference in phenotype raises doubt regarding the role of Gαq in causing cardiac dysfunction in adult animals. To better investigate the role of Gαq activation in the development of heart failure in adult animals, we generated transgenic mice that express recombinant GαqQ209L proteins whose activity can be turned on by injection of the drug tamoxifen. This inducible model allows us to investigate the consequences of Gαq activation in myocytes after completion of normal development and growth. In contrast to the standard transgenic models, we found that activation of Gαq in 8-week-old animals causes a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure that does not appear to progress through a hypertrophic stage. Use of an additional transgenic mouse line that expresses an inducible GαqQ209L protein that cannot activate PLCβ demonstrates that PLCβ activation is required for the development of heart failure but not for all of the Gαq-induced cardiac abnormalities. Another advantage this inducible model has over standard transgenic models is that it allows us to investigate early biochemical events initiated by Gαq activation. We found that two aspects of Ca2+ handling in myocytes are markedly altered 1 week after activation of the exogenous Gαq protein. We speculate that these changes in Ca2+ handling may be responsible for the contractility defect seen at this time.

Western Blotting—Membrane suspensions were mixed with a urea-containing loading buffer (110 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 8 m urea) without boiling, and proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The loading buffer used for non-membrane Western samples contained no urea. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. After immunoblotting, signals were detected using either an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). SERCA Activity—Crude ventricular membranes were prepared by homogenizing the tissue as described above followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 72,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 plus 0.6 m KCl and kept on ice for 45 min. The suspension was centrifuged again at 72,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was assayed for Ca2+-ATPase activity using a modification of an NADH-coupled assay (12Martin D.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The standard assay medium contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, ∼0.2 mm NADH, 1.5 mm trisodium phosphoenolpyruvate, 15 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 36 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. Additionally, the assay mix contained 10 mm NaN3 and 0.1 mm ouabain to inhibit contaminating NADH oxidase and Na+,K+-ATPase, respectively. Total activity (TA) was assayed by monitoring the rate of loss of A340 after addition of the membrane preparation to a thermostatically controlled (37 °C) cuvette in a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Background oxidase activity (OA) was assayed in the absence of ATP. Total ATPase activity (TAA) was calculated as TA-OA. Ca2+-independent ATPase activity (CIA) (corrected for OA) was assayed in the presence of 10 mm EGTA instead of Ca2+.Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was calculated as TAA-CIA and is expressed as nmol ATP hydrolyzed per mg of protein per min. Hemodynamic Measurements of Cardiac Function—Measurements of heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic pressure (LVEDP and LVESP, respectively), dP/dt, and ejection fraction were performed using the Millar ARIA™ pressure-volume conductance system (Houston, TX). A closed-chest approach similar to the one described by Lorenz and Robbins was used (13Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). After adequate anesthesia was attained with ketamine and fentanyl, the right carotid artery was isolated and cannulated with a 1.4 French Millar P-V catheter that was passed down the aorta into the left ventricle. Ventricular Myocyte Isolation—Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. The heart was removed and rinsed in three changes of PS solution (112 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 1.63 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm NaHCO3,20mm HEPES, 5.4 mm glucose, 4.1 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm taurine, minimal essential medium vitamins, and minimal essential medium amino acids, pH 7.4) containing 20 units/ml sodium heparin. The heart was cannulated through the aorta and perfused on a Langendorf apparatus with PS containing 1 mg/ml 2,3-butanedione monoxime for 10 min and with PS containing 12.6 μg/ml Liberase Blendzyme 4 (Roche Applied Science) for 8-12 min. After digestion, the heart was perfused to wash out collagenase with KB solution (74.56 mm KCl, 30 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm pyruvic acid, 5 mm β-hydroxybutyric acid, 5 mm creatine, 20 mm taurine, 10 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.2). The heart was minced in KB solution and the cells gently shaken out. After removal of the supernatant, the cells were washed once with KB solution after settling. Electrophysiology—Only clearly rod-shaped myocytes were studied. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings used 2-3 mΩ borosilicate glass pipettes measured prior to sealing (Sutter Instrument), pCLAMP 8 software, the DigiData 1350 interface, and the Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments). For the recording of L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) (14Knollmann B.C. Knollmann-Ritschel B.E. Weissman N.J. Jones L.R. Morad M. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 483-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), pipettes contained 111 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, 14 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm MgATP, pH 7.2 (adjusted by CsOH). ICa,L was recorded in Na+-free bath solution (137 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). The ICa,L was recorded as a single voltage step every 4 s. In current/voltage (I-V) experiments, current stability was usually checked for 2 min before beginning the protocol. I-V curves were generated using 300-ms depolarizing voltage steps from -50 to +50 mV in 10 mV increments (holding potential -50 mV). The membrane capacity was measured by applying a voltage step from a holding potential of -50 mV, and the current amplitudes are normalized to the cell capacitances. Perfusion solutions contained 1 μm 4-HT throughout the experiment. All the experiments were performed at 22 °C. Calculation of Percent Extracellular Space—Non-overlapping images on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections were digitally captured to obtain RGB color images with 1280 × 1024 resolution. The following algorithm was developed in ImageJ Version 1.34i (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to quantifiy extracellular space. The green channel, having the greatest contrast between stained tissue and non-stained extracellular space, was isolated in each image. A high pass filter in the Fourier domain of the image was then used to smooth the shading caused by non-uniform illumination of the sample. The histogram of each image was then normalized such that the low intensity pixels were set to 0, and high intensity pixels were set to 255. Pixels having intensities above a standard threshold value in each image were counted as extracellular space. The ratio of extracellular space was then computed as EC = pec/ptotal, where pec is the number of pixels considered extracellular space, and ptotal is the number of pixels in the image. Statistical Analysis—Values represent means ± S.E., and significance is defined as p < 0.05. Unless otherwise indicated, experimental groups were compared using Student's t test. Conditionally Active GαqQ209L-hbER Constructs—The Gαq proteins used in this study are GαqQ209L, which signals constitutively to all of its downstream effectors, and a GαqQ209L mutant in which Arg256 and Thr257 are changed to Ala. The latter protein (GαqQ209L-AA) cannot activate PLCβ (15Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) but still inhibits PI3K signaling (10Fan G. Ballou L.M. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52432-52436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To obtain inducible forms of Gαq, we fused a mutant hbER to the carboxyl terminus of GαqQ209L and GαqQ209L-AA (Fig. 1A). This mutant hbER does not bind 17β-estradiol but is responsive to 4-HT (16Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The function of GαqQ209L-hbER was checked by measuring its ability to activate PLCβ and increase the level of intracellular inositol phosphates in HEK 293 cells. The basal level of inositol phosphates in cells transfected with GαqQ209L-hbER was similar to that in the control cells, but treatment with 4-HT caused inositol phosphates to increase more than 6-fold at 4 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the level of inositol phosphates in cells transfected with either vector or GαqQ209L-AA-hbER did not change in response to 4-HT treatment (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the inducible form of GαqQ209L-AA can still inhibit PI3K signaling, we measured the activity of Akt, which acts downstream of PI3K. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with epitope-tagged Akt-HA and either vector or GαqQ209L-AA-hbER. Akt activity was inhibited 40% when the fusion protein was activated by addition of 4-HT to the cells (Fig. 1C). A similar level of inhibition was obtained using GαqQ209L-hbER (Fig. 1C). GαqQ209L-hbER and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER Transgenic Mice—Gαq transgenic mice were generated using an αMHC promoter construct to selectively express these proteins in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1A). Three GαqQ209L-hbER founders (lines 5, 7, and 11) were identified by PCR analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 2A). Mice from line 7 express the GαqQ209L-hbER protein at a higher level than mice from lines 5 or 11, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis of heart lysates (Fig. 2B). Although all three lines of transgenic mice develop heart failure when injected with tamoxifen (see below), transgenic mice from line 7 developed this phenotype most rapidly. Therefore, this line was selected for further study. Cardiac-specific expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed in line 7 animals (Fig. 2C). The transgenic mice are born at the expected Mendelian ratio and breed normally. Five GαqQ209L-AA-hbER founders (lines 27, 41, 56, 59, and 66) were identified by PCR analysis of tail DNA (data not shown). Expression of the recombinant protein in four of these lines was very low (Fig. 2D). However, line 66 GαqQ209L-AA-hbER mice express the protein at a high level comparable with that seen in line 7 GαqQ209L-hbER mice (Fig. 2D), so they were selected for all subsequent experiments. This allows us to directly compare the phenotypes of mice expressing either Gαq protein. It is important to note that expression of endogenous Gαq is not affected in any of the transgenic mouse lines (Fig. 2D). To confirm that tamoxifen activates Gαq/PLCβ signaling in the GαqQ209L-hbER mice but not in WT or GαqQ209L-AA-hbER animals, we examined the membrane localization of PKCα. Phosphorylated PKCα translocates from the cytosol to membranes and becomes active in response to the PLCβ-catalyzed of diacylglycerol and production elevated intracellular Ca2+ (17Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed that phospho-PKCα was undetectable in heart membranes isolated from transgenic and WT mice before tamoxifen injection, but after 7 days of drug treatment the protein was enriched in the membrane fraction from GαqQ209L-hbER animals only (Fig. 3A, top panel). Similar results were obtained using an antibody that recognizes total PKCα (Fig. 3A, middle panel). The total amount of PKCα in unfractionated lysates did not change in any of the three groups after drug treatment (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Thus, Gαq/PLCβ signaling is elevated as early as 1 week after tamoxifen injection in the GαqQ209L-hbER hearts. This signaling pathway remains active for up to 28 days of drug treatment, as PKCα was still enriched in membranes from GαqQ209L-hbER hearts at this time point (Fig. 3B). The amount of PKCδ, but not PKCϵ, was also increased in the membrane fraction prepared from GαqQ209L-hbER as compared with WT hearts (data not shown). Peripheral Edema, Heart Enlargement, and Increased Extracellular Space in GαqQ209L-hbER Mice—Starting at 8 weeks of age, transgenic and WT mice were injected intraperitoneally daily with 1 mg of tamoxifen, which is converted to 4-HT in animals. Approximately two-thirds of the male GαqQ209L-hbER mice developed peripheral edema between 21 and 28 days of tamoxifen injection, suggestive of heart failure (Fig. 4A). The average body weight of these edematous mice increased 33% over preinjection levels (Fig. 4B). Mice that did not develop severe peripheral edema exhibited a distended abdomen, suggesting the presence of ascites. These mice then lost weight and developed a disheveled appearance and decreased mobility. This phenotype was more common for the female transgenic mice. Approximately one-third of all tamoxifen-injected GαqQ209L-hbER mice died within 28 days, although not all of these animals had an edematous or ill appearance prior to death. Without tamoxifen treatment, they displayed no phenotypic abnormalities up to 2 years of age, indicating that the GαqQ209L-hbER protein is essentially inactive in the absence of drug. This result is consistent with a recent report by Syed et al. (9Syed F. Odley A. Hahn H.S. Brunskill E.W. Lynch R.A. Marreez Y. Sanbe A. Robbins J. Dorn 2nd., G.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 1200-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showing that overexpression of wild-type Gαq in adult mice does not have a pathological consequence. One would expect that wild-type Gαq in the absence of receptor activation is in the inactive state. All GαqQ209L-AA-hbER and WT mice were alive after 28 days of tamoxifen injection and appeared healthy and free of edema (Fig. 4A). These animals exhibited body weight increases of 9% (WT) and 12% (GαqQ209L-AA-hbER) over the course of the experiment (Fig. 4B). Transgenic or WT mice injected with vehicle suffered no ill effects. When sacrificed after 28 days of drug treatment, the GαqQ209L-hbER hearts were found to be enlarged, with ventricular dilatation (Fig. 4C). The heart weight/tibial length ratio was significantly increased (1.65-fold) in GαqQ209L-hbER mice with edema as compared with WT mice injected with tamoxifen for 28 days (Fig. 4D). GαqQ209L-hbER mice as a group, including non-edematous animals that were injected for 28 days, exhibited a 1.89-fold increase in heart weight/tibial length ratio as compared with WT mice (12.97 ± 0.74 mg/mm, n = 10). Although most GαqQ209L-AA-hbER hearts did not exhibit architectural changes after 28 days of tamoxifen injection (Fig. 4C), modest ventricular dilatation was seen in ∼10% of these animals (data not shown). The heart weight/tibial length ratio was 1.3-fold higher in GαqQ209L-AA-hbER mice than in WT animals (Fig. 4D), an increase that is not statistically significant. Transgenic mice expressing exogenous proteins in cardiac myocytes often exhibit increased expression of fetal genes such as βMHC in the heart, with no increase in the expression level of αMHC. Up-regulation of fetal genes is associated with cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure in many, but not all, of these animal models. In humans, increased circulating BNP levels are indicative of heart failure. Quantitative PCR analysis of RNA extracted from hearts after tamoxifen injection showed a large increase in expression of BNP and βMHC mRNA in both GαqQ209L-hbER and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER hearts as compared with WT (Fig. 4E). This result was surprising, since GαqQ209L-AA-hbER mice do not develop enlarged hearts or heart"
https://openalex.org/W2030830391,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent inhibitors of lipogenic gene expression in liver. The lipogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is unique in this gene family, in that fatty acids inhibit at a post-transcriptional step. In this study, we have provided evidence for a signaling pathway for the arachidonic acid inhibition of G6PD mRNA abundance. Arachidonic acid decreases the insulin induction of G6PD expression; by itself, arachidonic acid does not inhibit basal G6PD mRNA accumulation. The insulin stimulation of G6PD involves the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway (Wagle, A., Jivraj, S., Garlock, G. L., and Stapleton, S. R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14968-14974). Incubation of hepatocytes with arachidonic acid blocks the activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin as observed by a decrease in Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, the downstream effector of PI 3-kinase. The decrease in PI 3-kinase activity was associated with an increase in Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1. Western analysis demonstrated increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in arachidonic acid-treated cells, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity was not changed. Incubating the hepatocytes with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, blocked the arachidonic acid inhibition of G6PD mRNA accumulation. Furthermore, SB203580 decreased the arachidonic acid-mediated Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 and rescued Akt activation that was otherwise decreased by arachidonic acid. Thus, arachidonic acid inhibits the insulin stimulation of G6PD mRNA accumulation by stimulating the p38 MAPK pathway, thereby inhibiting insulin signal transduction.

Thus, arachidonic acid inhibits the insulin stimulation of G6PD mRNA accumulation by stimulating the p38 MAPK pathway, thereby inhibiting insulin signal transduction. Insulin is the central hormone required for the activation of lipogenic genes in the liver. Feeding animals a high carbohydrate diet enhances the expression of the lipogenic genes. This effect involves the stimulatory actions of both dietary glucose and insulin (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 2Towle H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13476-13478Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, dietary polyunsaturated fats attenuate the stimulatory effect of feeding a high carbohydrate diet (3Clarke S.D. Curr. Opin.

The advantage of this model is that insulin is the primary inducer of G6PD expression, and fatty acids such as arachidonic acid are the primary inhibitors of G6PD expression; this regulation is independent of other hormonal requirements (5Salati L.M.

The intracellular mechanisms by which polyunsaturated fats inhibit G6PD or other lipogenic genes are not completely understood. Inhibition by polyunsaturated fatty acid may represent a direct action of fatty acids on factors involved in gene expression. Alternatively, fatty acids may act indirectly via the inhibition of stimulatory signal transduction pathways of glucose or insulin. We hypothesized that fatty acids inhibit G6PD expression by inhibition of the insulin induction. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase insulin receptor substrate phosphoinositide mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase tumor necrosis factor α. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase insulin receptor substrate phosphoinositide mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase tumor necrosis factor α. Insulin transduces its signal upon binding to the insulin receptor. Transduction of this signal in liver involves phosphorylation of two intracellular substrates, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 (7Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). These proteins play complementary roles in insulin signaling (8Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3907) Google Scholar). Activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase is associated with the stimulatory effects of insulin on metabolic pathways, including lipogenesis (9Nadeau K.J. Leitner J.W. Gurerich I. Draznin B. J.

The IRS proteins can be phosphorylated on both tyrosines and serines. A known mechanism for the inhibition of IRS-1 activation is by phosphorylation at serines 307, 612, and 632 (12Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Gual P. Gremeaux T. Gonzalez T. Barres R. Tanti J.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These serine residues, when phosphorylated might interfere with the interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor or PI 3-kinase (13Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E.

Known activators of MAP kinases include tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and very high fat diets. TNFα, a potent mediator of insulin resistance, activates all three of the MAP kinases.

In muscle and adipose tissue, this results in the decrease in glucose uptake associated with insulin resistance.

In contrast to the pathological effects of large amounts of dietary fat, the addition of smaller amounts of polyunsaturated fat (<20% of energy) to a high carbohydrate diet has a potent but reversible inhibitory effect on lipogenic gene expression (3Clarke S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The question remains whether modulation of insulin signaling by low levels of dietary fat is involved in the non-pathological regulation of metabolic pathways and, in particular, the de novo synthesis of fatty acids. In this paper, we have reported a signaling pathway by which polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit G6PD expression. We have demonstrated that arachidonic acid inhibits the insulin-mediated induction of G6PD mRNA abundance in primary rat hepatocytes. This inhibition of insulin action occurs by Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1. Incubation of hepatocytes with arachidonic acid results in an activation of p38 MAPK, thereby inducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and reducing PI 3-kinase activation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK results in a loss of the arachidonic acid-mediated inhibition of G6PD expression. This is the first report of p38 MAPK involvement in the regulation of a lipogenic gene by polyunsaturated fatty acids. Animal Care and Cell Culture—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-225 g) were starved 16 h prior to surgery. Hepatocytes were isolated by a modification of the technique of Seglen (24Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) as previously described (6Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (3.1 × 106) were placed in 60-mm dishes coated with rat tail collagen and incubated in Hi/Wo/Ba medium (Waymouth MB752/1 plus 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm serine, 0.5 mm alanine, 0.2% bovine serum albumin). The medium containing the treatments indicated in the figure legends was added after 24 h in culture. Fatty acids (Nu-Check Prep) were added as a complex bound to bovine serum albumin (25Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11724-11733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acid (4 mm) albumin (1 mm) stocks contained butylated hydroxytoluene (0.1%), and the medium contained α-tocopherol phosphate, disodium (10 μg/liter) to minimize oxidation of fatty acids. The concentration of arachidonic acid used (175 μm) resulted in the maximum inhibition of G6PD expression (6Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J.

Hepatocytes not receiving arachidonic acid were treated with an equivalent amount of albumin and butylated hydroxytoluene. Because arachidonic acid is metabolized rapidly by the hepatocytes, the medium was replenished every 12 h. The ERK inhibitor (PD98059) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology; the inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (LY294002) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) were purchased from Calbiochem. Isolation of Total RNA and Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Total RNA from 2-3 plates/treatment was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). Quantitation of RNA was performed using RNase protection assays (Ambion, Inc.). Rat G6PD exon 13 template was synthesized as described previously (26Tao H. Szeszel-Fedorowicz W. Amir-Ahmady B. Gibson M.A. Stabile L.P. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31270-31278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The templates for the rat β-actin and 18S probes were purchased from Ambion, Inc. Probe synthesis, hybridizations, and RNase digestion were as previously described (28Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The resulting hybridization products protected from RNase digestion were separated in a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Images were visualized by storage phosphor technology and quantified using ImageQuant software by Amersham Biosciences. Preparation of Cell Extract and Western Blot Analysis—The hepatocytes were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 1% SDS, and total protein was quantified using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of denatured protein (40 μg/lane) were loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1.5 h. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies against phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), phosphorylated IRS-1 (Ser307 and Ser612), phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phosphorylated ERK (Tyr183/185), phosphorylated JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and total Akt, IRS-1, p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as the secondary antibody, and the immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Images were visualized with film (Pierce) and quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). PI 3-Kinase Assay—Rat hepatocytes were harvested with lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 m NaVO4,1 m dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (500 μg) from each treatment group were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose beads. The bead pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer, once each with TNE buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and suspended in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml phosphoinositol, 60 μm ATP, 20 μCi [γ-32P]ATP). After 15 min in assay buffer, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m HCl, and the lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (1:1). The organic phase was loaded on silica gel TLC plates (10Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The lipids were visualized using autoradiography. Insulin Induces the Expression of G6PD mRNA, whereas Arachidonic Acid Attenuates This Effect—Primary rat hepatocytes were used for these studies, because they are the only cell culture system that mimics the effects of dietary polyunsaturated fat on the regulation hepatic G6PD expression. In hepatocytes, insulin increases G6PD mRNA abundance, and arachidonic acid inhibits G6PD mRNA amount, similar to the changes in G6PD expression observed in intact liver, in animals fed a high carbohydrate diet, and a diet supplemented with polyunsaturated fat (6% safflower oil), respectively (6Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, regulation of G6PD expression occurs at a nuclear post-transcriptional step in both intact liver and primary hepatocyte cultures (6Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We first asked whether arachidonic acid per se regulated G6PD expression. Because G6PD activity is essential for cell viability, the amount of G6PD mRNA remains readily detectable in the absence of insulin (Fig. 1). The addition of arachidonic acid alone did not decrease the expression of G6PD mRNA. In contrast, insulin induced G6PD mRNA expression 7-fold, and arachidonic acid inhibited this induction by 50% or more. Thus, arachidonic acid appears to inhibit the insulin-mediated induction of G6PD expression. Arachidonic Acid Inhibits Akt Phosphorylation and Induces Ser307 Phosphorylation of IRS-1—Because the arachidonate inhibition is only observed in cells with intact insulin action, we hypothesized that arachidonic acid interferes with the PI 3-kinase pathway and thus prevents the induction of G6PD mRNA by insulin. The induction of G6PD mRNA by insulin has been demonstrated to require the PI 3-kinase signal transduction pathway (Ref. 30Wagle A. Jivraj S. Garlock G.L. Stapleton S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14968-14974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and data not shown). The form or metabolite of arachidonic acid that inhibits gene expression is not known. Thus, the hepatocytes were pre-incubated with arachidonic acid to allow time for incorporation of this fatty acid into membrane phospholipid and/or generation of the relevant intracellular metabolite. The rapid signal transduction by the insulin receptor could otherwise have preceded the generation of the relevant inhibitory form of arachidonic acid. Insulin induced Akt phosphorylation 24-75-fold across time points (Fig. 2, A and B). This induction was rapid and persisted through 60 min. Preincubation of hepatocytes with arachidonic acid attenuated the insulin-mediated induction of Akt phosphorylation by 50-72% across the time points (Fig. 2, A and B). The amount of total Akt was not affected by these treatments (Fig. 2A). Similarly, arachidonic acid inhibited PI 3-kinase activity by 50%, consistent with it being an upstream activator of Akt (data not shown). The decrease in Akt phosphorylation in cells incubated with arachidonic acid suggests that arachidonic acid is inhibiting a step at or prior to PI 3-kinase activation. Because phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serines can interfere with its interaction with either the insulin receptor or PI 3-kinase and thereby inhibits insulin signal transduction (12Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Gual P. Gremeaux T. Gonzalez T. Barres R. Tanti J.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we measured changes in the amount of IRS-1 phosphorylation on two different serine residues. Incubation of hepatocytes with arachidonic acid prior to and during the addition of insulin increased IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation 4-6-fold at each time point (Fig. 2, A and C). Insulin alone caused a smaller but reproducible increase in Ser307 phosphorylation. Arachidonic acid does not cause an increase in the phosphorylation of all regulatory serines in IRS-1. In this regard, arachidonic acid did not stimulate an increase in phosphorylation at Ser612 of IRS-1 (Fig. 2A). Although phosphorylation of Ser612 can also abolish tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (7Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), arachidonic acid inhibition of insulin signaling in hepatocytes does not appear to involve this serine residue. These results suggest that arachidonic acid increases Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1; this in turn interferes with the PI 3-kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation, which are required for the insulin induction of G6PD mRNA. Arachidonic Acid Induces p38 MAPK Phosphorylation—To explore the mechanism for the increase in IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation, we determined whether arachidonic acid in the presence of insulin activates serine/threonine kinases involved in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Members of the MAP kinase family are known to stimulate serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (15De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

The amounts of phosphorylated and activated as well as the total amounts of the three MAP kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38, were measured by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3, A and B). Insulin stimulated a small but consistent increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation. A similar increase was detected with arachidonic acid alone (Fig. 3C). The greatest increase in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (4-6-fold) was observed with arachidonic acid in the presence of insulin as compared with no additions. Furthermore, the increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation occurred within the same time frame as the changes in Akt and IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation. The total amount of p38 MAPK was not regulated by these treatments (Fig. 3C). In contrast, arachidonic acid did not increase the amounts of activated ERK and JNK. Fluctuations in ERK and JNK activation were observed across treatments and likely reflect stimulation due to the manipulation of the cells for the addition of the treatments. There was no consistent effect of the treatments per se on ERK or JNK activation. This result suggests that arachidonic acid stimulates Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the activation of p38 MAPK. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK Pathway Decreases the Arachidonic Acid-mediated Inhibition of G6PD mRNA Expression—We next tested whether the activation of p38 MAPK by arachidonic acid is responsible for the inhibition of G6PD mRNA accumulation. The p38 MAP kinase pathway was inhibited by SB203580. SB203580 had little or no effect on the insulin-mediated induction of G6PD mRNA abundance but abrogated the inhibition by arachidonic acid (Fig. 4). In contrast, inhibition of ERK signaling with the inhibitor PD98059 had no detectable effect on G6PD regulation by insulin or arachidonic acid (data not shown), consistent with the lack of ERK activation by arachidonic acid. To verify that activation of p38 MAPK was involved in the Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1, the effects of arachidonic acid on Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation were measured in hepatocytes incubated with SB203580. Arachidonic acid in the presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor did not increase the Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 as compared with insulin- and SB203580-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 5 versus 2 and 3 for P-IRS1). At the same time, Akt phosphorylation in hepatocytes incubated with arachidonic acid and SB203580 did not decrease with respect to hepatocytes incubated with insulin and SB203580 (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5 versus 2 and 3 for P-Akt). These results are consistent with the idea that activation of p38 MAP kinase by arachidonic acid impairs the activation of the PI 3-kinase by inducing Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1, which in turn inhibits the induction of G6PD mRNA by insulin.FIGURE 5Inhibition of p38 MAPK blocks the decrease in Akt activation and the increase in IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation by arachidonic acid. Hepatocytes were treated with or without arachidonic acid (175 μm) for 23 h. The cells were then incubated with or without 10μm SB203580 for 1 h, prior to the addition of insulin (0.04μm). Total cell lysates were isolated 5 min after the addition of insulin. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies against total and phosphorylated Akt and IRS-1.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5ω3) was as effective as arachidonic acid (20:4ω6) at both decreasing Akt phosphorylation and increasing p38 MAPK phosphorylation (TABLE ONE).

The presence of two regulatory interactions raises the question of whether disruption of both is required for kinase activation. To address this question, we engineered a high affinity linker (HAL) mutant of the Src family member Hck in which an optimal SH3 ligand was substituted for the natural linker. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated tight intramolecular binding of the modified HAL sequence to SH3. Hck-HAL was then combined with a tail tyrosine mutation (Y501F) and expressed in Rat-2 fibroblasts. Surprisingly, Hck-HAL-Y501F showed strong transforming and kinase activities, demonstrating that intramolecular SH3-linker release is not required for SH2-based kinase activation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks the negative regulatory tail kinase Csk, wild-type Hck was more strongly activated in the presence of an SH3-binding protein (human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef), indicating persistence of native SH3-linker interaction in an active Hck conformation. Taken together, these data support the existence of multiple active conformations of Src family kinases that may generate unique downstream signals.

Taken together, these data support the existence of multiple active conformations of Src family kinases that may generate unique downstream signals. The Src family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases consists of nine members (Src, Lck, Hck, Fyn, Blk, Lyn, Fgr, Yes, Yrk) that affect a diverse array of cellular responses in virtually every cell type (1Parsons S.J. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7906-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Tight control of Src kinase activity is essential to normal cellular function, and elevated activity of this kinase family is a common feature of several forms of cancer and other hyperproliferative states (2Ishizawar R. Parsons S.J. Cancer Cells. 2004; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Src family kinases exhibit a highly conserved structural organization that includes a myristoylated N-terminal domain, a short unique region, modular SH3 and SH2 domains, an SH2 kinase-linker region, the catalytic domain, and a C-terminal tail (3Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of nearly full-length Src and Hck in their down-regulated autoinhibited states reveal that intramolecular interactions involving SH3 and SH2 are essential for negative regulation of kinase activity (4Schindler T.

Superti-Furga G. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These domains pack against the back side of the catalytic domain and stabilize it in a closed, inactive conformation. In this state, the SH3 domain engages the SH2 kinase-linker, which forms the polyproline type II helix required for SH3 binding, while the SH2 domain engages the tyrosine-phosphorylated tail. Tail phosphorylation is catalyzed by a separate kinase known as Csk (9Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and occurs on a single tyrosine residue conserved in all Src family members (Tyr-527 in c-Src). Autoinhibited Src family kinases are very sensitive to small perturbations in intramolecular interactions involving SH3 and SH2. Mutations within the SH3 domain as well as the SH2 kinase-linker are sufficient to activate Src family kinases, as are mutations that disrupt SH2-tail interaction (3Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, interactions with target proteins can also disrupt the regulatory mechanism by engaging the SH3 domain, the SH2 domain, or both (3Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 10Miller W.T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, the Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusHALhigh affinity linkerSHSrc homology. is a high affinity ligand for the SH3 domain of Hck, a member of the Src kinase family expressed in myeloid hematopoietic cells. SH3-directed Hck-Nef complex formation leads to constitutive Hck kinase activation both in vitro (11Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T.

These observations suggest that Src kinases are responsive to a wide variety of upstream inputs, which helps to explain their versatility in diverse signaling situations. human immunodeficiency virus high affinity linker Src homology. Regulation of Src family kinase activity by two distinct intramolecular interactions has raised several important questions regarding the number of inputs required for kinase activation. Is disruption of individual SH2-tail or SH3-linker interactions sufficient for activation or is displacement of the entire regulatory apparatus required? Recently, we observed that increasing the affinity of the tail for the SH2 domain does not impact activation through SH3 in vivo (13Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting some degree of independence. A related issue concerns the status of the second interaction once the first one is disrupted. Molecular dynamics simulations show that motions within SH3 and SH2 are highly correlated, predicting that individual SH3- or SH2-based inputs may disrupt both interactions and lead to a single activated state (14Young M.A. Gonfloni S. Superti-Furga G. Roux B. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 105: 115-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Lim W.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To probe these issues experimentally, we created a modified form of Hck in which the native SH2 kinase-linker sequence was changed to a high affinity intramolecular ligand for the SH3 domain. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrates that the modified linker binds very tightly to its intramolecular SH3 target. Surprisingly, the kinase activity of this high affinity linker mutant was strongly activated by disruption of SH2-tail interaction, producing a strong transforming signal in fibroblasts. These data show that SH3-linker release is not required for Hck activation through SH2-tail displacement. Furthermore, wild-type Hck was observed to have a “reserve” of kinase activity that could be stimulated by SH3 engagement or by SH2 kinase-linker mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a system in which Src family kinases are constitutively active because yeast lack a homolog of Csk. This finding indicates that SH3-linker interaction persists in wild-type Hck that is activated through disruption of SH2-tail interaction. Together with our previous data (13Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that SH3- and SH2-based activation of Hck are independent and support a role for Hck and other Src family kinases as “OR-gate” signaling switches (15Lim W.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in which occupation of SH3 or SH2 by target proteins is sufficient to induce kinase activation without disruption of the remaining intramolecular interaction. This raises the possibility that multiple active conformations of Src family kinases exist, which may add to signaling diversity and provide unique targets for selective inhibitor discovery. Mutagenesis and Recombinant Protein Expression—Wild-type, tail mutant (Y501F), and SH2 kinase-linker (2PA) mutant forms of Hck have been described elsewhere (16Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol.

The high affinity linker (HAL) mutant of Hck was produced by changing the coding sequence of the wild-type linker lysines to prolines using standard PCR-based methods. The wild-type linker and HAL amino acid sequences are aligned in Fig. 1. The presence of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Recombinant human Hck SH3 (amino acids 56-122 in p59 Hck; 72-143 in c-Src), SH3-SH2 (Hck amino acids 51-224; 72-245 in c-Src), SH3-SH2 plus wild-type linker (Hck amino acids 51-235; 72-256 in c-Src), and SH3-SH2 plus the HAL sequence were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (17Engen J.R.

Recombinant protein purity and concentration were determined by SDS-PAGE, and all protein identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out using a BIAcore 3000. The biotinylated high affinity SH3 domain binding peptide VSLARRPLPPLP (20Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (University of Pittsburgh Molecular Medicine Institute Peptide Synthesis Facility) was immobilized on an SA5 streptavidin biosensor chip (Biacore). A biotinylated IKB kinase substrate peptide (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) of similar length was bound to a second channel on the same chip as a negative control. Peptide immobilization was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in HBS-EP running buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20 surfactant). To prevent re-binding events with the recombinant Hck proteins, titration experiments were performed to define the lowest amount of immobilized target peptide that produced an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio with the recombinant SH3 domain. Based on these preliminary studies, the amount of biotinylated peptide bound to the chip was limited to 80 response units, a level well below saturation, for all subsequent experiments. Association of recombinant Hck SH3, 3 + 2, 32L, and 32HAL proteins at various concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 μm was measured at 25 °C with a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 300 s, followed by 300 s of dissociation in HBS-EP buffer alone. Background response values of each recombinant Hck protein with the control peptide were subtracted from those obtained for the VSL-12 peptide to yield a specific value of corrected response units. After each individual binding experiment, the chip surface was regenerated with 0.05% SDS. Fibroblast and Yeast Expression Systems—Generation of recombinant Hck retroviruses, culture and infection of Rat-2 fibroblasts, and focus-forming assays for transformation were conducted as described previously (12Briggs S.D.

In all experiments, expression of Hck proteins and tyrosine kinase activity were determined by immunoblotting with anti-Hck and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as described (12Briggs S.D. Sharkey M.

For yeast expression, cDNA clones for Hck, Nef, and Csk were sub-cloned into the pESC series of galactose-inducible yeast expression vectors (Stratagene) under different nutritional selection markers. In Fig. 5, Hck clones were expressed from the pYC2 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). For growth suppression assays, transformed yeast colonies were started in liquid culture in the presence of glucose to repress protein expression, and equivalent A600 units of each culture were plated as a dilution series on agar plates with galactose as sole carbon source. Plates were incubated for 3 days, and an image of each plate was recorded on a flatbed scanner. To evaluate protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation, aliquots of the same cultures were grown in liquid medium containing galactose for 4 h, and cell lysates were probed by immunoblotting with antibodies to Hck (N-30; Santa Cruz), HIV-1 Nef (EH-1; National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), Csk (C-20; Santa Cruz), and phosphotyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz and PY20, BD Biosciences). Development of a HAL Mutant of the Src Family Kinase, Hck—To investigate whether Hck activation by SH2-based inputs also requires SH3-linker disruption, we sought to modify the Hck SH2 kinase-linker sequence to enhance its affinity for the SH3 domain. Native Src family kinase SH3-linker interactions tend to be weak, as the sequences of the linkers do not conform to those of polyproline type II helices normally associated with high affinity SH3 ligands (21Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of Hck in the down-regulated conformation (4Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) is presented in Fig. 1 and illustrates this point. A close-up view of the SH3-linker interaction in the context of the overall Hck structure shows that the linker binds to the SH3 domain in the “minus” orientation (22Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Polyproline type II helical positions P0 and P+3 are occupied by lysine residues, which interact poorly with the hydrophobic surface of SH3 (5Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). To create the HAL mutant, these lysine residues were replaced with prolines. We performed molecular modeling to evaluate whether substitution of the natural linker lysine residues with prolines would disrupt the structure of the linker or its position relative to the SH3 domain or the N-lobe of the kinase domain in the overall structure. We were particularly interested in the position of Trp-260 in Hck-HAL. This residue is located at the C-terminal end of the linker and has a key role in coupling the regulatory domains to the αC helix in the N-lobe, where it helps to stabilize αC in a position that prevents catalysis in the down-regulated state (23LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Lysines 249 and 252 were replaced with prolines in the Hck crystal structure, and the resulting virtual mutant was energy minimized (24Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, these two substitutions produced very little change in the overall structure of Hck. The relationship of the modified linker to the surface of SH3 as well as the position of Trp-260 relative to the αC helix remained virtually the same. These observations suggested that the HAL modification may be effective in stabilizing SH3-linker interaction without affecting overall kinase structure or regulation. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was used to determine whether lysine to proline substitution enhanced intramolecular linker-SH3 interaction. For these studies, a biotinylated high affinity SH3 ligand peptide (VSLARRPLPPLP or VSL-12) (20Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was immobilized on a streptavidin biosensor chip. Four purified recombinant Hck proteins were then flowed past the VSL-12 peptide surface at equal concentrations (Fig. 3). These Hck proteins included the SH3 domain alone, the SH3 and SH2 domains together (3 + 2), the SH3 and SH2 domains plus the wild-type linker (32L), and the SH3 and SH2 domains plus the modified linker with the dual proline for lysine substitutions (32HAL). As shown in Fig. 3, the isolated Hck SH3 domain bound strongly to VSL-12 with a very rapid on-rate, yielding an equilibrium dissociation constant of ∼800 nm. This value agrees favorably with published data for other Src family kinase SH3 domains using this peptide ligand (20Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with the 3 + 2 protein, although a second low affinity binding component prevented complete dissociation over the time scale of the experiment. Addition of the wild-type linker in the 32L construct produced a result nearly identical to 3 + 2, suggesting little intramolecular competition of the tethered linker for SH3 binding to the chip surface. This observation is not surprising, as the wild-type linker sequence represents a suboptimal ligand for SH3 as described above. In striking contrast, the 32HAL protein bound poorly to the VSL-12 surface, showing that proline substitution of the Hck SH2 kinase-linker lysines resulted in strong intramolecular binding and prevented association with the high affinity ligand on the biosensor chip. These data strongly support the idea that the HAL substitutions lock the SH3 domain to the linker, providing a valuable tool to investigate the requirement for SH3-linker release in kinase activation. Activation of Hck-HAL without SH3 Domain Displacement from the Linker—To address the requirement for SH3-linker displacement during Hck activation and signaling in vivo, we incorporated the HAL substitutions into the context of full-length Hck. The resulting Hck constructs were analyzed for kinase and biological activities in a Rat-2 fibroblast transformation assay. Rat-2 cells do not express endogenous Hck but effectively down-regulate ectopically expressed wild-type Hck via tail tyrosine phosphorylation (13Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, Rat-2 fibroblasts expressing wild-type Hck continue to grow as a contact-inhibited monolayer indistinguishable from control cells. However, expression of a Hck mutant in which the tail tyrosine residue is mutated to phenylalanine (Hck-YF) results in transformation to an anchorage-independent phenotype and the appearance of large numbers of transformed foci. Fibroblast transformation correlated with release of kinase activity, which was reflected in strong tyrosine phosphorylation of a 40-kDa cellular protein as reported previously (Fig. 4B, pp40) (12Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar, 16Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We first investigated the impact of the HAL substitution on wild-type Hck. As shown in Fig. 4, Hck-HAL did not induce fibroblast transformation and showed no evidence of kinase activity, indicating that it is down-regulated as effectively as wild-type Hck in fibroblasts. These results strongly suggest that the enhanced SH3-linker interaction present in Hck-HAL does not impact tail phosphorylation by Csk. Furthermore, these data imply that the modified linker retains its ability to pack against the small lobe of the kinase domain as required for negative regulation of kinase activity, consistent with the modeling shown in Fig. 2. We next coupled the HAL substitution with the tail mutation, creating the compound mutant HAL-YF. To our surprise, Hck-HAL-YF exhibited very strong focus-forming activity that correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of pp40 (Fig. 4). These data provide strong evidence that SH2-based activation of Hck resulting from mutation of the tail tyrosine can occur without release of the SH3 domain from its internal ligand. Evidence for SH3-Linker Interaction in Active Wild-type Hck—Evidence presented in Fig. 4 shows that strengthening the SH3-linker interaction does not prevent activation of Hck via SH2-tail displacement, supporting the notion that SH2-based activation may result in a unique active conformation of the kinase. This led us to question whether the SH3 domain remains bound to the native linker in the context of wild-type Hck following activation through SH2-tail disruption. To address this question, we turned to a yeast expression system that is a well established tool for Src family kinase structure-function analysis (25Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Murphy S.M. Bergman M. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because yeast cells do not express Csk, ectopically expressed c-Src is catalytically active due to the lack of phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail tyrosine. Expression of kinase-active Src results in growth suppression of yeast, and the extent of growth suppression correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous yeast proteins. Coexpression with Csk restores tail phosphorylation and down-regulation of Src and reverts the growth inhibitory phenotype. Thus the physiological mechanism of Src family kinase regulation can be accurately modeled in yeast, allowing for direct evaluation of the impact of mutations or protein-protein interactions on Src family kinase activity in a defined cellular context. We first investigated whether wild-type Hck produced the growth inhibitory phenotype previously reported for c-Src in yeast. To accomplish this, S. cerevisiae transformed with a galactose-inducible expression vector for Hck was plated at increasing dilutions on solid medium containing galactose. As shown in Fig. 5A, wild-type Hck, when expressed alone, suppressed yeast cell growth when compared with cultures transformed with the empty expression plasmid. Growth suppression correlated with the appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated yeast proteins on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots (Fig. 5B). Growth suppression and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation were both reversed when wild-type Hck was co-expressed with Csk, as observed originally for c-Src (26Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Murphy S.M. Bergman M. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This result shows that tail phosphorylation by Csk is required for down-regulation of Hck. Therefore, when wild-type Hck is expressed alone, it fails to undergo intramolecular SH2-tail interaction and remains active, resulting in growth suppression. To probe active wild-type Hck for evidence of SH3-linker interaction, Hck was co-expressed with HIV-1 Nef, a well known high affinity-binding protein for the Hck SH3 domain (28Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 29Lee C.-H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Co-expression of wild-type Hck with Nef resulted in a much stronger growth-suppressive phenotype than Hck alone, which correlated with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 5). Further evidence for changes in the Hck activation state following SH3 engagement is revealed by shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of Hck in the presence and absence of Nef (Fig. 5, Hck blot). Hck, when expressed alone, consistently migrates as three closely spaced bands. Co-expression with Csk enhances levels of the highest mobility form of Hck, which most likely results from tail phosphorylation. Co-expression with Nef results in a shift toward the middle band, which is likely due to the enhanced autophosphorylation that results from Nef-induced activation. These results show that although wild-type Hck is active in the absence of tail phosphorylation, binding of a high affinity SH3 ligand (Nef) enhances kinase activity to a greater extent. This observation implies that SH3-linker interaction persists in active, wild-type Hck, a conclusion that is supported by a very recent x-ray crystal structure of active Src (30Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Manley P.W. Jahnke W. Fabbro D. Liebetanz J. Meyer T. Structure. (Camb.). 2005; 13: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Evidence for SH3-linker interaction in active Hck was also observed in comparisons of wild-type Hck activity with that of Hck-2PA, a mutant in which linker prolines are replaced with alanines (16Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These mutations disturb intramolecular linker-SH3 binding and are sufficient to release kinase activity and transform rodent fibroblasts (16Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, Hck-2PA showed much stronger growth suppression and kinase activity than wild-type Hck when similar amounts of these proteins were expressed in the yeast system. Hck-2PA also migrated predominantly as the middle band, as observed following SH3-based activation of wild-type Hck by Nef. Because Hck is not phosphorylated on the tail in yeast, these observations with Hck-2PA support the idea that SH3-linker interaction persists in wild-type Hck that is activated through loss of SH2-tail interaction. Hck-2PA could be stimulated somewhat further by co-expression with Nef, suggesting that the 2PA substitutions may not fully disrupt the negative regulatory influence of the linker on the kinase domain. Interestingly, co-expression with Csk failed to down-regulate Hck-2PA and did not alter the Hck band-shifting pattern. Thus, tail phosphorylation alone cannot drive Hck-2PA into the down-regulated conformation, indicating that the wild-type linker sequence is required for effective regulation. In a final experiment, we expressed the wild-type and HAL forms of Hck in yeast and evaluated growth suppression and kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of wild-type Hck and Hck-HAL both resulted in strong growth suppression that correlated with the presence of an active kinase. This result agrees with the fibroblast transformation data (Fig. 4) and supports the conclusion that SH3-linker release is not required for Hck activation. The x-ray crystal structures of the down-regulated forms of Hck and c-Src have revealed that two intramolecular interactions involving the SH3 and SH2 domains are essential for negative regulation of the kinase domain (3Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). This observation led us to question whether displacement of both interactions is required for kinase activation. Here we have provided experimental evidence that displacement of SH2-tail association alone is sufficient to induce kinase activation in vivo. We found that “locking” the SH3 domain to the SH2 kinase-linker did not prevent activation of Hck through an SH2-directed mechanism in fibroblasts or in a yeast model system. These results are complemented by our previous work showing that SH3-mediated Hck activation occurs without dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory tail and may not require tail release from the SH2 domain (13Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the SH3 and SH2 domains may operate independently in the regulation of Hck kinase activity. Data with the Hck-HAL mutant presented in Fig. 4 strongly suggest that SH3-linker release is not required for Hck activation in vivo. In this experiment, mutagenesis of the negative regulatory tyrosine in the Hck-HAL C-terminal tail led to strong kinase activation, despite the enhanced SH3-linker interaction engineered into this protein (Fig. 3). This observation raises the question of whether SH3-linker interaction persists in the context of wild-type Hck activated through a similar SH2-based mechanism. Yeast experiments presented in Fig. 5 support this view. Because of the absence of Csk in yeast, wild-type Hck is not tail phosphorylated and is therefore active as a consequence. Surprisingly, co-expression of a high affinity ligand for the Hck SH3 domain (HIV-1 Nef) led to a greater kinase output in yeast, consistent with the idea that some Hck molecules may retain linker-SH3 interaction that can be fully displaced only in the presence of a strong SH3 ligand. A very recent crystal structure of c-Src also supports this idea, revealing that SH3-linker interaction is maintained despite the absence of tail phosphorylation and the presence of the kinase domain in an active conformation (30Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Manley P.W. Jahnke W. Fabbro D. Liebetanz J. Meyer T. Structure. (Camb.). 2005; 13: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that SH3-linker interaction may persist in some active conformations of Hck as well, such as those produced by interaction with SH2 ligands or via tail dephosphorylation. Src family kinases are unique signaling molecules in that their non-catalytic SH2 and SH3 domains serve the dual functions of substrate recruitment and negative regulation of the kinase domain. This arrangement coordinates substrate binding and catalytic function, allowing strict spatiotemporal control of kinase activity (10Miller W.T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The presence of these two modular signaling entities in the same protein allows for a wide range of possible kinase-substrate interactions, and proteins that activate Src kinases through SH2- and SH3-based mechanisms (or both) have been reported (10Miller W.T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This has led to the idea that Src kinases can function as allosteric “switches” that integrate different types of activating inputs (binding of SH2 or SH3 ligands) into a single downstream output (kinase activity) (15Lim W.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Borrowing from the language of circuit theory, work presented here and in a previous report (13Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that Hck operates as an OR gate signaling switch. Upstream input through either the SH3 or the SH2 domain is sufficient to induce kinase activation and a strong signal for transformation in Rat-2 fibroblasts. Although OR gate signaling behavior was also observed in yeast, simultaneous disruption of both components of negative regulation led to a stronger output signal (Fig. 5). The difference between mammalian cells and yeast may reflect a threshold effect in mammalian cells, in which a submaximal level of kinase activity is sufficient to achieve a complete biological response (oncogenic transformation in this case). A similar phenomenon was reported recently for dual input synthetic OR gate switches based on the actin remodeling protein, N-WASP (31Dueber J.E. Yeh B.J. Chak K. Lim W.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1904-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this case, disruption of either of two negative regulatory protein-protein interactions was sufficient to release the actin-bundling activity of the N-WASP catalytic domain, while simultaneous disruption of both interactions allowed for a greater effect. In summary, our data provide direct experimental evidence that Src family kinase SH2 and SH3 domains can act independently to regulate the kinase domain. By extension, our results suggest that multiple active conformations of Hck and possibly other Src family kinases may exist, depending upon the type of input signal (e.g. SH3 versus SH2 directed). This suggests an additional level of signaling complexity in which the activating input dictates not only signal strength but perhaps the range of target proteins phosphorylated. Given the structural coupling between the SH3 domain, the linker, and the small lobe of the kinase domain, it is possible that the presence or absence of SH3-linker engagement may also allosterically impact the conformation of the active site. This possibility has implications for kinase-directed inhibitor discovery, as binding of some ATP-competitive inhibitors is sensitive to kinase domain conformation. A dramatic example is provided by the clinically important anti-leukemic agent and Abl kinase inhibitor, Imatinib, which shows a strong preference for the inactive conformation of the kinase domain (32Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 33Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T. Veach D.R.

Transcription, the synthesis of RNA from double-stranded DNA, is a fundamental process in all forms of life. The primary protein complex catalyzing transcription is composed of five subunits, α2β′βω, called “core RNA polymerase” (RNAP). 2The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYNOE spectroscopyTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyHSQChetero-nuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation.2The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYNOE spectroscopyTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyHSQChetero-nuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. Core RNAP is fully competent to synthesize RNA from DNA. However, the initiation of transcription at specific DNA sequences requires additional protein(s). In bacteria, these additional proteins are called the “σ factors” (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 2Hirschman J.

The σ factor facilitates transcription at specific DNA sequences by 1) binding to the core RNAP to form the σ-RNAP holoenzyme, 2) recognizing and binding to a specific DNA sequence next to the transcription start site, called the promoter element, and 3) opening the double-stranded DNA to initiate transcription.

Based on protein sequence homology, σ factors can be grouped into two classes, σ70 and σ54, which were named by the molecular weights of the first members identified (reviewed in Ref. 3Wosten M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The σ70-type factors are the most abundant in bacteria (reviewed in Refs. 4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 5Paget M.S. Helmann J.D. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 203Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). They include the primary σ factors, such as σ70 from Escherichia coli and σA from Gram-positive bacteria, which regulate transcription for most genes required for normal exponential growth. Other members of the σ70 family (σ28, σ32, etc.) regulate the transcription of more specialized genes that are required to respond to environmental changes. For example, σ28 from Salmonella typhimurium controls expression of genes required for flagellar assembly (6Chilcott G.S. Hughes K.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The σ54-type factor, which is also called σN and encoded by the rpoN gene, has no detectable sequence homology to σ70-type factors. Its occurrence is widespread among bacteria, but there is usually only one σ54 gene present in a particular organism (7Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). σ54 regulates gene transcription for proteins required for many important cellular functions, such as nitrogen metabolism, development, phage shock responses, and pathogenicity. For example, σ54 has been shown to be required for mammalian infection by Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease (8Fisher M.A. Grimm D. Henion A.K. Elias A.F. Stewart P.E. Rosa P.A. Gherardini F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5162-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The most striking difference between σ54 and σ70 factors is how they regulate transcription initiation. Once σ70-RNAP holoenzyme binds to the promoter of a gene (at a conserved sequence -10 and -35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site), it can open DNA and transcription can begin spontaneously. In contrast, when σ54-RNAP holoenzyme binds to a promoter (at a consensus sequence -12 and -24 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site), it remains in the closed, inactive state. To open the double-stranded DNA and initiate transcription, σ54-RNAP holoenzyme requires interaction with an activator protein (reviewed in Ref. 9Xu H. Hoover T.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which binds ∼150 base pairs upstream of the promoter (10Wedel A. Weiss D.S. Popham D. Droge P. Kustu S. Science. 1990; 248: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Once stimulated by a physiological signal, such as phosphorylation or ligand binding, the activator uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis (via a conserved AAA+-ATPase domain) to remodel the σ54-RNAP promoter complex into an active conformation that is capable of initiating transcription (7Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The σ70-type factors have been well characterized structurally (11Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 12Campbell E.A. Tupy J.L. Gruber T.M. Wang S. Sharp M.M. Gross C.A. Darst S.A. Mol.

X-ray crystal structures of individual domains of σ70 and σ70-RNAP holoenzyme show that σ70-type factors are composed of four helical domains (σ1, σ2, σ3, σ4) connected by flexible linkers (15Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester- Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). These four domains are also functionally distinct: σ1 is involved in regulating the kinetics of transcription initiation; σ2 binds to the -10 promoter element and is essential for melting the DNA; σ3 stabilizes the open complex formation by binding the extended -10 element; and σ4 binds specifically to the -35 promoter element (reviewed in Ref. 17Murakami K.S. Darst S.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In contrast to σ70, σ54 is divided into three regions based on function (18Wong C. Tintut Y. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Cannon W.V. Chaney M.K. Wang X. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Region 1 (E. coli-(1-55)) interacts with the upstream activator protein to control promoter melting; region 2 (E. coli-(70-304)) contains the minimal RNAP-binding domain (E. coli-(70-180) and a part that enhances DNA binding affinity (E. coli-(180-304)); region 3 (E. coli-(329-477)) recognizes and binds the consensus promoter elements. This C-terminal part of the protein contains a region that cross-links to DNA (E. coli-(329-346)), a predicted helix-turn-helix motif (E. coli-(366-386); Fig. 1), and a highly conserved sequence (E. coli-(454-463); Fig. 1) called the RpoN box. The RpoN box (ARRTVAKYRE) is the signature sequence for σ54 proteins and is critical for DNA binding (21Taylor M. Butler R. Chambers S. Casimiro M. Badii F. Merrick M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although information about the overall shape of σ54 has come from scattering and electron microscopy data (22Svergun D.I. Malfois M. Koch M.H. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4210-4214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S. Keetch C.A. Robinson C.V. Buck M. Zhang X. Science. 2005; 307: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), no high resolution structural information is available for σ54. The lack of sequence homology between σ54 and σ70 prevents homology modeling of σ54 domains based on the structures of σ70 domains. Therefore, to understand the mechanism of σ54-dependent transcription initiation, high resolution structures of domains are required. Here we present the NMR-derived structure of a C-terminal fragment of σ54 (residues Thr-323 to Gly-389) from the hyperthermophilic bacterium, Aquifex aeolicus. This domain, which includes the signature RpoN box motif, consists of a poorly structured N-terminal tail followed by an unpredicted helix-turn-helix motif. Surprisingly, this domain is structurally similar to the σ3 and σ4 domains of σ70-type proteins, despite their low sequence homology. Structural homology with other DNA-binding proteins suggests how this protein may bind the -24 promoter element. Because of the high sequence conservation of this region among σ54 proteins (Fig. 1), it is likely that this domain has a similar fold in all species, including the most highly studied σ54 proteins from E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia. Sequence Analyses—σ54 protein sequences from a variety of species were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and then aligned using the ClustalW (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54882) Google Scholar) web server at the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Secondary structure prediction for the A. aeolicus σ54 protein sequence was performed using the neural network Jnet (25Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) via the Jpred web server (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/~www-jpred/) (26Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—Six unique constructs of the C-terminal region of σ54 from A. aeolicus were cloned by PCR with primers (Operon) containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′-ends, respectively. The fragments were amplified from a plasmid containing the full-length σ54 gene (courteously provided by Gongyi Zhang from the National Jewish Medical Center, Denver, CO). The amplified fragments were digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and ligated into the pET21a expression vector. Protein Preparation—σ54 C protein was expressed using E. coli BL21 (DE3) with Rosetta.pLysS plasmid. Cells were first grown at 37 °C in two liters of Luria-Bertani medium. At A600 nm ∼0.6, cells were exchanged (27Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) into one liter of M9 minimal medium containing 1 g of 15N-NH4Cl and/or 2 g of 13C6-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory). Four hours after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended into 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. σ54 C protein was purified by ion exchange chromatography (heparin; Amersham Biosciences) and by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75; Amersham Biosciences). For NMR spectroscopy, σ54C protein was concentrated to 0.8 mm in 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.9), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% 2H2O, and 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Resonance Assignments—NMR data were collected at 298 K on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz. All data were processed with NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11273) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (29Johnson B.A. Blevins B.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; : 4Google Scholar). Small amounts of proteolysis were detected by new peaks in the 15N-HSQC spectrum after 5 days at 298 K. Therefore, a fresh protein sample was used for each three-dimensional spectrum. Backbone assignments were obtained using the three-dimensional triple resonance experiments HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and 15N-NOESY-HSQC. Side chain assignments were obtained from the three-dimensional experiments 15N-TOCSY-HSQC, C(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY, as well as the two-dimensional experiment proton DQF-COSY for the aromatic proton assignments. Distance Restraints—Backbone dihedral restraints were obtained from the backbone chemical shifts (HN, HA, CA, and CB) using the program TALOS (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). 3JHNHA-coupling constants were obtained from an HNHA spectrum (31Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) distance constraints were derived by manual assignment of cross-peaks in a three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13C-NOESY-HSQC, both with 100-ms mixing times. Hydrogen bond restraints were defined from slowly exchanging amide protons. The protein was exchanged into 95% D2O using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal concentrator (5-kDa cutoff; Millipore). Amide protons with strong cross-peak intensities in the 15N-HSQC after 3 h at 298 K were identified as significantly protected. Stereo-specific assignments of the methyl groups of valine and leucine residues were obtained from a 13C-HMQC spectrum of a 10% 13C-labeled protein sample as described in Ref. 32Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar. Only residues with totally unambiguous methyl assignments were used for stereo-specific assignments. Structure Calculations—Structure calculations were performed with the program DYANA (33Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). Initial structures were calculated using only unambiguous NOESY peak assignments. During the later stages of assignment (backbone r.m.s.d. <1.5 for residues 21-67), the structure with the lowest energy was used to filter possible assignments based on distances. The program MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6453) Google Scholar) was used to analyze molecules throughout the assignment process. Structure statistics, including PROCHECK analysis (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), are summarized in TABLE ONE.TABLE ONEExperimental restraints and structural statistics for the C-terminal domain of σ54Restraints1064Total distance956Intraresidue458Sequential (i-j = 1)201Medium range (2 ≥ I-j ≤5)128Long range (i-j ≥5)169Dihedral ϕ/φ angle restraintsTALOS prediction643JHNHA coupling44Total restraints1064Residual violationsaThe average number of distance and angle violations for each of the 20 final conformers is reported.Number of distance violations ≥0.3 Å2.74 ± 1.42Number of dihedral angle violations ≥5°0 ± 0Number of 3JHNHA coupling violations ≥0.5 Hz0 ± 0Number of van der Waals violations ≥0.2 Å1.1 ± 0.91Average DYANA target function (Å2)2.60 ± 0.33Coordinate precision (Å)br.m.s.d. values are calculated from the mean structure.Backbone atoms in well structured region (residues Gln-340 to Leu-388)0.56 ± 0.07Heavy atoms in well structured region (residues Gln-340 to Leu-388)1.24 ± 0.09Procheck statisticscStructures were not energy minimized.Residues in the most favored region (%)75.8Residues in additional allowed regions (%)20.8Residues in generously allowed regions (%)3.3Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.2a The average number of distance and angle violations for each of the 20 final conformers is reported.b r.m.s.d. values are calculated from the mean structure.c Structures were not energy minimized. Open table in a new tab Miscellaneous—All figures were made with Pymol (www.pymol.org). The sequence alignments were plotted with TexShade (36Beitz E. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis and Protein Construct Design—To help identify a subdomain of the σ54 protein suitable for structure determination by NMR, the A. aeolicus σ54 protein sequence was aligned with 38 other σ54 proteins using the program ClustalW (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54882) Google Scholar). This alignment, which includes σ54 proteins from 11 of the most studied species, is shown in Fig. 1. Visual examination of the sequence alignment indicated that the C-terminal end (∼288-398 in A. aeolicus and 360-477 in E. coli) was the most conserved region. This fragment of σ54 has been shown to be sufficient for binding to double-stranded DNA (19Cannon W.V. Chaney M.K. Wang X. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using the secondary structure prediction of the A. aeolicus σ54 protein as a guide, six different constructs of this region were cloned and expressed in E. coli. Constructs were created using PCR with three different N-terminal primers and two different C-terminal primers, shown in Fig. 1. Only one of the six fragments expressed in E. coli with high levels of soluble protein. This fragment, shown with ** above the primers in Figs. 1 and 2B, starts at Thr-323, just upstream of a pair of conserved phenylalanines (329, 330) and ends at Gly-389, just downstream of the highly conserved RpoN box motif (377-386; boxed in Fig. 1). For this part of σ54, the A. aeolicus protein sequence is 36% identical to the E. coli protein sequence. Here, we present the solution structure of this 67-residue (7.9 kDa) fragment, which we refer to as “σ54C.” As shown in Fig. 1, this fragment does not include the region predicted to form a helix-turn-helix motif, residues 292-313 in A. aeolicus and 366-386 in E. coli (gray box above the sequence alignment in Fig. 1). Structure Determination—The σ54C fragment gave an excellent 1H-15N HSQC spectrum with highly dispersed cross-peaks (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that the majority of the protein fragment was stably folded. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum contained cross-peaks for all residues except for the first three N-terminal residues (Thr-323, Tyr-324, Ser-325) and the single proline (Pro-359). 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments for the σ54C domain were made using standard three-dimensional NMR techniques (37Cavanagh J. Wayne J.F. Palmer A.G. Nicholas J.S. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 1996; (Academic Press, San Diego, CA)Google Scholar). In total, the chemical shifts for 97% of the backbone atoms (N, NH, CA, HA) and 94% of side chain atoms (aliphatic/aromatic C and H) were assigned. Even before we started calculating structures, three properties of the NMR data indicated that the N-terminal portion of σ54C from Leu-326 to Thr-339 was poorly structured and dynamic on a time scale of micro-seconds to seconds. First, in all two- and three-dimensional spectra, diagonal and cross-peak intensities for atoms in this N-terminal region were significantly weaker than for atoms in other parts of the protein. For example, in the 1H-15N HSQC the average relative peak height for residues Leu-326 to Thr-339 is 24% less than the average intensity for residues Gln-340 to Gly-389 (Fig. 2B, last row). Second, chemical shift index (38Spera S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5490-5492Crossref Scopus (989) Google Scholar) for this region indicated little secondary structure beyond Leu-338 (Fig. 2B, first two rows). Third, only a small number of inter-residue NOE cross-peaks were present in the three-dimensional 13C-NOESY-HSQC for this region of the protein. Nine hundred fifty-six unique distance restraints (TABLE ONE) were obtained from the three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra. An additional 108 φ/ϕ torsion angle restraints were calculated from HN, HA, CA, and CB chemical shift values (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) and from 3JHNHA-coupling constants (31Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (TABLE ONE). These 1064 restraints (16 restraints/residue) were used to calculate 150 structures. The 20 structures with the lowest energy were chosen to represent the structure of the C-terminal domain of the σ54 protein from A. aeolicus (Fig. 2A). Structure of the C-terminal Domain of σ54—For the well structured region (Gln-340 to Leu-388) of σ54C, the superposition of the final 20 structures has an r.m.s. deviation from the mean structure of 0.56 ± 0.07 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.24 ± 0.09 Å for all heavy atoms. Overall these structures have good statistics and geometry, as summarized in TABLE ONE. This C-terminal portion of σ54C folds into a compact domain consisting of three α-helices (Fig. 2). Helix 1 (Gln-340 to Asn-353) is followed by a long loop, which starts at the conserved Glu-354 and ends at the conserved Ser-361. Helix 2 (Asp-362 to Leu-369) and helix 3 (Arg-379 to Leu-388), which includes the highly conserved RpoN box sequence, form a helix-turn-helix motif that is commonly found in many DNA-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 39Wintjens R. Rooman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 294-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A color-coded image representing the electrostatic surface of σ54C (residues Gln-340 to Leu-388) shows that the molecule has a striking polarity. It has a positively charged face primarily composed of the loop in the helix-turn-helix motif (loop 2) and the top of helix 3 (Fig. 3C, right). The other side of the molecule is negatively charged, due to negative residues in loop 1 and on helix 1 (supplemental Fig. S2). A search for proteins structurally homologous to σ54C (residues Gln-340 to Leu-388) using the DALI server identified many DNA-binding proteins. Residues 77 to 127 of the human PAX6 homeodomain (PDB accession number 6PAX; Ref. 40Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) had the highest Z score of 5.2 (r.m.s.d 2.1 Å). The N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein, LrpA, from Pyrococcus furiosus (PDB accession number 1I1G; Ref. 41Leonard P.M. Smits S.H. Sedelnikova S.E. Brinkman A.B. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) had the second highest Z score of 4.7 (r.m.s.d. 1.9 Å). The DALI results are summarized in supplemental Table S1 (52Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 53Mer G. Bochkarev A. Gupta R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Ingles C.J. Edwards A.M. Chazin W.J.

Interestingly, the σ54C domain has structural homology to both σ3 (regions 3.0-3.1) and σ4 (regions 4.1-4.2) of σ70-type factors. σ3 of σA (residues 279 to 326) from Thermus aquaticus (PDB accession number 1KU2; Ref. 15Campbell E.A.

Ray S.S. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) had a lower Z score of 3.8 but aligns slightly better with the σ54C structure (r.m.s.d. 1.9 Å) than the σ3 fragment of σA (r.m.s. deviation of 2.5 Å). Structural alignments with σ4 and σ3 are shown in Fig. 3B, left and right, respectively. As described above, the N-terminal segment from Ser-325 to Thr-339 is poorly structured and probably dynamic on a microsecond-to-second time scale. This type of dynamics causes line broadening, thus making less structural information available for this region. The poor chemical shift dispersion for backbone and side chain atoms (Fig. 2B, top two rows) and the low number of medium- and long-range NOE cross-peaks available made it possible to assign only ten long-range NOE cross-peaks available for this region. These cross-peaks indicate that Ala-335 and Leu-338 interact with the N-terminal end of helix 1 primarily via Leu-343 and with the loop between helices 2 and 3 primarily via Phe-374. For example, the aliphatic hydrogens on Leu-338 interact with the amide and aliphatic hydrogens on Leu-343 and with the aromatic hydrogens on Phe-374. Structural Role for Conserved Residues—The hydrophobic core connecting the three helices is composed of highly conserved residues. For example, Ile-347 in helix 1 makes van der Waal interactions with Ile-365 in helix 2 and Val-381 in helix 3. All three of these residues are isoleucine, leucine, or valine in all 38 σ54 protein sequences examined (11 of these sequences are shown in Fig. 1). Other residues making crucial van der Waals interactions between the helices are Leu-343, Met-344, and Ile-350 in helix 1, Ala-366, Ile-368, and Leu-369 in helix 2, and Tyr-384 and Leu-388 in helix 3. Many of the residues creating the charge on the protein surface are conserved among σ54 proteins. The highly conserved RpoN box (Ala-378 to Glu-386) forms the majority of helix 3, the second helix in the helix-turn-helix motif. This helix is amphipathic, with the hydrophobic face packing against the hydrophobic core described above. The hydrophilic side is surface exposed. This helix is primarily positively charged due to the side chains Arg-378, Arg-379, Lys-383, and Arg-385, but the C-terminal part of the helix has negative charge due to the side chain of Glu-386 (Fig. 3C, right). When fragments of σ70 were crystallized, they were found to be small helical domains (15Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester- Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The subsequent structure of σ70 (regions 2-4) in complex with core RNA polymerase showed that these domains are modular, connected by flexible linkers, which interact with other parts of polymerase and DNA (16Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 42Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and biochemical experiments suggest that σ54 may also be comprised of such domains (43Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 945-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 44Missailidis S. Cannon W.V. Drake A. Wang X.Y. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we present the first structure of a σ54 domain, the C-terminal segment of the protein, which is critical for DNA binding and contains the signature “RpoN box” sequence (Fig. 1). Residues Gln-340 to Leu-388 of A. aeolicus σ54 form a compact, three-helix domain that includes a helix-turn-helix motif. A search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server found that this region of σ54 is structurally similar to many DNA-binding domains (supplemental Table S2). Of the ten structures with the highest Z scores, seven are known to interact with DNA. For two of these domains, the C-terminal part of the PAX6 homeodomain (PDB accession number 6PAX; Ref. 40Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal domain of the methicillin repressor protein (PDB accession number 1SAX; Ref. 45Garcia-Castellanos R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39897-39905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the structures of the protein-DNA complexes are known (40Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A.

These structures show that the proteins interact primarily with the major groove of DNA via the second helix of the helix-turn-helix motif, termed the “recognition helix.” The equivalent helix in the σ54C domain is created by residues of the highly conserved RpoN box motif (helix 3; Figs. 2B and 3A). Thus, residues in the RpoN box are structurally poised to interact with the major groove of the σ54 promoter element. Consistent with interpreting structure of the σ54C domain as a DNA-binding domain, previous footprinting and gel shift assays have shown that the region near the RpoN box is critical for σ54 promoter recognition and DNA binding (19Cannon W.V. Chaney M.K. Wang X. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 47Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 48Wang L. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8979-8986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutations in the RpoN box sequence are far more damaging to DNA binding than mutations in other parts of E. coli σ54 (21Taylor M. Butler R. Chambers S. Casimiro M. Badii F. Merrick M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 48Wang L. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8979-8986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All five mutations made in the RpoN box sequence had reduced binding to both duplex and fork junction promoter DNA, with four mutant proteins (K. pneumoniae R455A, R456A, Y461A, and R462A) showing ≤20% DNA binding of wild-type σ54 protein. In addition, these four mutant proteins had dramatically reduced transcription activity in vitro with ≤30% the activity of the wild-type protein. Thus, these residues on the RpoN box are important for DNA binding and σ54-dependent transcription. The corresponding residues in A. aeolicus σ54 are shown as sticks in Fig. 3A. Four of these residues (Arg-378, Arg-379, Lys-383, and Arg-385) lie on the hydrophilic face of the recognition helix, suggesting that this face of the helix interacts directly with DNA, as discussed in more detail later in this section. Additional support for the role of this domain in DNA binding comes from the work of Cannon et al. (47Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They found that removing the last 53 residues of K. pneumoniae σ54 (Lys-425 to Val-477; A. aeolicus Lys-346 to Ile-398) eliminated DNase I and 1,10-phenanthroline-copper footprints of σ54 and reduced σ54 holoenzyme binding to 5-bromouracil substituted DNA by 85%. This truncation cuts the protein in the middle of helix 1 of the σ54 C domain, removing loop 2 and the helix-turn-helix motif. Overall, the C-terminal domain of σ54 is more structurally similar to domain σ3 than to domain σ4 of σ70. σ3 and the σ54C are about the same size (55 and 59 residues, respectively), and all three helices are about the same length (Fig. 3B, right). On the other hand, σ4 has an extra helix at the N-terminal end, and the recognition helix is twice as long as the corresponding helix in the σ54C domain (Fig. 3B, left). In terms of surface charge distribution, however, the σ54C is more similar to σ4 than to σ3 (Fig. 3C). Both σ4 and σ54C have a positively charged surface created by side chains on the loop and the recognition helix of the helix-turn-helix motif (Fig. 3C, left and middle). For σ4, this surface interacts specifically with the major groove of the -35 promoter element (13Jain D. Nickels B.E. Sun L. Hochschild A. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester- Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). For σ54C, this surface is created by the residues of the conserved RpoN box, which probably interact with the -24 promoter element. Previous biochemical studies suggest that the C-terminal domain of σ54 is more functionally analogous to the σ4 domain than to the σ3 domain of σ70-type factors. σ3 of σ70 proteins interacts with the extended -10 promoter element near the site of melting (42Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 49Voskuil M.I. Chambliss G.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas the major role of σ4 of σ70 proteins is to bind to the -35 promoter element (13Jain D. Nickels B.E. Sun L. Hochschild A. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester- Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). By tethering a DNA cleavage reagent, FeBABE (p-bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA-Fe), to charged residues in the RpoN box of K. pneumoniae σ54, Burrows et al. (50Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Ishihama A. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29728-29743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that residues in the RpoN box are near the -24 promoter element, not the -12 promoter element where melting occurs. For example, with the FeBABE tethered to residue E463C (A. aeolicus Glu-386), strong cleavage was seen between the -30 and -25 nucleotides of the template DNA strand. The N-terminal end of σ54C domain, residues Ser-325 to Thr-339, is not well ordered and probably dynamic on the microsecond-to-second time scale. These residues could be a part of a linker region that connects two independently folded domains of σ54, as seen with σ70-type factors (15Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester- Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Previous limited proteolysis experiments on the full-length σ54 did not identify this segment as proteolytically sensitive (51Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, additional proteolysis studies and NMR analyses on larger fragments of the A. aeolicus σ54 are required to determine whether this region (Ser-325 to Thr-339) is still poorly structured in the presence of the other domains and RNAP. The C-terminal domain of σ54 presented in this report provides an interesting structural connection between σ54 and σ70. This structural similarity of σ54C to domains of σ70-type sigma factors is surprising (Fig. 3B) because these regions have poor sequence homology. Residues Thr-323 to Gly-389 of σ54C have 14% identity, 25% similarity with residues 186-326 of region 4 of σA from T. aquaticus and 15% identity, 26% similarity with residues 279-326 of region 3 of σ28 from A. aeolicus. A low resolution structure of the full-length σ54 protein suggests that other domains of σ54 may also be more similar to domains of σ70 than previously predicted by only sequence homology (22Svergun D.I. Malfois M. Koch M.H. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4210-4214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

Ablation of Scl resulted in the loss of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, consistent with its essential role in these processes. Interestingly, in embryos with severely reduced Scl levels, erythroid progenitors expressing gata1 and embryonic globin developed. Erythroid maturation was deficient in these Scl hypomorphs, supporting that Scl was required both for the erythroid specification and for the maturation steps, with maturation requiring higher Scl levels than specification. Although all hematopoietic functions were rescued by wild-type Scl mRNA, an Scl DNA binding mutant rescued primitive and definitive hematopoiesis but did not rescue primitive erythroid maturation. Together, we showed that there is a distinct Scl hypomorphic phenotype and demonstrated that distinct functions are required for the roles of Scl in the specification and differentiation of primitive and definitive hematopoietic lineages. Our results revealed that Scl participates in multiple processes requiring different levels and functions. Further, we identified an Scl hypomorphic phenotype distinct from the null state.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the role of scl in zebrafish hematopoiesis using morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotide (MO) knockdown of Scl. Using this approach, we were able to selectively either reduce or completely ablate functional Scl. Upon complete ablation of Scl, we showed here that Scl is required for primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, consistent with two other recent studies (23Patterson L.J. Gering M. Patient R. Blood. 2005; 105: 3502-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24Dooley K.A. Davidson A.J. Zon L.I. Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 522-536Google Scholar). In embryos in which functional Scl is severely reduced, but not completely absent, a distinct hypomorphic phenotype was observed. Scl-reduced embryos lacked primitive myeloid development and definitive hematopoiesis. Interestingly, primitive erythroid specification remained intact, as demonstrated by the presence of gata1- and globin-expressing erythroid progenitors. These progenitors, however, were unable to form mature erythrocytes. Thus, low levels of Scl were sufficient for primitive erythroid specification but not maturation. In Scl-ablated embryos, primitive erythroid specification and myeloid differentiation could be rescued with either wild-type Scl or a DNA binding mutant of Scl, whereas primitive erythroid maturation could only be rescued with the wild-type form. These studies revealed a distinct Scl hypomorphic phenotype and demonstrated differential effects of Scl reduction on hematopoietic specification and development of the myeloid and erythroid developmental programs in primitive hematopoiesis. Further, these findings demonstrated distinct roles for zebrafish Scl in primitive erythroid specification and erythroid maturation. The ability of an Scl DNA binding mutant to rescue early erythroid development, but not maturation, suggested that Scl may directly bind DNA at target genes involved in erythroid maturation, whereas it may exist in a multiprotein complex in which other factors bind DNA during erythroid specification. These results demonstrated that transcription factors such as Scl can play distinct roles in regulation of different genes based on the other members of the transcriptional complex. The zebrafish offers a rapid in vivo system for analysis of transcription factors in development. Zebrafish Maintenance and Breeding—Zebrafish were maintained and bred essentially as described in The Zebrafish Book (25Westerfield M.

Morpholinos were created by Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). The genomic structure of scl was determined based on BLAST comparisons between the genomic sequence in bacterial artificial chromosome clone dz129I22 and the cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers AF038873 and BC068324). The sequences that masked the scl splice donor site of exon 2 and exon 3 were chosen through the Gene Tools oligonucleotide design service, according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

MOs were injected at doses that resulted in minimal morphologic deformities. The quantities of MO injected were 1 mm for ex 2 and mis 2 MO and 1.5 mm for ex 3 and mis 3 MO.

Some images of embryos were taken in two focal planes and merged in Adobe PhotoShop to allow simultaneous sharp focus of yolk sac and tail structures in a single image. All results were obtained in at least 80% of embryos in two independent experiments with over 30 embryos total for all in situ results. RNA Isolation—RNA was collected at the 16-somite stage for reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Approximately 20-30 injected embryos were collected, and RNA was then isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions for RNA isolation. RT-PCR—Two micrograms of isolated RNAs were used in 20-ml reaction volumes to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript II (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions without SuperScript II were performed in parallel as negative controls. Primers used for amplification of RNA products were as follows: forward primer, P284 5′-ATCGCGCCGAAGGATGATG3′ (targeted to a sequence in exon 2); reverse primer, P208 5′-CACCGTTCACATTCTGCTG-3′ (targeted to a sequence of exon 4). PCR conditions used were denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 58 °C, and then extension for 1.0 min 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by a single 5-min extension at 72 °C after the last cycle. Products were subcloned by TA cloning (Invitrogen) and sequenced, with at least four subclones sequenced. mRNA Rescue—Capped mRNA was synthesized using an mMessage kit (Ambion). scl cDNA was linearized with SspI followed by transcription with T3 or SP6 polymerase. Rescue experiments were performed by injecting MOs with and without 100 pg of scl mRNA. Injections with eGFP mRNA were performed in parallel with rescue injections as negative controls. The DNA binding mutant, RER-scl, was synthesized using a Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions with the following primers: 5′-CACGAACAGTGCCGCGGCCTGGCGACAGCAGAATGTGAACGGTG-3′ and 5′-CACCGTTCACATTCTGCTGTCGCCAGGCCGCGGCACTGTTCGTG-3′. Normal Scl Expression Is Reduced or Ablated by scl MOs—To examine the consequences of Scl knockdown, we designed two MO oligonucleotides directed to the zebrafish scl sequence. The MOs were designed to inhibit splicing by masking the splice donor sites for exon 2 (ex 2 MO) and exon 3 (ex 3 MO). To determine the efficacy of each of the two splicing MOs separately or together, ex 2, ex 3, or ex 2/ex 3 MOs were injected into single cell embryos followed by collection of RNA at 16 somites (17 hpf) and RT-PCR to analyze splice products. Amplification of uninjected, mis 2, or mis 3 embryo cDNAs with exon 2 (P284) and exon 4 (P208) primers demonstrated a single PCR product of ∼650 bp, the expected size of the fragment amplified from correctly spliced scl mRNA (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR with ex 2, ex 3, or ex 2/ex 3 MO RNAs revealed only aberrant splice products (Fig. 1A). Sequencing of each variant revealed that all resulted in use of cryptic splice sites outside the region masked by the MOs. One product was amplified from ex 3 MO-injected embryos (Fig. 1, A-C), which predicted a protein product missing the entire basic helix-loop-helix domain (bHLH), known to be required for Scl DNA binding and function in vivo (36Porcher C. Liao E.C. Fujiwara Y. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Development. 1999; 126: 4603-4615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In multiple amplifications, either a single larger product (variant b) or a dominant larger product and a minor smaller product, variant c, were amplified from exon 2 MO-injected embryos (Fig. 1A). The larger product predicted a truncated protein lacking the bHLH domain, whereas the smaller product predicted a substitution of amino acid Gln-121 → His and deletion of 27 amino acids (position 122-148) followed by an intact bHLH domain (Fig. 1, B and C). Although the protein predicted by variant c would result in a functional product, variant c was absent in some PCR amplifications and was a minor product in others, suggesting that it might account for a small amount of functional protein in vivo. RT-PCR from ex 2/ex 3 MO-injected embryos demonstrated a single product, variant d, resulting from cryptic splicing at exon 2 (Fig. 1B, at a unique cryptic splice site, close to variant b) and exon 3 (Fig. 1B, the same site used for variant a), resulting in a truncated predicted protein lacking the bHLH domain (Fig. 1, A-C). Since the mechanism of splicing MO-directed inactivation is based on inhibition of proper mRNA splicing, the total levels of mRNA are not necessarily affected by MOs. However, in many cases, it appeared that targeted transcripts are absent, possibly due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or autoregulation of the gene. To examine scl mRNA expression patterns, we examined scl MO-injected embryos by RNA in situ hybridization. scl expression appeared mildly reduced in exon 3 MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2) and severely reduced in ex 2 MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2), whereas expression of scl in ex 2/ex 3-injected embryos was undetectable. Based on the sequencing analysis of splice products, the mRNA present in ex 3 MO-injected embryos should all encode non-functional product, whereas a small amount of the residual mRNA from ex 2 may have functional product (variant c). However, the total scl mRNA levels from ex 2-injected embryos was low. These results showed that the combined ex 2 and ex 3 MO injections resulted in stronger knockdown of scl mRNA than either MO alone. However, each single MO resulted in significant reduction in functional Scl. Scl MO-injected Embryos Lack Both Primitive and Definitive Hematopoiesis—Embryos injected with ex 2, ex 3, or ex 2/ex 3 MOs were assessed for blood development by light microscopy. In all scl MO-injected embryos, 80-100% of injected embryos lacked any circulating erythrocytes and did not have visible hemoglobinized blood pooled in the embryo, whereas less than 5% of control (mis) MO-injected embryos lacked circulating erythrocytes at 26-30 hpf (Fig. 3A). The scl MO-injected embryos developed cardiac edema evident between 30 and 48 hpf, whereas the corresponding mis MO-injected embryos or uninjected embryos appeared normal (Fig. 3B). Staining with a hemoglobin stain, o-dianisidine, in scl MO-injected embryos from 24 to 48 hpf showed that all embryos that lacked circulating blood at the level of light microscopy were also negative for hemoglobin by o-dianisidine staining (Fig. 3C). Definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish is thought to begin in cells in the wall of the aorta, marked by c-myb expression. In the ex 2, ex 3, or ex 2/ex 3 MO-injected embryos, c-myb expression in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta was absent at 30-36 hpf in comparison with control-injected embryos (Fig. 4, left panel). Lymphoid lineages, which develop only in the definitive wave of hematopoiesis, were detectable in the zebrafish thymus at 4 dpf. ikaros, which marks the lymphoid population at 4 dpf, was present in control embryos but was completely absent in all scl MO-injected embryos (Fig. 3, right panel), consistent with a loss of definitive hematopoiesis in the scl MO-injected embryos. Scl MO-injected Embryos Undergo Primitive Hematopoietic Specification but Lack Primitive Myeloid Lineage Development—To examine the step at which hematopoietic development was blocked, RNA in situ hybridizations with early hematopoietic stem cell markers were performed. The gata2 and lmo2 genes are first expressed in zebrafish from the 1-3-somite stage (10-11 hpf) and mark hematopietic stem cells (13Gering M. Yamada Y. Rabbitts T.H. Patient R.K. Development. 2003; 130: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Thompson M.A. Ransom D.G. Pratt S.J. MacLennan H. Kieran M.W. Detrich H.W. II I Vail B. Huber T.L. Paw B. Brownlie A.J.

In ex 2, ex 3, or ex 2/ex 3 scl MO-injected embryos, gata2 and lmo2 expression was intact in the ICM at the 16-21-somite stage (17-19 hpf). Thus, mesodermal specification to the hematopoietic lineage occurred, suggesting that Scl acts downstream or in parallel with Gata2 and Lmo2. Zebrafish, unlike mammals, have robust primitive myeloid development, with development of both macrophage and granulocyte lineages in the first wave of hematopoiesis. To evaluate primitive myelopoiesis, myeloid-specific RNA in situ markers were examined. All scl MO-injected embryos had complete or nearly complete loss of expression of terminal myeloid markers by RNA in situ hybridization. l-pl (Fig. 5C), which marks macrophages, was lost. mpo (data not shown) and lys C (Fig. 5D), which both mark granulocytes 3S. E. Lyons, manuscript submitted., were absent in scl MO-injected embryos, but not in mis MO-injected control embryos. Thus, both the granulocyte and the macrophage myeloid subsets were absent in either the single MO or combination scl MO-injected embryos. To examine early myeloid lineage development, embryos injected with each of the scl MOs or the mis MOs were analyzed by RNA in situ hybridization to follow the expression of genes that are activated early in myelopoiesis. pu.1 encodes a hematopoietic transcriptional activator required for the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells and B-lymphocytes. pu.1 is also expressed in early erythroid progenitors but is negatively regulated upon differentiation to mature erythrocytes (37Back J. Dierich A. Bronn C. Kastner P. Chan S. Blood. 2004; 103: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RNA in situ hybridization of single or double scl MO-injected embryos at the 16-somite stage (17 hpf) revealed the absence of pu.1 expression in the ALM (Fig. 5B). Expression of pu.1 in the PLM was lost in the ex 2/ex 3 MO-injected embryos but was variably retained in the single MO-injected embryos (data not shown). To examine myeloid development upstream of pu.1, draculin (dra) expression was assessed. dra encodes a 12-zinc finger protein that displays a hematopoietic expression pattern in zebrafish embryos (8Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Development. 1999; 126: 3735-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with hematopoietic expression beginning at three somites (11 hpf) in the ALM and PLM. Although the function of dra has not yet been explored, expression of dra occurs at approximately the same time as scl and precedes pu.1 (8Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Development. 1999; 126: 3735-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore presumed to occur upstream of pu.1, in the precursors of the myeloid lineage in the ALM and in the precursors of the erythroid lineage in the PLM. dra expression was absent from the ALM in all scl MO-injected embryos (Fig. 5A). PLM expression of dra was absent in the ex 2/ex 3 embryos but was largely preserved in all the single MO-injected embryos (Fig. 6A). The loss of gene expression in the ALM and PLM was specific to hematopoietic markers. Examination of other mesodermal, non-hematopoietic genes, including the central nervous system and kidney marker, pax2.1 (Figs. 5E and 6E) and the cardiac marker, gata5 (data not shown), showed no change in their expression in embryos injected with ex 2/ex 3 MOs. In summary, development of the myeloid lineage in the ALM was lost in all scl MO-injected embryos. The block to development in the ALM occurred upstream of dra and pu.1. In contrast, expression of dra and pu.1 in the PLM/ICM region of the embryo was less affected in single MO-injected embryos than in the combined ex 2/ex 3 MO embryos, suggesting differential sensitivity to dosage of Scl. Primitive Erythroid Specification, but Not Erythroid Maturation, Was Retained in Single scl MO-injected Embryos—The expression of dra and pu.1 in the ICM/PLM was unexpected and suggested that hematopoietic development in the PLM, the site of erythropoiesis, was relatively preserved in embryos injected with either ex 2 or ex 3 scl MOs separately. To further examine which step(s) in erythroid development might be affected, the expression of several erythroid-specific genes was investigated. Surprisingly, expression of the early erythroid markers, gata1 (Fig. 6B) and embryonic α-globin (Fig. 6C), was relatively intact at the 16-21-somite stage (17-19 hpf) in scl MO-injected embryos. Embryos injected in the same experiment as those used for in situ hybridizations were observed beyond 48 hpf, and over 80% never developed circulating blood. Although expression of gata1 and embryonic globin demonstrated intact early erythroid development, the erythroid progenitors did not appear to develop into hemoglobinized erythrocytes, as shown by the lack of circulating blood and the lack of o-dianisidine staining. Expression of band3, a marker of mature erythrocytes, was absent in both the single and the double scl MO-injected embryos, whereas there was strong ex"

Surprisingly, the position of CTDs over one turn of the helix does not affect the rotational setting of DNA on the nucleosome surface. Gel-shift analysis indicates that one CTD destabilizes histone-DNA interactions by 0.6 or 1.1 kJ/mol when facing away or toward the histone surface, respectively. Thus, 0.5 kJ/mol energy penalty for a buried CTD is not enough to change the rotational setting of sequences with strong rotational preference. The effect of rotational setting on CTD removal by nucleotide excision repair (NER) was examined using Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts. The NER rates are only 2–3 times lower in nucleosomes and change by only 1.5-fold when CTDs face away or toward the histone surface. Therefore, in Xenopus nuclear extracts, the rotational orientation of CTDs on nucleosomes has surprisingly little effect on rates of repair.

The chromatin serves a dual purpose, tight DNA packing within the nucleus and organization of dynamic processes such as DNA transcription, replication, and repair. Of these, DNA repair protects genomic integrity from DNA-damaging agents and is vital for cell survival (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, 1995Google Scholar). Indeed, occasional failures in DNA repair can lead to aging and to multiple diseases, including cancer (2Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar). When DNA is irradiated with UV light, adjacent pyrimidines can form stable covalent bonds, yielding cis-syn cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). 5The abbreviations used are: CPDcis-syn cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimerCTDcis-syn cyclobutane-thymine dimerGREglucocorticoid response elementNERnucleotide excision repair·OHhydroxyl radicalT4 endo VT4 endonuclease V. A common UV lesion caused by exposure to direct sunlight, CPDs can lead to skin cancer, one of the most common forms of cancer (4Cleaver J.E. Crowley E. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1024-d1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CPD lesion can stall DNA replication (5Li Y. Dutta S. Doublie S. Bdour H.M. Taylor J.S. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Each of these events can lead to genetic instability. cis-syn cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimer cis-syn cyclobutane-thymine dimer glucocorticoid response element nucleotide excision repair hydroxyl radical T4 endonuclease V. The effect of chromatin structure on repair of UV damage was first implicated by the findings of Wilkins and Hart (7Wilkins R.J. Hart R.W. Nature. 1974; 247: 35-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These authors showed that UV-induced lesions in permeable human cells are removed more slowly from DNA that is less accessible to lesion-specific nucleases in chromatin. It was then found that newly repaired DNA in UV-irradiated human fibroblasts is initially more accessible to exogenous nucleases than bulk DNA in chromatin (8Smerdon M.J. Tlsty T.D. Lieberman M.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and that nucleosome rearrangement occurs in these regions (9Smerdon M.J. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4238-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Studies with a yeast mini-chromosome showed that repair of CPDs is faster in nucleosome-free segments of DNA, being highest in the transcribed strand of a selectable gene and correlating with transcription rate in different regions of the mini-chromosome (10Bedoyan J. Gupta R. Thoma F. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5996-6005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Smerdon M.J. Bedoyan J. Thoma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2045-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Cell. 1990; 61: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, high resolution analysis of NER in this mini-chromosome demonstrated modulation of repair by nucleosomes in the nontranscribed strand of the selectable gene such that slow repair occurred within the “internal protected region” of the nucleosomes and fast repair occurred in linker DNA (13Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a study of CPD repair rates at the level of individual bases showed that in some cases the repair rates can vary almost 10-fold even when lesion sites are less than one turn of the DNA helix apart (14Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Similar to studies in whole cells, in vitro studies with extracts from human fibroblasts showed that nucleosomes can reduce repair rates of CPDs by 6–9-fold relative to free DNA (15Wang Z.G. Wu X.H. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22472-22478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, work with a site-specific 6–4 photoproduct (T(6–4)T) showed there is an ∼10-fold difference in the initial damage excision rates between naked DNA and DNA bound to nucleosomes, using both extracts from HeLa cells and a reconstituted human excision complex (16Hara R. Mo J. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9173-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies with SV 40 mini-chromosomes and different cell extracts showed that DNA interaction with nucleosomes can inhibit repair rates of UV lesions by 4–6-fold relative to free DNA (17Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9098-9104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, extracts from large nuclei of Xenopus oocytes showed only a 2-fold difference in repair rates between free DNA and nucleosomes containing a single cis-syn cyclobutane-thymine dimer (CTD) that faced away from the histone surface (Ref. 18Kosmoski J.V. Ackerman E.J. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10113-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). (It is important to note that these nuclei have exceptionally large quantities of nuclear proteins that facilitate fast DNA synthesis at the onset of embryogenesis (19Ackerman E.J. Iakoucheva L.M. Methods. 2000; 22: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)). In summary, depending on the sequence and cell type, chromatin proteins can block DNA repair rates by 2- to 10-fold relative to free DNA. Nucleosomes are the primary structural unit of the chromatin hierarchy (20Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Nucleosome core particles contain 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.65 turns around a histone octamer 7 nm in diameter (21Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6925) Google Scholar). A CTD lesion causes a sharp 30° bend toward the major grove of DNA and a 9° unwinding of the strand containing the lesion (22Park H. Zhang K. Ren Y. Nadji S. Sinha N. Taylor J.S. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15965-15970Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, CPDs do not displace DNA from histones, and nucleosomes containing CPDs can be readily isolated or prepared (23Gale J.M. Nissen K.A. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA interactions within nucleosomes do not significantly affect the overall frequency of CPD formation, because there is only an ∼1.5-fold difference in CPD yield between linker DNA and DNA bound to nucleosomes (25Gale J.M. Smerdon M.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Mitchell D.L. Nguyen T.D. Cleaver J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, DNA interactions within nucleosomes affect the site of the lesion (23Gale J.M. Nissen K.A. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CPD lesions show specific preference for DNA sites that face away from the histone surface (i.e. CTD-OUT in Fig. 1) (23Gale J.M. Nissen K.A. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These sites have greater rotational freedom in the phosphate backbone, which is crucial in bringing adjacent pyrimidines to the correct angle to form CPDs (27Rao S.N. Keepers J.W. Kollman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4789-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when free genomic DNA containing randomly distributed CPDs is assembled into nucleosomes, the CPDs are found preferentially facing away from the histone surface (Fig. 1) (28Suquet C. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23755-23757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is an energy penalty in burying CPD lesions on the histone surface (29Mann D.B. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At this point, it remains to be seen whether CPDs change the DNA rotational setting on all nucleosome surfaces regardless of location or sequence and whether such a change can affect repair of this damage. In this study, using organic synthesis (24Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) we have prepared CTD lesions at different positions within a short oligonucleotide sequence containing a Glucocorticoid hormone Response Element (GRE). This sequence has been used in past studies focused on DNA accessibility in a DNA-nucleosome complex (24Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Li Q. Wrange O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Li Q. Wrange O. Mol. Cell.

A. 2003; 100: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The GRE sequence containing a CTD lesion was bracketed by multiple repeats of the TG motif (33Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) in an attempt to modulate the rotational setting of CTDs near the nucleosome dyad axis (31Li Q. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We found that, within strong nucleosome positioning sequences like the TG motif, CTDs are accommodated by the intrinsic DNA rotational setting on the nucleosome surface that is similar to undamaged DNA. Furthermore, we have shown that different DNA rotational settings on the nucleosome surface have relatively small effects (up to 1.5-fold) on the repair rates of CTD lesions in nuclear extracts from Xenopus laevis oocytes. Synthetic DNA Substrates—Cis-syn cyclobutyl-thymidine dimers were prepared as phosphoramidites by organic synthesis, as previously described (24Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and incorporated into oligonucleotides at the desired sequence by solid phase synthesis. The CTDs were incorporated into a GRE sequence (underlined) surrounded by multiple repeats of the TG motif (A/T)3NN(G/C)3NN: fragment 5R, 5′-TTG TAC ATT ATG TTC TAG CCT GTA ACA GCC TGT TAG AGC CTG TAA CTC GGT GTT AGA GCC TGT AAC TCG GTG TTA GAG CCT GTA ACT-3′. Four different 5R fragments were prepared, depending on the desired CTD position. For the CTD-IN fragment (Fig. 1), the fragment 5R had only one CTD site at the first TT site (shown in bold, starting from the 5′-end). For the CTD-OUT fragment (Fig. 1), the fragment 5R had only one CTD site at the second underlined TT site (shown in bold starting from the 5′-end). For CTD-IN-OUT, fragment 5R had a CTD at each of the underlined TT sites. Finally, we also prepared 5R fragment without the CTD lesion at either of the two TT sites (UND fragment). In addition, we prepared the following three fragments, fragment 3L: 5′-GTT ACA GGC TCT AAC ACC GAG TTA CAG GCT CTA ACA CCG AGT TAC AGG CTC TAA-3′; fragment 5L: 5′-TGT TAG AGC CTG TAA CTC GGT GTT AGA GCC TGT AAC TCG GTG TTA GAG CCT GTA ACT CGG TGA-3′; fragment 3R: 5′-B AGT TAC AGG C TC TAA CAC CG A GTT A CA GGC TCT AA C ACC G AG TTA CAG GC T CTA A CA GGCTGT TA C AGG C TA GAACAT AA T GTA C AA TCA CCG-3′. The fragments 5R and 3R and fragments 5L and 3L are complementary. Underlined on fragments 5L and 3R are six base pair overhangs that serve as “sticky ends” during the ligation reaction, described later. The fragment 3R has a blocking group (B = methoxyl trityl amine or n-buthylamine) on the 5′-end to prevent phosphorylation by the 5′-kinase. Each of the fragments was purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and stored in -80 °C. The fragments containing CTD sites were used within 1.5 years from the day of synthesis. DNA Ligation—The four fragments shown above were ligated to prepare the final 150-bp oligonucleotides as previously described (34Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The prepared full-length DNA was resuspended in TE buffer and stored under argon at -80 °C. The final oligonucleotide concentration was determined from the absorbance at 260 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 2.86 × 106 m-1cm-1. Digestion by CTD-specific T4 endonuclease V (T4 endo V) indicated that all fragments can be digested to ∼90% (data not shown), indicating that ∼90% of the originally synthesized CTD lesion was intact at the time of the experiment. Nucleosome Reconstitution—The 150-bp long oligonucleotides containing CTDs were reconstituted into core particles using nucleosomes prepared from chicken erythrocytes and slow dialysis from high to low salt as described earlier (24Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, reconstitution was typically carried out with 10 ng of radiolabeled DNA (0.1 pmol) and 2 μg of core particles (20 pmol) in a total volume of 50 μl. Initially, the reaction included 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, which was first allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 25 °C and then for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was dialyzed (Spectra/Por Membrane MWCO 6000–8000) against 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 4–6 h at 4 °C. Finally, the reaction was dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 4 h at 4 °C. In competitive gel-shift experiments, 100-fold less DNA and chicken erythrocyte core particles were used in the same volume, and the reconstitution protocol was identical. Products were assayed by native PAGE (6% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide in TBE), dried, and exposed to a phosphoimager screen for 24 h. The ratio of bound to free DNA with and without CTDs at different sites was quantified by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and used to calculate association constants (Ka = bound/free) and the change in free energy of the DNA-histone interaction (ΔΔG) as shown in Equation 1: ΔΔG =-RTln[Ka(damaged)/Ka(undamaged)]. Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting—Hydroxyl radical (·OH) footprinting was performed following earlier published procedures (34Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Gels were dried, exposed to PhosphorImager screens, and visualized on an Amersham Biosciences (model 455-P90) PhosphorImager. Images were analyzed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Xenopus Nuclear Extracts and Repair—Repair extracts were prepared from Xenopus oocyte nuclei as described earlier (19Ackerman E.J. Iakoucheva L.M. Methods. 2000; 22: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The in vitro repair experiments were performed as previously described, with some modification (18Kosmoski J.V. Ackerman E.J. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10113-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro repair reactions (20–25 μl final volume) included 0.1 nm radiolabeled oligonucleotides (∼15,000 cpm), 0.7 mm dATP, 0.5 mm dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.1 nmol chicken erythrocyte core particles, 5 mg/ml ultrapure salmon sperm DNA (2.5 kb average length; Invitrogen), nuclear extract equivalent of 2 nuclei, and fresh repair buffer (8.5 mm MgCl2, 7 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 70 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% polyvinyl-pyrrolidone 360,000). Reactions were carried out at room temperature in the dark. At each repair time, 4.0-μl aliquots of the repair reaction were combined with 16 μl of TE buffer and extracted with 30 μl of PCI (50% Tris-buffered phenol, 48% chloroform, and 2% isoamyl alcohol) to remove all proteins. DNA in the aqueous phase was ethanol precipitated, washed twice with 80% ethanol, and resuspended with 0.4 units/μl of T4 endo V in 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (35Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Samples were assayed for CTDs by digestion with T4 endo V for 1.5 h at room temperature, followed by electrophoresis on denaturing gels (7 m urea, 10% acrylamide, 0.5% bisacrylamide, TBE). Gels were dried, exposed to PhosphorImager screens, and visualized as described above. The percentage of CTD repair at each time point was determined as a fraction of the T4 endo V cut and T4 endo V uncut bands relative to the total pixel destiny in the given lane to offset loading variations between lanes. Rotational Orientation of CTDs on the Nucleosome Surface—The reaction of DNA with hydroxyl radical (·OH) is routinely used to map the interaction between DNA-binding proteins and the DNA phosphate backbone (34Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We have used this reaction to compare the rotational setting (Fig. 1) of undamaged DNA on the histone surface in nucleosomes with that of DNA molecules containing CTDs at different sites 5 nucleotides apart (i.e. one half turn of the DNA helix, Fig. 1). The CTD sites were positioned at the nucleosome dyad where histone-DNA interactions are strongest and the DNA helix is underwound (21Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6925) Google Scholar). The ·OHs cut the phosphate backbone essentially independent of DNA sequence, and the cuts can be analyzed as distinct bands on a sequencing gel (Fig. 2). As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, reaction of free DNA with ·OHs yields a series of bands of approximately uniform intensity. On the other hand, when this DNA is wrapped around histones in nucleosomes, it yields a series of bands that have a periodic variation in band intensity (Figs. 2 and 3). These periodic variations reflect the periodicity of exposure of DNA phosphates on the histone surface (34Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). As we previously observed (24Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), when the phosphate backbone is cut at CTD sites, the two bases remain attached by the cyclobutane bond holding the adjacent bases together. Thus, there is a band missing at the site of the CTD lesion, and the n+1 band is approximately double in intensity (Figs. 2 and 3). These gaps at CTD sites make them easy to find on the ·OH gels (24Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the individual bands can be identified by comparing their mobility with lanes containing Maxam-Gilbert reactions for G sites (34Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3CTD lesions can adjust to different rotational settings dictated by the TG motif. A, superimposed scans of ·OH reaction for undamaged (black) and CTD-IN-OUT (red) sample as shown in Fig. 1. B, deletion of 3 base pairs in the sticky ends region (see “Materials and Methods”) results in a change in the CTD rotational setting as dictated by the TG motif.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We find that undamaged DNA and DNA with different CTD lesions show similar patterns in mobility and relative intensity in the ·OH-induced cuts. Preserved relative intensity between the ·OH cut patterns indicates that CTD sites do not affect DNA rotational setting relative to the nucleosome surface. The similarity in mobility of ·OH-induced cuts with minimal and maximal intensity indicates that CTD lesions do not cause extensive unwinding or stretching of the DNA helix. These results indicate that CTD sites can be buried at the surface (Fig. 3, CTD-IN), fully exposed to the surrounding media (CTD-OUT), or simultaneously buried and fully exposed (CTD-IN-OUT). Thus, CTDs do not cause a large change in interaction between the DNA phosphate backbone and the nucleosome surface, even though this lesion in free DNA causes 30° bending in the long axis and a 9° twist in base pairing (22Park H. Zhang K. Ren Y. Nadji S. Sinha N. Taylor J.S. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15965-15970Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We also prepared oligonucleotide fragments with CTDs at different positions relative to the phased TG motifs by deleting nucleotides at the sticky end of the four DNA fragments that were used to prepare the full-length 150-bp DNA (see “Materials and Methods”). A similar strategy was used by Li and Wrange (31Li Q. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to change the rotational setting of the GRE element on the surface of nucleosomes. As shown in Fig. 3, CTDs can adapt to different rotational settings of the DNA molecule on the nucleosome surface when dictated by TG motifs. For example, when DNA fragments have two CTDs 5 nucleotides apart, they can be positioned with one CTD facing precisely away (CTD-OUT) and one CTD facing precisely toward (CTD-IN) the histones (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, these two CTD lesions can also be positioned to face in more of a tangential direction on the nucleosome surface when shifted 3 nucleotides relative to the beginning of the TG motifs (Fig. 3B). Change in Free Energy of DNA-Histone Interactions Caused by CTD Lesions in Different Positions—Together with the ·OH footprinting experiments, the differences in DNA-histone interaction can be described by the differences in free energy of interaction (Equation 1, ΔΔG values). All oligonucleotides containing CTDs can be fully reconstituted in nucleosomes (Fig. 4A); however, when the reconstitution reaction is diluted 100-fold, DNA molecules with CTDs at different sites show a difference in the extent of reconstitution (Fig. 4B). The relative intensity of the reconstituted band and free DNA band can be quantified and the corresponding ΔΔG values can be calculated (Equation 1). We find that one CTD facing out can destabilize DNA-histone interactions at the nucleosome surface, relative to undamaged DNA, by a change in free energy (ΔΔG) of 0.6 ± 0.12 kJ/mol. The ΔΔG for CTD-IN is close to twice that value (1.1 ± 0.2 kJ/mol), which indicates there is ∼0.5 kJ/mol in free energy penalty when the CTD is buried at the nucleosome surface. Interestingly, with DNA containing two CTDs separated by only one half turn of the DNA helix (Fig. 1, CTD-IN-OUT), the DNA-histone interactions within nucleosomes are destabilized by ΔΔG = 1.6 ± 0.3 kJ/mol, which is close to the sum of the change in free energy penalties for each lesion alone. Thus, the CTD sites act almost independently, and this is consistent with a localized disturbance in DNA-histone interaction at each CTD site. The observed changes in free energy are very similar to the values we reported previously for randomly positioned CPD lesions within 5 S ribosomal DNA (TABLE ONE and Ref. 29Mann D.B. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although apparently small, these differences are significant for the majority of genomic DNA sequences, where rotational setting is supported by ΔΔG values closer to 1 kJ/mol (36Widlund H.R. Cao H.

The repair reactions for free DNA and nucleosome DNA were identical and run in parallel (see “Materials and Methods”). The progress of the repair reaction was monitored on a denaturing gel by following the disappearance of the T4-cut band and appearance of the T4-uncut band (Fig. 5 and “Materials and Methods”). Quantitative analysis of band intensity as a function of time gives the rates of CTD repair (Fig. 5, B and C, and TABLE TWO).TABLE TWORepair rates of CTD in different rotational positions All rates are expressed as % CTD removed per hour as shown in Figure 5.

https://openalex.org/W2087374271,"To further understand the mechanism of promoter escape by RNA polymerase II, we have systematically investigated the effect of core promoter sequence on the rate of transcript synthesis in vitro. Chimeric and mutant promoters were made by swapping sequences between the human interleukin-2 promoter and the adenovirus major late promoter, which exhibit different rates of transcript synthesis. Kinetic studies at these promoters revealed that sequences downstream of the start sites set the rate of transcript synthesis. Specifically, the sequences at +2 and +7/+8 are critical for determining the rate; when either +2 is a C (nontemplate strand) or +7/+8 is a TT (nontemplate strand), transcript synthesis is slow. At +7/+8, the thermodynamic stability of the RNA:DNA hybrid controls the overall rate of transcript synthesis. Our data support a model in which the rate-limiting step during transcript synthesis by RNA polymerase II in vitro occurs at the point in the reaction at which early ternary complexes transform into elongation complexes."

Parasitic nematodes are the most significant helminths in terms of numbers of species and distribution, causing many serious diseases in humans and animals. Furthermore, they have a great economic impact on many agricultural products. Differences between host and parasite biochemistry present possible targets for chemotherapy and are the object of intensive research in parasitology. In parasitic nematodes, specific metabolic pathways are modified to meet their actual physicochemical environment, the host organism. Because of the low oxygen tension in the host organs and tissues, helminths show a down-regulation of enzymes from the oxygen-dependent pathways, such as β-oxidation (1Barrett J. Chowdhury N. Tada I. Perspectives on Helminthology. 2001: 309-334Google Scholar, 2Tielens A.G. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 346-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). They exhibit restricted lipid metabolism but contain high levels of lipid as long chain fatty acids, retinoids, and steroids (1Barrett J. Chowdhury N. Tada I. Perspectives on Helminthology. 2001: 309-334Google Scholar). The import of these metabolites from the host organism is essential for parasite survival, and consequently, the lipid transporters are possible targets for therapeutic agents (3Kennedy M.W. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Immunology. 2001: 309-330Google Scholar).The lipophilic ligands, such as long chain fatty acids, eicosanoids, retinoids, and steroids, play an important role in cellular homeostasis. Triacylglycerols are the major cell energy storage compounds. Some of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, retinoids, and steroids act as signaling molecules and take part in important cell processes such as gene transcription, cell development, inflammation, and immune response (4Noy N. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). As a consequence of their similar physical properties, principally hydrophobicity, these chemically and functionally different metabolites are unified into the group of “lipids.” Because the tissue and cell environment is hydrophilic, these metabolites need to be solubilized and protected from chemical damage, and their transport and function have to be tightly regulated. The lipid-binding proteins (LBPs) 4The abbreviations used are: LBPslipid-binding proteinsNPAnematode polyprotein allergens/antigensFARfatty acid and retinoid-binding proteinsDAUDAdansylaminoundecanic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightFABPsfatty acid-binding proteinsRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends.4The abbreviations used are: LBPslipid-binding proteinsNPAnematode polyprotein allergens/antigensFARfatty acid and retinoid-binding proteinsDAUDAdansylaminoundecanic acidMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightFABPsfatty acid-binding proteinsRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends. perform the important role of lipid carriers. Recently, proteins of the LBP family, related to the oxysterol-binding protein, were identified to play a major role in intracellular lipid targeting and are also structural components of the membrane contact sites (5Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 6Levine T. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).In vertebrates, three major structural groups of soluble LBPs are described, namely albumin, lipocalins, and cytosolic fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs). Although lipocalins and FABPs are small β-sheet proteins (20 and 14 kDa, respectively), albumin is a larger α-helical protein (67 kDa) (7Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although mammalian FABPs are cytosolic and possess various tissue isoforms, lipocalins and albumin are involved in the extracellular lipid transport (8Zimmerman A.W. Veerkamp J.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1096-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).Nematodes secrete structurally different classes of small (15-20 kDa), helical lipid-binding proteins into host tissues, referred to as nematode polyprotein allergens/antigens (NPA) and fatty acid and retinoid-binding proteins (FAR) (9Kennedy M.W.

The first representatives were identified as major nematode antigens (As-NPA-1 from Ascaris suum and Ov-FAR-1 from Onchocerca volvulus).

These are the NPA representative, Ag-NPA-1 (14Timanova A. Muller S. Marti T. Bankov I. Walter R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Jordanova R.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and a novel 55-kDa protein, Ag-lbp55, that have no significant homology, besides a C-terminal FAR domain, with any proteins described so far. In the present study, Ag-lbp55 was purified, and its primary and secondary structures were identified. Its affinity for long chain fatty acids was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, immunolocalization was performed, indicating an extracellular localization and the presence of similar proteins in other nematode parasites.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification—Native Ag-lbp55 was purified from adult A. galli worms, as described for Ag-NPA-1 (14Timanova A. Muller S. Marti T. Bankov I. Walter R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Timanova A.M. Marti T. Walter R.D. Bankov I.Y. Parasitol. Res. 1997; 83: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The purification procedure included homogenization of the worms and ultracentrifugation and ammonium sulfate precipitation of the soluble protein fraction, followed by dialysis. The supernatant was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The eluate was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column. To avoid degradation of the native protein, all steps were performed at 4 °C and in the presence of the protease inhibitor (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture; Roche Applied Science). Additionally, a truncated form of the native protein was purified. The fatty acid binding activity during the purification procedure was checked by the binding of [14C]palmitate (14Timanova A. Muller S. Marti T. Bankov I. Walter R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Timanova A.M. Marti T. Walter R.D. Bankov I.Y. Parasitol. Res. 1997; 83: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The molecular size of the protein was determined by SDS-PAGE, using 12 and 4-20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The oligomeric state of the native protein in the presence or absence of ligand was studied by native gel electrophoresis, performed on 4-20% gradient gels as described in Ref. 17Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar. The protein concentration was determined initially by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). After obtaining the amino acid sequence of Ag-lbp55, the concentration was also determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 32.79 × 103 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm as calculated on the basis of the aromatic amino acid content of 3 Trp and 12 Tyr residues per protein monomer with ProtParam tool (www.expasy.org/).The purity and homogeneity of the full-length protein were demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, performed according to the two-dimensional electrophoresis manual (Amersham Biosciences), and the protein bands were further analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF analysis of the peptides, obtained after tryptic digestion of Ag-lbp55 bands, was performed as described previously (17Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Stone K.L. Williams K.R. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 359: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The data were additionally analyzed with PEPTIDE MASS software (www.expasy.org/).CD Measurements—CD spectra were recorded in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 °C, using a Jasco model 715 automatic recording CD spectrophotometer with a thermostatically controlled cell holder. A fused quartz cell with a path length of 0.1 cm was used. The protein concentration was 12.2 μm. The spectra, measured in the far UV-region of 190-260 nm, were averages of four scans and were corrected by subtracting the base line of the buffer. They are reported as mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ]R) in degrees cm2 dmol-1. Spectra subtraction, normalization, and smoothing were performed using Jasco CD J-715 data manipulation software, and the analyses of the data were carried out with the programs SELCON and CONTIN (20Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2516) Google Scholar).Peptide Sequencing—For internal sequencing, protein bands were cut out of the gel and digested with trypsin and the endoproteinases Lys-C and Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) as described (21Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The obtained peptides were subjected to N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-TOF analysis. Microsequencing was performed using a gas-phase sequenator Procise 492 cLC (Applied Biosystems GmbH).Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence—Based on the obtained N-terminal and internal peptide sequences, various combinations of degenerate oligonucleotides were designed, from the N-terminal sequence three forward primers S1, S2, and S3 and one reverse primer AS1, and from internal peptides three forward S4, S5, and S6 and four reverse primers AS2, AS3, AS4, and AS5 (TABLE ONE and Fig. 3). Total RNA was isolated from adult worms, using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed with 4 μg of RNA, oligo(dT) primer, and Moloney-murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (MBI) or Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). Gene fragments were amplified from the cDNA preparation by PCR with random combinations of the forward and reverse degenerate primers, using PCR Supermix (Invitrogen). The annealing temperature was 55 °C. The PCR fragments were cloned into TOPO-TA-modified vector (pCR II, Invitrogen) and sequenced. The obtained sequence data were used to design new and specific oligonucleotide primers. Amplification with the standard PCR protocol of the ag-lbp55 gene fragment and the internal regions of the degenerated primers was performed with the specific forward and reverse primers S11, S44, AS33, and AS44 (TABLE ONE and Fig. 3). The missing 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA from the ag-lbp55 gene as well as the 5′- and 3′-degenerated oligonucleotide regions were isolated and sequenced using the 5′- and 3′-RACE methods, according to the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). The primers used for RACE experiments were S33 and S22 for the 3′-RACE and AS11 and AS22 for the 5′-RACE (TABLE ONE and Fig. 3). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen.TABLE ONEOligonucleotide primers used to obtain the full length cDNA sequence of Ag-lbp55.

Following deglycosylation, treated and nontreated protein extracts were loaded on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Ag-lbp55 was detected with mouse anti-Ag-lbp55 serum (see under “Immunohistology”), used at a 1:1000 dilution, and the second antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (Dako), used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Western blotting was prepared according to a standard protocol (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Molecular mass, molar extinction coefficient, and isoelectric point (pI) of the protein were estimated with the ProtParam program.Ligand Binding Experiments and Reagents—The fluorescent fatty acid analogue 11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid (DAUDA) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). The fatty acids were products of Sigma. All ligands were dissolved in ethanol in concentrations of either 1 or 0.1 mm. The concentration of DAUDA was calculated from its absorption spectra, using the corresponding molar extinction coefficient of 4.8 × 10-3 cm-1 m-1. Steady-state fluorescence was measured with a Shimadzu model RF5000 and PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometers, equipped with a thermostatically controlled cuvette holder.Ligand binding experiments were performed with 0.1 μm Ag-lbp55 and an initial sample volume of 800 μl. Binding affinities of Ag-lbp55 for fatty acids were studied by changes in the intrinsic tryptophan emission of the protein (excitation wavelength λex of 295 nm and emission wavelength λem 340 nm). Binding of the fluorescent ligand DAUDA was monitored by measuring changes in its specific emission intensity (λex 350 nm and λem(max) 510 nm) that was expected to increase upon complex formation with the protein. Increasing amounts of fatty acids or DAUDA were added to Ag-lbp55, and the samples were equilibrated until a steady emission reading was obtained (usually 5 min). All titration experiments were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 20 °C. The concentration of the organic solvent in the final reaction did not exceed 2.5%. In order to minimize inner filter and self-absorption effects, absorbance of the samples at the excitation wavelength was always less than 0.05. Because DAUDA absorbs at the excitation wavelength (λex 350 nm), its emission spectra were corrected for inner filter effects and background fluorescence. All emission spectra were corrected for progressive dilution (≈2.5% maximum) (30Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar).The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) and the maximal fluorescence change upon saturation of the Ag-lbp55-binding site (ΔFmax) were calculated from the experimental data with GraphPad Prism program. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and fitted to one-site binding hyperbola, by using Equation 1, ΔFobs=Fmax[L]Kd+[L] (Eq. 1) where ΔFobs is the observed change in the fluorescence and [L] is the ligand concentration.The stoichiometry of the complexes was computed by the Hill Equation 2 (31Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6084) Google Scholar), logΔF1−ΔF=logKd+nHlogL (Eq. 2) if ΔFmax represents saturation of all binding sites then ΔF corresponds to the fraction of full sites at certain ligand concentrations; (1 - ΔF) corresponds to the fraction of empty sites, and nH is the Hill coefficient, which equals 1 if the stoichiometry of the protein-ligand complexes is 1:1.Immunohistology—Antisera against Ag-lbp55 were raised in mice, using a standard immunization protocol (Eurogentec). The preimmune serum was used as a control. Immunolocalization on the light microscopic level was performed as described previously (15Jordanova R. Radoslavov G. Fischer P. Liebau E. Walter R.D. Bankov I. Boteva R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Fischer P. Schmetz C. Bandi C. Bonow I. Mand S. Fischer K. Buttner D.W. Exp. Parasitol. 2002; 102: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Anti-Ag-lbp55 serum was used as primary antibody at dilutions of 1:50 to 1:100. As secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was employed, and Fast Red TR salt (Sigma) was used as the chromogen, whereas hematoxylin acted as the counterstain. For immunolocalization, adult A. galli worms were fixed in either 4% buffered formaldehyde or in 80% ethanol and embedded in paraffin. For comparison with other ascarids or with filarial nematodes, sections of female A. suum and of female O. volvulus, Onchocerca gutturosa, Acanthocheilonema viteae, and Dirofilaria immitis were used.RESULTSProtein Purification—Following gel filtration the native Ag-lbp55 was eluted as a single peak, corresponding to the molecular mass of the monomers, 55 kDa. By using the same procedure, another LBP from A. galli, the 15-kDa NPA representative, Ag-NPA-1, was purified (14Timanova A. Muller S. Marti T. Bankov I. Walter R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Jordanova R. Radoslavov G. Fischer P. Liebau E. Walter R.D. Bankov I. Boteva R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These two proteins show the same biophysical and biochemical features, except that they differ in molecular masses, so their separation was possible by size exclusion chromatography. The binding activity of the eluted peaks was followed with [14C]palmitate, and both proteins showed a high affinity for that ligand (data not shown). The native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration data indicate that under native conditions Ag-lbp55 is a monomer. The SDS-PAGE of the purification steps is shown in Fig. 1A. Moreover, Fig. 1A, lane 1, clearly shows that Ag-lbp55 together with the NPA protein are the most abundant and soluble A. galli proteins.FIGURE 1A, purification of Ag-lbp55 from A. galli, followed by SDS-PAGE. Lane 1, soluble protein fraction after ultracentrifugation (7.9 μg of protein); lane 2, supernatant after 70% saturation with ammonium sulfate (4.3 μg of protein); lane 3, eluted protein fraction after DEAE-cellulose chromatography (1.2 μg of protein); and lane 4, protein after Superdex 75 gel filtration (0.6 μg of protein). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. B, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of Ag-lbp55. The three isoforms are marked with arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis, in combination with MALDI-TOF analysis, demonstrated the homogeneity of the purified Ag-lbp55 fraction. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed the presence of at least three isoforms with pI values of ∼7.65, 7.7, and 7.8 (Fig. 1B). From the amino acid sequence of Ag-lbp55, the calculated pI is 6.99. The differences between calculated and measured pI values suggest post-translational modifications of the molecules, further supported by the presence of three isoforms. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage, followed by MALDI-TOF analysis of the obtained peptides confirmed that the three bands contain the same protein. These masses correspond to the one obtained from the digested Ag-lbp55 band, loaded on one dimensional SDS-PAGE. The mass spectrum of the tryptically cleaved Ag-lbp55 was compared with known parasitic or mammalian proteins, using the software MASCOT (33Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6709) Google Scholar) (www.matrix-science.com), but no homology was observed.Peptide Sequencing—In order to identify the purified protein and obtain some information on its amino acid sequence, N-terminal and internal peptide sequencing were performed. The sequence of the first amino acids of the native protein chain was obtained by direct N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation and showed no homology with other described proteins. The N-terminal amino acid residue was glutamate and not the expected methionine, which suggested the presence of a signal peptide. In order to get more information about the amino acid sequence, the protein was proteolytically cleaved with trypsin and the endoproteinases Lys-C and Asp-N, and the obtained peptides were sequenced. This approach yielded 35 internal sequences, around 60% of the total protein sequence (TABLE TWO). The mass and the accuracy of most of the sequences were confirmed by mass spectroscopic MALDI-TOF analysis (TABLE TWO). Some of the peptides obtained with different proteases overlapped, allowing identification of the first 35 N-terminal residues. Most interestingly, the amino acid residues at position 32 and 436 could not be identified, due to a post-translational modification. After obtaining the cDNA sequence, these were found to be asparagine residues, and the sites were identified as potential N-glycosylation sites (Figs. 2 and 3).TABLE TWON-terminal sequence of Ag-lbp55 and internal peptide sequences, determinated by Edman degradation The fragments were obtained with proteolytic enzymes Lys-C and Asp-N, and Asp-N, respectively. For most of the peptides MALDI-TOF masses were obtained as well. The main part of the protein sequencing was done by Reinhard Mentele (MPI, Martinsried).
