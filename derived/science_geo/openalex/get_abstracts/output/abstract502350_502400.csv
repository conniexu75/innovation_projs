https://openalex.org/W2164631613,"Solanum pennellii is a wild tomato species endemic to Andean regions in South America, where it has evolved to thrive in arid habitats. Because of its extreme stress tolerance and unusual morphology, it is an important donor of germplasm for the cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum. Introgression lines (ILs) in which large genomic regions of S. lycopersicum are replaced with the corresponding segments from S. pennellii can show remarkably superior agronomic performance. Here we describe a high-quality genome assembly of the parents of the IL population. By anchoring the S. pennellii genome to the genetic map, we define candidate genes for stress tolerance and provide evidence that transposable elements had a role in the evolution of these traits. Our work paves a path toward further tomato improvement and for deciphering the mechanisms underlying the myriad other agronomic traits that can be improved with S. pennellii germplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2110923983,"The circadian system is an important regulator of immune function. Human inflammatory lung diseases frequently show time-of-day variation in symptom severity and lung function, but the mechanisms and cell types underlying these effects remain unclear. We show that pulmonary antibacterial responses are modulated by a circadian clock within epithelial club (Clara) cells. These drive circadian neutrophil recruitment to the lung via the chemokine CXCL5. Genetic ablation of the clock gene Bmal1 (also called Arntl or MOP3) in bronchiolar cells disrupts rhythmic Cxcl5 expression, resulting in exaggerated inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide and an impaired host response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Adrenalectomy blocks rhythmic inflammatory responses and the circadian regulation of CXCL5, suggesting a key role for the adrenal axis in driving CXCL5 expression and pulmonary neutrophil recruitment. Glucocorticoid receptor occupancy at the Cxcl5 locus shows circadian oscillations, but this is disrupted in mice with bronchiole-specific ablation of Bmal1, leading to enhanced CXCL5 expression despite normal corticosteroid secretion. The therapeutic effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone depend on intact clock function in the airway. We now define a regulatory mechanism that links the circadian clock and glucocorticoid hormones to control both time-of-day variation and the magnitude of pulmonary inflammation and responses to bacterial infection."

Interestingly, African rice is not of the same origin as Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) but rather is an entirely different species (i.e., Oryza glaberrima Steud.). Here we present a high-quality assembly and annotation of the O. glaberrima genome and detailed analyses of its evolutionary history of domestication and selection. Population genomics analyses of 20 O. glaberrima and 94 Oryza barthii accessions support the hypothesis that O. glaberrima was domesticated in a single region along the Niger river as opposed to noncentric domestication events across Africa. We detected evidence for artificial selection at a genome-wide scale, as well as with a set of O. glaberrima genes orthologous to O. sativa genes that are known to be associated with domestication, thus indicating convergent yet independent selection of a common set of genes during two geographically and culturally distinct domestication processes."
https://openalex.org/W1971198199,"The amygdala central nucleus (CEA) has been implicated in feeding control, but its role is controversial. The lateral subdivision of CEA (CEl) contains a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, marked by protein kinase C-δ. In this paper the authors provide data suggesting that CEl PKC-δ+ neurons constitute an important node that mediates the influence of multiple anorexigenic signals. Feeding can be inhibited by multiple cues, including those associated with satiety, sickness or unpalatable food. How such anorexigenic signals inhibit feeding at the neural circuit level is not completely understood. Although some inhibitory circuits have been identified, it is not yet clear whether distinct anorexigenic influences are processed in a convergent or parallel manner. The amygdala central nucleus (CEA) has been implicated in feeding control, but its role is controversial. The lateral subdivision of CEA (CEl) contains a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons that are marked by protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ). We found that CEl PKC-δ+ neurons in mice were activated by diverse anorexigenic signals in vivo, were required for the inhibition of feeding by such signals and strongly suppressed food intake when activated. They received presynaptic inputs from anatomically distributed neurons activated by different anorexigenic agents. Our data suggest that CEl PKC-δ+ neurons constitute an important node that mediates the influence of multiple anorexigenic signals."

https://openalex.org/W2116433828,"While changes in dACC activity have traditionally been associated with variability in decision difficulty, a recent high-profile study has suggested that dACC instead encodes the value of foraging. In this study, the authors challenge this previous finding by showing that, when foraging value and decision difficulty are effectively dissociated, dACC activity corresponds to changes in choice difficulty. Previous theories predict that human dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) should respond to decision difficulty. An alternative theory has been recently advanced that proposes that dACC evolved to represent the value of 'non-default', foraging behavior, calling into question its role in choice difficulty. However, this new theory does not take into account that choosing whether or not to pursue foraging-like behavior can also be more difficult than simply resorting to a default. The results of two neuroimaging experiments show that dACC is only associated with foraging value when foraging value is confounded with choice difficulty; when the two are dissociated, dACC engagement is only explained by choice difficulty, and not the value of foraging. In addition to refuting this new theory, our studies help to formalize a fundamental connection between choice difficulty and foraging-like decisions, while also prescribing a solution for a common pitfall in studies of reward-based decision making."

In PC12 cells, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated transient activation of ERK induces cell proliferation, whereas a nerve growth factor-stimulated sustained activation of ERK induces differentiation (1Kao S.

Similarly, different growth factor ligands cause distinct kinetics of ERK activation in human breast cancer cells (3Neve R.M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4637-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ERK and Akt/protein kinase B are deterministic kinases that control the activation of nuclear transcription factors (5Bouchard C. Marquardt J. Bras A. Medema R.H. Eilers M.

However, the question concerning gene expression dynamics induced by kinetically different kinase activities and its effect on cell determination mechanisms remains unsolved. In this study we focused on the dose-dependent time course analysis of early transcription induced by two ligands of the ErbB family receptor, EGF and heregulin (HRG), which induce distinct kinase activity patterns and phenotypes of MCF-7 cells. Although many studies attempted to delineate the biochemical characteristics of ErbB ligands and receptors, no systematic study has been reported concerning the analysis of ErbB receptor-mediated cell fate control. MCF-7 cells endogenously express all family members of the ErbB protein-tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR/ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors). EGF preferably binds to an EGFR, whereas HRG first binds to either the ErbB3 or ErbB4 receptor and then induces trans-activation of ErbB2 (8Carraway K.L. II I Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V.

ErbB receptors tend to form heterodimers in response to ligand binding when different ErbB receptors are co-expressed in the same cell. In particular, ErbB2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner among the receptor family (9Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell.

EGFR activation induces self-down-regulation of the receptor by recruitment of the Cbl ubiquitin ligase (11Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 183: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Activation of ErbB receptor is often accompanied by activation of Shc-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways. These two pathways often cross-talk or inhibit each other (15Moelling K. Schad K. Bosse M. Zimmermann S. Schweneker M. J. Biol.

In addition, many studies attempted to identify specific gene expression induced by different ErbB ligands that show signaling diversities and distinct biological outcomes (20Sweeney C. Fambrough D.

Stern D.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 309: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, earlier results using platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-β receptor mutants indicated that diverse signaling pathways induce broadly overlapping transcription (22Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Our quantitative transcriptional analysis indicated that EGF and HRG also induced overlapping early transcription, however, with a large difference in their expression levels. Our results showed that ligand-specific dose-dependent activation of signal transduction pathways is precisely transmitted to early transcription, which was initially graded, induced ligand-oriented biphasic induction of c-Fos proteins after 20 min. For this mechanism, the duration of intracellular signaling, which was prolonged by ErbB receptor and, possibly, early transcription products, seemed to be responsible for this event. Our analysis indicated that MCF-7 cells utilize dose-dependent graded responses and transcriptional feedback to maintain signal duration to induce a biphasic response for cell determination and that expression of the ErbB receptor species is the most critical parameter to control the quantitative aspects of cellular processes. Cell Culture—The MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For growth factor treatment, cells were serum-starved for 16-24 h and then EGF or HRG-β176-246 was added (10 nm concentration was used unless otherwise indicated). For each inhibitor analysis, the inhibitors (AG1478, 100 nm; U0126, 200 nm; cycloheximide, 10 μm) were added 20 min prior to growth factor treatment. Gene Expression Analysis—Cells were stimulated with 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 10 nm of either EGF or HRG for 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 (HRG only), or 90 min. Cells untreated with growth factor were used as the control. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then purified using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. RNA quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). GeneChip (Affymetrix U133A version 2) experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol, and signals were processed according to the GeneChip expression analysis algorithm (GCOS version 1.2). Protein Phosphorylation Analysis—For phosphorylation and protein measurements of Akt and ERK, the Bio-Plex Suspension Assay System (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting were used. For Western blotting, antibodies for detecting phospho-p44/42 ERK, ERK, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and Akt (Cell Signaling Technology) were used. To detect ErbB receptor phosphorylation, immunoprecipitation (using corresponding anti-ErbB receptor antibody) followed by detection using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) or anti-phospho-EGFR (pY1068) (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-phospho-ErbB2 (pY1248) antibodies (Upstate) were used. Protein band intensities were quantified using a densitometer. Finally, the ratio of phosphorylation to total protein was calculated and normalized against the control. Cell Differentiation Assay—To monitor differentiation, lipid droplets accumulated in MCF-7 cells were visualized with Oil Red. MCF-7 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of growth factor in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following cultivation for 14 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. After washing with water, the cells were stained with Oil Red O dye (0.6% in isopropanol water (6:4). Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression Data—We developed a statistical model to divide gene expression changes into two components as follows: time course profiles and dose-dependent profiles (see supplemental Methods S1 for details). Gene expression (22,277 gene probes on an array) following each treatment (i.e. EGF or HRG) was modeled independently in the following manner. The log expression level for a gene following treatment is given by X(i,j) = A(i) × B(j) + C(j) + error at time points i = 1,..., I (I = 7) and dose levels j = 1,..., J (J = 4). For inhibitor data, a different stimulus was assigned to a different dose level (j1 = inhibitor only, j2 = HRG and inhibitor, and j3 = HRG only). This model represents a generalization of the multiplicative decomposition model, where the time course profile is A(1),..., A(I), and the dose-dependent profile is B(1),..., B(J). The base line C(j) is allowed to depend on j. These three components are estimated by fitting the model to the log-expression profile data. The constraint (B(1) +... + B(J))/J = 1is applied to resolve arbitrariness up to the constant factor, and smoothness of change in the time course and dose-dependent profiles is assumed. The weighted least squares method was used for model fitting. Estimated values are automatically derived from the model for missing values (at 60 min for 10 nm EGF). For gene selection, we used the log-fold change value defined as the maximum of the absolute values of A(1) × B(J),..., A(I) × B(J). For inhibitor analysis, this value was calculated for each time course observed under a different stimulus, and the maximum value of these was used. We applied the normal approximation test to the log-fold change using the standard deviation estimated by a version of the bootstrap method (the resampling residuals methods). The p value is calculated to determine whether gene expression levels show more than a 1.5-fold change from the base line (for the inhibitor data analysis this value was set to 2.0). We selected genes with p values <0.0001 so that the expected number of false discoveries is, at most, 22,277 × 0.0001 ≈2. Finally, we applied the PCA to the selected genes for visualization. The time course profile is defined as A(1) × B(J),..., A(I) × B(J) (i.e. fold changes from the base line for 10 nm), and the dose-dependent profile as A(imax) × B(1),..., A(imax) × B(J), where imax is the time at which the maximum change occurs (i.e. fold changes from the base line at the time of maximum change). Hill Coefficient Analysis—Using EGF-activated ERK phosphorylation as an example, we assume that the response of y to EGF concentration [EGF] is adequately approximated by a Hill equation (Equation 1), y=EGFNK0.5N+EGFNy=pERK-pERKbasalpERKmax(Eq. 1) where y denotes the normalized concentration of doubly phosphorylated ERK as represented by y = (pERK - pERKbasal)/(pERKmax) with the basal level of phosphorylated ERK (pERK-basal) and the maximum level of phosphorylated ERK (pERKmax). K0.5 represents the concentration of [EGF] at which [pERK] is half-maximal and N represents a Hill coefficient. The nonlinear fitting function of the Mathematica software program was used for data fitting. EGF and HRG Induce Different Kinetics of Intracellular Signaling Activities—Incubation of EGF and HRG resulted in proliferation and differentiation (accumulation of lipid droplets in the cell) of MCF-7 cells, respectively (Fig. 1A). EGF and HRG induced phosphorylation of all ErbB receptors to some extent (Fig. 1B). In general, a receptor dimer containing EGFR tends to show a transient pattern of the receptor phosphorylation, because an activated EGFR is down-regulated by Cbl ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation (11Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 23Grovdal L.M. Stang E. Sorkin A. Madshus I.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is known that mutation of the Cbl-binding site at Tyr-1045 on the EGFR abolishes the ubiquitination and enhances rapid recycling of the receptor (23Grovdal L.M. Stang E. Sorkin A. Madshus I.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In our study, HRG-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 was initially transient and subsequently sustained. This pattern is thought to be caused by the consecutive formation of ErbB1-3 and ErbB2-3 heterodimers (25Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Because EGF mainly causes activation of EGFR as HRG does for ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors (10Holbro T. Beerli R.R. Maurer F. Koziczak M. Barbas C.F. II I Hynes N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8933-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), we measured EGFR phosphorylation for EGF-induced ErbB activation, and ErbB2 phosphorylation for HRG-induced activation to observe ligand dose-dependent receptor activation. Overall, EGF and HRG induced a transient and sustained dose-dependent phosphorylation of receptors, respectively, followed by similar activation kinetics of Akt and ERK (Fig. 1C). Thus, distinct kinetics of kinase activities seemed to result in different cell fate in MCF-7 cells in a similar manner as reported in PC12 cells (1Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol.

It was hypothesized that transcription that is directly modulated by upstream pathways should be controlled in a dose-dependent manner. In an effort to identify such genes, we employed a statistical method, based on a multiplicative decomposition model (Fig. 2A) followed by gene selection (>1.5-fold change, p < 0.0001) to analyze the effect of ligand dosage and time independently (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Method S1). As a result, 63 EGF- and 251 HRG-regulated genes were selected, and 62 of the genes overlapped in the two groups (supplemental Table S1). Gene transcription was initiated very soon after ligand stimulation. Early responsive genes such as FOS, EGR, and DUSP were expressed just after 5 min, when the phosphorylation level of ERK was highest. Even in this short time, the time course profiles of each gene were quite distinct, suggesting the different regulation mechanisms for the transcription start for the different cluster of genes. Furthermore, we found that apparent HRG-specific 189 genes were also modulated by EGF, even though the modulation levels were not statistically significant (supplemental Fig. S1). It meant that EGF-regulated genes are substantially contained in the HRG-induced gene groups, and both ligands do not induce qualitative difference in the early transcription. Thus, the phosphorylation levels of upstream kinases and gene expression triggered by growth factor-induced signal transduction pathways are highly regulated quantitatively but not qualitatively.FIGURE 2Ligand dose-dependent early transcription and ErbB signaling.

We are interested in which directions these points are placed relative to the base-line point because the direction reflects the profile shape pattern. In Fig. 2B, ERK and Akt show rapid increase in early time points followed by DUSP1, FOS, and JUN, and the profile peak shifts to later time points as the points of the PCA plot move in the clockwise direction. EGF-regulated genes are, in general, closer to the base line (i.e. smaller expression averages) than HRG-regulated genes; however, the directions (profile shapes) are almost the same for the connected gene pairs (Fig. 2B). The result implies that sustained upstream kinase activity does not induce a change in the duration of transcription (mRNA induction). In Fig. 2C, we observed that the expression change becomes gradually larger as the dose concentration increases in the EGF treatment, but it changes steeply in the HRG treatment. In summary, the result showed that although the effect of time for early transcription was relatively similar for the EGF- and HRG-regulated genes, the effect of the dosage was distinct. HRG tends to reach its peak maximum at a lower concentration (d1 = 0.1 nm); in other words, the gene expression profiles induced by HRG became “saturated” at lower concentrations. Ligand Dose-dependent Property of Early Transcription Is Determined by the Membrane Receptor—To explain ligand-dependent quantitative profiles of early transcription, we analyzed the ligand-dose phosphorylation responses of ErbB receptor, ERK and Akt (Fig. 2D). Analysis of the phosphorylation response of these kinases to the HRG concentration revealed a positive cooperative mechanism in the signaling network system with higher Hill coefficients (HRG, n = 1.87, and EGF, n = 1.48 for receptor phosphorylation; HRG, n = 2.19, and EGF, n = 1.27 for ERK phosphorylation; and HRG, n = 2.11, and EGF, n = 1.31 for Akt phosphorylation) (Fig. 2D). Similar cooperative phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor has been observed for antibody-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p185neu (26Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ErbB ligand tends to show high affinity for the receptor dimer than the receptor monomer (27Uyemura T. Takagi H. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys J. 2005; 88: 3720-3730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and HRG-induced ErbB2 phosphorylation might be facilitated by high affinity interaction of the ligand with the ErbB2/3 receptor dimer (10Holbro T.

Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on ERK and Akt Phosphorylation and Gene Expression—Although duration of the upstream kinase activity does not cause any effect for duration of transcription, our results suggest that the quantitative characteristics of dose dependence (or sensitivity) of the receptor phosphorylation responding to the growth factor have a large effect for early transcription. A comparison of the 62 EGF- and HRG-regulated overlapping genes revealed that whereas the expression level of particular genes was almost identical regardless of ligand types, HRG often markedly regulated the intensity of gene expression more than EGF did (supplemental Table S1). ERK and Akt cooperatively facilitate cellular transformation (29Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Kimura K. Nishida W. Saga H. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 30Li W. Zhu T. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2079772090,"The evolutionary conserved TOR complex 1 (TORC1) activates cell growth in response to nutrients. In yeast, TORC1 responds to the nitrogen source via a poorly understood mechanism. Leucine, and perhaps other amino acids, activates TORC1 via the small GTPases Gtr1 and Gtr2, orthologs of the mammalian Rag GTPases. Here we investigate the activation of TORC1 by the nitrogen source and how this might be related to TORC1 activation by Gtr/Rag. The quality of the nitrogen source, as defined by its ability to promote growth and glutamine accumulation, directly correlates with its ability to activate TORC1 as measured by Sch9 phosphorylation. Preferred nitrogen sources stimulate rapid, sustained Sch9 phosphorylation and glutamine accumulation. Inhibition of glutamine synthesis reduces TORC1 activity and growth. Poor nitrogen sources stimulate rapid but transient Sch9 phosphorylation. A Gtr1 deficiency prevents the transient stimulation of TORC1 but does not affect the sustained TORC1 activity in response to good nitrogen sources. These findings suggest that the nitrogen source must be converted to glutamine, the preferred nitrogen source in yeast, to sustain TORC1 activity. Furthermore, sustained TORC1 activity is independent of Gtr/Rag. Thus, the nitrogen source and Gtr/Rag activate TORC1 via different mechanisms."

Genotoxic chemotherapy is the most common cancer treatment strategy. However, its untargeted generic DNA-damaging nature and associated systemic cytotoxicity greatly limit its therapeutic applications. Here, we used a haploid genetic screen in human cells to discover an absolute dependency of the clinically evaluated anticancer compound YM155 on solute carrier family member 35 F2 (SLC35F2), an uncharacterized member of the solute carrier protein family that is highly expressed in a variety of human cancers. YM155 generated DNA damage through intercalation, which was contingent on the expression of SLC35F2 and its drug-importing activity. SLC35F2 expression and YM155 sensitivity correlated across a panel of cancer cell lines, and targeted genome editing verified SLC35F2 as the main determinant of YM155-mediated DNA damage toxicity in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest a new route to targeted DNA damage by exploiting tumor and patient-specific import of YM155."
https://openalex.org/W2011677146,"Stanley Lemon and colleagues show that the HCV replicase is sensitive to lipid peroxidation, which may restrict viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Oxidative tissue injury often accompanies viral infection, yet there is little understanding of how it influences virus replication. We show that multiple hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes are exquisitely sensitive to oxidative membrane damage, a property distinguishing them from other pathogenic RNA viruses. Lipid peroxidation, regulated in part through sphingosine kinase-2, severely restricts HCV replication in Huh-7 cells and primary human hepatoblasts. Endogenous oxidative membrane damage lowers the 50% effective concentration of direct-acting antivirals in vitro, suggesting critical regulation of the conformation of the NS3-4A protease and the NS5B polymerase, membrane-bound HCV replicase components. Resistance to lipid peroxidation maps genetically to transmembrane and membrane-proximal residues within these proteins and is essential for robust replication in cell culture, as exemplified by the atypical JFH1 strain of HCV. Thus, the typical, wild-type HCV replicase is uniquely regulated by lipid peroxidation, providing a mechanism for attenuating replication in stressed tissue and possibly facilitating long-term viral persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2028106708,"Chromosome breakage elicits transient silencing of ribosomal RNA synthesis, but the mechanisms involved remained elusive. Here we discover an in trans signalling mechanism that triggers pan-nuclear silencing of rRNA transcription in response to DNA damage. This is associated with transient recruitment of the Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1), a central regulator of DNA damage responses, into the nucleoli. We further identify TCOF1 (also known as Treacle), a nucleolar factor implicated in ribosome biogenesis and mutated in Treacher Collins syndrome, as an interaction partner of NBS1, and demonstrate that NBS1 translocation and accumulation in the nucleoli is Treacle dependent. Finally, we provide evidence that Treacle-mediated NBS1 recruitment into the nucleoli regulates rRNA silencing in trans in the presence of distant chromosome breaks. DNA damage induces silencing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. Stucki and colleagues reveal that rRNA silencing is an ATM-dependent pan-nuclear response to irradiation, in which the nucleolar protein Treacle targets DNA-damage protein NBS1 to nucleoli."
https://openalex.org/W2131227905,"The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is thought to synchronize peripheral clocks in various organs with each other and with external time. Our knowledge about the role of the SCN clock is based mainly on SCN lesion and transplantation studies. We have now directly deleted the SCN clock using the Cre/LoxP system and investigated how this affects synchronization of peripheral rhythms. Impaired locomotor activity and arrhythmic clock gene expression in the SCN confirm that the SCN clockwork was efficiently abolished in our mouse model. Nonetheless, under light-dark (LD) conditions, peripheral clocks remained rhythmic and synchronized to the LD cycle, and phase relationships between peripheral clocks were sustained. Adaptation to a shifted LD cycle was accelerated in SCN clock-deficient mice. Moreover, under zeitgeber-free conditions, rhythmicity of the peripheral clock gene expression was initially dampened, and after several days peripheral clocks were desynchronized. These findings suggest that the SCN clock is dispensable for the synchronization of peripheral clocks to the LD cycle. A model describing an SCN clock-independent pathway that synchronizes peripheral clocks with the LD cycle is discussed.—Husse, J., Leliavski, A., Tsang, A.

In Xenopus laevis, the oocyte genome is active in transcription, providing a large pool of maternal mRNA in the cytoplasm. During oocyte maturation into an egg and early embryogenesis, these mRNAs together with maternal proteins provide the building materials of eggs and embryos (1Davidson E.H. Gene Activity in Early Development.3rd Ed. Academic Press, Orland, FL1986Google Scholar). mRNAs stored in oocytes are masked from the translational machinery by associating with a set of proteins in storage messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs). 2The abbreviations used are: mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; P-body, processing body; UTR, untranslated region; CPEB, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; SG, stress granule; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. Growing evidence indicates that mRNAs move between nontranslating (stored) and translating mRNP states in the cytoplasm not only in germ cells but also in cell types as diverse as neurons and yeast (2Martin K.C.

Studies on mRNA masking have shed light on several mechanisms by which mRNP components determine whether a given mRNA synthesized in vivo is actively translated or stored (5Colegrove-Otero L.J. Minshall N. Standart N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 21-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Matsumoto K. Pandalai S.G. Recent Developments in Nucleic Acids Research. Transworld Research Network, Kerala, India2006: 115-140Google Scholar). The most studied are those mRNAs carrying the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element, CPE, in their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). The CPE functions with its cognate trans-acting factor CPE-binding protein (CPEB) in RNA masking in immature oocytes (7Mendez R. Richter J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). CPEB associates with Maskin, which in turn binds to the cap-binding protein eIF4E and precludes the formation of an eIF4E-eIF4G complex that is required for cap-dependent translation (8Stebbins-Boaz B.

During oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis, changes in the length of the poly(A) tail, which occur dependent on or independent of specific cis-elements, have an impact on the translational activity of a mRNA (7Mendez R.

Alternatively, the splicing process in the nucleus deposits a protein complex at the exonexon junction and thereby determines the translational efficiency of an mRNA in the cytoplasm, which demonstrates that a specific gene structure affects translation (12Matsumoto K.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amount and activity of the Y-box protein, a core component of cytoplasmic mRNPs, have been shown to significantly affect general translational activity in Xenopus oocytes and in somatic cells of different organisms (14Matsumoto K.

Xp54 associates with nascent transcripts in the nucleus and, therein, is involved in the assembly of storage mRNPs (31Smillie D.A. Sommerville J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 395-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast genetic studies demonstrated that Dhh1p, which is the yeast homologue of Xp54, is involved in general translational repression (29Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To further identify and characterize the components of cytoplasmic mRNPs in Xenopus oocytes, we isolated complexes containing FRGY2 from Xenopus oocytes. In this report we demonstrate that xRAP55 is coimmunoprecipitated with FRGY2 in an RNA-dependent manner. We show that xRAP55 and its human homologue localize to cytoplasmic foci in oocytes and cultured cells and that xRAP55 is a component of storage mRNPs and acts as a translational repressor. Immunoprecipitation—50 oocytes expressing FRGY2-FLAG or 3× FLAG-xRAP55 were homogenized in 1 ml of buffer A (90 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% sucrose). The homogenate was centrifuged in a 1.5 ml tube at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to prepare oocyte lysates. To digest RNA, RNase A was added to the oocyte lysates at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Oocytes lysates were incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The affinity gel was extensively washed with buffer A, and complexes containing FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted with 150 μg/ml of 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/150 mm NaCl for 5 min at room temperature. Tandem mass spectrometric analyses of the tryptic peptides were carried out at the Research Resources Center at our institute.

The supernatant was loaded onto a 15-40% sucrose density gradient prepared in buffer B and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm in a Hitachi P50S2 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. For the EDTA treatment, all the buffers contained 20 mm EDTA instead of MgCl2 and cycloheximide. The samples were collected from the top of the gradient in 18 fractions of 280 μl by a piston gradient fractionator (Biocomp).

The supernatant was adjusted to 250 mm NaCl, mixed with 200 μl of oligo(dT)-cellulose beads (GE Healthcare), and rotated for 1 h at 4°C. The cellulose beads were then washed twice with buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2), and the bound fraction was eluted with 400 μl of buffer C containing 25% or 50% formamide (36Darnbrough C.H. Ford P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 113: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the UV cross-linking assay, 200 oocytes were homogenized in 500 μl of protein extraction buffer (90 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5% sucrose). The homogenate was centrifuged in a 1.5 ml tube at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was irradiated with UV light for 5 min on ice, denatured at 65 °C for 5 min, mixed with 250 μl of oligo(dT)-cellulose beads, and rotated for 15 min at room temperature. The cellulose beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS, and the bound fraction was eluted with elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% SDS) at 65 °C for 5 min. The eluates were treated with RNase A (25 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting. GST Pulldown Assay—For GST pull-down assays with purified proteins, 1.5 μg of GST or GST-xRAP55 bound to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with 2 μg of recombinant Xp54-His6 in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4°Cand washed twice with buffer D. The bound materials were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-histidine tag antibody. Gel Retardation Assay—A partial Vg1 3′-UTR fragment (VLE (37Mowry K.L. Melton D.A. Science. 1992; 255: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)) was prepared by PCR from total cDNA of Xenopus oocytes using 5′-AATATTTCTACTTTATTTCTACAC-3′ and 5′-CTCAAGTCATATGGACTATT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-Teasy to obtain pGEM-Teasy-VLE. pGEM-Teasy-VLE linearized with SalI was used for in vitro transcription with a MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (25 μCi, GE Healthcare). 100 fmol of in vitro synthesized mRNA and recombinant GST-xRAP55 and Xp54-His6 were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in a 10-μl reaction mixture consisting of 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 2 units/ml RNase inhibitor. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (35Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Aoki K. Matsumoto K. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48491-48497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. In Vitro Translation—β-Actin and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNAs (32P-labeled) were prepared using plasmids pSPcACT1 and pSPCAT, respectively, as described previously (39Matsumoto K. Tanaka K.J. Tsujimoto M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1779-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 500 fmol of β-actin or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA was incubated with various amounts of GST-xRAP55 or Xp54-His6 at 30 °C for 20 min in a 9.5-μl reaction mixture consisting of 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 2 units/μl RNase inhibitor. For in vitro translation in wheat germ extract, the mixture was then incubated at 25 °C for 2 h in a 25-μl reaction mixture consisting of 12.5 μl of wheat germ extract (Promega, Madison, WI), 20 μm each of the amino acids including 5 μCi of [35S]methionine, and 20 units of RNase inhibitor. The mixture was digested with RNase A and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To analyze the mRNA stability, the RNA was recovered from 10 μl of each reaction mixture with TRI reagent (Sigma) and analyzed by electrophoresis in an agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The gels were then dried and exposed to an imaging plate. The radioactivity of the translational products was quantified using a BAS2500 Image Analyzer (Fuji Film). Tethering Assay—25 fmol of mRNAs encoding MS2 fusion proteins was injected into stage VI oocytes. After 6 h, oocytes were injected with 25 nl of a solution containing luciferase reporter mRNA (10 ng/μl) and lacZ control mRNA (200 ng/μl). Alternatively, to analyze the synthesis of MS2 fusion proteins, oocytes were incubated with [35S]methionine. Incubation was continued for 14 h before harvesting. Two pools of ten oocytes were assayed per experimental point for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Oocytes were homogenized in 20 μl per oocyte of protein extraction buffer, and 5- and 15-μl samples were assayed for firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. To prepare RNA, 10 oocytes were lysed in TRI reagent, and RNA was analyzed as described above. Identification of the Components of FRGY2-associated Complexes—Given that FRGY2 is one of the major components of Xenopus maternal mRNPs, we attempted to search for proteins that interact with FRGY2 in oocytes. To do this, we microinjected mRNA encoding a FLAG epitope-tagged FRGY2 into oocytes. The FRGY2-FLAG protein was successfully incorporated into mRNPs as judged by fractionation on a sucrose gradient (data not shown, but see Ref. 20Matsumoto K. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FRGY2-associated complexes were immunoprecipitated from the oocytes with anti-FLAG antibodies. A number of proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated from FRGY2-FLAG-expressing oocytes but not from control oocytes (Fig. 1). RNase treatment prior to immunoprecipitation revealed that the association between FRGY2 and most proteins is likely to be mediated primarily by their binding to the same RNA molecules, with the notable exception of YBAP1, a chicken homologue of which has been shown to bind directly to the Y-box protein YB-1 (39Matsumoto K. Tanaka K.J. Tsujimoto M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1779-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We identified some of the FRGY2-associated proteins by mass spectrometry, as listed in Fig. 1. Among them, a protein of ∼60 kDa was identified as a Xenopus homologue of RAP55. RAP55 was originally identified as an mRNA-associated protein of 55 kDa from newt Pleurodeles waltl oocytes (40Lieb B. Carl M. Hock R. Gebauer D. Scheer U. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this report, we focus on our analysis of the Xenopus RAP55 protein, which we hereafter refer to as “xRAP55.” Temporal Expression of xRAP55—We isolated a cDNA clone encoding the xRAP55 protein from a Xenopus cDNA library. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 471 amino acid residues that has 74% identity with Pleurodeles RAP55. xRAP55 protein possesses an Lsm domain at its N terminus and two RGG-rich domains (RGG1 and RGG2) in its C-terminal region, all of which are putative RNA-binding domains (Fig. 2A). Eukaryotic Lsm domain-containing proteins (Lsm proteins) form heteroheptameric rings that bind to single-stranded RNA and are involved in various steps of RNA metabolism (41Khusial P. Plaag R. Zieve G.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 522-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 42Wilusz C.J. Wilusz J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Lsm1-7 ring occurs in the cytoplasm and functions as a decapping activator during mRNA degradation. The Lsm2-8 ring occurs in the nucleus and is involved in the processing of various nuclear RNAs. In addition to these prototypic Lsm proteins, a recent comprehensive data base search has identified novel Lsm proteins, Lsm12-16, which carry long C-terminal regions (43Albrecht M. Lengauer T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 44Anantharaman V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). RAP55 is a member of the Lsm14 family, or the Scd6 family that was named after the Saccharomyces cerevisiae member Scd6p (43Albrecht M. Lengauer T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The C-terminal RGG domains are separated by the FDF domain, which is commonly found in Lsm13-16 proteins. To facilitate characterization of xRAP55, we have raised a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of xRAP55. This antibody reacted with a 60-kDa protein in oocyte lysates, which is most likely xRAP55 (Fig. 2B). Moreover, it detected the recombinant xRAP55 and human RAP55 (hRAP55) proteins (data not shown). Using this antibody, we examined the expression of xRAP55 in oocytes and early embryos. The amount of xRAP55 increased during the oocyte growth, which corresponds with the accumulation of maternal mRNA (Fig. 2C). A similar level of xRAP55 expression was observed throughout early development until the tail bud stage (Fig. 2D). Reprobing with anti-ElrA (the Xenopus homologue of HuR) and anti-xCIRP2 served as the loading controls (35Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Wu L. Good P.J. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We noticed a slight decrease in the mobility of xRAP55 in matured oocytes and unfertilized eggs compared with that in immature stage VI oocytes. We therefore tested whether the slow migrating xRAP55 is phosphorylated, and found that, upon treatment with alkaline phosphatase, xRAP55 in matured oocytes migrated as fast as that in stage VI oocytes (Fig. 2E). However, the actual level of xRAP55 in a matured oocyte was not substantially changed when compared with that in a stage VI oocyte after the treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. S1A). xRAP55 was predominantly located in the cytoplasm, as judged by immunoblotting of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of stage VI oocytes (Fig. S1B). As a control, template-activating factor I (TAF-I), which is involved in chromatin remodeling, was exclusively detected in the nuclear fractions (32Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Miyaji-Yamaguchi M. Kikuchi A. Tsujimoto M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6940-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic localization of xRAP55 was confirmed by the immunostaining of oocytes. In the smallest oocytes in the ovary (stage I), xRAP55 was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2F). From stage III onward, immunostaining was detected in the perinuclear region and along fibers located perpendicular to the oocyte surface, the latter of which were less orderly organized at the vegetal hemisphere in fully grown stage VI oocytes (Fig. 2F). In addition, cytoplasmic particulate structures were observed at the vegetal hemisphere in stage VI oocytes, which suggests that xRAP55 exists in large particles. These structures were more prominent in a fertilized egg (Fig. 2G). Control rabbit immunoglobulin did not stain the oocytes (data not shown). Further, we found that the immunostaining patterns of FLAG-xRAP55 detected with the anti-FLAG antibody were similar to those obtained with the anti-FRGY2 antibody, although the cytoplasmic particulate structures were more prominent with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. S1C). Human RAP55 Localizes to the Cytoplasmic Processing Bodies—xRAP55 was found in RNPs that contain the DEAD-box ATPase Xp54 and eIF4E-T (Fig. 1). Recently, it has been shown that human homologues of Xp54 and eIF4E-T localize to P-bodies, which are cytoplasmic structures detected as discrete foci and considered as sites of either mRNA decay or storage of nontranslating mRNAs (46Cougot N. Babajko S. Seraphin B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 47Andrei M.A. Ingelfinger D. Heintzmann R. Achsel T. Rivera-Pomar R. Luhrmann R. RNA (N.

These results together with the observation that xRAP55 or its homologue occurs in cytoplasmic particles in Xenopus oocytes and eggs (Fig. 2) and in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos (49Boag P.R.

To this end, FLAG-xRAP55 was expressed in human HeLa cells. Immunostaining"
https://openalex.org/W2115546424,"K-mer abundance analysis is widely used for many purposes in nucleotide sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo assembly, repeat detection, and sequencing coverage estimation. We present the khmer software package for fast and memory efficient online counting of k-mers in sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on data structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer relies entirely on a simple probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch. The Count-Min Sketch permits online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On sparse data sets this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces a systematic overcount for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the k-mers, are stored. Here we analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the miscount rate of khmer for generating k-mer frequency distributions and retrieving k-mer counts for individual k-mers. We also compare the performance of khmer to several other k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer, Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC, Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of profiling sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and digital normalization of reads in the context of high khmer false positive rates. khmer is implemented in C++ wrapped in a Python interface, offers a tested and robust API, and is freely available under the BSD license at github.com/ged-lab/khmer."

Here we used both Bmal1−/− and acute liver-specific Bmal1-depleted mice to study the role of BMAL1 in refeeding-induced de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Both global deficiency and acute hepatic depletion of Bmal1 reduced lipogenic gene expression in the liver upon refeeding. Conversely, Bmal1 overexpression in mouse liver by adenovirus was sufficient to elevate the levels of mRNA of lipogenic enzymes. Bmal1−/− primary mouse hepatocytes displayed decreased levels of de novo lipogenesis and lipogenic enzymes, supporting the notion that BMAL1 regulates lipid synthesis in hepatocytes in a cell-autonomous manner. Both refed mouse liver and insulin-treated primary mouse hepatocytes showed impaired AKT activation in the case of either Bmal1 deficiency or Bmal1 depletion by adenoviral shRNA. Restoring AKT activity by a constitutively active mutant of AKT nearly normalized de novo lipogenesis in Bmal1−/− hepatocytes. Finally, Bmal1 deficiency or knockdown decreased the protein abundance of RICTOR, the key component of the mTORC2 complex, without affecting the gene expression of key factors of insulin signaling.

This unexpected model is adding a new dimension on how we think about GPCR signaling, but its mechanism is incompletely understood. We report here that endosomal acidification mediated by the PKA action on the v-ATPase provides a negative feedback mechanism by which endosomal receptor signaling is turned off."
https://openalex.org/W2167593281,"The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway selectively eliminates aberrant transcripts containing premature translation termination codons and regulates the levels of a number of physiological mRNAs. NMD modulates the clinical outcome of a variety of human diseases, including cancer and many genetic disorders, and may represent a target for therapeutic intervention. Here, we have developed a new multicolored bioluminescence-based reporter system that can specifically and effectively assay NMD in live human cells. Using this reporter system, we conducted a robust high-throughput small-molecule screen in human cells and, unpredictably, identified a group of cardiac glycosides, including ouabain and digoxin, as potent inhibitors of NMD. Cardiac glycoside-mediated effects on NMD are dependent on binding and inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase on the plasma membrane and subsequent elevation of intracellular calcium levels. Induction of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum also leads to inhibition of NMD. Thus, this study reveals intracellular calcium as a key regulator of NMD and has implications for exploiting NMD in the treatment of disease."

In the awake olfactory bulb, high activity with weak sensory-evoked responses has been reported in mitral/tufted cells (M/TCs). Using blind whole-cell recordings, we found 33% of M/TCs to be 'silent', yet still show strong sensory responses, with weak or inhibitory responses in 'active' neurons. Thus, a previously missed M/TC subpopulation can exert powerful influence over the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W1984011020,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates brain damage after stroke. Now our objective is to determine TLR4 involvement in stroke-induced neurogenesis. Stroke was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice. Stereological and densitometric analysis of immunofluorescence-labeled brain sections and FACS analysis of cell suspensions were performed. Our results show that subventricular zone (SVZ) cell proliferation after stroke depends on infarct size. Second, when comparing brains with similar lesions, TLR4 attenuated SVZ proliferation, as shown by a decrease in prominin-1(+)/EGFR(+)/nestin(-) cells (type-C cells) at 1-2 d, and in BrdU(+) cells at 7 d, in TLR4(+/+) vs. TLR4(-/-) mice. Interestingly, 7 d after the infarct, neuroblasts in TLR4(+/+) mice migrated farther distances, reaching areas closer to the lesion than those in TLR4-deficient mice. However, at 14 d, TLR4-deficient mice presented a higher number of neuroblasts in all migratory zones than the TLR4(+/+) counterparts, which suggests that TLR4 deficiency delays neuroblast migration. Consistently, TLR4(+/+) mice showed an increased number of interneurons (NeuN(+)/BrdU(+)/GAD67(+) cells) in peri-infarct cortex 14-28 d after stroke. Our data indicate that, despite a negative effect on SVZ cell proliferation, TLR4 plays an important role in stroke-induced neurogenesis by promoting neuroblasts migration and increasing the number of new cortical neurons after stroke."

It uses BWA to align reads to the genome and reference transcript models (including annotated exon-exon junctions) specifically allowing for the possibility of a single read spanning multiple exons. Reads aligned to the transcript models are then re-mapped on to genomic coordinates, transforming alignments that span multiple exons into large-gapped alignments on the genome. While JAGuaR does not detect novel junctions, we demonstrate how JAGuaR generates fast and accurate transcriptome alignments, which allows for both sensitive and specific SNV calling."
https://openalex.org/W1978309142,"Tripartite motif 24 protein (TRIM24) is a plant homeodomain/bromodomain histone reader, recently associated with poor overall survival of breast-cancer patients. At a molecular level, TRIM24 is a negative regulator of p53 levels and a co-activator of estrogen receptor. However, the role of TRIM24 in breast tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. We used an isogenic human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) culture model, derived from reduction mammoplasty tissue, and found that ectopic expression of TRIM24 in immortalized HMECs (TRIM24 iHMECs) greatly increased cellular proliferation and induced malignant transformation. Subcutaneous injection of TRIM24 iHMECs in nude mice led to growth of intermediate to high-grade tumors in 60-70% of mice. Molecular analysis of TRIM24 iHMECs revealed a glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle gene signature, alongside increased glucose uptake and activated aerobic glycolysis. Collectively, these results identify a role for TRIM24 in breast tumorigenesis through reprogramming of glucose metabolism in HMECs, further supporting TRIM24 as a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2045405513,"Lipid metabolism plays a fundamental role during influenza virus replication, although key regulators of lipid-dependent trafficking and virus production remain inadequately defined. This report demonstrates that infection by influenza virus stimulates phospholipase D (PLD) activity and that PLD co-localizes with influenza during infection. Both chemical inhibition and RNA interference of PLD delayed viral entry and reduced viral titers in vitro. Although there may be contributions by both major isoenzymes, the effects on viral infectivity appear to be more dependent on the PLD2 isoenzyme. In vivo, PLD2 inhibition reduced virus titer and correlated with significant increases in transcription of innate antiviral effectors. The reduction in viral titer downstream of PLD2 inhibition was dependent on Rig-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene-1), IRF3, and MxA (myxovirus resistance gene A) but not IRF7. Inhibition of PLD2 accelerated the accumulation of MxA in foci as early as 30 min postinfection. Together these data suggest that PLD facilitates the rapid endocytosis of influenza virus, permitting viral escape from innate immune detection and effectors that are capable of limiting lethal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2052102717,"Although the dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer has emerging physiological relevance and a postulated role in different neuropsychiatric disorders, such as drug addiction, depression, and schizophrenia, there is a need for pharmacological tools that selectively target such receptor complexes in order to analyze their biological and pathophysiological functions. Since no selective antagonists for the D1-D2 heteromer are available, serial deletions and point mutations were used to precisely identify the amino acids involved in an interaction interface between the receptors, residing within the carboxyl tail of the D1 receptor that interacted with the D2 receptor to form the D1-D2 receptor heteromer. It was determined that D1 receptor carboxyl tail residues 404Glu and 405Glu were critical in mediating the interaction with the D2 receptor. Isolated mutation of these residues in the D1 receptor resulted in the loss of agonist activation of the calcium signaling pathway mediated through the D1-D2 receptor heteromer. The physical interaction between the D1 and D2 receptor could be disrupted, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation and BRET analysis, by a small peptide generated from the D1 receptor sequence that contained these amino acids, leading to a switch in G-protein affinities and loss of calcium signaling, resulting in the inhibition of D1-D2 heteromer function. The use of the D1-D2 heteromer-disrupting peptide in vivo revealed a pathophysiological role for the D1-D2 heteromer in the modulation of behavioral despair. This peptide may represent a novel pharmacological tool with potential therapeutic benefits in depression treatment.—Hasbi, A., Perreault, M. L., Shen, M. Y.

https://openalex.org/W2030210530,"Selenoproteins are unique as they contain selenium in their active site in the form of the 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), which is encoded by an in-frame UGA stop codon. Sec incorporation requires both cis- and trans-acting factors, which are known to be sufficient for Sec incorporation in vitro, albeit with low efficiency. However, the abundance of the naturally occurring selenoprotein that contains 10 Sec residues (SEPP1) suggests that processive and efficient Sec incorporation occurs in vivo. Here, we set out to study native SEPP1 synthesis in vitro to identify factors that regulate processivity and efficiency. Deletion analysis of the long and conserved 3'-UTR has revealed that the incorporation of multiple Sec residues is inherently processive requiring only the SECIS elements but surprisingly responsive to the selenium concentration. We provide evidence that processive Sec incorporation is linked to selenium utilization and that reconstitution of known Sec incorporation factors in a wheat germ lysate does not permit multiple Sec incorporation events, thus suggesting a role for yet unidentified mammalian-specific processes or factors. The relationship between our findings and the channeling theory of translational efficiency is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2034899234,"Signal sequence-encoding mRNAs undergo translation-dependent localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and at the ER are anchored via translation on Sec61-bound ribosomes. Recent investigations into the composition and membrane association characteristics of ER-associated mRNAs have, however, revealed both ribosome-dependent (indirect) and ribosome-independent (direct) modes of mRNA association with the ER. These findings raise important questions regarding our understanding of how mRNAs are selected, localized, and anchored to the ER. Using semi-intact tissue culture cells, we performed a polysome solubilization screen and identified conditions that distinguish polysomes engaged in the translation of distinct cohorts of mRNAs. To gain insight into the molecular basis of direct mRNA anchoring to the ER, we performed RNA-protein UV photocross-linking studies in rough microsomes and demonstrate that numerous ER integral membrane proteins display RNA binding activity. Quantitative proteomic analyses of HeLa cytosolic and ER-bound polysome fractions identified translocon components as selective polysome-interacting proteins. Notably, the Sec61 complex was highly enriched in polysomes engaged in the translation of endomembrane organelle proteins, whereas translocon accessory proteins, such as ribophorin I, were present in all subpopulations of ER-associated polysomes. Analyses of the protein composition of oligo(dT)-selected UV photocross-linked ER protein-RNA adducts identified Sec61α,β and ribophorin I as ER-poly(A) mRNA-binding proteins, suggesting unexpected roles for the protein translocation and modification machinery in mRNA anchoring to the ER. In summary, we propose that multiple mechanisms of mRNA and ribosome association with ER operate to enable an mRNA transcriptome-wide function for the ER in protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2053578467,"Although targeting the V600E activating mutation in the BRAF gene, the most common genetic abnormality in melanoma, has shown clinical efficacy in melanoma patients, response is, invariably, short lived. To better understand mechanisms underlying this acquisition of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy in previously responsive melanomas, we induced vemurafenib resistance in two V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cell lines, A375 and DM443, by serial in vitro vemurafenib exposure. The resulting approximately 10-fold more vemurafenib-resistant cell lines, A375rVem and D443rVem, had higher growth rates and showed differential collateral resistance to cisplatin, melphalan, and temozolomide. The acquisition of vemurafenib resistance was associated with significantly increased NRAS levels in A375rVem and D443rVem, increased activation of the prosurvival protein, AKT, and the MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and P38, which correlated with decreased levels of the MAPK inhibitor protein, GSTP1. Despite the increased NRAS, whole exome sequencing showed no NRAS gene mutations. Inhibition of all three MAPKs and siRNA-mediated NRAS suppression both reversed vemurafenib resistance significantly in A375rVem and DM443rVem. Together, the results indicate a mechanism of acquired vemurafenib resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cells that involves increased activation of all three human MAPKs and the PI3K pathway, as well as increased NRAS expression, which, contrary to previous reports, was not associated with mutations in the NRAS gene. The data highlight the complexity of the acquired vemurafenib resistance phenotype and the challenge of optimizing BRAF-targeted therapy in this disease. They also suggest that targeting the MAPKs and/or NRAS may provide a strategy to mitigate such resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma. Although targeting the V600E activating mutation in the BRAF gene, the most common genetic abnormality in melanoma, has shown clinical efficacy in melanoma patients, response is, invariably, short lived. To better understand mechanisms underlying this acquisition of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy in previously responsive melanomas, we induced vemurafenib resistance in two V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cell lines, A375 and DM443, by serial in vitro vemurafenib exposure. The resulting approximately 10-fold more vemurafenib-resistant cell lines, A375rVem and D443rVem, had higher growth rates and showed differential collateral resistance to cisplatin, melphalan, and temozolomide. The acquisition of vemurafenib resistance was associated with significantly increased NRAS levels in A375rVem and D443rVem, increased activation of the prosurvival protein, AKT, and the MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and P38, which correlated with decreased levels of the MAPK inhibitor protein, GSTP1. Despite the increased NRAS, whole exome sequencing showed no NRAS gene mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2053003380,"Background Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61) may be involved in tumor proliferation and invasion. In earlier studies, we demonstrated increased insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is associated with breast tumor formation and poor clinical outcomes. In our current study we have investigated IGF-1 regulation of Cyr61 and whether targeting IGF-1 could inhibit Cyr61 induced tumor growth and proliferation. Methods Several ATCC derived normal and breast cancer cell lines were used in this study: MDA-MB231, BT474, MCF-7, and SKBR3. We also tested cells stably transfected in our laboratory with active Akt1 (pAkt; SKBR3/AA and MCF-7/AA) and dominant negative Akt1 (SKBR3/DN and MCF-7/DN). In addition, we used MCF-7 cells transfected with full length Cyr61 (CYA). Monolayer cultures treated with IGF-1 were analyzed for Cyr61 expression by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Migration assays and MTT based proliferation assays were used to determine invasive characteristics in response to IGF-1/Cyr61 activation. Results Cells with activated Akt have increased levels of Cyr61. Conversely, cells with inactive Akt have decreased levels of Cyr61. IGF-1 treatment increased Cyr61 expression significantly and cells with high level of Cyr61 demonstrate increased invasiveness and proliferation. Cyr61 overexpression and activation led to decrease in E-cadherin and decrease in FOXO1. Inhibition of the PI3K and MAPK pathways resulted in significant decrease in invasiveness and proliferation, most notably in the PI3K pathway inhibited cells. Conclusion The findings of this study show that IGF-1 upregulates Cyr61 primarily through activation of the Akt-PI3K pathway. IGF-1 induced MAPK plays a partial role. Increase in Cyr61 leads to increase in breast cancer cell growth and invasion. Hence, targeting Cyr61 and associated pathways may offer an opportunity to inhibit IGF-1 mediated Cyr61 induced breast cancer growth and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2120957446,"The two major intracellular protein degradation systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, work collaboratively in many biological processes including development, apoptosis, aging, and countering oxidative injuries. We report here that, in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), ARPE-19 cells, proteasome inhibitors, clasto-lactacystinβ-lactone (LA) or epoxomicin (Epo), at non-lethal doses, increased the protein levels of autophagy-specific genes Atg5 and Atg7 and enhanced the conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3) from LC3-I to its lipidative form, LC3-II, which was enhanced by co-addition of the saturated concentration of Bafilomycin A1 (Baf). Detection of co-localization for LC3 staining and labeled-lysosome further confirmed autophagic flux induced by LA or Epo. LA or Epo reduced the phosphorylation of the protein kinase B (Akt), a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in ARPE-19 cells; by contrast, the induced changes of autophagy substrate, p62, showed biphasic pattern. The autophagy inhibitor, Baf, attenuated the reduction in oxidative injury conferred by treatment with low doses of LA and Epo in ARPE-19 cells exposed to menadione (VK3) or 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Knockdown of Atg7 with siRNA in ARPE-19 cells reduced the protective effects of LA or Epo against VK3. Overall, our results suggest that treatment with low levels of proteasome inhibitors confers resistance to oxidative injury by a pathway involving inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and activation of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2017302400,"Introduction Celiac disease (CD) may initially present as a neurological disorder or may be complicated by neurological changes. To date, neurophysiological studies aiming to an objective evaluation of the potential central nervous system involvement in CD are lacking. Objective To assess the profile of cortical excitability to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in a group of de novo CD patients. Materials and methods Twenty CD patients underwent a screening for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms by means of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, respectively. Instrumental exams, including electroencephalography and brain computed tomography, were also performed. Cortico-spinal excitability was assessed by means of single and paired-pulse TMS using the first dorsal interosseus muscle of the dominant hand. TMS measures consisted of resting motor threshold, motor evoked potentials, cortical silent period (CSP), intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF). None of the CD was on gluten-free diet. A group of 20 age-matched healthy controls was used for comparisons. Results CD showed a significantly shorter CSP (78.0 vs 125.0 ms, p<0.025), a reduced ICI (0.3 vs 0.2, p<0.045) and an enhanced ICF (1.1 vs 0.7, p<0.042) compared to controls. A dysthymic disorder was identified in five patients. The effect size between dysthymic and non-dysthymic CD patients indicated a low probability of interference with the CSP (Cohen's d -0.414), ICI (-0.278) and ICF (-0.292) measurements. Conclusion A pattern of cortical excitability characterized by “disinhibition” and “hyperfacilitation” was found in CD patients. Immune system dysregulation might play a central role in triggering changes of the motor cortex excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2014255710,"There are indications that livestock-associated MRSA CC398 has a reduced human-to-human transmissibility, limiting its impact on public health and justifying modified control measures. This study determined the transmissibility of MRSA CC398 from livestock veterinarians to their household members in the community as compared to MRSA non-CC398 strains. A one-year prospective cohort study was performed to determine the presence of MRSA CC398 in four-monthly nasal and oropharyngeal samples of livestock veterinarians (n = 137) and their household members (n = 389). In addition, a cross-sectional survey was performed to detect the presence of MRSA non-CC398 in hospital derived control patients (n = 20) and their household members (n = 41). Staphylococcus aureus isolates were genotyped by staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Mean MRSA CC398 prevalence over the study period was 44% (range 41.6–46.0%) in veterinarians and 4.0% (range 2.8–4.7%) in their household members. The MRSA CC398 prevalence in household members of veterinarians was significantly lower than the MRSA non-CC398 prevalence in household members of control patients (PRR 6.0; 95% CI 2.4–15.5), indicating the reduced transmissibility of MRSA CC398. The impact of MRSA CC398 appears to be low at the moment. However, careful monitoring of the human-to-human transmissibility of MRSA CC398 remains important."

https://openalex.org/W2071563666,"The dopamine transporter (DAT) belongs to the family of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters and controls dopamine (DA) homeostasis by mediating Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent reuptake of DA. Here we used two-electrode voltage clamp measurements in Xenopus oocytes together with targeted mutagenesis to investigate the mechanistic relationship between DAT ion binding sites and transporter conductances. In Li(+), DAT displayed a cocaine-sensitive cation leak current ∼10-fold larger than the substrate-induced current in Na(+). Mutation of Na(+) coordinating residues in the first (Na1) and second (Na2) binding sites suggested that the Li(+) leak depends on Li(+) interaction with Na2 rather than Na1. DA caused a marked inhibition of the Li(+) leak, consistent with the ability of the substrate to interact with the Li(+)-occupied state of the transporter. The leak current in Li(+) was also potently inhibited by low millimolar concentrations of Na(+), which according to our mutational data conceivably depended on high affinity binding to Na1. The Li(+) leak was further regulated by Cl(-) that most likely increases Li(+) permeation by allosterically lowering Na2 affinity. Interestingly, mutational lowering of Na2 affinity by substituting Asp-420 with asparagine dramatically increased cation permeability in Na(+) to a level higher than seen in Li(+). In addition to reveal a functional link between the bound Cl(-) and the cation bound in the Na2 site, the data support a key role of Na2 in determining cation permeability of the transporter and thereby possibly in regulating the opening probability of the inner gate."

One feature that distinguishes ToxB from other host-selective toxins is that it has naturally occurring homologs in non-pathogenic P. tritici-repentis isolates that lack toxic activity. There are no high-resolution structures for any of the ToxB homologs, or for any protein with >30% sequence identity, and therefore what underlies activity remains an open question. Here, we present the NMR structures of ToxB and its inactive homolog Ptr toxb. Both proteins adopt a β-sandwich fold comprising three strands in each half that are bridged together by two disulfide bonds. The inactive toxb, however, shows higher flexibility localized to the sequence-divergent β-sandwich half. The absence of toxic activity is attributed to a more open structure in the vicinity of one disulfide bond, higher flexibility, and residue differences in an exposed loop that likely impacts interaction with putative targets. We propose that activity is regulated by perturbations in a putative active site loop and changes in dynamics distant from the site of activity. Interestingly, the new structures identify AvrPiz-t, a secreted avirulence protein produced by the rice blast fungus, as a structural homolog to ToxB.

https://openalex.org/W2048589777,"Botanicals are rich in bioactive compounds, and some offer numerous beneficial effects to animal and human health when consumed. It is well known that phytochemicals in cranberries have anti-oxidative and antimicrobial activities. Recently, an increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that cranberry phytochemicals may have potential benefits that promote healthy aging. Here, we use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to show that water-soluble cranberry extract standardized to 4.0% proanthocyanidins (WCESP), a major component of cranberries, can enhance host innate immunity to resist against Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae; wild type C6706 (O1 El Tor biotype)) infection. Supplementation of WCESP did not significantly alter the intestinal colonization of V. cholerae, but upregulated the expression of C. elegans innate immune genes, such as clec-46, clec-71, fmo-2, pqn-5 and C23G10.1. Additionally, WCESP treatment did not affect the growth of V. cholerae and expression of the major bacterial virulence genes, and only slightly reduced bacterial colonization within C. elegans intestine. These findings indicate that the major components of WCESP, including proanthocyanidins (PACs), may play an important role in enhancing the host innate immunity. Moreover, we engaged C. elegans mutants and identified that the p38 MAPK signaling, insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), and HSF-1 play pivotal roles in the WCESP-mediated host immune response. Considering the level of conservation between the innate immune pathways of C. elegans and humans, the results of this study suggest that WCESP may also play an immunity-promoting role in higher order organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2070876945,"Somatic activation of the KRAS proto-oncogene is evident in almost all pancreatic cancers, and appears to represent an initiating event. These mutations occur primarily at codon 12 and less frequently at codons 13 and 61. Although some studies have suggested that different KRAS mutations may have variable oncogenic properties, to date there has been no comprehensive functional comparison of multiple KRAS mutations in an in vivo vertebrate tumorigenesis system. We generated a Gal4/UAS-based zebrafish model of pancreatic tumorigenesis in which the pancreatic expression of UAS-regulated oncogenes is driven by a ptf1a:Gal4-VP16 driver line. This system allowed us to rapidly compare the ability of 12 different KRAS mutations (G12A, G12C, G12D, G12F, G12R, G12S, G12V, G13C, G13D, Q61L, Q61R and A146T) to drive pancreatic tumorigenesis in vivo. Among fish injected with one of five KRAS mutations reported in other tumor types but not in human pancreatic cancer, 2/79 (2.5%) developed pancreatic tumors, with both tumors arising in fish injected with A146T. In contrast, among fish injected with one of seven KRAS mutations known to occur in human pancreatic cancer, 22/106 (20.8%) developed pancreatic cancer. All eight tumorigenic KRAS mutations were associated with downstream MAPK/ERK pathway activation in preneoplastic pancreatic epithelium, whereas nontumorigenic mutations were not. These results suggest that the spectrum of KRAS mutations observed in human pancreatic cancer reflects selection based on variable tumorigenic capacities, including the ability to activate MAPK/ERK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2022028342,"Across animal species, offspring of closely related mates exhibit lower fitness, a phenomenon called inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression in humans is less well understood because mating between close relatives is generally rare and stigmatised, confounding investigation of its effect on fitness-relevant traits. Recently, the availability of high-density genotype data has enabled quantification of variation in distant inbreeding in 'outbred' human populations, but the low variance of inbreeding detected from genetic data in most outbred populations means large samples are required to test effects, and only a few traits have yet been studied. However, it is likely that isolated populations, or those with a small effective population size, have higher variation in inbreeding and therefore require smaller sample sizes to detect inbreeding effects. With a small effective population size and low immigration, Northern Finland is such a population. We make use of a sample of ∼5,500 'unrelated' individuals in the Northern Finnish Birth Cohort 1966 with known genotypes and measured phenotypes across a range of fitness-relevant physical and psychological traits, including birth length and adult height, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, heart rate, grip strength, educational attainment, income, marital status, handedness, health, and schizotypal features. We find significant associations in the predicted direction between individuals' inbreeding coefficient (measured by proportion of the genome in runs of homozygosity) and eight of the 18 traits investigated, significantly more than the one or two expected by chance. These results are consistent with inbreeding depression effects on a range of human traits, but further research is needed to replicate and test alternative explanations for these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2069832037,"Tomosyn negatively regulates SNARE-dependent exocytic pathways including insulin secretion, GLUT4 exocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The molecular mechanism of tomosyn, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here, we reconstituted SNARE-dependent fusion reactions in vitro to recapitulate the tomosyn-regulated exocytic pathways. We then expressed and purified active full-length tomosyn and examined how it regulates the reconstituted SNARE-dependent fusion reactions. Using these defined fusion assays, we demonstrated that tomosyn negatively regulates SNARE-mediated membrane fusion by inhibiting the assembly of the ternary SNARE complex. Tomosyn recognizes the t-SNARE complex and prevents its pairing with the v-SNARE, therefore arresting the fusion reaction at a pre-docking stage. The inhibitory function of tomosyn is mediated by its C-terminal domain (CTD) that contains an R-SNARE-like motif, confirming previous studies carried out using truncated tomosyn fragments. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of tomosyn is critical (but not sufficient) to the binding of tomosyn to the syntaxin monomer, indicating that full-length tomosyn possesses unique features not found in the widely studied CTD fragment. Finally, we showed that the inhibitory function of tomosyn is dominant over the stimulatory activity of the Sec1/Munc18 protein in fusion. We suggest that tomosyn uses its CTD to arrest SNARE-dependent fusion reactions, whereas its NTD is required for the recruitment of tomosyn to vesicle fusion sites through syntaxin interaction.

In particular, exocytosis plays crucial roles in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis in mammals. In response to elevated blood glucose levels (e.g. after a meal), the peptide hormone insulin is released from pancreatic beta cells through exocytosis. Insulin is then transported by the bloodstream to reach its target tissues including muscles and adipocytes (17.Eliasson L. Abdulkader F. Braun M. Galvanovskis J. Hoppa M.B. Rorsman P.

Another widely studied exocytic pathway is the release of neurotransmitters at chemical synapses, which serves the major form of cell-cell communication in the brain (3.Rizo J. Südhof T.C.

The neurotransmitter release requires the t-SNAREs syntaxin-1/SNAP-25 and the v-SNARE VAMP2. In addition to SNAREs, exocytosis also requires a group of SNARE-binding regulatory factors that control the temporal and spatial precision of the vesicle fusion reaction. One such regulatory factor is tomosyn, a 120–130-kDa protein that negatively regulates SNARE-dependent exocytosis (28.Widberg C.H. Bryant N.J. Girotti M. Rea S. James D.E.

It remains incompletely understood how tomosyn regulates SNARE-dependent exocytosis. Previous biochemical studies of tomosyn were performed mostly in static solution binding assays using truncated proteins. These truncated proteins, however, cannot recapitulate the physiological function of full-length (FL) tomosyn in exocytosis (44.Yizhar O. Lipstein N. Gladycheva S.E. Matti U. Ernst S.A. Rettig J.

Klosterman S.M. Shtessel L. Ahmed S. Richmond J.E. In vivo analysis of conserved C. elegans tomosyn domains.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26185Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed and purified active FL tomosyn and examined its molecular mechanism of action in reconstituted systems that recapitulate the vesicle fusion reactions of insulin secretion, GLUT4 exocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. We demonstrated that tomosyn negatively regulates SNARE-mediated membrane fusion by inhibiting the assembly of the ternary SNARE complex. Tomosyn recognizes the t-SNARE complex and prevents its pairing with v-SNARE, therefore arresting the fusion reaction at a pre-docking stage. The inhibitory function of tomosyn is dominant over the stimulatory activity of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein. The inhibitory function of tomosyn is mediated by its CTD that contains an R-SNARE-liked motif, confirming previous studies carried out using truncated fragments of tomosyn. Interestingly, the NTD of tomosyn is required (although not sufficient) for the binding of tomosyn to the syntaxin monomer, indicating that FL tomosyn presents unique features not found in the widely studied CTD fragment. These findings suggest that tomosyn uses its CTD to arrest SNARE-dependent membrane fusion, whereas the NTD is required for the recruitment of tomosyn to vesicle fusion sites through syntaxin interaction. Recombinant t- and v-SNARE proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The t-SNARE complexes, comprised of untagged syntaxin-4 and His6-tagged SNAP-23 or untagged syntaxin-1 and His6-tagged SNAP-25, were expressed as previously described (46.Shen J. Tareste D.C.

SNAREs were stored in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 400 mm KCl, 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Human tomosyn-1 gene (ATCC) was subcloned into a baculovirus transfer vector pFastBacMBP to generate a construct encoding a His6-MBP-tomosyn fusion protein separated by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The fusion protein was expressed in Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instruction (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System, Invitrogen). Briefly, recombinant Bacmid DNA was obtained by transforming the pFastBacMBP-tomosyn construct into DH10Bac cells. The Bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells grown at 27 °C in Sf900-III serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses were harvested 4 days after transfection and further amplified twice to obtain viral stocks with the desired titer. At the density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant virus at multiplicity of infection of 1. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection and cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. Tomosyn proteins were purified by both the nickel and amylose affinity chromatography. The His6-MBP tags were removed from tomosyn proteins by tobacco etch virus protease and the proteins were subsequently dialyzed overnight against a storage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol and 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). The NTD of tomosyn (amino acids 1–1010) was expressed and purified in insect cells in a similar way as the FL protein. The CTD of tomosyn (amino acids 1011–1115) was expressed and purified using a procedure we previously described for Munc18-1 (46.Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J.

Complete detergent removal was achieved by overnight dialysis of the samples in Novagen dialysis tubes against the reconstitution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT). To prepare sulforhodamine-loaded liposomes, t- or v-SNARE liposomes were reconstituted in the presence of 50 mm sulforhodamine B (Sigma). Free sulforhodamine B was removed by overnight dialysis followed by liposome flotation on a Nycodenz gradient. The protein:lipid ratio was 1:200 for v-SNAREs and 1:500 for t-SNARE liposomes. To ensure the consistency in SNARE liposome preparations, we routinely monitored the sizes and morphologies of reconstituted liposomes using dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. A standard lipid mixing reaction contained 45 μl of unlabeled t-SNARE liposomes and 5 μl of v-SNARE liposomes labeled with NBD and rhodamine, and was conducted in a 96-well Nunc plate at 37 °C. Prior to fusion, NBD emission from the v-SNARE liposomes was quenched by neighboring rhodamine molecules through FRET. After fusion, the NBD dyes were diluted such that their emission was dequenched. Increase in NBD fluorescence at 538 nm (excitation 460 nm) was measured every 2 min in a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader. At the end of the reaction, 10 μl of 10% CHAPSO was added to the liposomes. Fusion data were presented as the percentage of maximum fluorescence change. To assess their regulatory activities, 5 μm tomosyn was added to the fusion reaction. The maximum fusion rate within the first 10 min of the reaction was used to represent the initial rate of a fusion reaction. Full accounting of statistical significance was included for each figure based on at least three independent experiments. For content mixing assays, unlabeled t-SNARE liposomes were directed to fuse with sulforhodamine B-loaded v-SNARE liposomes in which the sulforhodamine B fluorescence was inhibited by self-quenching. The fusion of the liposomes led to the mixing of their contents and the dequenching of sulforhodamine B fluorescence. The increase of sulforhodamine B fluorescence at 585 nm (excitation 565 nm) was measured every 2 min. Full accounting of statistical significance was included for each figure based on at least three independent experiments.

After 1 h, an equal volume of 80% Nycodenz (w/v) in reconstitution buffer was added and transferred to 5 × 41-mm centrifuge tubes. The liposomes were overlaid with 200 μl each of 35 and 30% Nycodenz, and then with 20 μl of reconstitution buffer on the top. The gradients were centrifuged for 4 h at 52,000 × g in a Beckman SW55 rotor. Samples were collected from the 0–30% Nycodenz interface (2 × 20 μl) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The t-SNARE liposomes were prepared in a similar way as in the liposome fusion assay except that 2% biotin-conjugated 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine lipid was included. The biotin-labeled t-SNARE liposomes were incubated with avidin-conjugated agarose beads at room temperature for 1 h. The bead-bound t-SNARE liposomes were then used to pull down rhodamine-labeled v-SNARE liposomes. The rhodamine-labeled v-SNARE liposomes were identical to the v-SNARE liposomes used in lipid mixing assays. The pull-down reactions were performed in the liposome reconstitution buffer at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 5 μm tomosyn. After washing three times with the reconstitution buffer, 1% CHAPSO was added to solubilize the bead-bound liposomes. The avidin beads were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 2 min. Rhodamine fluorescence in the supernatant was measured in a BioTek microplate reader. In the negative control reaction, 20 μm VAMP2 CD was added to prevent the assembly of the ternary SNARE complex. CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter equipped with a 1-mm quartz cell. The readings were made at 0.1-nm intervals, and each data point represents the average of six scans at a speed of 50 nm/min over the wavelength range of 198 to 250 nm. The data were converted into mean residue weighted molar ellipticity using the following equation: [θ]MRW = 100 θ/Cnl, where C is the protein concentration (mm), θ is the measured ellipticity (milli"

https://openalex.org/W2085380764,"Osteosarcoma is the most prevalent primary pediatric cancer-related bone disease. These tumors frequently develop resistance to chemotherapy and are highly metastatic, leading to poor outcome. Thus, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies that can prevent cell dissemination. We previously showed that CYR61/CCN1 expression in osteosarcoma cells is correlated to aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo in mouse models, as well as in patients. In this study, we found that CYR61 is a critical contributor to the vascularization of primary tumor. We demonstrate that silencing CYR61, using lentiviral transduction, leads to a significant reduction in expression level of pro-angiogenic markers such as VEGF, FGF2, PECAM and angiopoietins concomitantly to an increased expression of major anti-angiogenic markers such as thrombospondin-1 and SPARC. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 family member expression, a key pathway in osteosarcoma metastatic capacity was also downregulated when CYR61 was downregulated in osteosarcoma cells. Using a metastatic murine model, we show that CYR61 silencing in osteosarcoma cells results in reduced tumor vasculature and slows tumor growth compared with control. We also find that microvessel density correlates with lung metastasis occurrence and that CYR61 silencing in osteosarcoma cells limits the number of metastases. Taken together, our data indicate that CYR61 silencing can blunt the malignant behavior of osteosarcoma tumor cells by limiting primary tumor growth and dissemination process."
https://openalex.org/W2061539579,"Metabotropic glutamate 1 (mGlu) receptor has been proposed as a target for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Studies have demonstrated that inhibiting the release of glutamate (the natural ligand of mGlu1 receptors), results in a decrease of melanoma tumor growth in mGlu1 receptor-expressing melanomas. Here we demonstrate that mGlu1 receptors, which have been previously characterized as oncogenes, also behave like dependence receptors by creating a dependence on glutamate for sustained cell viability. In the mGlu1 receptor-expressing melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-2 (SK2) and SK-MEL-5 (SK5), we show that glutamate is both necessary and sufficient to maintain cell viability, regardless of underlying genetic mutations. Addition of glutamate increased DNA synthesis, whereas removal of glutamate not only suppressed DNA synthesis but also promoted cell death in SK2 and SK5 melanoma cells. Using genetic and pharmacological inhibitors, we established that this effect of glutamate is mediated by the activation of mGlu1 receptors. The stimulatory potential of mGlu1 receptors was further confirmed in vivo in a melanoma cell xenograft model. In this model, subcutaneous injection of SK5 cells with short hairpin RNA-targeted downregulation of mGlu1 receptors resulted in a decrease in the rate of tumor growth relative to control. We also demonstrate for the first time that a selective mGlu1 receptor antagonist JNJ16259685 ((3,4-Dihydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-b]quinolin-7-yl)-(cis-4-methoxycyclohexyl)-methanone) slows SK2 and SK5 melanoma tumor growth in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2054542208,"The PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits, components of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza A virus, are essential for viral transcription and replication. The PB2 subunit binds to the host RNA cap (7-methylguanosine triphosphate (m7GTP)) and supports the endonuclease activity of PA to “snatch” the cap from host pre-mRNAs. However, the structure of PB2 is not fully understood, and the functional sites remain unknown. In this study, we describe a novel Val/Arg/Gly (VRG) site in the PB2 cap-binding domain, which is involved in interaction with acetyl-CoA found in eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases (HATs). In vitro experiments revealed that the recombinant PB2 cap-binding domain that includes the VRG site interacts with acetyl-CoA; moreover, it was found that this interaction could be blocked by CoA and various HAT inhibitors. Interestingly, m7GTP also inhibited this interaction, suggesting that the same active pocket is capable of interacting with acetyl-CoA and m7GTP. To elucidate the importance of the VRG site on PB2 function and viral replication, we constructed a PB2 recombinant protein and recombinant viruses including several patterns of amino acid mutations in the VRG site. Substitutions of the valine and arginine residues or of all 3 residues of the VRG site to alanine significantly reduced the binding ability of PB2 to acetyl-CoA and its RNA polymerase activity.

The avian H5N1 influenza A virus was reported to show stronger virulence to human by single amino acid substitutions in PB2 and hemagglutinin (2.Hatta M. Gao P. Halfmann P. Kawaoka Y. Molecular basis for high virulence of Hong Kong H5N1 influenza A viruses.Science. 2001; 293: 1840-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), and new strains of this virus, such as the swine-originating A/H1N1 in 2009 and the avian-originating A/H7N9 in 2013, had since emerged serially (1.Neumann G. Noda T. Kawaoka Y. Emergence and pandemic potential of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus.Nature. 2009; 459: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar, 3.Gao R. Cao B. Hu Y. Feng Z. Wang D.

Med. 2013; 368: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). To combat the influenza A virus, zanamivir and oseltamivir, which inhibit neuraminidase activity, are widely used as antiviral drugs (4.Hayden F.G. Atmar R.L. Schilling M. Johnson C. Poretz D. Paar D. Huson L. Ward P. Mills R.G. Use of the selective oral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir to prevent influenza.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1336-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). However, because the viral neuraminidase gene mutates easily, many strains, including A/H1N1 and A/H7N9, were found to be resistant to these drugs soon after their first discovery (5.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Oseltamivir-resistant novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in two immunosuppressed patients - Seattle, Washington, 2009.MMWR Morb.

In addition, oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed anti-influenza medication, was reported to stimulate behavioral activities in adolescents (7.Maxwell S.R. Tamiflu and neuropsychiatric disturbance in adolescents.BMJ. 2007; 334: 1232-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and we recently suggested that the inactive prodrug of oseltamivir (oseltamivir ethyl ester) inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidase A, and this side effect produced the stimulant effect (8.Hiasa M.

In particular, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 2The abbreviations used are: RdRpRNA-dependent RNA polymeraseHAThistone acetyltransferaseDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyTPCKl-(tosylamido-2-phenyl)ethyl chloromethyl ketoneNPnucleoproteinRNPribonucleoproteinqRTquantitative RTPDBProtein Data BankvRNAviral RNA. which contains the PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits (9.Furuta Y.

The structure and function of the viral PB2 subunit has been well studied: its N-terminal region plays an essential role in viral RNA replication (16.Gastaminza P. Perales B. Falcón A.M. Ortín J.

Transcription factor IIB acetylates itself to regulate transcription.Nature. 2003; 424: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA not only supplies its acetyl group to proteins, but, in doing so, also modifies the function of the target proteins. RNA polymerase II transcription is stimulated by acetyl-CoA in the absence of histones, and transcriptional stimulation results from increased affinity of the transcriptional factor IID for the DNA promoter (38.Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe De Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Acetyl coenzyme A stimulates RNA polymerase II transcription and promoter binding by transcription factor IID in the absence of histones.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, acetyl-CoA was also reported to bind to bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and modulate its enzymatic activity (39.McAlister L.E. Evans E.L. Smith T.E. Properties of a mutant Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase deficient in coregulation by intermediary metabolites.J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 200-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that acetyl-CoA can interact with various types of proteins and act as a cofactor that affects protein function. Notably, the specific amino acid sequence required for acetyl-CoA binding to the eukaryotic GCN5 protein, a histone acetyltransferase (HATs), has also recently been identified (40.Lin Y. Fletcher C.M. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Wagner G. Solution structure of the catalytic domain of GCN5 histone acetyltransferase bound to coenzyme A.Nature. 1999; 400: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41.Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J.

Here, we found that the Val/Arg/Gly (VRG) site required for acetyl-CoA interaction with eukaryotic HATs was also conserved in the viral PB2 subunit cap-binding domain. We also performed a series of biochemical experiments that demonstrate the interaction with acetyl-CoA in this domain. Amino acid mutations in the VRG site eliminated the interaction with acetyl-CoA, decreased RNA polymerase activity of viral RdRp, and inhibited viral growth. This is the first report to identify a new PB2 subunit functional site that is required for replication of the influenza virus. Tertiary structures similar to the PB2 cap-binding domain (PDB code 2vqz) were screened in a three-dimensional protein structure library using the online Markovian Transition of Structure (MATRAS) evolution program (42.Kawabata T. MATRAS: a program for protein 3D structure comparison.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3367-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The new region in the recombinant protein was from amino acids 322 to 783, which covers the cap-binding domain (GenBankTM Accession number AAO46493) of the PB2 polymerase subunit (influenza A virus (A/Hong Kong/16/1968(H3N2))). Wild-type or mutated PB2 cap-binding domain subunit was amplified by PCR using the primers listed below. To amplify mutant PB2 at each lysine residue or the VRG motif, an overlap extension method was performed for: PB2-WT-F, TTT TTT TGC TAG CTC CTT CAG TTT TGG CGG ATT C (the restriction site for NheI); PB2-WT-R, AAG GAT CCT TAC ATT TTG CTG ACT CTT ATC CCT C (the restriction site for BamHI); PB2-Mut-K331A-F, GCT AGC TCC TTC AGT TTT GGC GGA TTC ACA TTT GCG AGA ACA AGC GGG (the restriction site for NheI); PB2-Mut-K339A-OLE-F, GGG TCA TCA ATC GCG AGA GAG GAA GAA TTG; PB2-Mut-K339A-OLE-R, CGC GAT TGA TGA CCC GCT TGT TCT CTT AAA TGT GAA TCC GCC; PB2-Mut-K353A-OLE-F, CTC CAA ACA TTA GCA ATA AGG GTG CAT G; PB2-Mut-K353A-OLE-R, CAT GCA CCC TTA TTG CTA ATG TTT GGA G; PB2-Mut-K368A-OLE-F, ACA ATG GTG GGG GCA AGG GCA ACA GCT; PB2-Mut-K368A-OLE-R, GC TGT TGC CCT TGC CCC CAC CAT TGT; PB2-Mut-K376A-OLE-F, GCT ATA CTC AGA GCA GCA ACC AGG AGA TTG; PB2-Mut-K376A -OLE-R, CAA TCT CCT GGT TGC TGC TCT GAG TAT AGC; PB2-Mut-K412A-OLE-F, GAA GAT TGC ATG ATA GCA GCA GTT AGA GGT G; PB2-Mut-K412A-OLE-R, CAC CTC TAA CTG CTG CTA TCA TGC AAT CTT C; PB2-Mut-K440A-OLE-F, AGG CAT TTT CAG GCA GAT GCG AAA GTG; PB2-Mut-K440A-OLE-R, CAC TTT CGC ATC TGC CTG AAA ATG CCT; PB2-Mut-K443A-OLE-F, CAG AAA GAT GCG GCA GTG CTT TTT CAA; PB2-Mut-K443A -OLE-R, TTG AAA AAG CAC TGC CGC ATC TTT CTG; PB2-Mut-K482A-R, GGA TCC TTA CAT TGC GCT GAC TCT TAT CCC TCT C (the restriction site for BamHI); PB2-VRG-mut1-F, GCA TGA TAA AAG CAG CTA GAG GTG ATC TGA ATT TCG; PB2-VRG-mut1-R, GCT TTA AGT CTA GTG GAG ATC GAC GAA AAT AGT ACG; PB2-VRG-mut2-F, GCA TGA TAA AAG CAG TTG CAG GTG ATC TGA ATT TCG; PB2-VRG-mut2-R, CGA AAT TCA GAT CAC CTG CAA CTG CTT TTA TCA TGC; PB2-VRG-mut3-F, GCA TGA TAA AAG CAG TTA GAG CTG ATC TGA ATT TCG; PB2-VRG-mut3-R, CGA AAT TCA GAT CAG CTC TAA CTG CTT TTA TCA TGC; PB2-VRG-mut4-F, GCA TGA TAA AAG CAG CTG CAG GTG ATC TGA ATT TCG; PB2-VRG-mut4-R, CGA AAT TCA GAT CAC CTG CAG CTG CTT TTA TCA TGC; PB2-VRG-mut5-F, GCA TGA TAA AAG CAG TTG CAG CTG ATC TGA ATT TCG; PB2-VRG-mut5-R, CGA AAT TCA GAT CAG CTG CAA CTG CTT TTA TCA TGC; PB2-VRG-mut6-F, GCA TGA TAA AAG CAG CTA GAG CTG ATC TGA ATT TCG; PB2-VRG-mut6-R, CGA AAT TCA GAT CAG CTC TAG CTG CTT TTA TCA TGC; PB2-VRG-mut7-F, GCA TGA TAA AAG CAG CTG CAG CTG ATC TGA ATT TCG; PB2-VRG-mut7-R, CGA AAT TCA GAT CAG CTG CAG CTG CTT TTA TCA TGC. Each PCR product was ligated into the pET28a(+) vector (Novagen). This construct was then transformed into BL21-CodonPlus Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene). His6-tagged recombinant protein expression was induced by treatment with 0.32 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in TBG-M9 medium (0.8% Bacto-tryptone (BD Bioscience) and 0.4% NaCl), followed by purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). His6-tagged proteins were purified using a HiTrap carboxymethyl-FF column (GE Healthcare) and the ÄKTAprime plus system (GE Healthcare). The recombinant protein containing the PA N-terminal domain was produced as described previously (12.Kuzuhara T. Iwai Y. Takahashi H. Hatakeyama D. Echigo N.

The procedures used to perform this study were modified from a previous report (43.Kimura A. Horikoshi M. Tip60 acetylates six lysines of a specific class in core histones in vitro.Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recombinant PB2 cap-binding domain proteins (1 μg) were incubated with 18.5 kBq of [3H]acetyl-coenzyme A or [acetyl-3H]acetyl-coenzyme A (1.2 μm; 233 mCi/mmol; MT-896H, Moravek Biochemicals) or [14C]acetyl-CoA or [acetyl-1-14C]acetyl-coenzyme A (112 μm; 2 mCi/mmol; NEC-313, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm sodium butyrate. To measure the radioactivity of [3H], the reaction was filtered on a cation exchange filter (P81; Whatman). Filter papers were washed in a 0.2 m sodium carbonate solution (pH 9.2) twice for 30 min each, dried in a vacuum evaporator, and quantified in a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-6100; ALOKA). To detect 14C radioactivity, reactions were mixed with 2× SDS loading dye, boiled for 2 min, and separated in 14% SDS-PAGE gels, after which an imaging plate was exposed to such a gel for several days. Signals were detected using a fluoroimage analyzer (FLA-2000; Fuji Film). In the competitive binding experiment with m7GTP, 1 μg of recombinant PB2 cap-binding domain proteins was incubated with various concentrations of m7GTP for 30 min at 30 °C. Curcumin (Sigma), anacardic acid (Sigma), and garcinol (Enzo Life Sciences) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). CoA (Oriental Yeast), cap structure (7-methylguanosine 5′-diphosphate, m7GTP, Sigma), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (Sigma), and plumbagin (Tokyo Chemical Industry) were prepared in distilled water. These chemicals were mixed in the reaction solution prior to incubation, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C after the addition of 1 μg of recombinant PB2 cap-binding domain proteins. Cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were seeded and grown in each well of a 24-well plate. The cells were infected with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus at the multiplicity of infection of 0.001 in an infectious medium (DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 4 mm l-glutamine, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After infection, unbound viruses in the medium were removed and then the cells were treated with DMSO (0.5%), ribavirin (50 μm, WAKO), anacardic acid (50 μm), or garcinol (50 μm) in the infectious medium supplemented with 3 μg/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 24, 48, or 72 h, supernatants were collected from each well. Viral titers were determined using immunostaining (44.Takahashi E. Kataoka K. Indalao I.L. Konoha K. Fujii K. Chida J. Mizuno D. Fujihashi K. Kido H. Oral clarithromycin enhances airway immunoglobulin A (IgA) immunity through induction of IgA class switching recombination and B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family molecule on mucosal dendritic cells in mice infected with influenza A virus.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 10924-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatants were serially diluted and then added to the culture medium of MDCK cells. The cells were incubated with this mixture for 16 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (−) for 30 min at 4 °C and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. A mouse anti-influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) antibody (FluA-NP 4F1; Southern Biotech) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (SouthernBiotech) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. To visualize the infected cells, TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL, Inc.) was added, and color development was terminated after 15 min by washing with H2O. The stained cells were counted under a microscope, and then viral titers were calculated. Molecular modeling was performed using the Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE; Chemical Computing Group, Quebec, Canada). The x-ray crystallographic structure of the cap-binding domain of PB2 (PDB code 2vqz) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank. To prepare the enzyme for docking studies: (i) the ligand molecule was removed from the active site of the enzyme; (ii) hydrogen atoms were added to the structure using standard geometry; (iii) the structure was minimized using an MMFF94x force-field; (iv) MOE Alpha Site Finder was used for active site searches within the enzyme structure and dummy atoms were created from the obtained α spheres; and (v) the obtained model was then applied to the Dock program (Ryoka Systems Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The acetyl-CoA conformations were generated by a stochastic search in MOE and docking simulations with PB2 were undertaken for each of these conformations. The rescoring steps (1 and 2) were performed using the Affinity dG program with the retain parameter set at 30. Refinement was performed using the Forcefield program. One μg of the wild-type and mutant recombinant PB2 were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm sodium butyrate. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove the precipitate, immobilized γ-aminophenyl-m7GTP linked via a C10-spacer (AC-155, Jena Bioscience) was added to the supernatants and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. Samples of resins and supernatants were separated in 14% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The transcription level of purified ribonucleoprotein (RNP) was measured by primer extension. The procedures of primer extension analyses were performed as described previously (45.Vreede F.T.

https://openalex.org/W2061458330,"Trichosporon asahii is a yeast pathogen implicated in opportunistic infections. Cultures of an isolate collected from industrial wastewater were exposed for 2 days to 100 mg/L sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) and cadmium (CdCl2). Both metals reduced glutathione transferase (GST) activity but had no effect on superoxide dismutase or catalase. NaAsO2 exposure increased glutathione reductase activity while CdCl2 had no effect. Protein thiols were labeled with 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein followed by one dimensional electrophoresis which revealed extensive protein thiol oxidation in response to CdCl2 treatment but thiol reduction in response to NaAsO2. Two dimensional electrophoresis analyses showed that the intensity of some protein spots was enhanced on treatment as judged by SameSpots image analysis software. In addition, some spots showed decreased IAF fluorescence suggesting thiol oxidation. Selected spots were excised and tryptic digested for identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Twenty unique T. asahii proteins were identified of which the following proteins were up-regulated in response to NaAsO2: 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, phospholipase B, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, ATP synthase alpha chain, 20S proteasome beta-type subunit Pre3p and the hypothetical proteins A1Q1_08001, A1Q2_03020, A1Q1_06950, A1Q1_06913. In addition, the following showed decreased thiol-associated fluorescence consistent with thiol oxidation; aconitase; aldehyde reductase I; phosphoglycerate kinase; translation elongation factor 2; heat shock protein 70 and hypothetical protein A1Q2_04745. Some proteins showed both increase in abundance coupled with decrease in IAF fluorescence; 3-hydroxyisobutyryl- CoA hydrolase; homoserine dehydrogenase Hom6 and hypothetical proteins A1Q2_03020 and A1Q1_00754. Targets implicated in redox response included 10 unique metabolic enzymes, heat shock proteins, a component of the 20S proteasome and translation elongation factor 2. These data suggest extensive proteomic alterations in response to metal-induced oxidative stress in T. asahii. Amino acid metabolism, protein folding and degradation are principally affected."
https://openalex.org/W2003510160,"Background American adults consume 11.3% of total daily calories from foods and beverages from fast food restaurants. The contribution of different types of fast food restaurants to the diets of US children is unknown. Objective To estimate the consumption of energy, sodium, added sugars, and solid fats among US children ages 4–19 y by fast food restaurant type. Methods Analyses used the first 24-h recall for 12,378 children in the 2003–2010 cycles of the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003–2010). NHANES data identify foods by location of origin, including stores and fast food restaurants (FFR). A novel custom algorithm divided FFRs into 8 segments and assigned meals and snacks to each. These included burger, pizza, sandwich, Mexican, Asian, fish, and coffee/snack restaurants. The contribution of each restaurant type to intakes of energy and other dietary constituents was then assessed by age group (4–11 y and 12–19 y) and by race/ethnicity. Results Store-bought foods and beverages provided 64.8% of energy, 61.9% of sodium, 68.9% of added sugars, and 60.1% of solid fats. FFRs provided 14.1% of energy, 15.9% of sodium, 10.4% of added sugars and 17.9% of solid fats. Among FFR segments, burger restaurants provided 6.2% of total energy, 5.8% of sodium, 6.2% of added sugars, and 7.6% of solid fats. Less energy was provided by pizza (3.3%), sandwich (1.4%), Mexican (1.3%), and chicken restaurants (1.2%). Non-Hispanic black children obtained a greater proportion of their total energy (7.4%), sodium (7.1%), and solid fats (9.5%) from burger restaurants as compared to non-Hispanic white children (6.0% of energy, 5.5% of sodium, and 7.3% of solid fat). Conclusions These novel analyses, based on consumption data by fast food market segment, allow public health stakeholders to better monitor the effectiveness of industry efforts to promote healthier menu options."
https://openalex.org/W2093429954,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are implicated in a diverse range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as cholesterol and lipid transportation and multidrug resistance. Despite the considerable efforts made in understanding of the cellular function of ABC proteins, the regulation mechanism of this type of protein is still poorly defined. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel ATPase protein, protein associated with ABC transporters (PAAT), in humans. PAAT contains a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)-like domain and a signal for intramitochondrial sorting. We showed that PAAT is localized in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria and has an intrinsic ATPase activity. PAAT physically interacts with the 3 known mitochondrial inner membrane ABC proteins, ABCB7, ABCB8, and ABCB10, but not ABCB1, ABCB6, or ABCG2, and functionally regulates the transport of ferric nutrients and heme biosynthesis. Significantly, PAAT deficiency promotes cell death, reduces mitochondrial potential, and sensitizes mitochondria to oxidative stress-induced DNA damages. Our experiments revealed that PAAT is a novel ATPase and a trans-regulator of mitochondrial ABC transporters that plays an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and cell survival.—Yang, X., Yang, J., Li, L., Sun, L., Yi, X., Han, X., Si, W., Yan, R., Chen, Z., Xie, G., Li, W., Shang, Y., Liang, J., PAAT, a novel ATPase and trans-regulator of mitochondrial ABC transporters, is critically involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis"
https://openalex.org/W2205214010,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) signaling has been implicated in benign and malignant disorders including prostate cancer (PCa). To further explore the role of genetic alterations of GRM1 in PCa, we screened the entire human GRM1 gene including coding sequence, exon-intron junctions, and flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) for the presence of mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several PCa cell lines and matched tumor-normal tissues from Caucasian Americans (CAs) and African Americans (AAs). We used bidirectional sequencing, allele-specific PCR, and bioinformatics to identify the genetic changes in GRM1 and to predict their functional role. A novel missense mutation identified at C1744T (582 Pro > Ser) position of GRM1 gene in a primary AA-PCa cell line (E006AA) was predicted to affect the protein stability and functions. Another novel mutation identified at exon-intron junction of exon-8 in C4-2B cell line resulted in alteration of the GRM1 splicing donor site. In addition, we found missense SNP at T2977C (993 Ser > Pro) position and multiple non-coding mutations and SNPs in 3′-UTR of GRM1 gene in PCa cell lines and tissues. These novel mutations may contribute to the disease by alterations in GRM1 gene splicing, receptor activation, and post-receptor downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2007565785,"Cerebellar dysfunction causes ataxia characterized by loss of balance and coordination. Until now, the molecular and neuronal mechanisms of several types of inherited cerebellar ataxia have not been completely clarified. Here, we report that leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4/Gpr48) is highly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum. Deficiency of Lgr4 leads to an ataxia-like phenotype in mice. Histologically, no obvious morphological changes were observed in the cerebellum of Lgr4 mutant mice. However, the number of PCs was slightly but significantly reduced in Lgr4(-/-) mice. In addition, in vitro electrophysiological analysis showed an impaired long term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-PC (PF-PC) synapses in Lgr4(-/-) mice. Consistently, immunostaining experiments showed that the level of phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (Creb) was significantly decreased in Lgr4(-/-) PCs. Furthermore, treatment with forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase agonist, rescued phospho-Creb in PCs and reversed the impairment in PF-PC LTD in Lgr4(-/-) cerebellar slices, indicating that Lgr4 is an upstream regulator of Creb signaling, which is underlying PF-PC LTD. Together, our findings demonstrate for first time an important role for Lgr4 in motor coordination and cerebellar synaptic plasticity and provide a potential therapeutic target for certain types of inherited cerebellar ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2061361124,"The cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins are essential RING E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate apoptosis and inflammatory responses. cIAPs contain a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that binds ubiquitin and is implicated in the regulation of cell survival and proteasomal degradation. Here we show that mutation of the MGF and LL motifs in the UBA domain of cIAP1 caused unfolding and increased cIAP1 multimonoubiquitylation. By developing a UBA mutant that disrupted ubiquitin binding but not the structure of the UBA domain, we found that the UBA domain enhances cIAP1 and cIAP2 ubiquitylation. We demonstrate that the UBA domain binds to the UbcH5b∼Ub conjugate, and this promotes RING domain-dependent monoubiquitylation. This study establishes ubiquitin-binding modules, such as the UBA domain, as important regulatory modules that can fine tune the activity of E3 ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2094660094,"In peroxisomes, peroxins (PEXs) 3 and 19 are the principal protein components of the machinery required for early peroxisomal biogenesis. For further insight into the interaction of PEX3 and PEX19, we used hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to monitor conformational changes during complex formation between PEX3 and PEX19 in vitro. Our data showed that PEX19 remained highly flexible during interaction with PEX3. However, we could detect three changes, one each in the N-and C-terminus along with a small stretch in the middle of PEX19 (F64-L74) which became shielded from hydrogen exchange when interacting with PEX3. PEX3 became more protected from hydrogen exchange in the binding groove for PEX19 with only small changes elsewhere. Most likely the N-terminus of PEX19 initiates the binding to PEX3, and then subtle conformational changes in PEX3 affect the surface of the PEX3 molecule. PEX19 in turn, is stabilized by folding of a short helix and its C-terminal folding core permitting PEX19 to bind to PEX3 with higher affinity than just the N-terminal interaction allows. Thus within the cell, PEX3 is stabilized by PEX19 preventing PEX3 aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2029766654,"The THO complex participates during eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis in coupling transcription to formation and nuclear export of translation-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, THO has been defined as a heteropentamer composed of the Tho2p, Hpr1p, Tex1p, Mft1p, and Thp2p subunits and the overall three-dimensional shape of the complex has been established by negative stain electron microscopy. Here, we use small-angle X-ray scattering measured for isolated THO components (Mft1p and Thp2p) as well as THO subcomplexes (Mft1p-Thp2p and Mft1p-Thp2p-Tho2p) to construct structural building blocks that allow positioning of each subunit within the complex. To accomplish this, the individual envelopes determined for Mft1p and Thp2p are first fitted inside those of the Mft1p-Thp2p and Mft1p-Thp2p-Tho2p complexes. Next, the ternary complex structure is placed in the context of the five-component electron microscopy structure. Our model reveals not only the position of each protein in the THO complex relative to each other, but also shows that the pentamer is likely somewhat larger than what was observed by electron microscopy."
