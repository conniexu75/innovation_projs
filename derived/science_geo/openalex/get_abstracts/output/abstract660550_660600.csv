https://openalex.org/W3091484888,"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of upheaval for college students. The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with the increased levels of mental health burden among a sample of undergraduate college students in Northern New Jersey, the region of the U.S. severely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods College students (N = 162) enrolled in an introductory core curriculum course completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 information, behavior changes, academic and everyday difficulties, and mental health measurements (depression, anxiety, somatization, and stress). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results Descriptive findings indicate that students have a fundamental knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and common symptoms. Students tend to use and trust the official sources and have changed their behaviors in accordance with public health recommendations (i.e., increased hand washing, wearing mask). However, students reported a number of academic and everyday difficulties and high levels of mental health distress. High levels of depression were associated with difficulties in focusing on academic work and with employment losses, while higher levels of anxiety were more likely to be reported by students other than freshmen and those who spend more than one hour per day looking for information on COVID-19. Inability to focus on academic work and an elevated concern with COVID-19 were more likely to be associated with higher levels of somatization, while trusting news sources was associated with lower levels of somatization. Those with higher levels of perceived stress were more likely to be females, unable to focus on academic work, and report difficulties in obtaining medications and cleaning supplies. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic is making a significant negative impact on mental health of college students. Proactive efforts to support the mental health and well-being of students are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3017316599,"Doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches, fighting against a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one. However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu, may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3091410822,"Ecuador has been one of the most affected countries by the Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, by April 2020 this country presented the highest rates of mortality in Latin America. The purpose of the present study was to identify behaviors during confinement and sociodemographic variables associated with the mental health status of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients who were part of the epidemiological surveillance program in Ecuador that included mandatory confinement and self-isolation. A cross-sectional study was performed from March 22th to April 18th, 2020 using an online survey. The survey collected socio-demographic information and severity of depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and anxiety symptoms through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. A total of 759 patients completed the questionnaire, 20.3% presented moderate to severe symptoms of depression and 22.5% moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety. Being a woman and from the Coastal region were risk factors. Exercising, maintaining daily routines, and keeping informed about the COVID-19 but limiting to an hour was associated with better mental health. Regression analysis indicated that the mentioned behaviors explained approximately 17% of the variance for depression sum scores and 11.8% of the variance for anxiety sum scores while controlling for gender and region. Understanding the association between sociodemographic variables and psychological states in patients with COVID-19 is relevant to tackle future public mental health problems and to implement health policies that are intended to palliate further psychiatric complications. Promotion of modifiable behaviors such as exercising, maintaining daily routines, and keeping informed about the COVID-19 but limiting to less than an hour is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3091089105,"Optimizing the gene transformation factors can be considered as the first and foremost step in successful genetic engineering and genome editing studies. However, it is usually difficult to achieve an optimized gene transformation protocol due to the cost and time-consuming as well as the complexity of this process. Therefore, it is necessary to use a novel computational approach such as machine learning models for analyzing gene transformation data. In the current study, three individual machine learning models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) were developed for forecasting Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation in chrysanthemum based on eleven input variables including Agrobacterium strain, optical density (OD), co-culture period (CCP), and different antibiotics including kanamycin (K), vancomycin (VA), cefotaxime (CF), hygromycin (H), carbenicillin (CA), geneticin (G), ticarcillin (TI), and paromomycin (P). Consequently, best-obtained results were used in the fusion process by bagging method. Results showed that ensemble model with the highest R2 (0.83) had superb performance in comparison with all other individual models (MLP:063, RBF:0.69, and ANFIS: 0.74) in the validation set. Also, ensemble model was linked to Fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) for optimizing gene transformation, and the results showed that the maximum gene transformation efficiency (37.54%) can be achieved from EHA105 strain with 0.9 OD600, for 3.8 days CCP, 46.43 mg/l P, 9.54 mg/l K, 18.62 mg/l H, and 4.79 mg/l G as selection antibiotics and 109.74 μg/ml VA, 287.63 μg/ml CF, 334.07 μg/ml CA and 87.36 μg/ml TI as antibiotics in the selection medium. Moreover, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that input variables have a different degree of importance in gene transformation system in the order of Agrobacterium strain > CCP > K > CF > VA > P > OD > CA > H > TI > G. Generally, the developed hybrid model in this study (ensemble model-FOA) can be employed as an accurate and reliable approach in future genetic engineering and genome editing studies."
https://openalex.org/W3091521468,"Background Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a target for cardiovascular prevention. Contemporary equations for LDL-C estimation have limited accuracy in certain scenarios (high triglycerides [TG], very low LDL-C). Objectives We derived a novel method for LDL-C estimation from the standard lipid profile using a machine learning (ML) approach utilizing random forests (the Weill Cornell model). We compared its correlation to direct LDL-C with the Friedewald and Martin-Hopkins equations for LDL-C estimation. Methods The study cohort comprised a convenience sample of standard lipid profile measurements (with the directly measured components of total cholesterol [TC], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], and TG) as well as chemical-based direct LDL-C performed on the same day at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine (NYP-WCM). Subsequently, an ML algorithm was used to construct a model for LDL-C estimation. Results are reported on the held-out test set, with correlation coefficients and absolute residuals used to assess model performance. Results Between 2005 and 2019, there were 17,500 lipid profiles performed on 10,936 unique individuals (4,456 females; 40.8%) aged 1 to 103. Correlation coefficients between estimated and measured LDL-C values were 0.982 for the Weill Cornell model, compared to 0.950 for Friedewald and 0.962 for the Martin-Hopkins method. The Weill Cornell model was consistently better across subgroups stratified by LDL-C and TG values, including TG >500 and LDL-C <70. Conclusions An ML model was found to have a better correlation with direct LDL-C than either the Friedewald formula or Martin-Hopkins equation, including in the setting of elevated TG and very low LDL-C."
https://openalex.org/W3089643752,"This study aimed to detect Salmonella from retail meat collected from nine wet markets in Metro Manila, and identify the subtypes of Salmonella isolates using molecular serotyping assays from previously developed primers. Of the 720 collected meat samples, 57.64% were found to be Salmonella-contaminated. The most predominant serogroup was Salmonella O:3, and Salmonella serogroups O:4, O:6,7, O:8, O:9, and undetermined serogroups were also found. Most frequently detected isolates in bovine meat were S. 3:e,h:1,6 (putative identity: S. Anatum) and S: 4:e,h:1,2 (putative identity: S. Saintpaul), in porcine meat was S. 3:e,h:1,6 (putative identity: S. Anatum), and S. 8:i:z6 (putative identity: S. Kentucky) was common in poultry products. This study also demonstrated retail meat samples were contaminated with multiple Salmonella serogroups and serovars. This is the first Philippine study that utilized PCR-based assays to characterize Salmonella isolates down to a serovar level and provides baseline information regarding Salmonella prevalence and serovar distribution in retail meat. Molecular serotyping performed in this study can be used as an alternative approach to traditional serotyping in surveillance of Salmonella in the Philippines since the latter is expensive, time-consuming, and requires skilled technicians."
https://openalex.org/W3089722305,"Background It is estimated that one third of maternal deaths in Kenya in 2014 could have been prevented by more timely care-seeking. Mobile health interventions are increasingly being recognized as tools for the delivery of health education and promotion. Many maternal deaths occur in the first few weeks after delivery and mothers who are given adequate care in the postpartum period have better health outcomes. Kiambu County, Kenya has a high level of literacy and phone ownership amongst mothers delivering in public hospitals and was chosen as a site for a postpartum short message service intervention. Methods Women were recruited after delivery and randomized to receive a package of mobile messages or standard of care only. Messages covered danger signs, general postpartum topics, and family planning. Endline phone surveys were conducted at 8 weeks postpartum to assess knowledge, care seeking behavior and family planning uptake. Analysis was conducted using Stata and is presented in odds ratios. Results Women who received the danger sign messages were 1.6 times more likely to be able to list at least 1 danger sign and 3.51 times more likely to seek treatment if they experienced postpartum danger signs. There was no significant difference in routine postpartum care seeking or care seeking behaviors concerning newborns. Women who received family planning messages were 1.85 times more likely to uptake family planning services compared to controls and 2.1 times more likely to choose a long-acting method. Conclusions Simple, low-cost mobile interventions can support women in the early postpartum period when the information is targeted to particular points in the postpartum continuum. Additional research is needed to understand the interplay between healthcare providers and mobile health interventions. Health policy makers should consider direct mobile interventions for women as an option for supporting positive maternal health outcomes in certain populations."
https://openalex.org/W3089756883,"Cellular senescence is associated with inflammation and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of secreted proteins. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) expressing the SASP contributes to chronic vascular inflammation, loss of vascular function, and the developments of age-related diseases. Although VSMC senescence is well recognized, the mechanism of VSMC senescence and inflammation has not been established. In this study, we aimed to determine whether prednisolone (PD) attenuates adriamycin (ADR)-induced VSMC senescence and inflammation through the SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway. We found that PD inhibited ADR-induced VSMC senescence and inflammation response by decreasing p-NF-κB expression through the SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway. In addition, Western blotting revealed PD not only increased SIRT1 expression but also increased the phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser485 in ADR-treated VSMC. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated downregulation or pharmacological inhibitions of SIRT1 or AMPK significantly augmented ADR-induced inflammatory response and senescence in VSMC despite PD treatment. In contrast, the overexpression of SIRT1 or constitutively active AMPKα (CA-AMPKα) attenuated cellular senescence and p-NF-κB expression. Taken together, the inhibition of p-NF-κB by PD through the SIRT1 and p-AMPK (Ser485) pathway suppressed VSMC senescence and inflammation. Collectively, our results suggest that anti-aging effects of PD are caused by reduced VSMC senescence and inflammation due to reciprocal regulation of the SIRT1/p-AMPK (Ser485) signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3090717586,"Objective Although adverse events (AEs) following voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) are rare, their prompt ascertainment and management is a marker of quality care. The use of two-way text messaging (2wT) for client follow-up after VMMC reduces the need for clinic visits (standard of care (SoC)) without compromising safety. We compared the cost-effectiveness of 2wT to SoC for post-VMMC follow-up in two, high-volume, public VMMC sites in Zimbabwe. Materials and methods We developed a decision-analytic (decision tree) model of post-VMMC client follow-up at two high-volume sites. We parameterized the model using data from both a randomized controlled study of 2wT vs. SoC and from the routine VMMC program. The perspective of analysis was the Zimbabwe government (payer). The time horizon covered the time from VMMC to wound healing. Costs included text messaging; both in-person and outreach follow-up; and AE management. Costs were estimated in 2018 U.S. dollars. The outcome of analysis was AE yield relative to the globally accepted safety standard of a 2% AE rate. We estimated the incremental cost per percentage increase in AE ascertainment and the incremental cost per additional AE identified. We conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results 2wT increased the costs due to text messaging by $4.42 but reduced clinic visit costs by $2.92 and outreach costs by $3.61 –a net savings of $2.10. 2wT also increased AE ascertainment by 50% (92% AE yield in 2wT compared to 42% AE yield in SoC). Therefore, 2wT dominated SoC in the incremental analysis: 2wT was less costly and more effective. Results were generally robust to univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusions 2wT is cost-effective for post-VMMC follow-up in Zimbabwe. Countries in which VMMC is a high-priority HIV prevention intervention should consider this mHealth intervention to reduce overall cost per VMMC, increasing the likelihood of current and future VMMC program sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3089524448,"Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause deficiencies in homologous recombination repair (HR), resulting in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by the alternative non-homologous end-joining pathway, which is more error prone. HR deficiency of breast tumors is important because it is associated with better responses to platinum salt therapies and PARP inhibitors. Among other consequences of HR deficiency are characteristic somatic-mutation signatures and gene-expression patterns. The term ""BRCA-like"" (or ""BRCAness"") describes tumors that harbor an HR defect but have no detectable germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. A better understanding of the genes and molecular events associated with tumors being BRCA-like could provide mechanistic insights and guide development of targeted treatments. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for 1101 breast-cancer patients, we identified individuals with a germline mutation, somatic mutation, homozygous deletion, and/or hypermethylation event in BRCA1, BRCA2, and 59 other cancer-predisposition genes. Based on the assumption that BRCA-like events would have similar downstream effects on tumor biology as BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations, we quantified these effects based on somatic-mutation signatures and gene-expression profiles. We reduced the dimensionality of the somatic-mutation signatures and expression data and used a statistical resampling approach to quantify similarities among patients who had a BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutation, another type of aberration in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or any type of aberration in one of the other genes. Somatic-mutation signatures of tumors having a non-germline aberration in BRCA1/BRCA2 (n = 80) were generally similar to each other and to tumors from BRCA1/BRCA2 germline carriers (n = 44). Additionally, somatic-mutation signatures of tumors with germline or somatic events in ATR (n = 16) and BARD1 (n = 8) showed high similarity to tumors from BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers. Other genes (CDKN2A, CTNNA1, PALB2, PALLD, PRSS1, SDHC) also showed high similarity but only for a small number of events or for a single event type. Tumors with germline mutations or hypermethylation of BRCA1 had relatively similar gene-expression profiles and overlapped considerably with the Basal-like subtype; but the transcriptional effects of the other events lacked consistency. Our findings confirm previously known relationships between molecular signatures and germline or somatic events in BRCA1/BRCA2. Our methodology represents an objective way to identify genes that have similar downstream effects on molecular signatures when mutated, deleted, or hypermethylated."
https://openalex.org/W3089735816,"Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced endogenously in the gut by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber have been studied as nutrients that act as signaling molecules to activate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as GPR41 and GPR43. GPR43 functioning involves the suppression of lipid accumulation and maintaining body energy homeostasis, and is activated by acetic acid or propionic acid. Previously, we reported that the orally administered acetic acid improves lipid metabolism in liver and skeletal muscles and suppresses obesity, thus improving glucose tolerance. Acetic acid stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through its metabolic pathway in skeletal muscle cells. We hypothesized that acetic acid would stimulate GPR43 in skeletal muscle cells and has function in modulating gene expression related to muscle characteristics through its signal pathway. The objective of the current study was to clarify this effect of acetic acid. The GPR43 expression, observed in the differentiated myotube cells, was increased upon acetic acid treatment. Acetic acid induced the intracellular calcium influx in the cells and this induction was significantly inhibited by the GPR43-specific siRNA treatment. The calcineurin molecule is activated by calcium/calmodulin and is associated with proliferation of slow-twitch fibers. Calcineurin was activated by acetic acid treatment and inhibited by the concomitant treatment with GPR43-siRNA. Acetic acid induced nuclear localization of myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), and nuclear factor of activated t cells c1 (NFATc1). However, these localizations were abolished by the treatment with GPR43-siRNA. It was concluded that acetic acid plays a role in the activation of GPR43 and involves the proliferation of slow-twitch fibers in L6 skeletal muscles through the calcium-signaling pathway caused by induction of intracellular calcium influx."

As a result of the influx of clinical trials, researchers, clinicians, and the lay public, now more than ever, face a significant challenge in keeping up-to-date with the rapid rate of discoveries and advances. To remedy this problem, this research mined the ClinicalTrials.gov corpus to extract COVID-19 related clinical trials, produce unique reports to summarize findings and make the meta-data available via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Unique reports were created for each drug/intervention, Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) term, and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term. These reports, which have been run over multiple time points, along with APIs to access meta-data, are freely available at http://covidresearchtrials.com. The pipeline, reports, association of COVID-19 clinical trials with MeSH and HPO terms, insights, public repository, APIs, and correlations produced are all novel in this work. The freely available, novel resources present up-to-date relevant biological information and insights in a robust, accessible manner, illustrating their invaluable potential to aid researchers overcome COVID-19 and save hundreds of thousands of lives."
https://openalex.org/W3091473250,"Cancer vaccinations sensitize the immune system to recognize tumor-specific antigens de novo or boosting preexisting immune responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are regarded as the most potent antigen presenting cells (APCs) for induction of (cancer) antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) used as delivery vehicle have been shown to improve anti-tumor responses. This study aimed at exploring the potential of CNPs as antigen delivery system by assessing activation and expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by DCs and subsequent T cell-mediated lysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. As model antigen the ovalbumin-derived peptide SIINFEKL was chosen. Using imaging cytometry, intracellular uptake of FITC-labelled CNPs of three different sizes and qualities (90/10, 90/20 and 90/50) was demonstrated in DCs and in pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages to different extents. While larger particles (90/50) impaired survival of all APCs, small CNPs (90/10) were not toxic for DCs. Internalization of SIINFEKL-loaded but not empty 90/10-CNPs promoted a pro-inflammatory phenotype of DCs indicated by elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of murine DC2.4 cells with SIINFEKL-loaded 90/10-CNPs led to a marked MHC-related presentation of SIINFEKL and enabled DC2.4 cells to potently activate SIINFEKL-specific CD8+ OT-1 T cells finally leading to effective lysis of the PDAC cell line Panc-OVA. Overall, our study supports the suitability of CNPs as antigen vehicle to induce potent anti-tumor immune responses by activation and expansion of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W3090445070,"The diagnosis of pneumonia based on semiology and chest X-rays is frequently inaccurate, particularly in elderly patients. Older (C-reactive protein (CRP); procalcitonin (PCT)) or newer (Serum amyloid A (SAA); neopterin (NP)) biomarkers may increase the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis, but data are scarce and conflicting. We assessed the accuracy of CRP, PCT, SAA, NP and the ratios CRP/NP and SAA/NP in a prospective observational cohort of elderly patients with suspected pneumonia.We included consecutive patients more than 65 years old, with at least one respiratory symptom and one symptom or laboratory finding suggestive of infection, and a working diagnosis of pneumonia. Low-dose CT scan and comprehensive microbiological testing were done in all patients. The index tests, CRP, PCT, SAA and NP, were obtained within 24 hours. The reference diagnosis was assessed a posteriori by a panel of experts considering all available data, including patients' outcome. We used area under the curve (AUROC) and Youden index to assess the accuracy and obtain optimal cut-off of the index tests.200 patients (median age 84 years) were included; 133 (67%) had pneumonia. AUROCs for the diagnosis of pneumonia was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72) for CRP; 0.59 (95% CI: 0.51-0.68) for PCT; 0.60 (95% CI: 0.52-0.69) for SAA; 0.41 (95% CI: 0.32-0.49) for NP; 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55-0.71) for CRP/NP; and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.53-0.70) for SAA/NP. No cut-off resulted in satisfactory sensitivity or specificity.Accuracy of traditional (CRP, PCT) and newly proposed biomarkers (SAA, NP) and ratios of CRP/NP and SAA/NP was too low to help diagnosing pneumonia in the elderly. CRP had the highest AUROC.NCT02467092."
https://openalex.org/W3090476914,"Allium roseum is an important medicinal and aromatic plant, specific to the North African flora and a rich source of important nutrients and bioactive molecules including flavonoids and organosulfur compounds whose biological activities and pharmacological properties are well known. In the present study, the inhibition of amyloid beta protein toxicity by the ethanolic extract of this plant is investigated for the first time. Preliminary biochemical analyses identified kæmpferol and luteolin-7-o-glucoside as the more abundant phenolic compounds. The effects of A. roseum extract (ARE) on aggregation and aggregate cytotoxicity of amyloid beta-42 (Aβ42), whose brain aggregates are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, were investigated by biophysical (ThT assay, Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy) and cellular assays (cytotoxicity, aggregate immunolocalization, ROS measurement and intracellular Ca2+ imaging). The biophysical data suggest that ARE affects the structure of the Aβ42 peptide, inhibits its polymerization, and interferes with the path of fibrillogenesis. The data with cultured cells shows that ARE reduces Aß42 aggregate toxicity by inhibiting aggregate binding to the cell membrane and by decreasing both oxidative stress and intracellular Ca2+. Accordingly, ARE could act as a neuroprotective factor against Aβ aggregate toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease."

https://openalex.org/W2920845749,"The behavior of users of music streaming services is investigated from the point of view of the temporal dimension of individual songs. Specifically, the main object of the analysis is the point in time within a song at which users stop listening and start streaming another song (“skip”). The main contribution of this study is the ascertainment of a correlation between the distribution in time of skipping events and the musical structure of songs. It is also shown that such distribution is not only specific to the individual songs, but also independent of the cohort of users and date of observation. Finally, user behavioral data is used to train a predictor of the musical structure of a song solely from its acoustic content; it is shown that the use of such data, available in large quantities to music streaming services, yields significant improvements in accuracy over the customary fashion of training this class of algorithms, in which only smaller amounts of hand-labeled data are available."
https://openalex.org/W3089912296,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a monogenetic liver disease that is based on a mutation of the ATP7B gene and leads to a functional deterioration in copper (Cu) excretion in the liver. The excess Cu accumulates in various organs such as the liver and brain. WD patients show clinical heterogeneity, which can range from acute or chronic liver failure to neurological symptoms. The course of the disease can be improved by a life-long treatment with zinc or chelators such as D-penicillamine in a majority of patients, but serious side effects have been observed in a significant portion of patients, e.g. neurological deterioration and nephrotoxicity, so that a liver transplant would be inevitable. An alternative therapy option would be the genetic correction of the ATP7B gene. The novel gene therapy method CRISPR/Cas9, which has recently been used in the clinic, may represent a suitable therapeutic opportunity. In this study, we first initiated an artificial ATP7B point mutation in a human cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, and corrected this mutation by the additional use of single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotides (ssODNs), simulating a gene correction of a WD point mutation in vitro. By the addition of 0.5 mM of Cu three days after lipofection, a high yield of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ATP7B repaired cell clones was achieved (60%). Moreover, the repair efficiency was enhanced using ssODNs that incorporated three blocking mutations. The repaired cell clones showed a high resistance to Cu after exposure to increasing Cu concentrations. Our findings indicate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of ATP7B point mutations is feasible and may have the potential to be transferred to the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3089458135,"This study investigated the effect of non-periodized training performed at 80, 100 and 120% of the anaerobic threshold intensity (AnT) and a linear periodized training model adapted for swimming rats on the gene expression of monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4 (MCT1 and 4, in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles), protein contents, blood biomarkers, tissue glycogen, body mass, and aerobic and anaerobic capacities. Sixty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 10 per group): a baseline (BL; euthanized before training period), a control group (GC; not exercised during the training period), three groups exercised at intensities equivalent to 80, 100 and 120% of the AnT (G80, G100 and G120, respectively) at the equal workload and a linear periodized training group (GPE). Each training program lasted 12 weeks subdivided into three periods: basic mesocycle (6 weeks), specific mesocycle (5 weeks) and taper (1 week). Although G80, G100 and G120 groups were submitted to monotony workload (i.e. non-modulation at intensity or volume throughout the training program), rodents were evaluated during the same experimental timepoints as GPE to be able comparisons. Our main results showed that all training programs were capable to minimize the aerobic capacity decrease promoted by age, which were compared to control group. Rats trained in periodization model had reduced levels of lipid blood biomarkers and increased hepatic glycogen stores compared to all other trained groups. At the molecular level, only expressions of MCT1 in the muscle were modified by different training regimens, with MCT1 mRNA increasing in rats trained at lower intensities (G80), and MCT1 protein content showed higher values in non-periodized groups compared to pre-training and GPE. Here, training at different intensities but at same total workload promoted similar adaptations in rats. Nevertheless, our results suggested that periodized training seems to be optimize the physiological responses of rats."

We describe the current demographic profile of hospital care use in Denmark and make projections for changes in the patient profile up to 2050.The Danish population in 2013 (N = 5.63 million) was followed up for inpatient and emergency admissions recorded in Danish hospitals in 2013 using population-based registers. We combined age- and sex-specific hospital care use in 2013 with official population estimates to forecast the profile of hospital days up to 2050 with respect to age and sex.The total number of hospital days per year is projected to increase by 42% between 2013 and 2050, from 4.66 to 6.72 million days. While small changes are projected for the population aged 0-69, the largest change is projected to occur for the population aged 70+. The 2013 levels were 0.82 and 0.93 million days for men and women aged 70+, respectively. By 2050, these levels are projected to have reached 1.94 and 1.84 million days. While the population aged 70+ accounted for 37.5% of all days in 2013, its contribution is projected to increase to 56.2% by 2050.Our study shows one possible scenario for changes in the hospital days due to population aging by 2050: Assuming no changes in hospital care use over the forecast period, the absolute contribution of individuals aged 70+ to the total hospital days will more than double, and the relative contribution of persons aged 70+ will account for nearly 60% of all hospital days by 2050, being largest among men."
https://openalex.org/W3091294844,"Background Child health has been a health policy priority for more than a century in Chile. Since 2000, new health and intersectoral interventions have been implemented. However, no recent analyses have explored child mortality and equity in Chile, an indispensable input to guide policies towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, specially, in the context of a deeply unequal country such as many other Latin American countries. Thus, the objectives of this study are to analyze the variations in the risk and the causes of death among Chilean children aged <5 years, to identify the determinants, and to measure inequality of infant mortality from 1990 to 2016. Materials and methods An observational study was conducted to analyze the Chilean children's mortality from 1990 to 2016 using under five deaths and live births data from the Vital Statistics System. To describe the variation in the risk of death, a time series analysis was performed for each of the under five mortality rate components. A comparative cause of death analysis was developed for Neonatal and 1–59 months’ age groups. The determinants of infant mortality were studied with a descriptive analysis of yearly rates according to mother’s and child factors and bivariate logistic regression models at the individual level. Finally, simple and complex measures of inequality at individual level were estimated considering three-year periods. Results Regarding under 5 mortality: (i) Child survival has improved substantially in the last three decades, with a rapid decline in under five mortality rate between 1990 and 2001, followed by a slower reduction; (ii) early neonatal mortality has become the main component of the under five mortality rate (50.6%); (iii) congenital abnormalities have positioned as the leading cause of death; (iv) an important increase in live births below 1,000 grs. Regarding infant mortality: (i) birth weight and gestational age are the two most relevant risk factors in the neonatal period, while social variables are more significant for post-neonatal mortality and, (ii) the inequality according to mother’s education has shown a steady decline, with persistent inequalities in post-neonatal period. Conclusions The Chilean experience illustrates child health achievements and challenges in a country that transitioned from middle-to high-income in recent decades. Although inequity is one of the main challenges for the country, the health sector by granting universal access was able to reduce disparities. However, closing the gap in post-neonatal mortality is still challenging. To overcome stagnation in neonatal mortality, new and specific strategies must address current priorities, emphasizing the access of vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W3090313140,"Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a rare disease but its prevalence throughout the globe continues to grow, primarily due to increased contact lens usage. Since early-stage symptoms associated with AK closely resemble those from other corneal infections, accurate diagnosis is difficult and this often results in delayed treatment and exacerbation of the disease, which can lead to permanent visual impairment. Accordingly, developing a rapid Acanthamoeba-specific diagnostic method is highly desired. In the present study, a rapid and differential method for AK diagnosis was developed using the secretory proteins derived from the pathogenic Acanthamoeba. Among the vast quantities of proteins secreted by the pathogenic Acanthamoeba, an open reading frame of the inosine-uridine preferring nucleoside hydrolase (IPNH) gene was obtained. After expressing and purifying the IPNH protein using the pGEX 4T-3 vector system, mice were immunized with the purified proteins for polyclonal antibody generation. Western blot was performed using protein lysates of the human corneal cell, non-pathogenic amoeba, pathogenic amoeba, and clinical amoeba isolate along with lysates from other causes of keratitis such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Fusarium solani to confirm Acanthamoeba-specificity. Western blot using the polyclonal IPNH antibody revealed that IPNH was Acanthamoeba-specific since these proteins were only observed in lysates of Acanthamoeba origin or its culture media. Our findings indicate that the IPNH antibody of Acanthamoeba may serve as a potential agent for rapid and differential AK diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3090469197,"Background Hazardous alcohol use is prevalent among people living with HIV (PWH), leading to sub-optimal HIV treatment outcomes. In Vietnam, alcohol use is highly normative making it socially challenging for PWH to reduce or abstain. We used mixed methods to develop a quantitative scale to assess alcohol abstinence stigma and examined the association between alcohol abstinence stigma with alcohol use among PWH in Vietnam. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 PWH with hazardous alcohol use from an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic in the Thai Nguyen to inform item development. Alcohol use was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. We tested items in a survey of 1,559 ART clinic patients to assess internal consistency and structural validity. We used log binomial modeling to estimate associations between any reported alcohol abstinence stigma and alcohol use. Results Using the results from the qualitative interview data, we developed the alcohol abstinence stigma scale with seven final items with scores ranging from 0 (no stigma) to 28 (high stigma). The scale had good internal consistency (α = 0.75). Exploratory factor analysis suggested the presence of three factors: internalized, experienced, and anticipated stigma that explained 56.9% of the total variance. The mean score was 2.74, (SD = 4.28) and 46% reported any alcohol abstinence stigma. We observed a dose-response relationship between alcohol abstinence stigma and alcohol use. PWH who reported any alcohol abstinence stigma had greater hazardous alcohol use (aPR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.56), harmful alcohol use (aPR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.37, 3.72), and dependence symptoms (aPR = 3.81, 95% CI: 2.19, 6.64). Conclusion Alcohol abstinence stigma is associated with increased alcohol levels of alcohol use among PWH in Vietnam, signaling challenges for alcohol reduction. Consideration of alcohol abstinence stigma will be essential for the design of effective alcohol reduction interventions and policy efforts to prevent adverse health consequences of alcohol use among PWH."
https://openalex.org/W3090805871,"The maintenance of magnesium (Mg2+) homeostasis is essential for human life. The Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-pair domain divalent metal cation transport mediators (CNNMs) have been described to be involved in maintaining Mg2+ homeostasis. Among these CNNMs, CNNM2 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the kidney tubules where it is involved in Mg2+ reabsorption. A total of four patients, two of them with a suspected disorder of calcium metabolism, and two patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary tubulopathy were screened for mutations by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). We found one novel likely pathogenic variant in the heterozygous state (c.2384C>A; p.(Ser795*)) in the CNNM2 gene in a family with a suspected disorder of calcium metabolism. In this family, hypomagnesemia was indirectly discovered. Moreover, we observed three novel variants of uncertain significance in heterozygous state in the other three patients (c.557G>C; p.(Ser186Thr), c.778A>T; p.(Ile260Phe), and c.1003G>A; p.(Asp335Asn)). Our study shows the utility of Next-Generation Sequencing in unravelling the genetic origin of rare diseases. In clinical practice, serum Mg2+ should be determined in calcium and PTH-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3090822763,"Background A significant reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been reported, across all ages, following the implementation of 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) globally, as part of infant immunization programs. We explored the additional impact of PCV13 on IPD over a 14-year period. Methods Using provincial laboratory surveillance and hospitalization data (N = 5791), we calculated the annual incidence of IPD following the implementation of PCV13 vaccine. Poisson regression was used to evaluate changes in the overall incidence of IPD, and serotype-specific IPD between PCV7 (2004–10) and PCV13 (2011–2015) eras. Results Overall, IPD rates have seen a modest decline in the PCV13 compared to the PCV7 era (IRR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79–0.89); this was seen in children ≤2 years of age, and the majority of the adult cohort. Rates of vaccine-type IPD (PCV7 and PCV13) also decreased in the PCV13 era. In contrast, IPD incidence related to non-PCV13 (IRR: 1.56; 95%CI:1.43–1.72) and non-vaccine serotypes (IRR: 2.12; 95%CI:1.84–2.45) increased in the PCV13 era compared to the PCV7 era. Conclusions A modest reduction in IPD from the PCV13 vaccine was observed, with gains limited to the immunized cohort and adults. However, a significant increase in non-vaccine serotypes emphasizes the need for continued surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3090137091,"Caribbean Acropora spp. corals have undergone a decline in cover since the second half of the twentieth century. Loss of these architecturally complex and fast-growing corals has resulted in significant, cascading changes to the character, diversity, and available eco-spaces of Caribbean reefs. Few thriving Acropora spp. populations exist today in the Caribbean and western North Atlantic seas, and our limited ability to access data from reefs assessed via long-term monitoring efforts means that reef scientists are challenged to determine resilience and longevity of existing Acropora spp. reefs. Here we used multiple dating methods to measure reef longevity and determine whether Coral Gardens Reef, Belize, is a refuge for Acropora cervicornis against the backdrop of wider Caribbean decline. We used a new genetic-aging technique to identify sample sites, and radiocarbon and high-precision uranium-thorium (U-Th) dating techniques to test whether one of the largest populations of extant A. cervicornis in the western Caribbean is newly established after the 1980s, or represents a longer-lived, stable population. We did so with respect for ethical sampling of a threatened species. Our data show corals ranging in age from 1910 (14C) or 1915 (230Th) to at least November 2019. While we cannot exclude the possibility of short gaps in the residence of A. cervicornis earlier in the record, the data show consistent and sustained living coral throughout the 1980s and up to at least 2019. We suggest that Coral Gardens has served as a refuge for A. cervicornis and that identifying other, similar sites may be critical to efforts to grow, preserve, conserve, and seed besieged Caribbean reefs."
https://openalex.org/W3090158635,"Introduction A significant proportion of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) harbor mutations in homologous recombination (HR) repair genes, with some of these mutations associating with increased tumor susceptibility to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy. While mutations in some HR repair genes (e.g., BRCA1/2) have been associated with a more aggressive clinical course, prior studies correlating HR mutational status with treatment response to androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) or taxane-based chemotherapy have yielded conflicting results. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis to assess clinical outcomes to conventional, regulatory-approved therapies in mCRPC patients with somatic (monoallelic and biallelic) and/or germline HR repair mutations compared to patients without alterations as determined by clinical-grade next-generation sequencing assays. The primary endpoint was PSA30/PSA50 response, defined as ≥30%/≥50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline. Secondary endpoints of PSA progression-free survival (pPFS) and clinical/radiographic progression-free survival (crPFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results A total of 90 consecutively selected patients were included in this analysis, of which 33 (37%) were identified to have HR repair gene mutations. Age, race, Gleason score, prior surgery, and receipt of prior radiation therapy were comparable between carriers and non-carriers. There was no evidence that PSA30/PSA50 differed by HR gene mutational status. Median pPFS and crPFS ranged 3–14 months across treatment modalities, but there was no evidence either differed by HR gene mutational status (all p>0.05). There was also no difference in outcomes between those with BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations (n = 17) compared to those without HR repair mutations. Conclusion HR gene mutational status was associated with comparable clinical outcomes following treatment with ARSIs or taxane-based chemotherapy. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3089871108,"Cell shape change is one of the driving forces of animal morphogenesis, and the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has played a significant role in analyzing the underlying mechanisms involved. The analysis of cell shape change requires quantification of cellular shape descriptors, a method known as cellular morphometry. However, standard C. elegans live imaging methods limit the capability of cellular morphometry in 3D, as spherical aberrations generated by samples and the surrounding medium misalign optical paths. Here, we report a 3D live imaging method for C. elegans embryos that minimized spherical aberrations caused by refractive index (RI) mismatch. We determined the composition of a refractive index matching medium (RIMM) for C. elegans live imaging. The 3D live imaging with the RIMM resulted in a higher signal intensity in the deeper cell layers. We also found that the obtained images improved the 3D cell segmentation quality. Furthermore, our 3D cellular morphometry and 2D cell shape simulation indicated that the germ cell precursor P4 had exceptionally high cortical tension. Our results demonstrate that the RIMM is a cost-effective solution to improve the 3D cellular morphometry of C. elegans. The application of this method should facilitate understanding of C. elegans morphogenesis from the perspective of cell shape changes."
https://openalex.org/W3089936912,"In spite of many decades of research, the spawning migration of the European eel Anguilla anguilla from the European coast to the Sargasso Sea remains a mystery. In particular, the role of the swimbladder as a buoyancy regulating structure is not yet understood. In this study, we exercised silver eels in a swim tunnel under elevated hydrostatic pressure. The transcriptome of gas gland tissue of these exercised eels was then compared to the known transcriptome of not exercised (control) silver eel gas gland cells. Due to the high infection rate of the eel population with the swimbladder parasite Anguillicola crassus, the comparison also included an exercised group of silver eels with a heavily damaged swimbladder, and we compared the previously published transcriptome of not exercised silver eels with a highly damaged swimbladder with the exercised group of silver eels with a heavily damaged swimbladder. The comparisons of unexercised (control) silver eels with exercised silver eels with functional swimbladder (EF), as well as with exercised silver eels with damaged swimbladder (ED), both showed a significant elevation in transcripts related to glycolytic enzymes. This could also be observed within the comparison of unexercised silver eels with a highly infected swimbladder with exercised eels with a damaged swimbladder (DED). In contrast to EF, in ED a significant elevation in transcript numbers of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase was observed. While in EF the transcriptional changes suggested that acid production and secretion was enhanced, in ED these changes appeared to be related to thickened tissue and thus elevated diffusion distances. The remarkable number of differentially expressed transcripts coding for proteins connected to cAMP-dependent signaling pathways indicated that metabolic control in gas gland cells includes cAMP-dependent pathways. In contrast to ED, in EF significant transcriptional changes could be related to the reconstruction of the extracellular matrix, while in ED tissue repair and inflammation was more pronounced. Surprisingly, in exercised eels hypoxia inducible transcription factor expression was elevated. In EF, a large number of genes related to the circadian clock were transcriptionally modified, which may be connected to the circadian vertical migrations observed during the spawning migration."
https://openalex.org/W3090517541,"Land-use change and climate change are recognized as two main drivers of the current biodiversity decline. Protected areas help safeguard the landscape from additional anthropogenic disturbances and, when properly designed, can help species cope with climate change impacts. When designed to protect the regional biodiversity rather than to conserve focal species or landscape elements, protected areas need to cover a representative sample of the regional biodiversity and be functionally connected, facilitating individual movements among protected areas in a network to maximize their effectiveness. We developed a methodology to define effective protected areas to implement in a regional network using ecological representativeness and functional connectivity as criteria. We illustrated this methodology in the Gaspésie region of Québec, Canada. We simulated movements for the endangered Atlantic-Gaspésie caribou population (Rangifer tarandus caribou), using an individual-based model, to determine functional connectivity based on this large mammal. We created multiple protected areas network scenarios and evaluated their ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the current and future conditions. We selected a subset of the most effective network scenarios and extracted the protected areas included in them. There was a tradeoff between ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the created networks. Only a few protected areas among those available were repeatedly chosen in the most effective networks. Protected areas maximizing both ecological representativeness and functional connectivity represented suitable areas to implement in an effective protected areas network. These areas ensured that a representative sample of the regional biodiversity was covered by the network, as well as maximizing the movement over time between and inside the protected areas for the focal population."
https://openalex.org/W3083535243,"Evidence indicates that early life is critical for determining future obesity risk. A sharper policy focus on pregnancy and early childhood could help improve obesity prevention efforts. This study aimed to systematically identify and categorise policy levers used in England with potential to influence early life course (pregnancy, 0-5 years) and identify how these interface with energy balance behaviours. The objective is to identify gaps and where further policy actions could most effectively focus.A behavioural science approach was taken using the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework. The key determinants of energy balance in the early years were identified from the Foresight Systems Map. Policy actions were scoped systematically from available literature, including any health or non-health policies which could impact on energy balance behaviours. Foresight variables and policy actions were considered in terms of COM-B and the BCW to determine approaches likely to be effective for obesity prevention and treatment. Existing policies were overlaid across the map of key risk factors to identify gaps in obesity prevention and treatment provision.A wide range of policy actions were identified (n = 115) to address obesity-relevant risk factors. These were most commonly educational or guidelines relating to environmental restructuring (i.e. changing the physical or social context). Scope for strengthening policies relating to the food system (e.g. the market price of food) and psychological factors contributing to obesity were identified. Policies acted via all aspects of the COM-B model, but there was scope for improving policies to increase capability through skills acquisition and both reflective and automatic motivation.There is substantial policy activity to address early years obesity but much is focused on education. Scope exists to strengthen actions relating to upstream policies which act on food systems and those targeting psychological factors contributing to obesity risk."
https://openalex.org/W3089628532,"Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is commonly caused by abnormal pressure on the knee due to excessive load while standing, squatting, or going up or down stairs. To better understand the pathophysiology of PFP, we conducted a noninvasive patellar tracking study using a C-arm computed tomography (CT) scanner to assess the non-weight-bearing condition at 0° knee flexion (NWB0°) in supine, weight-bearing at 0° (WB0°) when upright, and at 30° (WB30°) in a squat. Three-dimensional (3D) CT images were obtained from patients with PFP (12 women, 6 men; mean age, 31 ± 9 years; mean weight, 68 ± 9 kg) and control subjects (8 women, 10 men; mean age, 39 ± 15 years; mean weight, 71 ± 13 kg). Six 3D-landmarks on the patella and femur were used to establish a joint coordinate system (JCS) and kinematic degrees of freedom (DoF) values on the JCS were obtained: patellar tilt (PT, °), patellar flexion (PF, °), patellar rotation (PR, °), patellar lateral-medial shift (PTx, mm), patellar proximal-distal shift (PTy, mm), and patellar anterior-posterior shift (PTz, mm). Tests for statistical significance (p < 0.05) showed that the PF during WB30°, the PTy during NWB0°, and the PTz during NWB0°, WB0°, and WB30° showed clear differences between the patients with PFP and healthy controls. In particular, the PF during WB30° (17.62°, extension) and the PTz during WB0° (72.5‬0 mm, posterior) had the largest rotational and translational differences (JCS Δ = patients with PFP-controls), respectively. The JCS coordinates with statistically significant difference can serve as key biomarkers of patellar motion when evaluating a patient suspected of having PFP. The proposed method could reveal diagnostic biomarkers for accurately identifying PFP patients and be an effective addition to clinical diagnosis before surgery and to help plan rehabilitation strategies."

However, the pharmacological mechanisms of BXHPD still remain unclear. Network Pharmacology (NP) approach was used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of BXHPD in treating depression. Potential active compounds of BXHPD were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform Database. STRING database was used to build a interaction network between the active compounds and target genes associated with depression. The topological features of nodes were visualized and calculated. Significant pathways and biological functions were identified using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. A total of 44 active compounds were obtained from BXHPD, and 121 potential target genes were considered to be therapeutically relevant. Pathway analysis indicated that MAPK signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt pathway were significant pathways in depression. They were mainly involved in promoting nerve growth and nutrition and alleviating neuroinflammatory conditions. The result provided some potential ways for modern medicine in the treatment of depression."
https://openalex.org/W3089918138,"Sediment and soil contamination with toxic heavy metals, including cadmium (Cd2+) and lead (Pb2+), represents a major long-term remediation challenge. Resuspension of contaminated sediments into the water column, or the uptake of toxic metals from top soil, can lead to exposure of aquatic or terrestrial organisms, followed by bioconcentration, bioaccumulation and biomagnification, which may pose a threat to public health. We have developed a novel nanoscale engineered material, namely ligand-coated dense nanoparticles (Ligand DNPs), which contain a dense WO3 nanoparticle core and a shell functionalized with a metal-binding organic ligand (EDTA), to effectively sequester heavy metal ions deeper into the soil and sediments. We demonstrate that one application of Ligand DNPs can remove from 60% to almost 80% of the Cd and Pb in two different soil matrices, driving these metal ions deeper into the sediment or soil column via gravity, and making them less bioavailable. Ligand DNPs can provide a relatively fast, convenient, and efficient in-situ approach for the remediation of sediments and soils contaminated with heavy metals."
https://openalex.org/W3089819499,"Understanding the patterns of chemical exposure among biota across a landscape is challenging due to the spatial heterogeneity and complexity of the sources, pathways, and fate of the different chemicals. While spatially-driven relationships between contaminant sources and biota body burdens of a single chemical are commonly modelled, there has been little effort on modelling chemical mixtures across multiple wildlife species in the Canadian Oil Sands region. In this study, we used spatial principal components analysis (sPCA) to assess spatial patterns of the body burdens of 22 metals and Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) in 492 individual wildlife, including fur-bearing mammals, colonial waterbirds, and amphibians collected from the Canadian Oil Sands region in Canada. Spatial analysis and mapping both indicate that some of the complex exposures in the studied biota are distributed randomly across a landscape, which suggests background or non-point source exposures. In contrast, the pattern of exposure for seven metals and PTEs, including mercury, vanadium, lead, rubidium, lithium, strontium, and barium, exhibited a clustered pattern to the east of the open-pit mining area and in regions downstream of oil sands development which indicates point-source input. This analysis demonstrated useful methods for integrating monitoring datasets and identifying sources and potential drivers of exposure to chemical mixtures in biota across a landscape. These results can be used to support an adaptive monitoring program by identifying regions needing additional monitoring, health impact assessments, and possible intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3090540086,"A novel cardiac motion correction algorithm has been introduced recently. Unlike other segmentation-based approaches it is fully automatic and capable of correcting motion artifacts of myocardial wall and other moving structures as well as coronary arteries of the heart. In addition, it requires raw data of only less than a single rotation for motion estimation and correction, which is a significant advantage from the perspective of x-ray exposure and workflow. The aim of this study is to explore the capability of the proposed method through phantoms and in-vivo experiments. Motion correction of coronary arteries and other heart structures including myocardial wall is the main focus of the evaluation. First, we provide a brief introduction to the concept of the motion correction algorithm. Next we address the procedure of our studies using an XCAT phantom and commercially available physical phantoms. Results of XCAT phantom demonstrate that our solution significantly improves the structural similarity of coronary arteries compared to FBP (proposed: 0.94, FBP: 0.77, p<0.001). Besides, it provides significantly lower root mean square error (proposed: 20.27, FBP: 25.33, p = 0.01) of the whole heart image. Mocomo phantom study shows that the proposed method improves the visualization of coronary arteries estimated based on motion score (1: worst, 5: best) from two experienced radiologists (proposed: 3.5, FBP: 2.1, p<0.001). The results of these phantom studies reveal that the proposed has a great potential in handling motion artifacts of other heart structures as well as coronary arteries. Finally, we provide the results of in-vivo animal and human studies. The 3D and 4D heart images show a consistently superior performance in the visualization of coronary arteries along with myocardial wall and other cardiothoracic structures. Based on these findings of our studies, we are of the opinion that our solution has a considerable potential to improve temporal resolution of cardiac CT imaging. This would open the door to innovations in structural or functional diagnosis of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W3091217270,"Music is considered a vital element in young people’s lives. It functions as an important means for expressing the emotions and feelings they experience in a daily basis. As such, this study explores the music preferences of high school Brazilian students (N = 940), 530 female (56.9%) and 410 male (43.1%) participants between 14 and 20 years old (M = 16.14 years old, SD = 1.22). The main instrument for data collection was the Questionnaire on Musical Style Preferences, which was adapted to the Brazilian context and encompassed 33 different music styles. A principal component analysis resulted in five dimensions representing different musical styles: (1) Intense, (2) Unique, (3) Sophisticated, (4) Contemporary, and (5) Mellow. The results of this study reinforced theory of the five-factor model of musical preference. Results also suggest that Mellow music was the most preferred while Sophisticated music was the least preferred among participants. Regarding gender, male participants showed a greater preference towards Contemporary, Intense, and Sophisticated music, whereas women generally preferred Mellow and Unique. Regarding age, participants under 20 years old showed a greater preference towards Mellow musical styles as compared to older participants. On the one hand, regression analyses showed that preferences towards Intense music decrease with age. On the other hand, gender was a better predictor for music preferences than age. Although the results of this study correspond to those of previous studies, more research studies are necessary to further explain musical preferences within the Brazilian context."
https://openalex.org/W3089495437,"Sri Lanka’s community forestry (CF) program emerged in the early 1980s following a global trend to conserve forest resources and provide benefits to the local community. However, very little is known about the effect of CF on forest resources. We assess the impacts of CF on forest conditions of semi-mixed evergreen forest in the intermediate zone of Sri Lanka using the before-after control-impact method. The study examines tree density, regeneration, woody species diversity, and evidence of disturbance as parameters to analyze the impact of the CF program. Data are analyzed using the difference in differences approach. The results show that the CF program has increased seedling and sapling density to a significant degree and reduced human disturbances. A major contribution of the CF program is that it was found to reduce invasive species and forest fires. The program reduced the amount of invasive species up to six times less than previous. The findings revealed that the impact of CF on forests may vary depending on pre-existing forest conditions, length of period to implement, perception, and decisions by local people. Community understanding and decision-making, in tandem with government policy, will weigh heavily on its future effectiveness."

https://openalex.org/W3090177928,"To develop mitigation measures for the protection of bats in close proximity to onshore wind turbines, new detection techniques covering large-scale environments and techniques, which are able to track individuals are required. Radar based observations, successfully applied in ornithological studies, offer a promising potential, but come with challenges regarding the comparability of measurements and noise interference (ground clutter) from objects within detection range. This paper presents improvements of a commercially available inexpensive pulse radar for 3D spatial detection of bat-sized objects in onshore wind parks. A new analytical spatial detection volume model is presented incorporating calibrated radar data and landscape parameters such as clutter. Computer simulation programs to process the analytical spatial detection volume model were developed. For model calibration, the minimum signal power of the radar was experimentally determined with the radar cross section (RCS) of an artificial bat (similar to Nyctalus noctula), resulting in a maximum detection range of 800 m and a corresponding RCS of 12.7 cm². Additionally, the spatial volume for radar detection was optimized with a clutter shielding fence (CSF). Adjusting the volume model by incorporating a theoretical model of the CSF, an extension of the detection volume by a factor of 2.5 was achieved, while the total volume of a 105° horizontal angular radar image section yields 0.0105 km³. Extrapolation and comparison with state-of-the-art acoustic bat detection result in a 270 times larger volume, confirming the large-scale detection capabilities of the pulse radar."
https://openalex.org/W3091052893,"Crystal structure prediction has been one of the fundamental and challenging problems in materials science. It is computationally exhaustive to identify molecular conformations and arrangements in organic molecular crystals due to complexity in intra- and inter-molecular interactions. From a geometrical viewpoint, specific types of organic crystal structures can be characterized by ellipsoid packing. In particular, we focus on aromatic systems which are important for organic semiconductor materials. In this study, we aim to estimate the ellipsoidal molecular shapes of such crystals and predict them from single molecular descriptors. First, we identify the molecular crystals with molecular centroid arrangements that correspond to affine transformations of four basic cubic lattices, through topological analysis of the dataset of crystalline polycyclic aromatic molecules. The novelty of our method is that the topological data analysis is applied to arrangements of molecular centroids intead of those of atoms. For each of the identified crystals, we estimate the intracrystalline molecular shape based on the ellipsoid packing assumption. Then, we show that the ellipsoidal shape can be predicted from single molecular descriptors using a machine learning method. The results suggest that topological characterization of molecular arrangements is useful for structure prediction of organic semiconductor materials."

We do not find evidence for severity when comparing immune-deficient mice to their heterozygous immune-competent littermates. Our data challenge the assumption that immune-deficiency per se regardless of housing conditions causes severity. Based on our study we propose to use objective non-invasive parameters determined by laboratory animal science for decisions concerning severity of immune-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W3090634807,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of migraine, and some polymorphisms are known to affect the expression of COX-2. This retrospective case-control study aimed to explore the associations between the -765 G>C (rs20417), -1759 G>A (rs3218625), and -8473 C>T (rs5275) COX-2 polymorphisms and migraine in Chinese Han individuals. One hundred and ten unrelated Han Chinese patients with migraine and 108 healthy controls were recruited between 03/2014 and 08/2016 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University and the First People's Hospital of Lianyungang City. The genotypes of all polymorphisms in controls followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.215, P = 0.884, and P = 0.689). There were differences in the genotype and allele distributions of the COX-2-1759G>A (Gly587Arg) polymorphism between the migraine and control groups (P = 0.038 and P = 0.040, respectively). Compared with the COX-2-1759AG genotype, GG genotype carriers had an increased risk of migraine (odds ratio (OR) = 8.720, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-70.960, P = 0.038). The frequency of the COX-2-1759A allele in patients with migraine was significantly lower than the controls (OR = 0.119, 95%CI: 0.015-0.957, P = 0.040). Adjusted age and sex, a statistical difference was found in the dominant model of COX-2-1759 G>A (OR = 0.118, 95% CI 0.014 to 0.962, P = 0.046). No significant difference was detected regarding the -765G>C and -8473T>C polymorphisms between the two groups. The COX-2 1759A allele might be involved in the development of migraine in Chinese Han individuals, but this will have to be confirmed in large-scale studies."
https://openalex.org/W3091587398,"The antibacterial effects of quaternary ammonium resins (QARs) have been reported for decades, but there are few practical applications because of limited improvements in bactericidal capacity and the absence of an efficient antibacterial-indicating parameter. An in-situ determination method of surficial N+ groups for QARs, defined as surficial N+ charge density, was first established to merely quantify the exposed surficial quaternary ammonium groups (QAs). The mechanism of the new method depends on the tetraphenylboron sodium standard solution (TS), which is a colloidal solution with high steric hindrance, making it difficult to permeate into QARs and further react with the inner QAs. The results showed that the antibacterial efficacy of QARs correlates with the surficial N+ charge density with R2 > 0.95 (R2 of 0.97 for Escherichia coli, R2 of 0.96 for Staphylococcus aureus) but not with the strong-base group exchange capacity or zeta potential. Furthermore, the surficial N+ charge density was demonstrated efficient to indicate the antibacterial capacities against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria for commercial QARs, including acrylic, styrene and pyridine resin skeletons, especially for the QARs with similar skeletons and similar QAs. Based on the finding that the bactericidal groups merely involve the surficial QAs of QARs, this study proposes a new direction for improving the antibacterial capacity by enriching the surficial QAs and enhancing the bactericidal property of these surficial QAs, and provides a practicable synthesis with two-step quaternization."
https://openalex.org/W3089436841,"Aim High-quality chest compressions is challenging for bystanders and first responders to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Long compression pauses and compression rates higher than recommended are common and detrimental to survival. Our aim was to design a simple and low computational cost algorithm for feedback on compression rate using the transthoracic impedance (TI) acquired by automated external defibrillators (AEDs). Methods ECG and TI signals from AED recordings of 242 OHCA patients treated by basic life support (BLS) ambulances were retrospectively analyzed. Beginning and end of chest compression series and each individual compression were annotated. The algorithm computed a biased estimate of the autocorrelation of the TI signal in consecutive non-overlapping 2-s analysis windows to detect the presence of chest compressions and estimate compression rate. Results A total of 237 episodes were included in the study, with a median (IQR) duration of 10 (6-16) min. The algorithm performed with a global sensitivity in the detection of chest compressions of 98.7%, positive predictive value of 98.7%, specificity of 97.1%, and negative predictive value of 97.1% (validation subset including 207 episodes). The unsigned error in the estimation of compression rate was 1.7 (1.3-2.9) compressions per minute. Conclusion Our algorithm is accurate and robust for real-time guidance on chest compression rate using AEDs. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement with minimal software modifications. Deployment of AEDs with this capability could potentially contribute to enhancing the quality of chest compressions in the first minutes from collapse."
https://openalex.org/W3090268085,"Setting land aside has long been a primary approach for protecting biodiversity; however, the efficacy of this approach has been questioned. We examined whether protecting lands positively influences bird species in the U.S., and thus overall biodiversity. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Protected Areas Database of the U.S. to assess effects of protected and multiple-use lands on the prevalence and long-term population trends of imperiled and non-imperiled bird species. We evaluated whether both presence and proportional area of protected and multiple-use lands surrounding survey routes affected prevalence and population trends for imperiled and non-imperiled species. Regarding presence of these lands surrounding these survey routes, our results suggest that imperiled and non-imperiled species are using the combination of protected and multiple-use lands more than undesignated lands. We found no difference between protected and multiple-use lands. Mean population trends were negative for imperiled species in all land categories and did not differ between the land categories. Regarding proportion of protected lands surrounding the survey routes, we found that neither the prevalence nor population trends of imperiled or non-imperiled species was positively associated with any land category. We conclude that, although many species (in both groups) tend to be using these protected and multiple-use lands more frequently than undesignated lands, this protection does not appear to improve population trends. Our results may be influenced by external pressures (e.g., habitat fragmentation), the size of protected lands, the high mobility of birds that allows them to use a combination of all land categories, and management strategies that result in similar habitat between protected and multiple-use lands, or our approach to detect limited relationships. Overall, our results suggest that the combination of protected and multiple-use lands is insufficient, alone, to prevent declines in avian biodiversity at a national scale."
https://openalex.org/W3090744115,"Fibromyalgia patients experience cardiovascular complications in addition to musculoskeletal pain. This study aimed to investigate the cardiac effects of a prolonged shallow water gait in a fibromyalgia-induced young mouse model.To produce a fibromyalgia mouse model, wild-type mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of reserpine once a day for three days, and two primary experiments were performed. First, three types of gait tests were performed before and after the reserpine injections as follows: (i) 5 minutes of free gait outside the water, (ii) 1 minute of free gait in shallow warm water, and (iii) 5 minutes of free gait in shallow warm water. Second, electrocardiogram recordings were taken before and after the three gait tests. The average heart rate and heart rate irregularity scores were analyzed.Exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia was observed at 1-minute gait in shallow water during the acute stage of induced FM in young mice. Further, both cardiac arrhythmia and a decrease in HR have occurred at 5-minute gait in shallow water at the same mice. However, this phenomenon was not observed in the wild-type mice under any test conditions.Although a short-term free gait in shallow warm water may be advantageous for increasing the motor activity of FM-model mice, we should be aware of the risk of prolonged and excessive exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia. For gait exercises in shallow water as a treatment in FM patients. We suggest a gradual increase in exercise duration may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3091647448,"Studies report that intense physical activity influences the down-regulation of immune function in athletes as well as the interaction between adipose tissue and the immune system.This study aimed to compare the plasma soluble levels of the immune checkpoint HLA-G (sHLA-G) molecule with the fat mass and muscle mass index among 77 bodybuilders and 64 controls.The comparisons of the percentage of body fat (%BF) revealed that the groups of male and female bodybuilders showed a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of body fat when compared to their control group, (P <0.0001, for both comparisons). Regarding sHLA-G levels, the comparisons showed that the group of male bodybuilders had significantly higher sHLA-G levels compared to the group of female bodybuilders (P = 0.0011).Our results showed that in bodybuilders with less body fat, the systemic levels of soluble HLA-G, an immunological molecule with recognized immunosuppressive function, are significantly higher and suggest that this immune mechanism may corroborate the immunosuppressive state in athletes undergoing intense and prolonged physical training."
