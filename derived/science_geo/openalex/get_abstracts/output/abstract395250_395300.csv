https://openalex.org/W2020113570,"Maternal care is associated with long-term effects on behavior and epigenetic programming of the NR3C1 (GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR) gene in the hippocampus of both rats and humans. In the rat, these effects are reversed by cross-fostering, demonstrating that they are defined by epigenetic rather than genetic processes. However, epigenetic changes at a single gene promoter are unlikely to account for the range of outcomes and the persistent change in expression of hundreds of additional genes in adult rats in response to differences in maternal care.We examine here using high-density oligonucleotide array the state of DNA methylation, histone acetylation and gene expression in a 7 million base pair region of chromosome 18 containing the NR3C1 gene in the hippocampus of adult rats. Natural variations in maternal care are associated with coordinate epigenetic changes spanning over a hundred kilobase pairs. The adult offspring of high compared to low maternal care mothers show epigenetic changes in promoters, exons, and gene ends associated with higher transcriptional activity across many genes within the locus examined. Other genes in this region remain unchanged, indicating a clustered yet specific and patterned response. Interestingly, the chromosomal region containing the protocadherin-α, -β, and -γ (Pcdh) gene families implicated in synaptogenesis show the highest differential response to maternal care.The results suggest for the first time that the epigenetic response to maternal care is coordinated in clusters across broad genomic areas. The data indicate that the epigenetic response to maternal care involves not only single candidate gene promoters but includes transcriptional and intragenic sequences, as well as those residing distantly from transcription start sites. These epigenetic and transcriptional profiles constitute the first tiling microarray data set exploring the relationship between epigenetic modifications and RNA expression in both protein coding and non-coding regions across a chromosomal locus in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2038699903,"The axial skeleton of extinct saurischian dinosaurs (i.e., theropods, sauropodomorphs), like living birds, was pneumatized by epithelial outpocketings of the respiratory system. Pneumatic signatures in the vertebral column of fossil saurischians include complex branching chambers within the bone (internal pneumaticity) and large chambers visible externally that are bounded by neural arch laminae (external pneumaticity). Although general aspects of internal pneumaticity are synapomorphic for saurischian subgroups, the individual internal pneumatic spaces cannot be homologized across species or even along the vertebral column, due to their variability and absence of topographical landmarks. External pneumatic structures, in contrast, are defined by ready topological landmarks (vertebral laminae), but no consistent nomenclatural system exists. This deficiency has fostered confusion and limited their use as character data in phylogenetic analysis.We present a simple system for naming external neural arch fossae that parallels the one developed for the vertebral laminae that bound them. The nomenclatural system identifies fossae by pointing to reference landmarks (e.g., neural spine, centrum, costal articulations, zygapophyses). We standardize the naming process by creating tripartite names from ""primary landmarks,"" which form the zygodiapophyseal table, ""secondary landmarks,"" which orient with respect to that table, and ""tertiary landmarks,"" which further delineate a given fossa.The proposed nomenclatural system for lamina-bounded fossae adds clarity to descriptions of complex vertebrae and allows these structures to be sourced as character data for phylogenetic analyses. These anatomical terms denote potentially homologous pneumatic structures within Saurischia, but they could be applied to any vertebrate with vertebral laminae that enclose spaces, regardless of their developmental origin or phylogenetic distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2034636924,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes a high morbidity and mortality rate in infected patients, but pathogenic mechanisms of this microorganism regarding the secretion and delivery of virulence factors to host cells have not been characterized. Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that play a role in the delivery of virulence factors to host cells. A. baumannii has been shown to secrete OMVs when cultured in vitro, but the role of OMVs in A. baumannii pathogenesis is not well elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated the secretion and delivery of virulence factors of A. baumannii to host cells via the OMVs and assessed the cytotoxic activity of outer membrane protein A (AbOmpA) packaged in the OMVs. A. baumannii ATCC 19606T secreted OMVs during in vivo infection as well as in vitro cultures. Potential virulence factors, including AbOmpA and tissue-degrading enzymes, were associated with A. baumannii OMVs. A. baumannii OMVs interacted with lipid rafts in the plasma membranes and then delivered virulence factors to host cells. The OMVs from A. baumannii ATCC 19606T induced apoptosis of host cells, whereas this effect was not detected in the OMVs from the ΔompA mutant, thereby reflecting AbOmpA-dependent host cell death. The N-terminal region of AbOmpA22-170 was responsible for host cell death. In conclusion, the OMV-mediated delivery of virulence factors to host cells may well contribute to pathogenesis during A. baumannii infection."
https://openalex.org/W2084235293,"Autophagy is a cellular self-digestion process activated in response to stresses such as energy deprivation and oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms by which energy deprivation and oxidative stress trigger autophagy remain undefined. Here, we report that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) is required for autophagy in cultured endothelial cells. AMPK activity, ROS levels, and the markers of autophagy were monitored in confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) treated with the glycolysis blocker 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Treatment of BAEC with 2-DG (5 mM) for 24 hours or with low concentrations of H(2)O(2) (100 µM) induced autophagy, including increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, accumulation of GFP-tagged LC3 positive intracellular vacuoles, and increased fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. 2-DG-treatment also induced AMPK phosphorylation, which was blocked by either co-administration of two potent anti-oxidants (Tempol and N-Acetyl-L-cysteine) or overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 or catalase in BAEC. Further, 2-DG-induced autophagy in BAEC was blocked by overexpressing catalase or siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK. Finally, pretreatment of BAEC with 2-DG increased endothelial cell viability after exposure to hypoxic stress. Thus, AMPK is required for ROS-triggered autophagy in endothelial cells, which increases endothelial cell survival in response to cell stress."
https://openalex.org/W1971009462,"We present a lipidomics analysis of human Parkinson's disease tissues. We have focused on the primary visual cortex, a region that is devoid of pathological changes and Lewy bodies; and two additional regions, the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex which contain Lewy bodies at different disease stages but do not have as severe degeneration as the substantia nigra.Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lipidomics techniques for an initial screen of 200 lipid species, significant changes in 79 sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid and cholesterol species were detected in the visual cortex of Parkinson's disease patients (n = 10) compared to controls (n = 10) as assessed by two-sided unpaired t-test (p-value <0.05). False discovery rate analysis confirmed that 73 of these 79 lipid species were significantly changed in the visual cortex (q-value <0.05). By contrast, changes in 17 and 12 lipid species were identified in the Parkinson's disease amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, respectively, compared to controls; none of which remained significant after false discovery rate analysis. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry techniques, 6 out of 7 oxysterols analysed from both non-enzymatic and enzymatic pathways were also selectively increased in the Parkinson's disease visual cortex. Many of these changes in visual cortex lipids were correlated with relevant changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and an oxidative stress response as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques.The data indicate that changes in lipid metabolism occur in the Parkinson's disease visual cortex in the absence of obvious pathology. This suggests that normalization of lipid metabolism and/or oxidative stress status in the visual cortex may represent a novel route for treatment of non-motor symptoms, such as visual hallucinations, that are experienced by a majority of Parkinson's disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W1973335238,"Adenosine A(2A) receptors (A2ARs) are thought to interact negatively with the dopamine D(2) receptor (D2R), so selective A2AR antagonists have attracted attention as novel treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, no information about the receptor in living patients with PD is available. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between A2ARs and the dopaminergic system in the striata of drug-naïve PD patients and PD patients with dyskinesia, and alteration of these receptors after antiparkinsonian therapy. We measured binding ability of striatal A2ARs using positron emission tomography (PET) with [7-methyl-(11)C]-(E)-8-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)-1,3,7-trimethylxanthine ([(11)C]TMSX) in nine drug-naïve patients with PD, seven PD patients with mild dyskinesia and six elderly control subjects using PET. The patients and eight normal control subjects were also examined for binding ability of dopamine transporters and D2Rs. Seven of the drug-naïve patients underwent a second series of PET scans following therapy. We found that the distribution volume ratio of A2ARs in the putamen were larger in the dyskinesic patients than in the control subjects (p<0.05, Tukey-Kramer post hoc test). In the drug-naïve patients, the binding ability of the A2ARs in the putamen, but not in the head of caudate nucleus, was significantly lower on the more affected side than on the less affected side (p<0.05, paired t-test). In addition, the A2ARs were significantly increased after antiparkinsonian therapy in the bilateral putamen of the drug-naïve patients (p<0.05, paired t-test) but not in the bilateral head of caudate nucleus. Our study demonstrated that the A2ARs in the putamen were increased in the PD patients with dyskinesia, and also suggest that the A2ARs in the putamen compensate for the asymmetrical decrease of dopamine in drug-naïve PD patients and that antiparkinsonian therapy increases the A2ARs in the putamen. The A2ARs may play an important role in regulation of parkinsonism in PD."
https://openalex.org/W1993494645,"Mutualistic networks are crucial to the maintenance of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, what we know about seed dispersal networks is based only on bird-fruit interactions. Therefore, we aimed at filling part of this gap by investigating bat-fruit networks. It is known from population studies that: (i) some bat species depend more on fruits than others, and (ii) that some specialized frugivorous bats prefer particular plant genera. We tested whether those preferences affected the structure and robustness of the whole network and the functional roles of species. Nine bat-fruit datasets from the literature were analyzed and all networks showed lower complementary specialization (H2' = 0.37±0.10, mean ± SD) and similar nestedness (NODF = 0.56±0.12) than pollination networks. All networks were modular (M = 0.32±0.07), and had on average four cohesive subgroups (modules) of tightly connected bats and plants. The composition of those modules followed the genus-genus associations observed at population level (Artibeus-Ficus, Carollia-Piper, and Sturnira-Solanum), although a few of those plant genera were dispersed also by other bats. Bat-fruit networks showed high robustness to simulated cumulative removals of both bats (R = 0.55±0.10) and plants (R = 0.68±0.09). Primary frugivores interacted with a larger proportion of the plants available and also occupied more central positions; furthermore, their extinction caused larger changes in network structure. We conclude that bat-fruit networks are highly cohesive and robust mutualistic systems, in which redundancy is high within modules, although modules are complementary to each other. Dietary specialization seems to be an important structuring factor that affects the topology, the guild structure and functional roles in bat-fruit networks."
https://openalex.org/W2015748224,"Very little is known about the regulation of morphogenesis in synovial joints. Mechanical forces generated from muscle contractions are required for normal development of several aspects of normal skeletogenesis. Here we show that biophysical stimuli generated by muscle contractions impact multiple events during chick knee joint morphogenesis influencing differential growth of the skeletal rudiment epiphyses and patterning of the emerging tissues in the joint interzone. Immobilisation of chick embryos was achieved through treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent Decamethonium Bromide. The effects on development of the knee joint were examined using a combination of computational modelling to predict alterations in biophysical stimuli, detailed morphometric analysis of 3D digital representations, cell proliferation assays and in situ hybridisation to examine the expression of a selected panel of genes known to regulate joint development. This work revealed the precise changes to shape, particularly in the distal femur, that occur in an altered mechanical environment, corresponding to predicted changes in the spatial and dynamic patterns of mechanical stimuli and region specific changes in cell proliferation rates. In addition, we show altered patterning of the emerging tissues of the joint interzone with the loss of clearly defined and organised cell territories revealed by loss of characteristic interzone gene expression and abnormal expression of cartilage markers. This work shows that local dynamic patterns of biophysical stimuli generated from muscle contractions in the embryo act as a source of positional information guiding patterning and morphogenesis of the developing knee joint."
https://openalex.org/W2005947510,"Uremic syndrome results from malfunctioning of various organ systems due to the retention of uremic toxins which, under normal conditions, would be excreted into the urine and/or metabolized by the kidneys. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the renal elimination of uremic toxin creatinine that accumulate in chronic renal failure. Quantitative investigation of the plausible correlations was performed by spectroscopy, calorimetry, molecular docking and accessibility of surface area. Alkalinization of normal plasma from pH 7.0 to 9.0 modifies the distribution of toxin in the body and therefore may affect both the accumulation and the rate of toxin elimination. The ligand loading of HSA with uremic toxin predicts several key side chain interactions of site I that presumably have the potential to impact the specificity and impaired drug binding. These findings provide useful information for elucidating the complicated mechanism of toxin disposition in renal disease state."
https://openalex.org/W2142840017,"The developmental mechanisms regulating cell differentiation and patterning during the secondary growth of woody tissues are poorly understood. Class III HD ZIP transcription factors are evolutionarily ancient and play fundamental roles in various aspects of plant development. Here we investigate the role of a Class III HD ZIP transcription factor, POPCORONA, during secondary growth of woody stems. Transgenic Populus (poplar) trees expressing either a miRNA-resistant POPCORONA or a synthetic miRNA targeting POPCORONA were used to infer function of POPCORONA during secondary growth. Whole plant, histological, and gene expression changes were compared for transgenic and wild-type control plants. Synthetic miRNA knock down of POPCORONA results in abnormal lignification in cells of the pith, while overexpression of a miRNA-resistant POPCORONA results in delayed lignification of xylem and phloem fibers during secondary growth. POPCORONA misexpression also results in coordinated changes in expression of genes within a previously described transcriptional network regulating cell differentiation and cell wall biosynthesis, and hormone-related genes associated with fiber differentiation. POPCORONA illustrates another function of Class III HD ZIPs: regulating cell differentiation during secondary growth."
https://openalex.org/W2052135536,"Background Results from epidemiologic studies on the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer risk are inconclusive. It is possible that vitamin D may be effective in reducing risk only of specific subtypes due to disease heterogeneity. Methods and Findings In case-control and case-series analyses, we examined serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in relation to breast cancer prognostic characteristics, including histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER), and molecular subtypes defined by ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2, among 579 women with incident breast cancer and 574 controls matched on age and time of blood draw enrolled in the Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 2003 to 2008. We found that breast cancer cases had significantly lower 25OHD concentrations than controls (adjusted mean, 22.8 versus 26.2 ng/mL, p<0.001). Among premenopausal women, 25OHD concentrations were lower in those with high- versus low-grade tumors, and ER negative versus ER positive tumors (p≤0.03). Levels were lowest among women with triple-negative cancer (17.5 ng/mL), significantly different from those with luminal A cancer (24.5 ng/mL, p = 0.002). In case-control analyses, premenopausal women with 25OHD concentrations above the median had significantly lower odds of having triple-negative cancer (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.08–0.53) than those with levels below the median; and every 10 ng/mL increase in serum 25OHD concentrations was associated with a 64% lower odds of having triple-negative cancer (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.22–0.56). The differential associations by tumor subtypes among premenopausal women were confirmed in case-series analyses. Conclusion In our analyses, higher serum levels of 25OHD were associated with reduced risk of breast cancer, with associations strongest for high grade, ER negative or triple negative cancers in premenopausal women. With further confirmation in large prospective studies, these findings could warrant vitamin D supplementation for reducing breast cancer risk, particularly those with poor prognostic characteristics among premenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2018474075,"The sphingolipid ceramide has been widely implicated in the regulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The accumulation of ceramide has been demonstrated in a wide variety of experimental models of apoptosis and in response to a myriad of stimuli and cellular stresses. However, the detailed mechanisms of its generation and regulatory role during apoptosis are poorly understood. We sought to determine the regulation and roles of ceramide production in a model of ultraviolet light-C (UV-C)-induced programmed cell death. We found that UV-C irradiation induces the accumulation of multiple sphingolipid species including ceramide, dihydroceramide, sphingomyelin, and hexosylceramide. Late ceramide generation was also found to be regulated by Bcl-xL, Bak, and caspases. Surprisingly, inhibition of de novo synthesis using myriocin or fumonisin B1 resulted in decreased overall cellular ceramide levels basally and in response to UV-C, but only fumonisin B1 inhibited cell death, suggesting the presence of a ceramide synthase (CerS)-dependent, sphingosine-derived pool of ceramide in regulating programmed cell death. We found that this pool did not regulate the mitochondrial pathway, but it did partially regulate activation of caspase-7 and, more importantly, was necessary for late plasma membrane permeabilization. Attempting to identify the CerS responsible for this effect, we found that combined knockdown of CerS5 and CerS6 was able to decrease long-chain ceramide accumulation and plasma membrane permeabilization. These data identify a novel role for CerS and the sphingosine salvage pathway in regulating membrane permeability in the execution phase of programmed cell death.

These data identify a novel role for CerS and the sphingosine salvage pathway in regulating membrane permeability in the execution phase of programmed cell death. Programmed cell death is a complex process whereby cells respond to external or internal stimuli by undergoing genetically programmed self-destruction. Although many variations of programmed cell death have been described, key pathways controlling most forms include mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), 2The abbreviations used are: MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; Cer, ceramide; dHCer, dihydroceramide; dHSph, dihydrosphingosine; FB1, fumonisin B1; HexCer, hexosylceramide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LacCer, lactosylceramide; SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; Sph, sphingosine; UV-C, ultraviolet light-C; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; 17C-Sph, 17-carbon sphingosine; aSMase, acid SMase; nSMase, neutral SMase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl. release of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins (e.g. cytochrome c), and protease activation (1Kroemer G.

Well established mediators of programmed cell death include members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bak, BH3-only proteins, etc.), which control MOMP, and caspases, which are proteases that control initiation (e.g. caspase-2, -8, -9, etc.) or execution (e.g. caspase-3, -6, and -7) of cell death (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1324-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The upstream pathways leading to MOMP and caspase activation depend largely on the nature of the death stimulus. For example, genotoxic stress can induce accumulation of p53, stimulation of p53-mediated transcription of the BH3-only proteins p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Noxa, and activation of Bax and Bak (3Schuler M.

Despite being widely implicated in programmed cell death, the mechanisms of Cer generation and its functions in regulating cell death pathways remain ill defined. Several studies have suggested that Cer regulates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis through regulating Bcl-2 family members and MOMP (27Jin J. Hou Q. Mullen T.D. Zeidan Y.H. Bielawski J.

We hypothesized that, in a model of ultraviolet light-C (UV-C)-induced programmed cell death, Cer generation would be necessary for the activation of the mitochondrial pathway and apoptosis. We found that UV-C induced the accumulation of multiple sphingolipid species including dihydroceramide (dHCer) and Cer. Inhibition of de novo synthesis greatly reduced the levels of Cer in cells both basally and following UV-C irradiation, but only inhibition of CerS was able to protect from cell death. Moreover, this protection occurred downstream or independently of mitochondrial permeabilization. Inhibition of CerS greatly inhibited plasma membrane permeabilization. These data identify a novel pool of CerS-derived Cer that regulates plasma membrane permeabilization in the execution phase of apoptosis. Myriocin was from Sigma-Aldrich.

All subsequent steps were the same as those described for the aSMase assay above. RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy® kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration was determined by the Quant-iTTM RiboGreen® RNA Assay kit (Invitrogen). One microgram of RNA was used to produce cDNA using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA was used for real time quantitative PCR using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Invitrogen) on an ABI 7300 quantitative PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described by the manufacturer.

Caspase-3/7 activity was determined using a fluorometric assay provided by BioVision Research Products (Mountain View, CA) using the manufacturer's protocol with a few modifications. Briefly, cells were treated as described, scraped into ice-cold PBS, and pelleted. Lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in a lysis buffer provided in the kit and freezing at −20 °C. On the day of the assay, the frozen lysates were thawed on ice and centrifuged briefly, and the protein content was determined by the Bradford assay. To begin the reaction, 50 μg of lysate in 50 μl of lysis buffer was added to 2× reaction buffer containing 10 mm DTT and the DEVD-AFC (where AFC is 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) substrate. Reactions were incubated for 2 h after which fluorescence (400-nm excitation and 500-nm emission) was determined. Background fluorescence was determined using reactions lacking lysate, and this value was subtracted from the fluorescence observed in the treatment samples. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was determined using the LDH-Cytotoxicity Assay kit II from BioVision Research Products according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were treated as indicated, and 100 μl of cell-conditioned medium was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. Ten microliters of the resulting supernatant was transferred in triplicate to wells in a 96-well plate. One hundred microliters of reaction mixture containing WST (1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methyl sulphate) substrate was added, and the plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells treated for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 were used as a 100% control, and non-cell-conditioned medium was used to determine background activity. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's two-tailed unpaired t test for single comparisons. For multiple comparisons, we used one- or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post tests. α = 0.05 was our criterion for significance. We first sought to characterize UV-C-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells in regard to common programmed cell death mediators. As indicated in Fig. 1, UV-C indeed induced cell death (Fig. 1A) and DEVDase activity (Fig. 1B) 6–12 h postirradiation. Because MCF-7 cells do not possess functional caspase-3, this latter activity is likely due solely to the activatio"
https://openalex.org/W2040414086,"During adulthood, the neurotrophin Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) sensitizes nociceptors, thereby increasing the response to noxious stimuli. The relationship between NGF and pain is supported by genetic evidence: mutations in the NGF TrkA receptor in patients affected by an hereditary rare disease (Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type IV, HSAN IV) determine a congenital form of severe pain insensitivity, with mental retardation, while a mutation in NGFB gene, leading to the aminoacid substitution R100W in mature NGF, determines a similar loss of pain perception, without overt cognitive neurological defects (HSAN V). The R100W mutation provokes a reduced processing of proNGF to mature NGF in cultured cells and a higher percentage of neurotrophin secreted is in the proNGF form. Moreover, using Surface Plasmon Resonance we showed that the R100W mutation does not affect NGF binding to TrkA, while it abolishes NGF binding to p75NTR receptors. However, it remains to be clarified whether the major impact of the mutation is on the biological function of proNGF or of mature NGF and to what extent the effects of the R100W mutation on the HSAN V clinical phenotype are developmental, or whether they reflect an impaired effectiveness of NGF to regulate and mediate nociceptive transmission in adult sensory neurons. Here we show that the R100 mutation selectively alters some of the signaling pathways activated downstream of TrkA NGF receptors. NGFR100 mutants maintain identical neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in a variety of cell assays, while displaying a significantly reduced pain-inducing activity in vivo (n = 8–10 mice/group). We also show that proNGF has a significantly reduced nociceptive activity, with respect to NGF. Both sets of results jointly contribute to elucidating the mechanisms underlying the clinical HSAN V manifestations, and to clarifying which receptors and intracellular signaling cascades participate in the pain sensitizing action of NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2094234691,"The ability to process concurrently multiple visual objects is fundamental for a coherent perception of the world. A core component of this ability is the simultaneous individuation of multiple objects. Many studies have addressed the mechanism of object individuation but it remains unknown whether the visual system mandatorily individuates all relevant elements in the visual field, or whether object indexing depends on task demands. We used a neural measure of visual selection, the N2pc component, to evaluate the flexibility of multiple object individuation. In three ERP experiments, participants saw a variable number of target elements among homogenous distracters and performed either an enumeration task (Experiment 1) or a detection task, reporting whether at least one (Experiment 2) or a specified number of target elements (Experiment 3) was present. While in the enumeration task the N2pc response increased as a function of the number of targets, no such modulation was found in Experiment 2, indicating that individuation of multiple targets is not mandatory. However, a modulation of the N2pc similar to the enumeration task was visible in Experiment 3, further highlighting that object individuation is a flexible mechanism that binds indexes to object properties and locations as needed for further object processing."
https://openalex.org/W2013609600,"The development of the mammalian kidney is well conserved from mouse to man. Despite considerable temporal and spatial data on gene expression in mammalian kidney development, primarily in rodent species, there is a paucity of genes whose expression is absolutely specific to a given anatomical compartment and/or developmental stage, defined here as 'anchor' genes. We previously generated an atlas of gene expression in the developing mouse kidney using microarray analysis of anatomical compartments collected via laser capture microdissection. Here, this data is further analysed to identify anchor genes via stringent bioinformatic filtering followed by high resolution section in situ hybridisation performed on 200 transcripts selected as specific to one of 11 anatomical compartments within the midgestation mouse kidney. A total of 37 anchor genes were identified across 6 compartments with the early proximal tubule being the compartment richest in anchor genes. Analysis of minimal and evolutionarily conserved promoter regions of this set of 25 anchor genes identified enrichment of transcription factor binding sites for Hnf4a and Hnf1b, RbpJ (Notch signalling), PPARγ:RxRA and COUP-TF family transcription factors. This was reinforced by GO analyses which also identified these anchor genes as targets in processes including epithelial proliferation and proximal tubular function. As well as defining anchor genes, this large scale validation of gene expression identified a further 92 compartment-enriched genes able to subcompartmentalise key processes during murine renal organogenesis spatially or ontologically. This included a cohort of 13 ureteric epithelial genes revealing previously unappreciated compartmentalisation of the collecting duct system and a series of early tubule genes suggesting that segmentation into proximal tubule, loop of Henle and distal tubule does not occur until the onset of glomerular vascularisation. Overall, this study serves to illuminate previously ill-defined stages of patterning and will enable further refinement of the lineage relationships within mammalian kidney development."
https://openalex.org/W2023415155,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling plays an important role in regulating multiple cellular responses, such as growth, morphogenesis, and/or pathogenicity of eukaryotic organisms such as fungi. As a second messenger, cAMP is important in the activation of downstream effector molecules. The balance of intracellular cAMP levels depends on biosynthesis by adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and hydrolysis by cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEases). The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae contains a high-affinity (PdeH/Pde2) and a low-affinity (PdeL/Pde1) PDEases, and a previous study showed that PdeH has a major role in asexual differentiation and pathogenicity. Here, we show that PdeL is required for asexual development and conidial morphology, and it also plays a minor role in regulating cAMP signaling. This is in contrast to PdeH whose mutation resulted in major defects in conidial morphology, cell wall integrity, and surface hydrophobicity, as well as a significant reduction in pathogenicity. Consistent with both PdeH and PdeL functioning in cAMP signaling, disruption of PDEH only partially rescued the mutant phenotype of ΔmagB and Δpka1. Further studies suggest that PdeH might function through a feedback mechanism to regulate the expression of pathogenicity factor Mpg1 during surface hydrophobicity and pathogenic development. Moreover, microarray data revealed new insights into the underlying cAMP regulatory mechanisms that may help to identify potential pathogenicity factors for the development of new disease management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2141139673,"H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established worldwide in terrestrial poultry and wild birds, and are occasionally transmitted to mammals including humans and pigs. To comprehensively elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of 571 viral genomes from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database, representing the spectrum of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from 1966 to 2009. Our study provides a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis and evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses, and for describing the history of H9N2 viruses circulating in diverse hosts. Panorama phylogenetic analysis of the eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 viral genomes were classified into 74 separate lineages, which had marked host and geographical differences in phylogeny. Panorama genotypical analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses include at least 98 genotypes, which were further divided according to their HA lineages into seven series (A-G). Phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes showed that H9N2 viruses are closely related to H3, H4, H5, H7, H10, and H14 subtype influenza viruses. Our results indicate that H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive reassortments to generate multiple reassortants and genotypes, suggesting that the continued circulation of multiple genotypical H9N2 viruses throughout the world in diverse hosts has the potential to cause future influenza outbreaks in poultry and epidemics in humans. We propose a nomenclature system for identifying and unifying all lineages and genotypes of H9N2 influenza viruses in order to facilitate international communication on the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of H9N2 influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2065894261,"The WalKR two-component system is essential for viability of Staphylococcus aureus, a major pathogen. We have shown that WalKR acts as the master controller of peptidoglycan metabolism, yet none of the identified regulon genes explain its requirement for cell viability. Transmission electron micrographs revealed cell wall thickening and aberrant division septa in the absence of WalKR, suggesting its requirement may be linked to its role in coordinating cell wall metabolism and cell division. We therefore tested whether uncoupling autolysin gene expression from WalKR-dependent regulation could compensate for its essential nature. Uncoupled expression of genes encoding lytic transglycosylases or amidases did not restore growth to a WalKR-depleted strain. We identified only two WalKR-regulon genes whose expression restored cell viability in the absence of WalKR: lytM and ssaA. Neither of these two genes are essential under our conditions and a ΔlytM ΔssaA mutant does not present any growth defect. LytM is a glycyl–glycyl endopeptidase, hydrolyzing the pentaglycine interpeptide crossbridge, and SsaA belongs to the CHAP amidase family, members of which such as LysK and LytA have been shown to have D-alanyl-glycyl endopeptidase activity, cleaving between the crossbridge and the stem peptide. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that peptidoglycan crosslinking relaxation through crossbridge hydrolysis plays a crucial role in the essential requirement of the WalKR system for cell viability."

Debris (termed drusen) below the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) have been recognized as a risk factor for dry AMD and its progression to wet AMD, which is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The underlying mechanism of how drusen might elicit CNV remains undefined. Cigarette smoking, oxidative damage to the RPE and inflammation are postulated to be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. To better understand the cellular mechanism(s) linking oxidative stress and inflammation to AMD, we examined the expression of pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-angiogenic pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF) in RPE from smoker patients with AMD. We also evaluated the effects of hydroquinone (HQ), a major pro-oxidant in cigarette smoke on MCP-1, VEGF and PEDF expression in cultured ARPE-19 cells and RPE/choroids from C57BL/6 mice. Principal Findings MCP-1, VEGF and PEDF expression was examined by real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. Low levels of MCP-1 protein were detected in RPE from AMD smoker patients relative to controls. Both MCP-1 mRNA and protein were downregulated in ARPE-19 cells and RPE/choroids from C57BL/6 mice after 5 days and 3 weeks of exposure to HQ-induced oxidative injury. VEGF protein expression was increased and PEDF protein expression was decreased in RPE from smoker patients with AMD versus controls resulting in increased VEGF/PEDF ratio. Treatment with HQ for 5 days and 3 weeks increased the VEGF/PEDF ratio in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion We propose that impaired RPE-derived MCP-1-mediated scavenging macrophages recruitment and phagocytosis might lead to incomplete clearance of proinflammatory debris and infiltration of proangiogenic macrophages which along with increased VEGF/PEDF ratio favoring angiogenesis might promote drusen accumulation and progression to CNV in smoker patients with dry AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2028788188,"Tsetse flies are notoriously difficult to observe in nature, particularly when populations densities are low. It is therefore difficult to observe them on their hosts in nature; hence their vertebrate species can very often only be determined indirectly by analysis of their gut contents. This knowledge is a critical component of the information on which control tactics can be developed. The objective of this study was to determine the sources of tsetse bloodmeals, hence investigate their feeding preferences. We used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) and cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequences for identification of tsetse fly blood meals, in order to provide a foundation for rational decisions to guide control of trypanosomiasis, and their vectors. Glossina swynnertoni were sampled from Serengeti (Tanzania) and G. pallidipes from Kenya (Nguruman and Busia), and Uganda. Sequences were used to query public databases, and the percentage identities obtained used to identify hosts. An initial assay showed that the feeds were from single sources. Hosts identified from blood fed flies collected in Serengeti ecosystem, included buffaloes (25/40), giraffes (8/40), warthogs (3/40), elephants (3/40) and one spotted hyena. In Nguruman, where G. pallidipes flies were analyzed, the feeds were from elephants (6/13) and warthogs (5/13), while buffaloes and baboons accounted for one bloodmeal each. Only cattle blood was detected in flies caught in Busia and Uganda. Out of four flies tested in Mbita Point, Suba District in western Kenya, one had fed on cattle, the other three on the Nile monitor lizard. These results demonstrate that cattle will form an integral part of a control strategy for trypanosomiasis in Busia and Uganda, while different approaches are required for Serengeti and Nguruman ecosystems, where wildlife abound and are the major component of the tsetse fly food source."
https://openalex.org/W2004817055,"Background Globally plants are the primary sink of atmospheric CO2, but are also the major contributor of a large spectrum of atmospheric reactive hydrocarbons such as terpenes (e.g. isoprene) and other biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC). The prediction of plant carbon (C) uptake and atmospheric oxidation capacity are crucial to define the trajectory and consequences of global environmental changes. To achieve this, the biosynthesis of BVOC and the dynamics of C allocation and translocation in both plants and ecosystems are important. Methodology We combined tunable diode laser absorption spectrometry (TDLAS) and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for studying isoprene biosynthesis and following C fluxes within grey poplar (Populus x canescens) saplings. This was achieved by feeding either 13CO2 to leaves or 13C-glucose to shoots via xylem uptake. The translocation of 13CO2 from the source to other plant parts could be traced by 13C-labeled isoprene and respiratory 13CO2 emission. Principal Finding In intact plants, assimilated 13CO2 was rapidly translocated via the phloem to the roots within 1 hour, with an average phloem transport velocity of 20.3±2.5 cm h−1. 13C label was stored in the roots and partially reallocated to the plants' apical part one day after labeling, particularly in the absence of photosynthesis. The daily C loss as BVOC ranged between 1.6% in mature leaves and 7.0% in young leaves. Non-isoprene BVOC accounted under light conditions for half of the BVOC C loss in young leaves and one-third in mature leaves. The C loss as isoprene originated mainly (76–78%) from recently fixed CO2, to a minor extent from xylem-transported sugars (7–11%) and from photosynthetic intermediates with slower turnover rates (8–11%). Conclusion We quantified the plants' C loss as respiratory CO2 and BVOC emissions, allowing in tandem with metabolic analysis to deepen our understanding of ecosystem C flux."
https://openalex.org/W2042087027,"IFN-α exerts multiple effects leading to immune protection against pathogens and cancer as well to autoimmune reactions by acting on monocytes and dendritic cells. We analyzed the versatility of human monocytes conditioned by IFN-α towards dendritic cell differentiation (IFN-DC) in shaping the autologous T-helper response. Priming of naïve CD4 T cells with autologous IFN-DC in the presence of either SEA or anti-CD3, resulted, in addition to a prominent expansion of CXCR3+ IFN-γ-producing CD4 Th1 cells, in the emergence of two distinct subsets of IL-17-producing CD4 T cells: i) a predominant Th17 population selectively producing IL-17 and expressing CCR6; ii) a minor Th1/Th17 population, producing both IL-17 and IFN-γ. After phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, IFN-DC induced Th17 cell expansion and IL-17 release. Notably, the use of neutralizing antibodies revealed that IL-23 was an essential cytokine in mediating Th17 cell development by IFN-DC. The demonstration of the IFN-DC-induced expansion of both Th1 and Th17 cell populations reveals the intrinsic plasticity of these DC in orienting the immune response and provides a mechanistic link between IFN-α and the onset of autoimmune phenomena, which have been correlated with both IL-17 production and exposure to IFN-α."
https://openalex.org/W2064664264,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling is initiated by the release of EGFR-ligands from membrane-anchored precursors, a process termed ectodomain shedding. This proteolytic event, mainly executed by A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases (ADAMs), is regulated by a number of signal transduction pathways, most notably those involving protein kinase C (PKC). However, the molecular mechanisms of PKC-dependent ectodomain shedding of EGFR-ligands, including the involvement of specific PKC isoforms and possible functional redundancy, are poorly understood. To address this issue, we employed a cell-based system of PMA-induced PKC activation coupled with shedding of heparin binding (HB)-EGF. In agreement with previous studies, we demonstrated that PMA triggers a rapid ADAM17-mediated release of HB-EGF. However, PMA-treatment also results in a protease-independent loss of cell surface HB-EGF. We identified PKCα as the key participant in the activation of ADAM17 and suggest that it acts in parallel with a pathway linking PKCδ and ERK activity. While PKCα specifically regulated PMA-induced shedding, PKCδ and ERK influenced both constitutive and inducible shedding by apparently affecting the level of HB-EGF on the cell surface. Together, these findings indicate the existence of multiple modes of regulation controlling EGFR-ligand availability and subsequent EGFR signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1967289736,"Human VRK1 induces a stabilization and accumulation of p53 by specific phosphorylation in Thr18. This p53 accumulation is reversed by its downregulation mediated by Hdm2, requiring a dephosphorylated p53 and therefore also needs the removal of VRK1 as stabilizer. This process requires export of VRK1 to the cytosol and is inhibited by leptomycin B. We have identified that downregulation of VRK1 protein levels requires DRAM expression, a p53-induced gene. DRAM is located in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment. Induction of DNA damage by UV, IR, etoposide and doxorubicin stabilizes p53 and induces DRAM expression, followed by VRK1 downregulation and a reduction in p53 Thr18 phosphorylation. DRAM expression is induced by wild-type p53, but not by common human p53 mutants, R175H, R248W and R273H. Overexpression of DRAM induces VRK1 downregulation and the opposite effect was observed by its knockdown. LC3 and p62 were also downregulated, like VRK1, in response to UV-induced DNA damage. The implication of the autophagic pathway was confirmed by its requirement for Beclin1. We propose a model with a double regulatory loop in response to DNA damage, the accumulated p53 is removed by induction of Hdm2 and degradation in the proteasome, and the p53-stabilizer VRK1 is eliminated by the induction of DRAM that leads to its lysosomal degradation in the autophagic pathway, and thus permitting p53 degradation by Hdm2. This VRK1 downregulation is necessary to modulate the block in cell cycle progression induced by p53 as part of its DNA damage response."

Genomic alterations may add prognostic information and indicate biological aggressiveness thereby emphasizing the need for genome-wide profiling of oral cancers. High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization was performed to delineate the genomic alterations in clinically annotated primary gingivo-buccal complex and tongue cancers (n = 60). The specific genomic alterations so identified were evaluated for their potential clinical relevance. Copy-number changes were observed on chromosomal arms with most frequent gains on 3q (60%), 5p (50%), 7p (50%), 8q (73%), 11q13 (47%), 14q11.2 (47%), and 19p13.3 (58%) and losses on 3p14.2 (55%) and 8p (83%). Univariate statistical analysis with correction for multiple testing revealed chromosomal gain of region 11q22.1-q22.2 and losses of 17p13.3 and 11q23-q25 to be associated with loco-regional recurrence (P = 0.004, P = 0.003, and P = 0.0003) and shorter survival (P = 0.009, P = 0.003, and P 0.0001) respectively. The gain of 11q22 and loss of 11q23-q25 were validated by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (I-FISH). This study identifies a tractable number of genomic alterations with few underlying genes that may potentially be utilized as biological markers for prognosis and treatment decisions in oral cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2041544712,"Background Several studies report an amplitude reduction of the error negativity (Ne or ERN), an event-related potential occurring after erroneous responses, in older participants. In earlier studies it was shown that the Ne can be explained by a single independent component. In the present study we aimed to investigate whether the Ne reduction usually found in older subjects is due to an altered component structure, i.e., a true alteration in response monitoring in older subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings Two age groups conducted two tasks with different stimulus response mappings and task difficulty. Both groups received fully balanced speed or accuracy instructions and an individually adapted deadline in both tasks. Event-related potentials, Independent Component analysis of EEG-data and between trial variability of the Ne were combined with analysis of error rates, coefficients of variation of RT-data and ex-Gaussian fittings to reaction times. The Ne was examined by means of ICA and PCA, yielding a prominent independent component on error trials, the Ne-IC. The Ne-IC was smaller in the older than the younger subjects for both speed and accuracy instructions. Also, the Ne-IC contributed to a much lesser extent to the Ne in older than in younger subjects. RT distribution parameters were not related to Ne/ERP-variability. Conclusions/Significance The results show a genuine reduction as well as a different component structure of the Ne in older compared to young subjects. This reduction is not reflected in behaviour, apart from a general slowing of older participants. Also, the Ne decline in the elderly is not due to speed accuracy trade-off. Hence, the results indicate that older subjects can compensate the reduction in control reflected in the reduced Ne, at least in simple tasks that induce reaction slips."
https://openalex.org/W2032688343,"Background The membrane arm of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) contains three large, and closely related subunits, which are called L, M, and N in E. coli. These subunits are homologous to components of multi-subunit Na+/H+ antiporters, and so are implicated in proton translocation. Methodology/Principal Findings Nineteen site-specific mutations were constructed at two corresponding positions in each of the three subunits. Two positions were selected in each subunit: L_K169, M_K173, N_K158 and L_Q236, M_H241, N_H224. Membrane vesicles were prepared from all of the resulting mutant strains, and were assayed for deamino-NADH oxidase activity, proton translocation, ferricyanide reductase activity, and sensitivity to capsaicin. Corresponding mutations in the three subunits were found to have very similar effects on all activities measured. In addition, the effect of adding exogenous decylubiquinone on these activities was tested. 50 µM decylubiquinone stimulated both deamino-NADH oxidase activity and proton translocation by wild type membrane vesicles, but was inhibitory towards the same activities by membrane vesicles bearing the lysine substitution at the L236/M241/N224 positions. Conclusions/Significance The results show a close correlation with reduced activity among the corresponding mutations, and provide evidence that the L, M, and N subunits have a common role in Complex I."

However, the reasons have not been studied. The goal of the current study was to examine the neural alterations in pancreatic cancer patients with hyperglycemia and to identify the relationship between the neural alterations and perineural invasion.The clinical and pathological features of 61 formalin-fixed pancreatic cancer specimens and 10 normal pancreases as controls were analyzed. Furthermore, the expression of Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP9.5), Myelin P0 protein (MPP), NGF, TrkA, and p75 were examined by immunohistochemistry. The median number of nerves, the median area of neural tissue, and the median nerve diameter per 10 mm(2) were larger in the hyperglycemia group than those in the euglycemia group (p = 0.007, p = 0.009, and p = 0.004, respectively). The integrated optical density (IOD) of MPP staining was lower in the hyperglycemia group than those in the euglycemia group (p = 0.019), while the expression levels of NGF and p75 were higher in the hyperglycemia group than those in the euglycemia group (p = 0.002, and p = 0.026, respectively). The nerve bundle invasion of pancreatic cancer was more frequent in the hyperglycemia group than in the euglycemia group (p = 0.000).Nerve damage and regeneration occur simultaneously in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer patients with hyperglycemia; the simultaneous occurrence may aggravate the process of perineural invasion. The abnormal expression of NGF and p75 may also be involved in this process and subsequently lead to a lower rate of curative surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2023961122,"Abnormalities in the electrocardiographic QT interval duration have been associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. However, there is substantial uncertainty about the effect of modifiable factors such as coffee intake, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity on QT interval duration.We studied 7795 men and women from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994). Baseline QT interval was measured from the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram. Coffee and tea intake, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activities over the past month, and lifetime smoking habits were determined using validated questionnaires during the home interview.In the fully adjusted model, the average differences in QT interval comparing participants drinking ≥6 cups/day to those who did not drink any were -1.2 ms (95% CI -4.4 to 2.0) for coffee, and -2.0 ms (-11.2 to 7.3) for tea, respectively. The average differences in QT interval duration comparing current to never smokers was 1.2 ms (-0.6 to 2.9) while the average difference in QT interval duration comparing participants drinking ≥7 drinks/week to non-drinkers was 1.8 ms (-0.5 to 4.0). The age, race/ethnicity, and RR-interval adjusted differences in average QT interval duration comparing men with binge drinking episodes to non-drinkers or drinkers without binge drinking were 2.8 ms (0.4 to 5.3) and 4.0 ms (1.6 to 6.4), respectively. The corresponding differences in women were 1.1 (-2.9 to 5.2) and 1.7 ms (-2.3 to 5.7). Finally, the average differences in QT interval comparing the highest vs. the lowest categories of total physical activity was -0.8 ms (-3.0 to 1.4).Binge drinking was associated with longer QT interval in men but not in women.

https://openalex.org/W2013692549,"Toll and Toll-like receptors represent families of receptors involved in mediating innate immunity response in insects and mammals. Although Drosophila proteome contains multiple Toll paralogs, Toll-1 is, so far, the only receptor to which an immune role has been attributed. In contrast, every single mammalian TLR is a key membrane receptor upstream of the vertebrate immune signaling cascades. The prevailing view is that TLR-mediated immunity is ancient. Structural analysis reveals that Drosophila Toll-9 is the most closely related to vertebrate TLRs and utilizes similar signaling components as Toll-1. This suggests that Toll-9 could be an ancestor of TLR-like receptors and could have immune function. Consistently, it has been reported that over-expression of Toll-9 in immune tissues is sufficient to induce the expression of some antimicrobial peptides in flies. These results have led to the idea that Toll-9 could be a constitutively active receptor that maintain significant levels of antimicrobial molecules and therefore provide constant basal protection against micro-organisms. To test theses hypotheses, we generated and analyzed phenotypes associated with a complete loss-of-function allele of Toll-9. Our results suggest that Toll-9 is neither required to maintain a basal anti-microbial response nor to mount an efficient immune response to bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W1992147491,"Background There is limited data on the epidemiology of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) in rural sub-Saharan Africa. A prospective observational cohort study was conducted to assess the incidence, clinical characteristics, outcome and predictors of IRIS in rural Mozambique. Methods One hundred and thirty-six consecutive antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naïve HIV-1-infected patients initiating ART at the Manhiça district hospital were prospectively followed for development of IRIS over 16 months. Survival analysis by Cox regression was performed to identify pre-ART predictors of IRIS development. Results Thirty-six patients developed IRIS [26.5%, incidence rate 3.1 cases/100 persons-month of ART (95% CI 2.2–4.3)]. Median time to IRIS onset was 62 days from ART initiation (IQR 35.5–93.5). Twenty-five cases (69.4%) were “unmasking”, 10 (27.8%) were “paradoxical”, and 1 (2.8%) developed a paradoxical worsening followed by the unmasking of another condition. Systemic OI (OI-IRIS) accounted for 47% (17/36) of IRIS cases, predominantly of KS (8 cases) and TB (6 cases) IRIS. Mucocutaneous IRIS manifestations (MC-IRIS) accounted for 53% (19/36) of IRIS events, mostly tinea (9 cases) and herpes simplex infection (3 cases). Multivariate analysis identified two independent predictors of IRIS development: pre-ART CD4 count <50 cells/µl (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.19–4.44, p = 0.01) and body mass index (BMI) <18.5 (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.07–4.3, p = 0.03). The pre-cART proportion of activated T-cells, as well as the immunologic and virologic response to ART were not associated with IRIS development. All patients continued on ART, 7 (19.4%) required hospitalization and there were 3 deaths (8.3%) attributable to IRIS. Conclusions IRIS is common in patients initiating ART in rural Mozambique. Pre-ART CD4 counts and BMI can easily be assessed at ART initiation in rural sub-Saharan Africa to identify patients at high risk of IRIS, for whom close supervision is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2136320805,"The internalization of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, by phagocytes is essential for an effective activation of the immune response to this pathogen. The intracellular, cytosolic receptor Nod2 has been shown to play varying roles in either enhancing or attenuating inflammation in response to different infectious agents. We examined the role of Nod2 in responses to B. burgdorferi. In vitro stimulation of Nod2 deficient bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) resulted in decreased induction of multiple cytokines, interferons and interferon regulated genes compared with wild-type cells. However, B. burgdorferi infection of Nod2 deficient mice resulted in increased rather than decreased arthritis and carditis compared to control mice. We explored multiple potential mechanisms for the paradoxical response in in vivo versus in vitro systems and found that prolonged stimulation with a Nod2 ligand, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), resulted in tolerance to stimulation by B. burgdorferi. This tolerance was lost with stimulation of Nod2 deficient cells that cannot respond to MDP. Cytokine patterns in the tolerance model closely paralleled cytokine profiles in infected Nod2 deficient mice. We propose a model where Nod2 has an enhancing role in activating inflammation in early infection, but moderates inflammation after prolonged exposure to the organism through induction of tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1967637189,"The transmembrane adaptor protein Cbp (or PAG1) functions as a suppressor of Src-mediated tumor progression by promoting the inactivation of Src. The expression of Cbp is down-regulated in Src-transformed cells and in various human cancer cells, suggesting a potential role for Cbp as a tumor suppressor. However, the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of Cbp remain unknown. The present study shows that Cbp expression is down-regulated by epigenetic histone modifications via the MAPK/PI3K pathway. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, transformation by oncogenic Src and Ras induced a marked down-regulation of Cbp expression. The levels of Cbp expression were inversely correlated with the activity of MEK and Akt, and Cbp down-regulation was suppressed by inhibiting MEK and PI3K. Src transformation did not affect the stability of Cbp mRNA, the transcriptional activity of the cbp promoter, or the DNA methylation status of the cbp promoter CpG islands. However, Cbp expression was restored by treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC1/2. Src transformation significantly decreased the acetylation levels of histone H4 and increased the trimethylation levels of histone H3 lysine 27 in the cbp promoter. EGF-induced Cbp down-regulation was also suppressed by inhibiting MEK and HDAC.

The cytoplasmic domain of Cbp contains palmitoylation sites that are required for localization to a cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomain and multiple tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated by Src family kinases (SFKs). Upon phosphorylation by SFKs, Cbp associates with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a negative regulator of SFKs, through a specific site (Tyr-317 in humans) and brings it into proximity with membrane-associated SFKs. Csk then phosphorylates the C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine residue of SFKs, which suppresses their activation. Thus, Cbp acts as a scaffold in the Csk-mediated negative regulation of SFKs.

Among these, c-Src, Fyn, and c-Yes are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the others are expressed mainly in the immune system.

However, the mechanisms underlying Cbp down-regulation in cancer cells remain unknown. To elucidate the mechanisms that mediate the down-regulation of Cbp expression, the potential contribution of the oncogenic signaling pathway acting downstream of Src and Ras, was examined based on prior findings showing that Ras- and EGF-mediated transformation can also induce Cbp down-regulation. The present study shows that Cbp is down-regulated by an epigenetic mechanism involving the deacetylation/methylation of histones, but not DNA methylation, in the cbp promoter via the activation of MAPK/PI3K pathways.

Anti-Cbp antibody was generated as described previously (1Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared using Sepasol (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto) and reverse transcribed using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). Real-Time PCR was performed as described (27Yagi R. Waguri S. Sumikawa Y. Nada S. Oneyama C. Itami S. Schmedt C. Uchiyama Y. Okada M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Relative values of the ratio of Cbp mRNA to a control GAPDH mRNA are evaluated in all the experiments. Gene-specific primers for mouse Cbp (ID: Mm00474700_m1), GAPDH (ID: Mm99999915_g1), human Cbp (ID: Hs00179693_m1*) and GAPDH (ID: Hs99999905_m1) were obtained from Applied Biosystems. The mouse cbp promoter sequence (−3000/+50) and the GAPDH promoter sequence (−1000/+50) were amplified by PCR from the mouse genome extracted from MEFs and then subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid PGV-B2 (Toyo Ink, Tokyo). The cbp promoter deletion series was generated by a PCR-based procedure. For luciferase assays, cells were co-transfected with a promoter construct along with the control plasmid pRL-TK (Toyo Ink, Tokyo). Cells were harvested 24h after transfection and luciferase activities were measured using PicaGene DualSeaPansy Luminescence kit (Toyo Ink, Tokyo). Sodium bisulfite modification of genomic DNA was conducted using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Briefly, cells were fixed in culture medium with formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) for 10 min. After washing with cold PBS, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) and incubated for 10 min on ice. DNA was sheared into 200–1000bp fragments by sonication. The fragments were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibody against acetyl-histone H3 (Upstate), acetyl-histone H4 (Upstate), histone H3 (Cell Signaling), H3K9me3 (ACTIVE MOTIF), and H3K27me3 (ACTIVE MOTIF). DNA extraction was performed using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The samples were analyzed by Real-Time PCR using SYBR Premix Ex TaqGC (TAKARA BIO, Ohtsu). Primers used for amplification were as follows: 5′-CTG GGA CCC TAA GGC AGT TC-3′ and 5′-AGG GCT GGT GAC CAA AAA CT-3′. A previous study revealed that Cbp protein and mRNA expression were down-regulated by Src transformation (11Oneyama C. Hikita T. Enya K. Dobenecker M.W. Saito K. Nada S. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 426-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To address the mechanisms underlying Cbp down-regulation, we first examined the effects of serum stimulation on Cbp expression. MEFs were cultured in the absence of serum overnight, followed by stimulation with 10% FBS for 24 h. Although there was a slight up-regulation of Cbp mRNA expression within 3 h after stimulation, Cbp expression was decreased by about 50% within 6 h after stimulation and the reduced levels were sustained up to 24 h (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the expression of Cbp can be regulated through growth-promoting signaling pathways activated by serum. To define the pathways, the effects of introducing K-Ras G12D, H-Ras G12V, and v-Src, which are oncoproteins that activate growth-promoting signals, were examined. MEFs expressing these molecules were cultured under low (0.5%) serum conditions, and the expression levels of Cbp mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein (Fig. 1C) as well as the activity status of signaling molecules were determined (Fig. 1C). The expression of all these molecules induced a dramatic reduction of Cbp expression. In these cells, there was significant activation of ERK and Akt. The expression of cyclin D1, which reflects ERK activation in the nucleus, was also induced by the expression of these oncogenic molecules. These observations suggest that Cbp down-regulation correlates with the activation of the growth-promoting, oncogenic signaling pathways, namely the ERK MAPK and/or Akt pathways. To evaluate the contribution of the ERK MAPK pathway, Cbp expression was examined in MEFs overexpressing wild-type MEK1 (MEK1 WT), a constitutively active mutant with a substitution of Ser-218/222 for Asp (MEK1 CA) or a kinase-deficient mutant with a substitution of Ser-218 for Ala (MEK1 DN) under low serum conditions (Fig. 1D). The overexpression of MEK WT and MEK1 CA significantly down-regulated Cbp expression, while that of MEK1 DN did not. The expression levels of Cbp correlated with the activity status of ERK (Fig. 1D, lower panels). Because the negative effect of MEK1 DN was thought to be due to the low level of basal ERK activity under low serum conditions, the effect of MEK1 DN was re-examined under high (10%) serum conditions (Fig. 1E). Under these conditions, the expression of MEK1 DN successfully suppressed ERK activity and induced an apparent up-regulation of Cbp expression. Overall, the tight correlation between Cbp mRNA expression and ERK MAPK pathway activity suggests that the Cbp down-regulation is at least partially mediated by the ERK MAPK pathway. In support of the above possibility, another form of the constitutively active mutant of MEK (LA-SDSE) was able to significantly suppress Cbp expression (Fig. 2A). The potential contribution of the Akt pathway was also examined by introducing a constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt). In agreement with the activation of Akt, Cbp expression was dramatically down-regulated under these conditions, even though there was no activation of the ERK MAPK pathway (Fig. 2A). We also found that the treatment of MEFs with a MEK inhibitor (U0126) and a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190), but not a JNK inhibitor (SP600125), significantly canceled the repression of Cbp expression (Fig. 2B); this indicates that the p38 MAPK pathway can also participate in Cbp down-regulation. Furthermore, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) effectively restored Cbp expression to a level similar to that gained with a Src inhibitor (PP2). These findings show that Cbp down-regulation can be achieved through multiple signaling pathways that include the ERK MAPK, p38 MAPK, and PI3K-Akt pathways, all of which are located downstream of the Src and Ras oncoproteins. The ERK MAPK pathway is activated by various extracellular signals, such as growth factors and cytokines, and plays a crucial role in diverse physiological processes. To examine if the activation of the ERK MAPK pathway under physiological conditions would lead to Cbp down-regulation, Cbp mRNA levels were determined in MEFs stimulated with EGF, PDGF, TNF-α, or IL-1β (Fig. 3A). Stimulation with EGF significantly induced the down-regulation of Cbp expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). PDGF and TNF-α had a similar effect but to a lesser extent (Fig. 3A). Kinetic analysis showed that the down-regulation of Cbp mRNA and protein became appreciable 3 h after EGF stimulation and reached a plateau 12 h after stimulation (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that Cbp down-regulation is induced by EGF stimulation and that this process occurs at a later phase of cell signaling because EGF-induced activation of the ERK MAPK pathway is terminated within 1 h (data not shown). To confirm the relevance of the ERK MAPK pathway to EGF-induced Cbp down-regulation, the effect of MEK inhibition was examined. MEFs were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor U0126, followed by EGF stimulation for 24 h. Analysis of Cbp mRNA levels showed that the inhibition of MEK robustly reversed EGF-induced Cbp down-regulation. In a previous study, an experimental system that uses MEFs lacking Csk (Csk−/− cells) was developed for the analysis of c-Src function (13Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 15Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Csk−/− cells are not morphologically transformed, but exogenous expression of wild-type c-Src can efficiently induce their transformation (16Oneyama C. Hikita T. Nada S. Okada M. Genes to Cells. 2008; 13: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the c-src gene is rarely mutated in human cancer (9Irby R.B. Mao W. Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M. Trudeau W. Karl R. Fujita D.J. Jove R. Yeatman T.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 10Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), this system can serve as an excellent model to analyze the function of c-Src up-regulation in human cancers. Cbp was also found to be dramatically down-regulated by c-Src transformation in this system (11Oneyama C. Hikita T. Enya K. Dobenecker M.W. Saito K. Nada S. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 426-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This system was therefore used to analyze the mechanism of Cbp down-regulation induced by c-Src up-regulation. The levels of mRNA can be controlled by the efficiencies of mRNA synthesis and degradation. To examine whether c-Src-induced Cbp down-regulation is caused by a decrease in Cbp mRNA stability, the half-life of Cbp mRNA was analyzed in c-Src-transformed Csk−/− cells (c-Src), nontransformed Csk−/− cells expressing Csk (Csk), and normal MEFs (Csk+/+) (Fig. 4). These cells were treated with actinomycin D to inhibit transcriptional initiation, and Cbp mRNA levels were determined at various time points (Fig. 4A). The half-life of Cbp mRNA in all cell types was ∼3 h (Fig. 4B), indicating that there were no significant differences in Cbp mRNA stability. These results show that c-Src up-regulation does not affect Cbp mRNA stability. To examine whether c-Src-induced Cbp down-regulation is caused by a decrease in the efficiency of mRNA transcription regulated by transcription factors, the effects of c-Src transformation on cbp promoter activity were analyzed. Luciferase reporter assays were performed using the promoter region (3 kbp) upstream of the transcriptional initiation site of the cbp gene and its deletion constructs. Results showed that promoter activity was present in the region between −100 and +50 bp, but that there were no significant differences in promoter activity between c-Src-transformed and nontransformed cells (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained with EGF-stimulated and unstimulated MEFs (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that the activation of c-Src and EGF signaling does not affect the activity of transcription factors that regulate the promoter activity of the cbp gene. The contribution of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation, to Cbp down-regulation was examined. These mechanisms affect DNA transcription by remodeling chromatin structure (17Sharma S. Kelly T.K. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar, 18Margueron R. Reinberg D. Nature. 2011; 469: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The c-Src-transformed Csk−/− cells (c-Src) and nontransformed Csk−-expressing cells (Csk) were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and/or the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), and Cbp mRNA levels were determined (Fig. 5A). TSA treatment restored Cbp mRNA levels in both cell types, and the effect was greatly enhanced in c-Src transformed cells, suggesting the involvement of histone deacetylation in Cbp down-regulation. Essentially the same results were obtained when the cells were treated with another HDAC inhibitor, Scriptaid (data not shown). To examine the contribution of histone deacetylation, the effects of the siRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC family members, HDAC1/2/3, were examined (Fig. 5B). Knockdown of HDAC1, but not HDAC2 or HDAC3, caused significant up-regulation of Cbp expression; this indicates that HDAC1 is responsible for Cbp down-regulation. However, there was a synergistic effect when HDAC1 siRNA was used in combination with HDAC2 siRNA, which suggest that there is functional redundancy between HDAC1 and HDAC2. Conversely, overexpression of HDAC1 induced the repression of Cbp expression, and Cbp up-regulation induced by HDAC1/2 siRNA was abrogated by the expression of siRNA-resistant human HDAC1 (Fig. 5C). These findings strongly suggest that HDAC1/2-mediated histone deacetylation is involved in Cbp down-regulation. In c-Src-transformed cells, treatment with 5-Aza-dC failed to restore Cbp mRNA expression, while combination with TSA caused a slight additive effect (Fig. 5A). This suggests a potential involvement of DNA methylation in c-Src-induced Cbp down-regulation. To evaluate this possibility, the methylation status of the CpG islands in the cbp promoter was examined by bisulfite sequencing. The CpG islands were equally hypomethylated in these cell types (data not shown). These results suggest that histone deaceylation is the major, if not the only, cause of Cbp down-regulation in c-Src-transformed MEFs. To further confirm that c-Src activation induces histone deacetylation in the cbp promoter, the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 in the cbp promoter was examined by the ChIP assay (Fig. 5D). A significant decrease in the acetylation of histone H4 was observed in c-Src-transformed cells, whereas the acetylation of histone H3 was only moderately decreased by c-Src transformation. These results suggest that c-Src activation promotes the deacetylation of histone H4 and, to a lesser extent, histone H3 associated with the cbp promoter, which may be associated with the suppression of Cbp mRNA transcription. Histone methylation is also known to be involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (18Margueron R. Reinberg D. Nature. 2011; 469: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 19Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Science. 2002; 298: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (2842) Google Scholar). The trimethylation status of histone H3 lysines 27 (H3K27me3) and 9 (H3K9me3), which mark transcriptionally silent chromatin, was examined in the cbp promoter by ChIP assay. Although there was no dramatic change in H3K9me3, the level of H3K27me3 was significantly increased in c-Src-transformed cells (Fig. 5E). This suggests that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated gene silencing (18Margueron R. Reinberg D. Nature. 2011; 469: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar) may also be activated in these cells. To assess whether EGF-induced down-regulation of Cbp expression is also controlled by epigenetic mechanisms, MEFs treated with 5-Aza-dC and/or TSA were stimulated with or without EGF, and Cbp mRNA levels in these cells were assessed (Fig. 5F). Treatment with 5-Aza-dC did not affect Cbp mRNA down-regulation, whereas treatment with TSA restored Cbp expression. Combination treatment with 5-Aza-dC and TSA did not show any additive effect. These results demonstrate that histone deacetylation is also involved in EGF-induced Cbp down-regulation. The above results suggest that c-Src-induced deacetylation and methylation of histones associated with the cbp promoter results in the down-regulation of Cbp mRNA transcription. In a previous study, Cbp mRNA was shown to be down-regulated in several cancer cell lines and tumor tissues (11Oneyama C. Hikita T. Enya K. Dobenecker M.W. Saito K. Nada S. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 426-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To examine whether the above mentioned epigenetic mechanisms are indeed functional in human cancer cells, the effects of the inhibition of the ERK MAPK pathway were tested in the colon cancer cell line HT29 and the lung cancer cell line A549, both of which harbor c-Src up-regulation and substantial down-regulation of Cbp (11Oneyama C. Hikita T. Enya K. Dobenecker M.W. Saito K. Nada S. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 426-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). The breast cancer cell line MCF7, which has Cbp down-regulation but has no c-Src up-regulation (11Oneyama C. Hikita T. Enya K. Dobenecker M.W. Saito K. Nada S. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 426-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was also studied (Fig. 6A). Treatment with U0126 restored the expression of Cbp in A549 and HT29 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, although a higher concentration of U0126 was required for A549 cells. These results indicate that Cbp down-regulation is mediated by the ERK MAPK pathway in some cancer cells as well. However, treatment with U0126 suppressed Cbp expression in MCF7 cells, which suggests that the contribution of the ERK MAPK pathway is cell context-dependent and potentially dependent on the patterns of activated oncoproteins. Treatment of these cancer cells with 5-Aza-dC and/or TSA also exhibited cell type-dependent effects (Fig. 6B). In A549 cells, treatment with 5-Aza-dC or TSA restored Cbp expression and the combination of 5-Aza-dC and TSA induced the synergistic up-regulation of Cbp expression. In HT29 cells, TSA treatment restored Cbp expression, but 5-Aza-dC treatment did not affect Cbp expression. MCF7 cells showed a response similar to that of A549 cells. The positive effects of 5-Aza-dC in A549 and MCF7 cells suggest that DNA methylation might contribute to Cbp down-regulation in these cells. However, the CpG islands in the promoter region of the cbp gene were equally hypomethylated in these cell types (Fig. 6C), which indicates that the effects of treatment with 5-Aza-Dc might be elicited by an indirect mechanism. These findings suggest that, although signaling pathways may vary among cancer types, histone modification is one of the major causes of Cbp down-regulation in some cancer cells. A wide range of genes has been shown to be up-regulated or down-regulated in cancer cells. Some of these down-regulated genes are tumor suppressors. Epigenetic modifications are involved in the down-regulation of some of these tumor suppressors (17Sharma S. Kelly T.K. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). The main epigenetic modifications in mammals are DNA methylation and histone modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc.). A number of studies show that tumor suppressors are transcriptionally silenced through hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands (20Baylin S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 106 (discussion 143–160): 85-87Google Scholar, 21Yan P.S. Chen C.M. Shi H. Rahmatpanah F. Wei S.H. Caldwell C.W. Huang T.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8375-8380PubMed Google Scholar) and/or modifications of promoter-associated histones (17Sharma S. Kelly T.K. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). The present study showed that Cbp, which functions as a suppressor of Src-mediated tumor progression, is down-regulated by an epigenetic mechanism involving deacetylation/methylation of histones, but not DNA methylation, via the activation of the oncogenic MAPK/PI3K pathways (Fig. 7). Although the mechanisms by which these pathways regulate histone deacetylases, e.g. HDAC1, or histone methylase complexes, e.g. PRC2 (18Margueron R. Reinberg D. Nature. 2011; 469: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), remain unknown, understanding the molecular link between these pathways and the regulation of histone modification would provide new insights into the molecular basis of cancer-related alterations of gene expression through chromatin remodeling. The genes down-regulated by an oncogenic form of Src, v-Src, have been studied extensively. The neuroretina specific gene QR1 is transcriptionally down-regulated by a v-Src-responsive element (22Pierani A. Pouponnot C. Calothy G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3401-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene (vhl) and 3Y1 tumor suppressor gene (tsg) are also down-regulated by v-Src (23Sung J. Turner J. McCarthy S. Enkemann S. Li C.G. Yan P. Huang T. Yeatman T.J. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In these cases, v-Src up-regulates the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1, resulting in the hypermethylation of the vhl and tsg promoters. The scaffolding protein SSeCKS, which functions as a suppressor of tumorigenesis and metastasis, is down-regulated by v-Src and oncogenic Ras (24Bu Y. Gelman I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26725-26739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). v-Src down-regulates SSeCKS expression by facilitating the recruitment of HDAC1 to its promoter, which results in a decrease in the acetylation of histones H3 and H4. In the present study, Src transformation was shown to down-regulate Cbp by promoting the deacetylation of histone H4 in the cbp promoter through HDAC1/2. In this context, the mechanism of Cbp down-regulation appears similar to that of SSeCKS down-regulation. In the case of SSeCKS, however, v-Src can inhibit the expression of SSeCKS by recruiting Sp1/Sp3 to the SSeCKS promoter, while the activity of the cbp promoter itself is not affected by the activation of c-Src or EGF signaling. Moreover, activation of Raf, which is a component of the MAPK pathway, does not decrease SSeCKS expression, which suggests that the activation of the MAPK pathway is not sufficient for SSeCKS down-regulation. Although there are some inconsistencies, SSeCKS and Cbp may share a common regulatory mechanism mediated by Src-induced histone deacetylation in their promoter regions. A comparative analysis of the mechanisms involved in Cbp and SSeCKS down-regulation would help elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with the Src-mediated regulation of particular sets of tumor suppressor genes. The present study showed that the activation of the ERK MAPK pathway contributes to Cbp down-regulation. This is consistent with observations that Cbp is down-regulated in cells transformed by various oncogenes, including c-Src, v-Src, H-Ras, and K-Ras, all of which activate the ERK MAPK pathway. We also observed that Cbp was down-regulated in various human cancer cells harboring c-Src up-regulation and Ras mutations (11Oneyama C. Hikita T. Enya K. Dobenecker M.W. Saito K. Nada S. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 426-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, growth factors and cytokines that activate the ERK MAPK pathway, such as EGF, PDGF, and TNFα, caused Cbp down-regulation. Up-regulation and/or hyperactivation of such growth factors and cytokines and their receptors are frequently detected in cancers as well as in other cellular processes such as cell growth, inflammation, and development, which implies that these events might also be associated with Cbp down-regulation. These findings suggest that the ERK MAPK pathway contributes to Cbp down-regulation even under physiological conditions. We showed that the PI3K and p38 MAPK pathways, which are also activated by various cytokines, were likely to participate in Cbp down-regulation. Since these pathways are known to affect gene transcription, common factors downstream of these oncogenic pathways might activate critical molecules that induce the epigenetic down-regulation of Cbp. Alternatively, these pathways might be differentially utilized in different cell types. These observations suggest that Cbp expression can be regulated through multiple pathways activated not only by pathological processes, such as cancer progression and chronic inflammation, and by normal physiological cellular events, such as cell growth and differentiation/development. Therefore, analysis of Cbp down-regulation mechanisms would shed new light on the physiological functions of Cbp in regulating signaling pathways, particularly the c-Src-MAPK/PI3K pathway. The down-regulation of Cbp, a suppressor of Src-mediated transformation, by c-Src activation is seemingly contradictory. However, the present results showed that full Cbp down-regulation requires a longer time (>12 h) than MAPK pathway activation (<1 h). This phenomenon could be due to the amount of time required for stable histone modification-mediated transcriptionally silencing. Therefore, during acute cell stimulation, Cbp is able to function as a suppressor of transiently activated c-Src; however, when Cbp is down-regulated epigenetically under chronic conditions, c-Src can no longer be suppressed by Cbp and exhibits constitutive activity. This suggests that the epigenetic silencing of Cbp would in turn create a positive feedback mechanism for c-Src: hyperactivation of c-Src-related pathways promotes chronic cellular events that induce epigenetic down-regulation of Cbp, resulting in the further activation of c-Src. Thus, it is likely that Cbp down-regulation occurs only under chronic conditions, such as cancer, inflammation, and development, which accompany a global shift in gene expression patterns via the epigenetic mechanisms. Treatment of A549 and MCF7 cells with TSA or 5-Aza-dC up-regulated Cbp mRNA expression, and treatment with both inhibitors showed synergistic effects. This result suggests that the activity of the cbp promoter in these cells can be down-regulated not only by histone modification but also by DNA methylation. However, analysis of DNA methylation showed that the cbp promoter CpG islands were hypomethylated in these cells. Cancer cells contain localized hypermethylation at CpG islands (25Goelz S.E. Vogelstein B. Hamilton S.R. Feinberg A.P. Science. 1985; 228: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), which is associated with the transcriptional inactivation of various cancer-related genes besides tumor suppressor genes (20Baylin S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 106 (discussion 143–160): 85-87Google Scholar, 21Yan P.S. Chen C.M. Shi H. Rahmatpanah F. Wei S.H. Caldwell C.W. Huang T.H.

It is thus likely that 5-Aza-dC may target other genes that are indirectly involved in repressing Cbp expression, although the possibility that other distal elements of the cbp gene might be regulated by DNA methylation could not be excluded. In contrast, the treatment of HT29 cells with 5-Aza-dC did not affect Cbp expression, which indicates that the cbp promoter is down-regulated predominantly by histone modification in HT29 cells. Overall, these findings suggest that the cbp gene is not directly silenced by DNA methylation and that histone modification is the primary mechanism for suppressing Cbp expression at least in a subset of cancer cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the involvement of epigenetic histone modifications, activated through multiple oncogenic pathways, in the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor Cbp. These findings suggest that elements involved in the aberrant positive feedback loop created by Cbp down-regulation, which consists of c-Src-related oncogenic signaling pathways and histone modifiers, could serve as potential targets for the development of anticancer therapeutics against human cancers harboring c-Src up-regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2023821657,"Background S-phase kinase protein 2 (Skp2), an F-box protein, targets cell cycle regulators via ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Skp2 is frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancers and associated with patient survival. In melanoma, however, the prognostic significance of subcellular Skp2 expression remains controversial. Methods To investigate the role of Skp2 in melanoma development, we constructed tissue microarrays and examined Skp2 expression in melanocytic lesions at different stages, including 30 normal nevi, 61 dysplastic nevi, 290 primary melanomas and 146 metastatic melanomas. The TMA was assessed for cytoplasmic and nuclear Skp2 expression by immunohistochemistry. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate the patient survival. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were performed to estimate the harzard ratios (HR) at five-year follow-up. Results Cytoplasmic but not nuclear Skp2 expression was gradually increased from normal nevi, dysplastic nevi, primary melanomas to metastatic melanomas. Cytoplasmic Skp2 expression correlated with AJCC stages (I vs II–IV, P<0.001), tumor thickness (≤2.00 vs >2.00 mm, P<0.001) and ulceration (P = 0.005). Increased cytoplasmic Skp2 expression was associated with a poor five-year disease-specific survival of patients with primary melanoma (P = 0.018) but not metastatic melanoma (P>0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that cytoplasmic Skp2 plays an important role in melanoma pathogenesis and its expression correlates with patient survival. Our data indicate that cytoplasmic Skp2 may serve as a potential biomarker for melanoma progression and a therapeutic target for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2081628084,"Background TGF-β has been known to play an important role in various liver diseases including fibrosis and alcohol-induced fatty liver. Smad7 is an intracellular negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. It is currently unclear whether endogenous Smad7 has an effect on liver function and alcoholic liver damage. Methodology/Principal Findings We used Cre/loxP system by crossing Alb-Cre mice with Smad7loxP/loxP mice to generate liver-specific deletion of Smad7 with loss of the indispensable MH2 domain. Alcoholic liver injury was achieved by feeding mice with a liquid diet containing 5% ethanol for 6 weeks, followed by a single dose of ethanol gavage. Deletion of Smad7 in the liver was associated with increased Smad2/3 phosphorylation in the liver or upon TGF-β treatment in primary hepatocytes. The majority of mice with liver specific deletion of Smad7 (Smad7liver-KO) were viable and phenotypically normal, accompanied by only slight or no reduction of Smad7 expression in the liver. However, about 30% of Smad7liver-KO mice with high efficiency of Smad7 deletion had spontaneous liver dysfunction, demonstrated as low body weight, overall deterioration, and increased serum levels of AST and ALT. Degeneration and elevated apoptosis of liver cells were observed with these mice. TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) was accelerated in Smad7-deleted primary hepatocytes. In addition, alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis were profoundly aggravated in Smad7 deficient mice, associated with upregulation of critical genes involved in lipogenesis and inflammation. Furthermore, alcohol-induced ADH1 expression was significantly abrogated by Smad7 deletion in hepatocytes. Conclusion/Significance In this study, we provided in vivo evidence revealing that endogenous Smad7 plays an important role in liver function and alcohol-induced liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2006575363,"The Rho family of small GTPases are essential during early embryonic development making it difficult to study their functions in adult animals. Using inducible transgenes expressing either a constitutively active version of the single C. elegans Rho ortholog, RHO-1, or an inhibitor of endogenous Rho (C3 transferase), we demonstrate multiple defects caused by altering Rho signaling in adult C. elegans. Changes in RHO-1 signaling in cholinergic neurons affected locomotion, pharyngeal pumping and fecundity. Changes in RHO-1 signaling outside the cholinergic neurons resulted in defective defecation, ovulation, and changes in C. elegans body morphology. Finally both increased and decreased RHO-1 signaling in adults resulted in death within hours. The multiple post-developmental roles for Rho in C. elegans demonstrate that RhoA signaling pathways continue to be used post-developmentally and the resulting phenotypes provide an opportunity to further study post-developmental Rho signaling pathways using genetic screens."
https://openalex.org/W2075163002,"Divergent natural selection rooted in differential resource use can generate and maintain intraspecific eco-morphological divergence (i.e., resource polymorphism), ultimately leading to population splitting and speciation. Differing bottom environments create lake habitats with different benthos communities, which may cause selection in benthivorous fishes. Here, we document the nature of eco-morphological and genetic divergence among local populations of the Japanese gudgeon Sarcocheilichthys (Cyprinidae), which inhabits contrasting habitats in the littoral zones (rocky vs. pebbly habitats) in Lake Biwa, a representative ancient lake in East Asia. Eco-morphological analyses revealed that Sarcocheilichthys variegatus microoculus from rocky and pebbly zones differed in morphology and diet, and that populations from rocky environments had longer heads and deeper bodies, which are expected to be advantageous for capturing cryptic and/or attached prey in structurally complex, rocky habitats. Sarcocheilichthys biwaensis, a rock-dwelling specialist, exhibited similar morphologies to the sympatric congener, S. v. microoculus, except for body/fin coloration. Genetic analyses based on mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite DNA data revealed no clear genetic differentiation among local populations within/between the gudgeon species. Although the morphogenetic factors that contribute to morphological divergence remain unclear, our results suggest that the gudgeon populations in Lake Biwa show a state of resource polymorphism associated with differences in the bottom environment. This is a novel example of resource polymorphism in fish within an Asian ancient lake, emphasizing the importance and generality of feeding adaptation as an evolutionary mechanism that generates morphological diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2036644751,"Rationale The endurance time (Tend) during constant-workrate cycling exercise (CET) is highly variable in COPD. We investigated pulmonary and physiological variables that may contribute to these variations in Tend. Methods Ninety-two patients with COPD completed a CET performed at 80% of peak workrate capacity (Wpeak). Patients were divided into tertiles of Tend [Group 1: <4 min; Group 2: 4–6 min; Group 3: >6 min]. Disease severity (FEV1), aerobic fitness (Wpeak, peak oxygen consumption [peak], ventilatory threshold [VT]), quadriceps strength (MVC), symptom scores at the end of CET and exercise intensity during CET (heart rate at the end of CET to heart rate at peak incremental exercise ratio [HRCET/HRpeak]) were analyzed as potential variables influencing Tend. Results Wpeak, peak, VT, MVC, leg fatigue at end of CET, and HRCET/HRpeak were lower in group 1 than in group 2 or 3 (p≤0.05). VT and leg fatigue at end of CET independently predicted Tend in multiple regression analysis (r = 0.50, p = 0.001). Conclusion Tend was independently related to the aerobic fitness and to tolerance to leg fatigue at the end of exercise. A large fraction of the variability in Tend was not explained by the physiological parameters assessed in the present study. Individualization of exercise intensity during CET should help in reducing variations in Tend among patients with COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2042824248,"Background The evolution of female choice mechanisms favouring males of their own kind is considered a crucial step during the early stages of speciation. However, although the genomics of mate choice may influence both the likelihood and speed of speciation, the identity and location of genes underlying assortative mating remain largely unknown. Methods and Findings We used mate choice experiments and gene expression analysis of female Drosophila melanogaster to examine three key components influencing speciation. We show that the 1,498 genes in Zimbabwean female D. melanogaster whose expression levels differ when mating with more (Zimbabwean) versus less (Cosmopolitan strain) preferred males include many with high expression in the central nervous system and ovaries, are disproportionately X-linked and form a number of clusters with low recombination distance. Significant involvement of the brain and ovaries is consistent with the action of a combination of pre- and postcopulatory female choice mechanisms, while sex linkage and clustering of genes lead to high potential evolutionary rate and sheltering against the homogenizing effects of gene exchange between populations. Conclusion Taken together our results imply favourable genomic conditions for the evolution of reproductive isolation through mate choice in Zimbabwean D. melanogaster and suggest that mate choice may, in general, act as an even more important engine of speciation than previously realized."
https://openalex.org/W1993266650,"Numerosity estimation is a basic preverbal ability that humans share with many animal species and that is believed to be foundational of numeracy skills. It is notoriously difficult, however, to establish whether numerosity estimation is based on numerosity itself, or on one or more non-numerical cues like-in visual stimuli-spatial extent and density. Frequently, different non-numerical cues are held constant on different trials. This strategy, however, still allows numerosity estimation to be based on a combination of non-numerical cues rather than on any particular one by itself.Here we introduce a novel method, based on second-order (contrast-based) visual motion, to create stimuli that exclude all first-order (luminance-based) cues to numerosity. We show that numerosities can be estimated almost as well in second-order motion as in first-order motion.The results show that numerosity estimation need not be based on first-order spatial filtering, first-order density perception, or any other processing of luminance-based cues to numerosity. Our method can be used as an effective tool to control non-numerical variables in studies of numerosity estimation."
https://openalex.org/W1963680260,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene encodes a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex, which is best understood as a negative regulator of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). VHL ubiquitinates and degrades the α subunits of HIF, and this is proposed to suppress tumorigenesis and tumor angiogenesis. However, several lines of evidence suggest that there are unidentified substrates or targets for VHL that play important roles in tumor suppression.Employing quantitative proteomics, we developed an approach to systematically identify the substrates of ubiquitin ligases and using this method, we identified the Myb-binding protein p160 as a novel substrate of VHL.A major barrier to understanding the functions of ubiquitin ligases has been the difficulty in pinpointing their ubiquitination substrates. The quantitative proteomics approach we devised for the identification of VHL substrates will be widely applicable to other ubiquitin ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2027051449,"The nickel resistance determinant ncrABCY was identified in Leptospirillum ferriphilum UBK03. Within this operon, ncrA and ncrC encode two membrane proteins that form an efflux system, and ncrB encodes NcrB, which belongs to an uncharacterized family (DUF156) of proteins. How this determinant is regulated remains unknown. Our data indicate that expression of the nickel resistance determinant is induced by nickel. The promoter of ncrA, designated pncrA, was cloned into the promoter probe vector pPR9TT, and co-transformed with either a wild-type or mutant nickel resistance determinant. The results revealed that ncrB encoded a transcriptional regulator that could regulate the expression of ncrA, ncrB, and ncrC. A GC-rich inverted repeat sequence was identified in the promoter pncrA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and footprinting assays showed that purified NcrB could specifically bind to the inverted repeat sequence of pncrA in vitro; this was confirmed by bacterial one-hybrid analysis. Moreover, this binding was inhibited in the presence of nickel ions. Thus, we classified NcrB as a transcriptional regulator that recognizes the inverted repeat sequence binding motif to regulate the expression of the key nickel resistance gene, ncrA."
https://openalex.org/W2048755204,"Background Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain 86–24 grown in MacConkey broth (MB) shows almost no adherence to cultured epithelial cells but adheres well in pig ligated intestines. This study investigated the mechanisms associated with the difference between in-vitro and in-vivo adherence of the MB culture. Methodology/Principal Findings It was found that decreased adherence in vitro by bacteria grown in MB was mainly due to lactose, possibly implicating the involvement of carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Expression of selected virulence-related genes associated with adherence and CCR was then examined by quantitative PCR. When bacteria were grown in MB and Brain Heart Infusion with NaHCO3 (BHIN) plus lactose, pH was reduced to 5.5–5.9 and there was a significant decrease in expression of the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) genes eae, tir, espD, grlA/R and ler, and an increase in cya (cAMP), and two negative regulators of the LEE, gadE and hfq. Putative virulence genes stcE, hlyA, ent and nleA were also decreased in vitro. Reversal of these changes was noted for bacteria recovered from the intestine, where transcripts for qseF and fis and putative virulence factors AidA15, TerC and Ent/EspL2 were significantly increased, and transcripts for AIDA48, Iha, UreC, Efa1A, Efa1B, ToxB, EhxA, StcE, NleA and NleB were expressed at high levels. Conclusions/Significance Presence of lactose resulted in decreased expression of LEE genes and the failure of EHEC O157:H7 to adhere to epithelial cells in vitro but this repression was overcome in vivo. CCR and/or acidic pH may have played a role in repression of the LEE genes. Bacterial pathogens need to integrate their nutritional metabolism with expression of virulence genes but little is known of how this is done in E. coli O157:H7. This study indicates one aspect of the subject that should be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W2069421579,"The progression of many human neurodegenerative disorders is associated with an accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein belongs to the homologous synuclein family, which includes beta-synuclein. It has been proposed that beta-synuclein may be a natural regulator of alpha-synuclein. Therefore controlling beta-synuclein expression may control the accumulation of alpha-synuclein and ultimately prevent disease progression. The regulation of synucleins is poorly understood. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of beta-synuclein, with the aim of identifying molecules that differentially control beta-synuclein expression levels. To investigate transcriptional regulation of beta-synuclein, we used reporter gene assays and bioinformatics. We identified a region -1.1/-0.6 kb upstream of the beta-synuclein translational start site to be a key regulatory region of beta-synuclein 5'-promoter activity in human dopaminergic cells (SH-SY5Y). Within this key promoter region we identified a metal response element pertaining to a putative Metal Transcription Factor-1 (MTF-1) binding site. We demonstrated that MTF-1 binds to this 5'-promoter region using EMSA analysis. Moreover, we showed that MTF-1 differentially regulates beta-synuclein promoter binding site, as well as beta-synuclein mRNA and protein expression. This effect of MTF-1 on expression was found to be specific to beta-synuclein when compared to alpha-synuclein. Understanding the regulation of synucleins and how they interact may point to molecular targets that could be manipulated for therapeutic benefit. In this study we showed that MTF-1 differentially controls the expression of beta-synuclein when compared to its homolog alpha-synuclein. This could potentially provide a novel targets or pathways for therapeutic intervention and/or treatment of synucleinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2083362120,"About 20% of adults are persistently colonized with S. aureus in the anterior nares. Host genetic factors could contribute susceptibility to this phenotype. The objective of this study was to determine whether the phenotype of persistent S. aureus colonization aggregates in family members who live in different households. Healthy adults and their eligible same sex siblings who lived in different households were recruited from the Old Order Amish of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. All participants had two cultures of the anterior nares to determine if they were persistently colonized with S. aureus. Three hundred and ninety eight participants finished the study, of whom 166 were index cases and 232 were siblings of index cases. Eighteen per cent (71/398) of all participants and 17% (29/166) of index cases were persistently colonized with S. aureus. Twenty two per cent (8/36) of siblings of persistently colonized index cases were persistently colonized with S. aureus compared to 17% (34/196) of siblings of non-persistently colonized index cases, yielding a prevalence rate ratio of 1.28 (95% CI: 0.65–2.54, p = 0.64) and sibling relative risk of 1.25 (95% CI: 0.65–2.38, p = 0.51). The heritability of persistent colonization was 0.19±0.21 (p = 0.31). Persistent S. aureus colonization does not strongly aggregate in Amish family members in different households and heritability is low, suggesting that environmental factors or acquired host factors are more important than host genetic factors in determining persistent S. aureus colonization in this community."
https://openalex.org/W2081299697,"Estuaries are ecologically and economically valuable and have been highly degraded from both land and sea. Estuarine habitats in the coastal zone are under pressure from a range of human activities. In the United States and elsewhere, very few conservation plans focused on estuaries are regional in scope; fewer still address threats to estuary long term viability.We have compiled basic information about the spatial extent of threats to identify commonalities. To do this we classify estuaries into hierarchical networks that share similar threat characteristics using a spatial database (geodatabase) of threats to estuaries from land and sea in the western U.S.Our results show that very few estuaries in this region (16%) have no or minimal stresses from anthropogenic activity. Additionally, one quarter (25%) of all estuaries in this study have moderate levels of all threats. The small number of un-threatened estuaries is likely not representative of the ecological variability in the region and will require working to abate threats at others. We think the identification of these estuary groups can foster sharing best practices and coordination of conservation activities amongst estuaries in any geography."

Thus, it is capable of growth using syngas, which is a mixture of varying amounts of CO and H2 generated by organic waste gasification. O. carboxidovorans is capable also of heterotrophic growth in standard bacteriologic media. Here we characterize how the O. carboxidovorans proteome adapts to different lifestyles of chemolithoautotrophy and heterotrophy. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of O. carboxidovorans grown with acetate or with syngas showed that the bacterium changes membrane fatty acid composition. Quantitative shotgun proteomic analysis of O. carboxidovorans grown in the presence of acetate and syngas showed production of proteins encoded on the megaplasmid for assimilating CO and H2 as well as proteins encoded on the chromosome that might have contributed to fatty acid and acetate metabolism. We found that adaptation to chemolithoautotrophic growth involved adaptations in cell envelope, oxidative homeostasis, and metabolic pathways such as glyoxylate shunt and amino acid/cofactor biosynthetic enzymes."

Chem. 284, 23225-23233) details that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a well known inhibitor of glycolysis and a candidate antineoplastic agent, also induces insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling through the inhibition of insulin-like growth factor 1-insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGF-1-IGFBP-3) complex formation. Zhong et al. hypothesized that disrupted IGF-1/IGFBP-3 binding by 2-DG led to increased free IGF-1 concentrations and, consequently, activation of IGF-1R downstream pathways. Because their report suggests unprecedented off-target effects of 2-DG, this has profound implications for the fields of metabolism and oncology. Using ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and novel ""intensity-fading"" mass spectrometry, we now provide a detailed characterization of complex formation between IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. All three of these independent methods demonstrated that there was no effect of glucose or 2-DG on the interaction between IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. Furthermore, we show examples of 2-DG exposure associated with reduced rather than increased IGF-1R and AKT activation, providing further evidence against a 2-DG increase in IGF-1R activation by IGF-1-IGFBP-3 complex disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2068858535,"Important sounds can be easily missed or misidentified in the presence of extraneous noise. We describe an auditory illusion in which a continuous ongoing tone becomes inaudible during a brief, non-masking noise burst more than one octave away, which is unexpected given the frequency resolution of human hearing. Participants strongly susceptible to this illusory discontinuity did not perceive illusory auditory continuity (in which a sound subjectively continues during a burst of masking noise) when the noises were short, yet did so at longer noise durations. Participants who were not prone to illusory discontinuity showed robust early electroencephalographic responses at 40–66 ms after noise burst onset, whereas those prone to the illusion lacked these early responses. These data suggest that short-latency neural responses to auditory scene components reflect subsequent individual differences in the parsing of auditory scenes."
https://openalex.org/W2036112856,"Here we introduce a new technique that probes voltage-dependent charge displacements of excitable membrane-bound proteins using extracellularly applied radio frequency (RF, 500 kHz) electric fields. Xenopus oocytes were used as a model cell for these experiments, and were injected with cRNA encoding Shaker B-IR (ShB-IR) K(+) ion channels to express large densities of this protein in the oocyte membranes. Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) was applied to command whole-cell membrane potential and to measure channel-dependent membrane currents. Simultaneously, RF electric fields were applied to perturb the membrane potential about the TEVC level and to measure voltage-dependent RF displacement currents. ShB-IR expressing oocytes showed significantly larger changes in RF displacement currents upon membrane depolarization than control oocytes. Voltage-dependent changes in RF displacement currents further increased in ShB-IR expressing oocytes after ∼120 µM Cu(2+) addition to the external bath. Cu(2+) is known to bind to the ShB-IR ion channel and inhibit Shaker K(+) conductance, indicating that changes in the RF displacement current reported here were associated with RF vibration of the Cu(2+)-linked mobile domain of the ShB-IR protein. Results demonstrate the use of extracellular RF electrodes to interrogate voltage-dependent movement of charged mobile protein domains--capabilities that might enable detection of small changes in charge distribution associated with integral membrane protein conformation and/or drug-protein interactions."
