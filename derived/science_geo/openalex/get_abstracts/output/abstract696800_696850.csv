https://openalex.org/W4285083308,"Gut commensal bacteria with the ability to translocate across the intestinal barrier can drive the development of diverse immune-mediated diseases1–4. However, the key factors that dictate bacterial translocation remain unclear. Recent studies have revealed that gut microbiota strains can adapt and evolve throughout the lifetime of the host5–9, raising the possibility that changes in individual commensal bacteria themselves over time may affect their propensity to elicit inflammatory disease. Here we show that within-host evolution of the model gut pathobiont Enterococcus gallinarum facilitates bacterial translocation and initiation of inflammation. Using a combination of in vivo experimental evolution and comparative genomics, we found that E. gallinarum diverges into independent lineages adapted to colonize either luminal or mucosal niches in the gut. Compared with ancestral and luminal E. gallinarum, mucosally adapted strains evade detection and clearance by the immune system, exhibit increased translocation to and survival within the mesenteric lymph nodes and liver, and induce increased intestinal and hepatic inflammation. Mechanistically, these changes in bacterial behaviour are associated with non-synonymous mutations or insertion–deletions in defined regulatory genes in E. gallinarum, altered microbial gene expression programs and remodelled cell wall structures. Lactobacillus reuteri also exhibited broadly similar patterns of divergent evolution and enhanced immune evasion in a monocolonization-based model of within-host evolution. Overall, these studies define within-host evolution as a critical regulator of commensal pathogenicity that provides a unique source of stochasticity in the development and progression of microbiota-driven disease. Within-host evolution is a critical regulator of commensal pathogenicity that provides a unique source of stochasticity in the development and progression of microbiota-driven disease."
https://openalex.org/W4285083294,"Active crystals are highly ordered structures that emerge from the self-organization of motile objects, and have been widely studied in synthetic1,2 and bacterial3,4 active matter. Whether persistent crystalline order can emerge in groups of autonomously developing multicellular organisms is currently unknown. Here we show that swimming starfish embryos spontaneously assemble into chiral crystals that span thousands of spinning organisms and persist for tens of hours. Combining experiments, theory and simulations, we demonstrate that the formation, dynamics and dissolution of these living crystals are controlled by the hydrodynamic properties and the natural development of embryos. Remarkably, living chiral crystals exhibit self-sustained chiral oscillations as well as various unconventional deformation response behaviours recently predicted for odd elastic materials5,6. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for how non-reciprocal interactions between autonomous multicellular components may facilitate non-equilibrium phases of chiral active matter. Experiments show that swimming starfish embryos spontaneously assemble into large chiral crystals that exhibit self-sustained chiral oscillations and unconventional deformation responses characteristic of odd elastic materials."

https://openalex.org/W4285085391,"RORγt is a lineage-specifying transcription factor that is expressed by immune cells that are enriched in the gastrointestinal tract and promote immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis1-15. However, fundamental questions remain with regard to the cellular heterogeneity among these cell types, the mechanisms that control protective versus inflammatory properties and their functional redundancy. Here we define all RORγt+ immune cells in the intestine at single-cell resolution and identify a subset of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) that expresses ZBTB46, a transcription factor specifying conventional dendritic cells16-20. ZBTB46 is robustly expressed by CCR6+ lymphoid-tissue-inducer-like ILC3s that are developmentally and phenotypically distinct from conventional dendritic cells, and its expression is imprinted by RORγt, fine-tuned by microbiota-derived signals and increased by pro-inflammatory cytokines. ZBTB46 restrains the inflammatory properties of ILC3s, including the OX40L-dependent expansion of T helper 17 cells and the exacerbated intestinal inflammation that occurs after enteric infection. Finally, ZBTB46+ ILC3s are a major source of IL-22, and selective depletion of this population renders mice susceptible to enteric infection and associated intestinal inflammation. These results show that ZBTB46 is a transcription factor that is shared between conventional dendritic cells and ILC3s, and identify a cell-intrinsic function for ZBTB46 in restraining the pro-inflammatory properties of ILC3s and a non-redundant role for ZBTB46+ ILC3s in orchestrating intestinal health."
https://openalex.org/W4285083709,"Abstract Food and water are rewarding in part because they satisfy our internal needs 1,2 . Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are activated by gustatory rewards 3–5 , but how animals learn to associate these oral cues with the delayed physiological effects of ingestion is unknown. Here we show that individual dopaminergic neurons in the VTA respond to detection of nutrients or water at specific stages of ingestion. A major subset of dopaminergic neurons tracks changes in systemic hydration that occur tens of minutes after thirsty mice drink water, whereas different dopaminergic neurons respond to nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract. We show that information about fluid balance is transmitted to the VTA by a hypothalamic pathway and then re-routed to downstream circuits that track the oral, gastrointestinal and post-absorptive stages of ingestion. To investigate the function of these signals, we used a paradigm in which a fluid’s oral and post-absorptive effects can be independently manipulated and temporally separated. We show that mice rapidly learn to prefer one fluid over another based solely on its rehydrating ability and that this post-ingestive learning is prevented if dopaminergic neurons in the VTA are selectively silenced after consumption. These findings reveal that the midbrain dopamine system contains subsystems that track different modalities and stages of ingestion, on timescales from seconds to tens of minutes, and that this information is used to drive learning about the consequences of ingestion."
https://openalex.org/W3136134248,"The global quantum internet will require long-lived, telecommunications-band photon-matter interfaces manufactured at scale1. Preliminary quantum networks based on photon-matter interfaces that meet a subset of these demands are encouraging efforts to identify new high-performance alternatives2. Silicon is an ideal host for commercial-scale solid-state quantum technologies. It is already an advanced platform within the global integrated photonics and microelectronics industries, as well as host to record-setting long-lived spin qubits3. Despite the overwhelming potential of the silicon quantum platform, the optical detection of individually addressable photon-spin interfaces in silicon has remained elusive. In this work, we integrate individually addressable 'T centre' photon-spin qubits in silicon photonic structures and characterize their spin-dependent telecommunications-band optical transitions. These results unlock immediate opportunities to construct silicon-integrated, telecommunications-band quantum information networks."
https://openalex.org/W4285087929,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls growth by regulating anabolic and catabolic processes in response to environmental cues, including nutrients1,2. Amino acids signal to mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are regulated by several protein complexes, including GATOR1 and GATOR2. GATOR2, which has five components (WDR24, MIOS, WDR59, SEH1L and SEC13), is required for amino acids to activate mTORC1 and interacts with the leucine and arginine sensors SESN2 and CASTOR1, respectively3–5. Despite this central role in nutrient sensing, GATOR2 remains mysterious as its subunit stoichiometry, biochemical function and structure are unknown. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the human GATOR2 complex. We found that GATOR2 adopts a large (1.1 MDa), two-fold symmetric, cage-like architecture, supported by an octagonal scaffold and decorated with eight pairs of WD40 β-propellers. The scaffold contains two WDR24, four MIOS and two WDR59 subunits circularized via two distinct types of junction involving non-catalytic RING domains and α-solenoids. Integration of SEH1L and SEC13 into the scaffold through β-propeller blade donation stabilizes the GATOR2 complex and reveals an evolutionary relationship to the nuclear pore and membrane-coating complexes6. The scaffold orients the WD40 β-propeller dimers, which mediate interactions with SESN2, CASTOR1 and GATOR1. Our work reveals the structure of an essential component of the nutrient-sensing machinery and provides a foundation for understanding the function of GATOR2 within the mTORC1 pathway. The 3D structure of the human nutrient-sensing complex GATOR2 is resolved using cryo-electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W4285508237,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration flashes of radio waves that are visible at distances of billions of light years1. The nature of their progenitors and their emission mechanism remain open astrophysical questions2. Here we report the detection of the multicomponent FRB 20191221A and the identification of a periodic separation of 216.8(1) ms between its components, with a significance of 6.5σ. The long (roughly 3 s) duration and nine or more components forming the pulse profile make this source an outlier in the FRB population. Such short periodicity provides strong evidence for a neutron-star origin of the event. Moreover, our detection favours emission arising from the neutron-star magnetosphere3,4, as opposed to emission regions located further away from the star, as predicted by some models5. Analysis of the pulse profile of a fast radio burst showed sub-second periodicity, providing evidence for a neutron-star origin of the event and favouring emission arising from the magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W4285084188,"Abstract Social affiliation emerges from individual-level behavioural rules that are driven by conspecific signals 1–5 . Long-distance attraction and short-distance repulsion, for example, are rules that jointly set a preferred interanimal distance in swarms 6–8 . However, little is known about their perceptual mechanisms and executive neural circuits 3 . Here we trace the neuronal response to self-like biological motion 9,10 , a visual trigger for affiliation in developing zebrafish 2,11 . Unbiased activity mapping and targeted volumetric two-photon calcium imaging revealed 21 activity hotspots distributed throughout the brain as well as clustered biological-motion-tuned neurons in a multimodal, socially activated nucleus of the dorsal thalamus. Individual dorsal thalamus neurons encode local acceleration of visual stimuli mimicking typical fish kinetics but are insensitive to global or continuous motion. Electron microscopic reconstruction of dorsal thalamus neurons revealed synaptic input from the optic tectum and projections into hypothalamic areas with conserved social function 12–14 . Ablation of the optic tectum or dorsal thalamus selectively disrupted social attraction without affecting short-distance repulsion. This tectothalamic pathway thus serves visual recognition of conspecifics, and dissociates neuronal control of attraction from repulsion during social affiliation, revealing a circuit underpinning collective behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W4285085624,"The morphology and functionality of the epithelial lining differ along the intestinal tract, but tissue renewal at all sites is driven by stem cells at the base of crypts1-3. Whether stem cell numbers and behaviour vary at different sites is unknown. Here we show using intravital microscopy that, despite similarities in the number and distribution of proliferative cells with an Lgr5 signature in mice, small intestinal crypts contain twice as many effective stem cells as large intestinal crypts. We find that, although passively displaced by a conveyor-belt-like upward movement, small intestinal cells positioned away from the crypt base can function as long-term effective stem cells owing to Wnt-dependent retrograde cellular movement. By contrast, the near absence of retrograde movement in the large intestine restricts cell repositioning, leading to a reduction in effective stem cell number. Moreover, after suppression of the retrograde movement in the small intestine, the number of effective stem cells is reduced, and the rate of monoclonal conversion of crypts is accelerated. Together, these results show that the number of effective stem cells is determined by active retrograde movement, revealing a new channel of stem cell regulation that can be experimentally and pharmacologically manipulated."
https://openalex.org/W4285084534,"Telomeres are the physical ends of linear chromosomes. They are composed of short repeating sequences (such as TTGGGG in the G-strand for Tetrahymena thermophila) of double-stranded DNA with a single-strand 3′ overhang of the G-strand and, in humans, the six shelterin proteins: TPP1, POT1, TRF1, TRF2, RAP1 and TIN21,2. TPP1 and POT1 associate with the 3′ overhang, with POT1 binding the G-strand3 and TPP1 (in complex with TIN24) recruiting telomerase via interaction with telomerase reverse transcriptase5 (TERT). The telomere DNA ends are replicated and maintained by telomerase6, for the G-strand, and subsequently DNA polymerase α–primase7,8 (PolαPrim), for the C-strand9. PolαPrim activity is stimulated by the heterotrimeric complex CTC1–STN1–TEN110–12 (CST), but the structural basis of the recruitment of PolαPrim and CST to telomere ends remains unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Tetrahymena CST in the context of the telomerase holoenzyme, in both the absence and the presence of PolαPrim, and of PolαPrim alone. Tetrahymena Ctc1 binds telomerase subunit p50, a TPP1 orthologue, on a flexible Ctc1 binding motif revealed by cryo-EM and NMR spectroscopy. The PolαPrim polymerase subunit POLA1 binds Ctc1 and Stn1, and its interface with Ctc1 forms an entry port for G-strand DNA to the POLA1 active site. We thus provide a snapshot of four key components that are required for telomeric DNA synthesis in a single active complex—telomerase-core ribonucleoprotein, p50, CST and PolαPrim—that provides insights into the recruitment of CST and PolαPrim and the handoff between G-strand and C-strand synthesis. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase-bound Ctc1–Stn1–Ten1 and DNA polymerase α–primase provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying telomere replication and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W4285087726,"Chromosome segregation errors during cell divisions generate aneuploidies and micronuclei, which can undergo extensive chromosomal rearrangements such as chromothripsis1-5. Selective pressures then shape distinct aneuploidy and rearrangement patterns-for example, in cancer6,7-but it is unknown whether initial biases in segregation errors and micronucleation exist for particular chromosomes. Using single-cell DNA sequencing8 after an error-prone mitosis in untransformed, diploid cell lines and organoids, we show that chromosomes have different segregation error frequencies that result in non-random aneuploidy landscapes. Isolation and sequencing of single micronuclei from these cells showed that mis-segregating chromosomes frequently also preferentially become entrapped in micronuclei. A similar bias was found in naturally occurring micronuclei of two cancer cell lines. We find that segregation error frequencies of individual chromosomes correlate with their location in the interphase nucleus, and show that this is highest for peripheral chromosomes behind spindle poles. Randomization of chromosome positions, Cas9-mediated live tracking and forced repositioning of individual chromosomes showed that a greater distance from the nuclear centre directly increases the propensity to mis-segregate. Accordingly, chromothripsis in cancer genomes9 and aneuploidies in early development10 occur more frequently for larger chromosomes, which are preferentially located near the nuclear periphery. Our findings reveal a direct link between nuclear chromosome positions, segregation error frequencies and micronucleus content, with implications for our understanding of tumour genome evolution and the origins of specific aneuploidies during development."

https://openalex.org/W4285085260,"Telomeres, the natural ends of linear chromosomes, comprise repeat-sequence DNA and associated proteins1. Replication of telomeres allows continued proliferation of human stem cells and immortality of cancer cells2. This replication requires telomerase3 extension of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of the telomeric G-strand ((TTAGGG)n); the synthesis of the complementary C-strand ((CCCTAA)n) is much less well characterized. The CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) protein complex, a DNA polymerase α-primase accessory factor4,5, is known to be required for telomere replication in vivo6-9, and the molecular analysis presented here reveals key features of its mechanism. We find that human CST uses its ssDNA-binding activity to specify the origins for telomeric C-strand synthesis by bound Polα-primase. CST-organized DNA polymerization can copy a telomeric DNA template that folds into G-quadruplex structures, but the challenges presented by this template probably contribute to telomere replication problems observed in vivo. Combining telomerase, a short telomeric ssDNA primer and CST-Polα-primase gives complete telomeric DNA replication, resulting in the same sort of ssDNA 3' overhang found naturally on human telomeres. We conclude that the CST complex not only terminates telomerase extension10,11 and recruits Polα-primase to telomeric ssDNA4,12,13 but also orchestrates C-strand synthesis. Because replication of the telomere has features distinct from replication of the rest of the genome, targeting telomere-replication components including CST holds promise for cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4285083882,"The scattering of waves when they propagate through disordered media is an important limitation for a range of applications, including telecommunications1, biomedical imaging2, seismology3 and material engineering4,5. Wavefront shaping techniques can reduce the effect of wave scattering, even in opaque media, by engineering specific modes-termed open transmission eigenchannels-through which waves are funnelled across a disordered medium without any back reflection6-9. However, with such channels being very scarce, one cannot use them to render an opaque sample perfectly transmitting for any incident light field. Here we show that a randomly disordered medium becomes translucent to all incoming light waves when placing a tailored complementary medium in front of it. To this end, the reflection matrices of the two media surfaces facing each other need to satisfy a matrix generalization of the condition for critical coupling. We implement this protocol both numerically and experimentally for the design of electromagnetic waveguides with several dozen scattering elements placed inside them. The translucent scattering media we introduce here also have the promising property of being able to store incident radiation in their interior for remarkably long times."
https://openalex.org/W4285083708,"Any system of coupled oscillators may be characterized by its spectrum of resonance frequencies (or eigenfrequencies), which can be tuned by varying the system's parameters. The relationship between control parameters and the eigenfrequency spectrum is central to a range of applications1-3. However, fundamental aspects of this relationship remain poorly understood. For example, if the controls are varied along a path that returns to its starting point (that is, around a 'loop'), the system's spectrum must return to itself. In systems that are Hermitian (that is, lossless and reciprocal), this process is trivial and each resonance frequency returns to its original value. However, in non-Hermitian systems, where the eigenfrequencies are complex, the spectrum may return to itself in a topologically non-trivial manner, a phenomenon known as spectral flow. The spectral flow is determined by how the control loop encircles degeneracies, and this relationship is well understood for [Formula: see text] (where [Formula: see text] is the number of oscillators in the system)4,5. Here we extend this description to arbitrary [Formula: see text]. We show that control loops generically produce braids of eigenfrequencies, and for [Formula: see text] these braids form a non-Abelian group that reflects the non-trivial geometry of the space of degeneracies. We demonstrate these features experimentally for [Formula: see text] using a cavity optomechanical system."
https://openalex.org/W4285086629,"Memory formation involves binding of contextual features into a unitary representation1-4, whereas memory recall can occur using partial combinations of these contextual features. The neural basis underlying the relationship between a contextual memory and its constituent features is not well understood; in particular, where features are represented in the brain and how they drive recall. Here, to gain insight into this question, we developed a behavioural task in which mice use features to recall an associated contextual memory. We performed longitudinal imaging in hippocampus as mice performed this task and identified robust representations of global context but not of individual features. To identify putative brain regions that provide feature inputs to hippocampus, we inhibited cortical afferents while imaging hippocampus during behaviour. We found that whereas inhibition of entorhinal cortex led to broad silencing of hippocampus, inhibition of prefrontal anterior cingulate led to a highly specific silencing of context neurons and deficits in feature-based recall. We next developed a preparation for simultaneous imaging of anterior cingulate and hippocampus during behaviour, which revealed robust population-level representation of features in anterior cingulate, that lag hippocampus context representations during training but dynamically reorganize to lead and target recruitment of context ensembles in hippocampus during recall. Together, we provide the first mechanistic insights into where contextual features are represented in the brain, how they emerge, and how they access long-range episodic representations to drive memory recall."

https://openalex.org/W4285088425,"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)–RAS signalling through the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade regulates cell proliferation and survival. The SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C holophosphatase complex functions as a key regulator of RTK–RAS signalling by removing an inhibitory phosphorylation event on the RAF family of proteins to potentiate MAPK signalling1. SHOC2 forms a ternary complex with MRAS and PP1C, and human germline gain-of-function mutations in this complex result in congenital RASopathy syndromes2–5. However, the structure and assembly of this complex are poorly understood. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to resolve the structure of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C complex. We define the biophysical principles of holoenzyme interactions, elucidate the assembly order of the complex, and systematically interrogate the functional consequence of nearly all of the possible missense variants of SHOC2 through deep mutational scanning. We show that SHOC2 binds PP1C and MRAS through the concave surface of the leucine-rich repeat region and further engages PP1C through the N-terminal disordered region that contains a cryptic RVXF motif. Complex formation is initially mediated by interactions between SHOC2 and PP1C and is stabilized by the binding of GTP-loaded MRAS. These observations explain how mutant versions of SHOC2 in RASopathies and cancer stabilize the interactions of complex members to enhance holophosphatase activity. Together, this integrative structure–function model comprehensively defines key binding interactions within the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C holophosphatase complex and will inform therapeutic development ."
https://openalex.org/W4285388812,"Abundance and distribution of commercial marine resources are influenced by environmental variables, which together with fishery patterns may also influence their catchability. However, Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) can be standardized in order to remove most of the variability not directly attributable to fish abundance. In the present study, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to investigate the effect of some environmental and fishery covariates on the spatial distribution and abundance of the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus within the Pomo/Jabuka Pits (Central Adriatic Sea) and to include those that resulted significant in a standardization process. N. norvegicus is a commercially important demersal crustacean, altering its catchability over the 24-h cycle and seasons according to its burrowing behavior. A historically exploited fishing ground for this species, since 2015 subject to specific fisheries management measures, is represented by the meso-Adriatic depressions, which are also characterized by particular oceanographic conditions. Both the species behaviour and the features of this study area influence the dynamics of the population offering a challenging case study for a standardization modelling approach. Environmental and catch data were obtained during scientific trawl surveys properly designed to catch N. norvegicus, thus improving the quality of the model input data. Standardization of CPUE from 2 surveys from 2012 to 2019 was conducted building two GAMs for both biomass and density indices. Bathymetry, fishing pressure, dissolved oxygen and salinity proved to be significant drivers influencing catch distribution. After cross validations, the tuned models were then used to predict new indices for the study area and the two survey series by means of informed spatial grids, composed by constant surface cells, to each of which are associated average values of environmental parameters and specific levels of fishing pressure, depending on the management measures in place. The predictions can be used to better describe the structure and the spatio-temporal distribution of the population providing valuable information to evaluate the status of such an important marine resource."
https://openalex.org/W4285086348,"In spite of the high-density and strongly correlated nature of the atomic nucleus, experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that around particular 'magic' numbers of nucleons, nuclear properties are governed by a single unpaired nucleon1,2. A microscopic understanding of the extent of this behaviour and its evolution in neutron-rich nuclei remains an open question in nuclear physics3-5. The indium isotopes are considered a textbook example of this phenomenon6, in which the constancy of their electromagnetic properties indicated that a single unpaired proton hole can provide the identity of a complex many-nucleon system6,7. Here we present precision laser spectroscopy measurements performed to investigate the validity of this simple single-particle picture. Observation of an abrupt change in the dipole moment at N = 82 indicates that, whereas the single-particle picture indeed dominates at neutron magic number N = 82 (refs. 2,8), it does not for previously studied isotopes. To investigate the microscopic origin of these observations, our work provides a combined effort with developments in two complementary nuclear many-body methods: ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group and density functional theory (DFT). We find that the inclusion of time-symmetry-breaking mean fields is essential for a correct description of nuclear magnetic properties, which were previously poorly constrained. These experimental and theoretical findings are key to understanding how seemingly simple single-particle phenomena naturally emerge from complex interactions among protons and neutrons."
https://openalex.org/W4221147228,"Abstract One of the main developments in unconventional superconductivity in the past two decades has been the discovery that most unconventional superconductors form phase diagrams that also contain other strongly correlated states. Many systems of interest are therefore close to more than one instability, and tuning between the resultant ordered phases is the subject of intense research 1 . In recent years, uniaxial pressure applied using piezoelectric-based devices has been shown to be a particularly versatile new method of tuning 2,3 , leading to experiments that have advanced our understanding of the fascinating unconventional superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 (refs. 4–9 ). Here we map out its phase diagram using high-precision measurements of the elastocaloric effect in what we believe to be the first such study including both the normal and the superconducting states. We observe a strong entropy quench on entering the superconducting state, in excellent agreement with a model calculation for pairing at the Van Hove point, and obtain a quantitative estimate of the entropy change associated with entry to a magnetic state that is observed in proximity to the superconductivity. The phase diagram is intriguing both for its similarity to those seen in other families of unconventional superconductors and for extra features unique, so far, to Sr 2 RuO 4 ."
https://openalex.org/W4285087176,"RAS-MAPK signalling is fundamental for cell proliferation and is altered in most human cancers1-3. However, our mechanistic understanding of how RAS signals through RAF is still incomplete. Although studies revealed snapshots for autoinhibited and active RAF-MEK1-14-3-3 complexes4, the intermediate steps that lead to RAF activation remain unclear. The MRAS-SHOC2-PP1C holophosphatase dephosphorylates RAF at serine 259, resulting in the partial displacement of 14-3-3 and RAF-RAS association3,5,6. MRAS, SHOC2 and PP1C are mutated in rasopathies-developmental syndromes caused by aberrant MAPK pathway activation6-14-and SHOC2 itself has emerged as potential target in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS-driven tumours15-18. Despite its importance, structural understanding of the SHOC2 holophosphatase is lacking. Here we determine, using X-ray crystallography, the structure of the MRAS-SHOC2-PP1C complex. SHOC2 bridges PP1C and MRAS through its concave surface and enables reciprocal interactions between all three subunits. Biophysical characterization indicates a cooperative assembly driven by the MRAS GTP-bound active state, an observation that is extendible to other RAS isoforms. Our findings support the concept of a RAS-driven and multi-molecular model for RAF activation in which individual RAS-GTP molecules recruit RAF-14-3-3 and SHOC2-PP1C to produce downstream pathway activation. Importantly, we find that rasopathy and cancer mutations reside at protein-protein interfaces within the holophosphatase, resulting in enhanced affinities and function. Collectively, our findings shed light on a fundamental mechanism of RAS biology and on mechanisms of clinically observed enhanced RAS-MAPK signalling, therefore providing the structural basis for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4285390201,"It is forecasted that the skills and competencies necessary for post-pandemic success in higher education need to be founded upon adaptability, coping, and Self- Regulated Learning (SRL). It is worth investigating how stakeholders perceived their adaptability and coping with the accelerated change accompanying Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to assess the self-reported adaptability of postgraduate dental learners and their instructors in the context of abrupt transition to distance learning induced by the pandemic. This study utilized a convergent mixed methods study design. The quantitative and qualitative data were concurrently collected from instructors and learners, using a tailor-made survey of items measured with a Likert-type scale, complemented with open-ended questions. The collected datasets were independently analyzed. Descriptive and inferential analysis were conducted using the quantitative data. Qualitatively, the researchers underwent a multi-staged thematic analysis. The generated information was then integrated using a joint model analysis. The percentage of the total average of self-reported adaptability for both groups of stakeholders was 81.15%. The instructors, with a mean of satisfaction of 17.94 (±1.76), rated their adaptability significantly higher than the learners, with a mean of satisfaction of 15.66 (±2.77) (p = 0.002). The thematic analysis resulted in two interrelated themes: Self and Environment. Within the Self theme, three subthemes surfaced: Cognitions, Emotions, and Behaviors. As for the Environment theme, it encapsulated two subthemes: Enablers and Impediments. The stakeholders perceived themselves to have adapted well to the transition, and SRL appeared as a cornerstone in the adaptation to the accelerated change accompanying COVID-19. There appeared to be an interplay between the cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on the level of the self as part of the adaptation process. Also, building upon existent models of SRL, this study uncovered that the stakeholders considered the environment to play a crucial role in their adaptation process. This highlights the importance of developing a climate that remains, despite external pressures, conducive to attaining learning and teaching goals. It is also crucial for university-level mental health promotion activities to proactively foster, among learners and instructors, adaptability, building 'academic resilience'."
https://openalex.org/W4285087411,"Abstract Our understanding of the climatic teleconnections that drove ice-age cycles has been limited by a paucity of well-dated tropical records of glaciation that span several glacial–interglacial intervals. Glacial deposits offer discrete snapshots of glacier extent but cannot provide the continuous records required for detailed interhemispheric comparisons. By contrast, lakes located within glaciated catchments can provide continuous archives of upstream glacial activity, but few such records extend beyond the last glacial cycle. Here a piston core from Lake Junín in the uppermost Amazon basin provides the first, to our knowledge, continuous, independently dated archive of tropical glaciation spanning 700,000 years. We find that tropical glaciers tracked changes in global ice volume and followed a clear approximately 100,000-year periodicity. An enhancement in the extent of tropical Andean glaciers relative to global ice volume occurred between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago, during sustained intervals of regionally elevated hydrologic balance that modified the regular approximately 23,000-year pacing of monsoon-driven precipitation. Millennial-scale variations in the extent of tropical Andean glaciers during the last glacial cycle were driven by variations in regional monsoon strength that were linked to temperature perturbations in Greenland ice cores 1 ; these interhemispheric connections may have existed during previous glacial cycles."

We irradiated spores of the Streptomyces coelicolor strain JCM4020 with carbon ions to generate a mutant library. We screened the RED production-deficient mutants of S. coelicolor by mixing them with T. pulmonis TP-B0596 on agar plates, identifying the red/white phenotype of the growing colonies. Through this process, we selected 59 RED-deficient mutants from around 152,000 tested spores. We resequenced the genomes of 16 mutants and identified 44 point mutations, which revealed the signatures induced by 12C5+-irradiation. Via gene complementation experiments, we also revealed that two genes-glutamate synthase (gltB) and elongation factor G (fusA)-are responsible for the reduced production of RED."
https://openalex.org/W4285495115,"Background The ability to filter sensory information into relevant versus irrelevant stimuli is a fundamental, conserved property of the central nervous system and is accomplished in part through habituation learning. Synaptic plasticity that underlies habituation learning has been described at the cellular level, yet the genetic regulators of this plasticity remain poorly understood, as do circuits that mediate sensory filtering. Methods To identify genes critical for plasticity, a forward genetic screen for zebrafish genes that mediate habituation learning was performed, which identified a mutant allele, dory p177 , that caused reduced habituation of the acoustic startle response. In this study, we combine whole-genome sequencing with behavioral analyses to characterize and identify the gene affected in dory p177 mutants. Results Whole-genome sequencing identified the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha-2/delta- 3 ( cacna2d3 ) as a candidate gene affected in dory p177 mutants. Behavioral characterization of larvae homozygous for two additional, independently derived mutant alleles of cacna2d3 , together with failure of these alleles to complement dory p177 , confirmed a critical role for cacna2d3 in habituation learning. Notably, detailed analyses of the acoustic response in mutant larvae also revealed increased startle sensitivity to acoustic stimuli, suggesting a broader role for cacna2d3 in controlling innate response thresholds to acoustic stimuli. Conclusions Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role for cacna2d3 in sensory filtering, a process that is disrupted in human CNS disorders, e.g. ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism."

Therefore, the detection of this disease using chest X-ray modalities has played a pivotal role in producing fast and accurate medical diagnoses, especially in countries that are unable to afford laboratory testing kits. However, identifying and distinguishing COVID-19 from virtually similar thoracic abnormalities utilizing medical images is challenging because it is time-consuming, demanding, and susceptible to human-based errors. Therefore, artificial-intelligence-driven automated diagnoses, which excludes direct human intervention, may potentially be used to achieve consistently accurate performances. In this study, we aimed to (i) obtain a customized dataset composed of a relatively small number of images collected from publicly available datasets; (ii) present the efficient integration of the shallow handcrafted features obtained from local descriptors, radiomics features specialized for medical images, and deep features aggregated from pre-trained deep learning architectures; and (iii) distinguish COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and pneumonia patients using a collection of conventional machine learning classifiers. By conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrated that the feature-based ensemble approach provided the best classification metrics, and this approach explicitly outperformed schemes that used only either local, radiomic, or deep features. In addition, our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art multi-class classification results compared to the baseline reference for the currently available COVID-19 datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4285387698,"This paper presents a systematic study of the effects of hyperspectral pixel dimensionality reduction on the pixel classification task. We use five dimensionality reduction methods—PCA, KPCA, ICA, AE, and DAE—to compress 301-dimensional hyperspectral pixels. Compressed pixels are subsequently used to perform pixel classifications. Pixel classification accuracies together with compression method, compression rates, and reconstruction errors provide a new lens to study the suitability of a compression method for the task of pixel classification. We use three high-resolution hyperspectral image datasets, representing three common landscape types (i.e. urban, transitional suburban, and forests) collected by the Remote Sensing and Spatial Ecosystem Modeling laboratory of the University of Toronto. We found that PCA, KPCA, and ICA post greater signal reconstruction capability; however, when compression rates are more than 90% these methods show lower classification scores. AE and DAE methods post better classification accuracy at 95% compression rate, however their performance drops as compression rate approaches 97%. Our results suggest that both the compression method and the compression rate are important considerations when designing a hyperspectral pixel classification pipeline."
https://openalex.org/W4285386976,"Frailty assessment has been identified as critical approach in chronic respiratory diseases with substantial impact in the health status and functionality in later life. Aging modifies the immune response leading to a chronic pro-inflammatory state and increased susceptibility to airway infections. Since epigenetic changes, airway epithelium dysfunction and inflammatory cytokine activity seem to be more pronounced in the immunosenescence, elderly asthmatics are at higher risk of poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that frailty would be associated with the degree of asthma control in elderly patients with moderate to severe asthma. The aims of this study are to investigate association between frailty and asthma control in patients over 60 years old to estimate the prevalence of frailty in this study population. We plan to conduct a cross-sectional study with at least 120 patients above 60 years old with diagnostic of moderate to severe asthma according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, treated at a referral outpatient clinic. We defined asthma control by the six-domain Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) and frailty phenotype in accordance with Fried scale and visual scale of frailty (VS-Frailty). We hope to analyze the multidimensional relationships between frailty and asthma and contribute to innovative therapeutic plans in geriatric asthma."
https://openalex.org/W4285388704,"Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a global pandemic having a serious impact on national economies and healthcare infrastructure. Accurate infection detection protocols are key to policy guidance and decision making. In this pilot study, we compared single versus replicate PCR testing for effective and accurate SARS-CoV-2 infection detection. One-Step Real-Time RT-PCR was employed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from individual nasopharyngeal swabs. A total of 10,014 swabs, sampled from the general public (hospital admissions, A&amp;E, elective surgeries, cancer patients, care home residents and healthcare staff), were tested using standard replicate testing. Our analysis demonstrates that approximately 19% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals would have been reported as false negative if single sample Real-Time PCR testing was used. Therefore, two replicate tests can substantially decrease the risk of false negative reporting and reduce hospital and community infection rates. As the number of variants of concern increases, we believe that replicate testing is an essential consideration for effective SARS-CoV-2 infection detection and prevention of further outbreaks. A strategic approach limiting the number of missed infections is crucial in controlling the rise of new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the management of future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4285388841,"γδ T cells are thought to contribute to immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the mechanisms by which they are activated by the virus are unknown. Using flow cytometry, we investigated if the two most abundant viral structural proteins, spike and nucleocapsid, can activate human γδ T cell subsets, directly or in the presence of dendritic cells (DC). Both proteins failed to induce interferon-γ production by Vδ1 or Vδ2 T cells within fresh mononuclear cells or lines of expanded γδ T cells generated from healthy donors, but the same proteins stimulated CD3 + cells from COVID-19 patients. The nucleocapsid protein stimulated interleukin-12 production by DC and downstream interferon-γ production by co-cultured Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells, but protease digestion and use of an alternative nucleocapsid preparation indicated that this activity was due to contaminating non-protein material. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins do not have stimulatory activity for DC or γδ T cells. We propose that γδ T cell activation in COVID-19 patients is mediated by immune recognition of viral RNA or other structural proteins by γδ T cells, or by other immune cells, such as DC, that produce γδ T cell-stimulatory ligands or cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W4285389359,"Background Rapid deterioration of oxygenation occurs in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and prediction of mechanical ventilation (MV) is needed for allocation of patients to intensive care unit. Since intubation is usually decided based on varying clinical conditions, such as required oxygen changes, we aimed to elucidate thresholds of increase in oxygen demand to predict MV use within 12 h. Methods A single-center retrospective cohort study using data between January 2020 and January 2021was conducted. Data were retrieved from the hospital data warehouse. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) who needed oxygen during admission were included. Hourly increments in oxygen demand were calculated using two consecutive oxygen values. Covariates were selected from measurements at the closest time points of oxygen data. Prediction of MV use within 12 h by required oxygen changes was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating curves (AUCs). A threshold for increased MV use risk was obtained from restricted cubic spline curves. Results Among 66 eligible patients, 1835 oxygen data were analyzed. The AUC was 0.756 for predicting MV by oxygen demand changes, 0.888 by both amounts and changes in oxygen, and 0.933 by the model adjusted with respiratory rate, PCR quantification cycle (Ct), and days from PCR. The threshold of increments of required oxygen was identified as 0.44 L/min/h and the probability of MV use linearly increased afterward. In subgroup analyses, the threshold was lower (0.25 L/min/h) when tachypnea or frequent respiratory distress existed, whereas it was higher (1.00 L/min/h) when viral load is low (Ct ≥20 or days from PCR &gt;7 days). Conclusions Hourly changes in oxygen demand predicted MV use within 12 h, with a threshold of 0.44 L/min/h. This threshold was lower with an unstable respiratory condition and higher with a low viral load."
https://openalex.org/W4285390408,"The bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes reproductive, enteric, and respiratory diseases. Vaccination is essential in increasing herd resistance to BVDV spread. The selection of an adjuvant is an important factor in the success of the vaccination process. Monolaurin or glycerol monolaurate is a safe compound with an immunomodulatory effect. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of monolaurin as a novel adjuvant. This was examined through the preparation of an inactivated BVDV (NADL strain) vaccine adjuvanted with different concentrations of monolaurin and compared with the registered available locally prepared polyvalent vaccine (Pneumo-4) containing BVD (NADL strain), BoHV-1 (Abou Hammad strain), BPI3 (strain 45), and BRSV (strain 375L), and adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide gel. The inactivated BVDV vaccine was prepared using three concentrations, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, from monolaurin as adjuvants. A potency test was performed on five groups of animals. The first group, which did not receive vaccination, served as a control group while three other groups were vaccinated using the prepared vaccines. The fifth group received the Pneumo-4 vaccine. Vaccination response was monitored by measuring viral neutralizing antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). It was found that the BVD inactivated vaccine with 1% and 2% monolaurin elicited higher neutralizing antibodies that have longer-lasting effects (nine months) with no reaction at the injection site in comparison to the commercial vaccine adjuvanted by aluminum hydroxide gel."

In parallel to the randomised-controlled trial of Engager (Trial registration number: ISRCTN11707331), a set of process evaluation analyses were undertaken. This paper reports on the depth multiple case study analysis part of the process evaluation, exploring how a sub-sample of prison-leavers engaged and responded to the intervention offer of one-to-one support during their re-integration into the community.To understand intervention delivery and what response it elicited in individuals, we used a realist-informed qualitative multiple 'case' studies approach. We scrutinised how intervention component delivery lead to outcomes by examining underlying causal pathways or 'mechanisms' that promoted or hindered progress towards personal outcomes. 'Cases' (n = 24) were prison-leavers from the intervention arm of the trial. We collected practitioner activity logs and conducted semi-structured interviews with prison-leavers and Engager/other service practitioners. We mapped data for each case against the intervention logic model and then used Bhaskar's (2016) 'DREIC' analytic process to categorise cases according to extent of intervention delivery, outcomes evidenced, and contributing factors behind engagement or disengagement and progress achieved.There were variations in the dose and session focus of the intervention delivery, and how different participants responded. Participants sustaining long-term engagement and sustained change reached a state of 'crises but coping'. We found evidence that several components of the intervention were key to achieving this: trusting relationships, therapeutic work delivered well and over time; and an in-depth shared understanding of needs, concerns, and goals between the practitioner and participants. Those who disengaged were in one of the following states: 'Crises and chaos', 'Resigned acceptance', 'Honeymoon' or 'Wilful withdrawal'.We demonstrate that the 'implementability' of an intervention can be explained by examining the delivery of core intervention components in relation to the responses elicited in the participants. Core delivery mechanisms often had to be 'triggered' numerous times to produce sustained change. The improvements achieved, sustained, and valued by participants were not always reflected in the quantitative measures recorded in the RCT. The compatibility between the practitioner, participant and setting were continually at risk of being undermined by implementation failure as well as changing external circumstances and participants' own weaknesses.ISRCTN11707331, Wales Research Ethics Committee, Registered 02-04-2016-Retrospectively registered https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN11707331."

https://openalex.org/W4285086180,"Lung ultrasound (LUS), a rapid, bedside, goal-oriented diagnostic test, can be quantitatively assessed, and the scores can be used to evaluate disease progression. However, little data exists on predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) and successful extubation using serial LUS scores. We examined the relationship of PMV with successful extubation in patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by using two types of serial LUS scores. One LUS score evaluated both the pleura and lung fields, while the other assessed each separately (modified-LUS score). Both LUS scores were determined for 20 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 at three timepoints: admission (day-1), after 48 h (day-3), and on the seventh follow-up day (day-7). We compared LUS scores with the radiographic assessment of the lung oedema (RALE) scores and laboratory test results, at the three timepoints. The PMV and successful extubation groups showed no significant differences in mortality, but significant differences occurred on day-3 and day-7 both LUS scores, day-7 RALE score, and day-7 PaO2/FiO2 ratio, in the PMV group (p<0.05); and day-3 and day-7 modified-LUS scores, day-7 C-reactive protein levels, and day-7 PaO2/FiO2 ratio, in the successful extubation group (p<0.05). The area under the curves (AUC) of LUS scores on day-3 and day-7, modified-LUS scores on day-3 and day-7,RALE score on day-7, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio on day-7 in the PMV group were 0.98, 0.85, 0.88, 0.98, 0.77, and 0.80, respectively. The AUC of modified-LUS scores on day-3 and day-7, C-reactive protein levels on day-7, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio on day-7 in the successful extubation group were 0.79, 0.90, 0.82, and 0.79, respectively. The modified-LUS score on day 7 was significantly higher than that on day 1 in PMV group (p<0.05). While the LUS score did not exhibit significant differences.

We identified candidates in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway for the genes 4CL, CCR, CAD, CCoAOMT, and CSE but did not identify candidates for PAL, CYP450 (F5H, C3H, C4H), HCT, and COMT. In gene tree analysis, we present evidence that these gene candidates evolved independently from their land plant counterparts, suggesting convergent evolution of a complex multistep lignin biosynthetic pathway in this red algal lineage. Additionally, we provide tools to extract metabolic pathways and genes from the newly generated transcriptomic and genomic datasets. Using these methods, we extracted genes related to sucrose metabolism and calcification. Ultimately, this transcriptome will provide a foundation for further genetic and experimental studies of calcifying red algae."
https://openalex.org/W4285495667,"The HTLV-1 protease is one of the major antiviral targets to overwhelm this virus. Several research groups have developed protease inhibitors, but none has been successful. In this regard, developing new HTLV-1 protease inhibitors to fix the defects in previous inhibitors may overcome the lack of curative treatment for this oncovirus. Thus, we decided to study the unbinding pathways of the most potent (compound 10, PDB ID 4YDF, Ki = 15 nM) and one of the weakest (compound 9, PDB ID 4YDG, Ki = 7900 nM) protease inhibitors, which are very structurally similar. We conducted 12 successful short and long simulations (totaling 14.8 μs) to unbind the compounds from two monoprotonated (mp) forms of protease using the Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) without applying any biasing force. The results revealed that Asp32 or Asp32′ in the two forms of mp state similarly exert powerful effects on maintaining both potent and weak inhibitors in the binding pocket of HTLV-1 protease. In the potent inhibitor’s unbinding process, His66′ was a great supporter that was absent in the weak inhibitor’s unbinding pathway. In contrast, in the weak inhibitor’s unbinding process, Trp98/Trp98′ by pi-pi stacking interactions were unfavorable for the stability of the inhibitor in the binding site. In our opinion, these results will assist in designing more potent and effective inhibitors for the HTLV-1 protease."
https://openalex.org/W4285083826,"Objective To assess whether an adapted Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) like cross-sectional household survey with full pregnancy histories can demonstrate the validity of health and demographic surveillance (HDSS) data by producing similar population structural characteristics and childhood mortality indicators at two HDSS sites in The Gambia–Farafenni and Basse. Methods A DHS-type survey was conducted of 2,580 households in the Farafenni HDSS, and 2,907 in the Basse HDSS. Household members were listed and pregnancy histories obtained for all women aged 15–49. HDSS datasets were extracted for the same households including residency episodes for all current and former members and compared with the survey data. Neonatal (0–28 days), infant (&lt;1 year), child (1–4 years) and under-5 (&lt; 5 years) mortality rates were derived from each source by site and five-year periods from 2001–2015 and by calendar year between 2011 and 2015 using Kaplan–Meier failure probabilities. Survey-HDSS rate ratios were determined using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results The selected households in Farafenni comprised a total population of 27,646 in the HDSS, compared to 26,109 captured in the household survey, implying higher coverage of 94.4% (95% CI: 94.1–94.7; p &lt;0.0001) against a hypothesised proportion of 90% in the HDSS. All population subgroups were equally covered by the HDSS except for the Wollof ethnic group. In Basse, the total HDSS population was 49,287, compared to 43,538 enumerated in the survey, representing an undercount of the HDSS by the survey with a coverage of 88.3% (95% CI: 88.0–88.6; p = 1). All sub-population groups were also under-represented by the survey. Except for the neonatal mortality rate for Farafenni, the childhood mortality indicators derived from pregnancy histories and HDSS data compare reasonably well by 5-year periods from 2001–2015. Annual estimates from the two data sources for the most recent quinquennium, 2011–2015, were similar in both sites, except for an excessively high neonatal mortality rate for Farafenni in 2015. Conclusion Overall, the adapted DHS-type survey has reasonably represented the Farafenni HDSS database using population size and structure; and both databases using childhood mortality indicators. If the hypothetical proportion is lowered to 85%, the survey would adequately validate both HDSS databases in all considered aspects. The adapted DHS-type sample household survey therefore has potential for validation of HDSS data."

https://openalex.org/W4285389594,"Daphnia, an ecologically important zooplankton species in lakes, shows both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature and fish predation, but little is known about the molecular basis of these responses and their potential interactions. We performed a factorial experiment exposing laboratory-propagated Daphnia pulicaria clones from two lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California to normal or high temperature (15°C or 25°C) in the presence or absence of fish kairomones, then measured changes in life history and gene expression. Exposure to kairomones increased upper thermal tolerance limits for physiological activity in both clones. Cloned individuals matured at a younger age in response to higher temperature and kairomones, while size at maturity, fecundity and population intrinsic growth were only affected by temperature. At the molecular level, both clones expressed more genes differently in response to temperature than predation, but specific genes involved in metabolic, cellular, and genetic processes responded differently between the two clones. Although gene expression differed more between clones from different lakes than experimental treatments, similar phenotypic responses to predation risk and warming arose from these clone-specific patterns. Our results suggest that phenotypic plasticity responses to temperature and kairomones interact synergistically, with exposure to fish predators increasing the tolerance of Daphnia pulicaria to stressful temperatures, and that similar phenotypic responses to temperature and predator cues can be produced by divergent patterns of gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4285494375,"The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) which causes that amphibian disease chytridiomycosis is expanding its worldwide range from an Asian origin, infecting amphibians in a growing number of countries. Modelling the potential range of this amphibian pathogen using environmental variables and presence data could advance our understanding of at-risk areas and species in locations with limited surveillance to date. We used a species distribution model to assess Bd habitat suitability in the three Guiana’s (Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana) in South America. The model output showed that all three countries have substantial areas where Bd could grow and proliferate, and maximum temperature of the warmest month was the top predictor of suitable Bd habitat, inversely correlated with modeled Bd occurrence. Predicted Bd infection areas in Guyana and French Guiana were large and localized whereas possible sites in Suriname were more scattered throughout the country. The areas projected as potential suitable in Suriname were mostly high elevation regions. These results could help inform efficiencies for development of a proactive monitoring program that could alert managers of novel Bd outbreaks for focused mitigation actions to forestall the spread of this amphibian disease."
https://openalex.org/W4285495628,"Humans have the remarkable ability to efficiently group elements of a scene together to form a global whole. However, cross-cultural comparisons show that East Asian individuals process scenes more globally than White individuals. This experiment presents new insights into global processing, revealing the relative contributions of two types of visual cells in mediating global and local visual processing in these two groups. Participants completed the Navon hierarchical letters task under divided-attention conditions, indicating whether a target letter ""H"" was present in the stimuli. Stimuli were either 'unbiased', displayed as black letters on a grey screen, or biased to predominantly process low spatial frequency information using psychophysical thresholds that converted unbiased stimuli into achromatic magnocellular-biased stimuli and red-green isoluminant parvocellular-biased stimuli. White participants processed stimuli more globally than Asian participants when low spatial frequency information was conveyed via the parvocellular pathway, while Asian participants showed a global processing advantage when low spatial frequency information was conveyed via the magnocellular pathway, and to a lesser extent through the parvocellular pathway. These findings suggest that the means by which a global processing bias is achieved depends on the subcortical pathway through which visual information is transmitted, and provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between global/local processing, subcortical pathways and spatial frequencies."
