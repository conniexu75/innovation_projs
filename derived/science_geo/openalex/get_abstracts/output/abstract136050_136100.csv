https://openalex.org/W1991054305,"A cDNA was isolated from rat C6 glioma cells by expression cloning which encodes a novel Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter designated LAT1. For functional expression in Xenopusoocytes, LAT1 required the heavy chain of 4F2 cell surface antigen (CD98), a type II membrane glycoprotein. When co-expressed with 4F2 heavy chain, LAT1 transported neutral amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains and did not accept basic amino acids or acidic amino acids. The transport via LAT1 was Na+-independent and sensitive to a system L-specific inhibitor 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid. These functional properties correspond to those of the classically characterized amino acid transport system L, a major nutrient transporter. In in vitro translation, LAT1 was shown to be a nonglycosylated membrane protein consistent with the property of 4F2 light chain, suggesting LAT1 is at least one of the proteins formerly referred to as 4F2 light chain. LAT1 exhibits relatively low but significant amino acid sequence similarity to mammalian cationic amino acid transporters and amino acid permeases of bacteria and yeasts, indicating LAT1 is a new member of the APC superfamily. Because of highly regulated nature and high level of expression in tumor cell lines, LAT1 is thought to be up-regulated to support the high protein synthesis for cell growth and cell activation. The cloning of LAT1 is expected to facilitate the research on the protein-protein interaction in the transporter field and to provide a clue to the search for still unidentified transporters.

The organic nutrients such as sugars and amino acids are provided to cells via transporters situated on the plasma membrane (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 2Hediger M.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 15-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transport of large neutral amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains are mediated by amino acid transport system L (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 3Oxender D.L. Christensen H.N. Nature. 1963; 197: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). System L is a Na+-independent neutral amino acid transport agency and thought to be a major route to provide cells with branched or aromatic amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, and methionine (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of system L has not been characterized. It has, however, been indicated recently that the knockout of 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc)1 by antisense oligonucleotides reduced the system L activity in rat C6 glioma cells (4Broer S. Broer A. Hamprecht B. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 4F2 antigen (CD98) is a heterodimeric protein composed of two subunits, a 80-kDa glycosylated heavy chain and a 40-kDa nonglycosylated light chain (5Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). The 4F2 antigen has been identified originally as a cell surface antigen associated with lymphocyte activation (5Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of 4F2 antigen has not been clarified, it has attracted investigators, because it is involved in variety of cellular activity such as cell activation, cell growth, and cell adhesion (5Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yagita H. Masuko T. Hashimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1478-1484PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). 4F2hc is an integral membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain classified as type II membrane protein (9Quackenbush E. Clabby M. Gottesdiener K.M. Barbosa J. Jones N.H. Strominger J.L. Speck S. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6526-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The 4F2 light chain, however, has not been identified by molecular cloning. When 4F2hc was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it induced the transport of neutral and basic amino acids with the property of system y+L, which is in agreement with the fact that 4F2hc exhibits amino acid sequence similarity to the type II membrane protein D2/rBAT, a cystinuria-associated putative amino acid transport activator (10Wells R.G. Lee W.S. Kanai Y. Leiden J.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15285-15288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X.

Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was supposed that 4F2hc, as well as D2/rBAT, associates with unidentified amino acid transporters to activate them (12Palacin M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned above, in mammalian cells, 4F2hc was proposed to activate neutral amino acid-specific transport system L based on the knockout of 4F2hc by antisense oligonucleotides (4Broer S. Broer A. Hamprecht B. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study to identify system L transporter, we have, therefore, performed expression cloning by co-expression of 4F2hc and rat C6 glioma cell cDNA library. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel Na+-independent transporter for large neural amino acids, which requires 4F2hc for its functional expression. Xenopus laevis oocyte expression studies and uptake measurements were performed as described elsewhere (13Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with in vitrotranscribed cRNA (5 ng) of 4F2hc (GenBankTM/EBI/DDBJ accession number AB015433) and poly(A)+ RNA (45 ng) obtained from C6 glioma cells. Two days after injection, the uptake of [14C]l-leucine was measured for 30 min in Na+-free uptake solution (choline-Cl, 100 mm;KCl, 2 mm; CaCl2, 1 mm;MgCl2, 1 mm; HEPES, 10 mm; Tris, 5 mm, pH 7.4) containing 50 μm[14C]l-leucine (1.0 μCi/ml). Expression cloning using theXenopus oocyte expression system was performed as described (15Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 16Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 17Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Four-hundred μg of C6 glioma poly(A)+ RNA was size-fractionated (17Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). RNA from each fraction (45 ng) was co-expressed with 4F2hc cRNA (5 ng) in Xenopus oocytes. Positive fractions showing peak stimulation of [14C]l-leucine (50 μm) uptake when co-expressed with 4F2hc were used to construct a directional cDNA library. cRNA synthesized in vitro from pools of ∼500 clones was injected with 4F2hc cRNA into Xenopusoocytes (17Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). A positive pool was sequentially subdivided and analyzed until single clone (LAT1) was identified. The cDNA was sequenced in both directions by dideoxy termination method and dye terminator cycle sequencing method by Applied Biosystems. Xenopus oocytes were injected with 15 ng of LAT1 cRNA and 10 ng of 4F2hc cRNA giving the mole ratio of 1:1. Two days after injection the uptake of 14C-labeled amino acids was measured as described above in the Na+-free uptake solution containing 0.5 μCi/ml radiolabeled compounds. For Na+ uptake solution, choline-Cl in the Na+-free uptake solution was replaced by NaCl. For Cl−-free uptake solution, Cl− in the Na+ uptake solution was replaced by gluconate anion. For the efflux measurement, [14C]l-leucine (20 μm; 2 μCi/ml) was preloaded by incubating the oocytes for 30 min. Then, the individual oocytes were transferred to Na+-free uptake solution with or without 100 μm nonradiolabeledl-leucine (18Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Gelpi J.L. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in the medium and the remaining radioactivity in oocytes were measured. Because the [14C]l-leucine (20 μm) uptake into oocytes expressing LAT1 was linearly dependent on incubation time up to 60 min (data not shown), so for all the experiments uptakes were measured for 30 min, and the values were expressed as picomoles/oocyte/min. For the uptake measurements in the present study, six to nine oocytes were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of uptake (n = 6–9). To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three separate experiments using different batches of oocytes and in vitrotranscribed cRNA were performed for each measurement. Results from the representative experiments were shown in the figures. Procedure for in vitrotranslation have been described elsewhere (19Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H.

Acta. 1991; 1064: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vitrotranslation of cRNAs for LAT1 and 4F2hc was performed by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system with or without canine pancreatic microsome membrane (Promega) and endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim). Poly(A)+ RNA (3 μg/lane) isolated from rat tissues and tumor cell lines was separated on 1% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell) (14Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 21Kanai Y. Stelzner M.G. Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1087-F1092PubMed Google Scholar). The BamHI fragment of LAT1 cDNA corresponding to 1135–1529 base pairs was labeled with 32P using aT7QuickPrime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was for 20 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide. The final stringent wash of the filter was in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 3 × 20 min (14Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 21Kanai Y. Stelzner M.G. Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1087-F1092PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor cell lines were provided by Health Science Research Resources Bank, Japan Health Sciences Foundation. When poly(A)+ RNA from rat C6 glioma cells was expressed in X. laevis oocytes, the synergistic augmentation of [14C]l-leucine uptake was detected by co-expression with 4F2hc (Fig. 1 A). The size fractionation of the C6 glioma cell poly(A)+ RNA revealed that the fraction of 2.8–3.8 kb contained the peak activity for [14C]l-leucine uptake when co-expressed with 4F2hc. From this fraction, a cDNA library was constructed and screened for [14C]l-leucine uptake by co-expression with 4F2hc in Xenopus oocytes. A 3.5-kb cDNA was isolated, which encodes a protein designated LAT1 (L-type amino acid transporter 1). As shown in Fig. 1 B, LAT1 by itself did not induce [14C]l-leucine transport. 4F2hc when solely expressed induced low levels ofl-leucine transport, probably due to the activation of oocyte endogenous transporters. The co-expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc resulted in the large leucine uptake, indicating that 4F2hc is indispensable for the functional expression of LAT1. The functional characteristics of LAT1 were examined by co-expression with 4F2hc in Xenopus oocytes. The uptake of [14C]l-leucine was saturable and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K m value of 18.1 ± 3.4 μm (mean ± S.E., n= 4) (data not shown). The substrate selectivity of LAT1 was investigated by inhibition experiments in which 20 μm[14C]l-leucine uptake was measured in the presence of 2 mm amino acids. The l-leucine uptake was highly inhibited by l-isomers of isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan, valine, and a classical system L-specific inhibitor 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) (Fig. 2 A). These amino acids were confirmed to be transport substrates of LAT1 by the uptake of radiolabeled compounds (Fig. 2 B). Basic amino acids lysine and arginine and acidic amino acids glutamate and aspartate did not inhibit [14C]l-leucine uptake (Fig. 2 A) (12Palacin M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kanai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LAT1 was less stereoselective for leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine, whereas it was highly stereoselective for tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan, and valine (Fig. 2 C). The uptake of l-leucine was not dependent on Na+ or Cl− (Fig. 1 C). Because LAT1-induced amino acid transport was apparently accumulative despite its independence on Na+ or Cl−, we tested whether LAT1-mediated transport is an amino acid exchange that could drive the transport. As shown in Fig. 1 D,l-leucine applied outside the oocytes induced the efflux of preloaded [14C]l-leucine, suggesting LAT1 is an amino acid exchanger. The LAT1 cDNA (3455 base pairs) contains a single open reading frame encoding a putative 512-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 56 kDa (Fig. 3 A). The first ATG, which is in the Kozak consensus initiation sequence for translation (23Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar) (GAGAGCATGG), was predicted to be the start for translation. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) indicated that LAT1 is an integral membrane protein with putative 12 membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 3 B).In vitro translation of LAT1 showed a band of 44-kDa protein (Fig. 3 C). Although 4F2hc was glycosylated by canine pancreatic microsomes, LAT1 was not glycosylated (Fig. 3 C). The search of protein data bases (April 1998) revealed that LAT1 sequence is novel and exhibits relatively low but significant homology to those of mammalian Na+-independent cationic amino acid transporters (e.g. 30% identity to mouse CAT2 (25Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7538-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and amino acid permeases of bacteria and yeasts (e.g. 29% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae methionine permease MUP1 (26Isnard A.D. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Therefore LAT1 denotes a new and distinct member of the APC superfamily, which includes prokaryote and eukaryote Na+-independent transporters for amino acids, polyamines, and choline (27MacLeod C.L. Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 109-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Northern blot analysis indicated that a 3.8-kb message is expressed at high level in brain, spleen, and placenta and at low level in testis and colon (Fig. 4 A). In placenta, an additional 2.6-kb message was also detected. LAT1 was expressed at high levels in C6 glioma, hepatoma (dRLh-84), and hepatocarcinoma (FAA-HTC1) cell lines, whereas normal liver did not express LAT1 (Fig. 4 B). A high level of LAT1 expression was also detected in human tumor cell lines such as stomach signet ring cell carcinoma (KATOIII), malignant melanoma (G-361), and lung small cell carcinoma (RERF-LC-MA) by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). By co-expression of 4F2hc and rat C6 glioma cell cDNA library in Xenopus oocytes, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel Na+-independent transporter LAT1. Because it prefers neutral amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains and is inhibited by a system L-specific inhibitor BCH, we conclude that LAT1 is a transporter corresponding to classically characterized neutral amino acid transport system L (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 3Oxender D.L. Christensen H.N. Nature. 1963; 197: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For the functional expression in Xenopus oocytes, LAT1 requires co-expression of 4F2hc. This is in agreement with the previous report showing that the antisense oligonucleotide for 4F2hc reduced the system L activity in C6 glioma cells (4Broer S. Broer A. Hamprecht B. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the manner of interaction between the two proteins is not clarified at present, it is indicated in the present study that the interaction is essential for the transporter to be functional. The 4F2 antigen is a heterodimeric protein. Its light chain has been reported to be a 40-kDa nonglycosylated protein (5Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). Our in vitro translation results are consistent with the properties of 4F2 light chain. It is, therefore, suggested that LAT1 is at least one of the proteins previously referred to as 4F2 light chain (5Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar, 12Palacin M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our Northern blot showed that LAT1 is expressed in some restricted tissues. Because system L transporter should be present in every tissue for cellular nutrition and in kidney and small intestine for epithelial transport (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), it is proposed that the other isoforms exist in tissues which lack LAT1. In fact, heterogeneity in the properties of system L has been reported (28Gallardo M.A. Albi J.L. Sanchez J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29Weissbach L. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12006-12011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Christensen H.N. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1975; 6: 227-258Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Guidotti G.G. Borghetti A.F. Gazzola G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 329-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is interesting to know whether other unidentified isoforms are also coupled to 4F2hc, which is expressed ubiquitously (32Parmacek M.S. Karpinski B.A. Gottesdiener K.M. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1915-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it should be clarified whether other transporters of the APC superfamily require 4F2hc or other related proteins for their functional expression. When 4F2hc was solely expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it induces the activity of neutral and basic amino acid transport system y+L but not neutral amino acid-specific system L (10Wells R.G. Lee W.S. Kanai Y. Leiden J.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15285-15288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A.

Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which let us speculate that 4F2hc could couple to multiple transporters with related structures. The data base search indicated that partial or incomplete sequences of LAT1 (E16, TA1, and ASUR4b) were already reported (33Gaugitsch H.W. Prieschl E.E. Kaithoff F. Huber N.E. Baumruker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sang J. Lim Y.-P. Panzia M. Finch P. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1152-1159PubMed Google Scholar, 35Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). E16 (human) and ASUR4b (Xenopus) were identified to be up-regulated upon the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes and the stimulation of A6 epithelial cell line by aldosterone, respectively (33Gaugitsch H.W. Prieschl E.E. Kaithoff F. Huber N.E. Baumruker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting highly regulated nature of LAT1 gene expression. TA1 (rat) was identified as a tumor-associated sequence with the oncofetal pattern of expression in rat liver (34Sang J. Lim Y.-P. Panzia M. Finch P. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1152-1159PubMed Google Scholar). TA1 immunoreactivity was abundant in human colon cancer in vivo but barely detected in surrounding normal colon tissue (36Wolf D.A. Wang S. Panzia M.A. Bassily N.H. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5012-5022PubMed Google Scholar), confirming the high level of expression of LAT1 protein in tumor cells. We also detected strong LAT1 expression in some tumor cell lines. It is, therefore, speculated that LAT1 expression is up-regulated in rapidly dividing tumor cells and established cell lines to supply cells with more essential amino acids to support the continuous growth and proliferation. We have identified a system L amino acid transporter LAT1 and showed that 4F2hc is essential for LAT1 to be functional. The cloning of LAT1 is expected to facilitate the research on the protein-protein interaction in the transporter field and to provide a clue to the search for still unidentified amino acid transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2047231993,"Abstract Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP) is a novel lipid messenger that has dual function. Intracellularly it regulates proliferation and survival, and extracellularly, it is a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor Edg-1. Based on peptide sequences obtained from purified rat kidney sphingosine kinase, the enzyme that regulates SPP levels, we report here the cloning, identification, and characterization of the first mammalian sphingosine kinases (murine SPHK1a and SPHK1b). Sequence analysis indicates that these are novel kinases, which are not similar to other known kinases, and that they are evolutionarily conserved. Comparison withSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans sphingosine kinase sequences shows that several blocks are highly conserved in all of these sequences. One of these blocks contains an invariant, positively charged motif, GGKGK, which may be part of the ATP binding site. From Northern blot analysis of multiple mouse tissues, we observed that expression was highest in adult lung and spleen, with barely detectable levels in skeletal muscle and liver. Human embryonic kidney cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transiently transfected with either sphingosine kinase expression vectors had marked increases (more than 100-fold) in sphingosine kinase activity. The enzyme specifically phosphorylatedd-erythro-sphingosine and did not catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol, diacylglycerol, ceramide,d,l-threo-dihydrosphingosine orN,N-dimethylsphingosine. The latter two sphingolipids were competitive inhibitors of sphingosine kinase in the transfected cells as was previously found with the purified rat kidney enzyme. Transfected cells also had a marked increase in mass levels of SPP with a concomitant decrease in levels of sphingosine and, to a lesser extent, in ceramide levels. Our data suggest that sphingosine kinase is a prototypical member of a new class of lipid kinases. Cloning of sphingosine kinase is an important step in corroborating the intracellular role of SPP as a second messenger."

Oleate induced steady-state levels of M-CPT I mRNA 4.5-fold. The transcription of a plasmid construct containing the human M-CPT I gene promoter region fused to a luciferase gene reporter transfected into cardiac myocytes, was induced over 20-fold by long-chain fatty acid in a concentration-dependent and fatty acyl-chain length-specific manner. The M-CPT I gene promoter fatty acid response element (FARE-1) was localized to a hexameric repeat sequence located between 775 and 763 base pairs upstream of the initiator codon. Cotransfection experiments with expression vectors for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) demonstrated that FARE-1 is a PPARα response element capable of conferring oleate-mediated transcriptional activation to homologous or heterologous promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PPARα bound FARE-1 with the retinoid X receptor α. The expression of M-CPT I in hearts of mice null for PPARα was approximately 50% lower than levels in wild-type controls. Moreover, a PPARα activator did not induce cardiac expression of the M-CPT I gene in the PPARα null mice. These results demonstrate that long-chain fatty acids regulate the transcription of a gene encoding a pivotal enzyme in the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake pathway in cardiac myocytes and define a role for PPARα in the control of myocardial lipid metabolism.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I; palmitoyl-CoA:l-carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase; EC2.3.1.21) catalyzes the initial reaction in the mitochondrial import of long-chain fatty acids, a tightly regulated step in the cellular fatty acid utilization pathway (17McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 18McGarry J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The activity of CPT I is an important determinant of cellular fatty acid oxidative flux. CPT I catalyzes the transfer of a long-chain fatty acyl group from coenzyme A to carnitine. A specific translocase (carnitine-acylcarnitine carrier) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane delivers long-chain acylcarnitines into the mitochondrial matrix where they are re-esterified to acyl-thioesters by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II). Acyl-thioesters in the mitochondria undergo β-oxidation generating reducing equivalents used to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Recent studies have demonstrated that CPT I exists as two isoforms encoded by separate genes: liver-type (L-CPT I or CPT IA), a hepatic-enriched, ubiquitously expressed protein (19Esser V.

CPT I activity is inhibited by the reversible binding of malonyl-CoA, the first committed intermediate in the pathway of fatty acid synthesis (17McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 18McGarry J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA is proposed to inhibit hepatic fatty acid oxidation during periods of fatty acid synthesis. Much less is known about the regulation of CPT I activity in heart. The IC50of M-CPT I for malonyl-CoA is approximately 100-fold lower than that of L-CPT I (24McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Forter D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), yet the malonyl-CoA concentration in liver and heart is similar (25Singh B. Stakkestad J.A. Bremer J. Borrebaek B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 138: 107-111Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These observations have led to speculation that control of M-CPT I activity occurs, at least in part, via malonyl-CoA independent mechanisms. We hypothesized that long-chain fatty acids regulate M-CPT I gene expression. In this study we demonstrate that expression of the M-CPT I gene is regulated in cardiac myocytes, at the transcriptional level, by long-chain fatty acids via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Our results suggest a mechanism for the control of myocardial fatty acid utilization at the mitochondrial import step, by long-chain acyl substrate levels. Cardiac myocytes were prepared from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described (13Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, ventricle was removed and digested in 0.2% collagenase (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), the cells were pooled in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and subjected to differential plating (1 h) to reduce fibroblast contamination. Nonadherent cells (enhanced cardiocyte fraction) were plated to 50% confluence on 60-mm diameter dishes pretreated with collagen (Sigma). After 24 h the cell medium was switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.10 mm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma). Oleate was diluted to 20 mm in water preheated to 70 °C. NaOH (1n) was added dropwise until oleate was solubilized. The oleate was then complexed to BSA (molar ratio 7:1) to yield a final oleate concentration of 4.7 mm. The sodium salts of n-decanoic acid and n-caproic acid were each diluted in water to a concentration of 100 mm. The sodium salt of etomoxir (Research Biochemicals International) was diluted in water to a concentration of 4 mm. Each of these stock solutions were diluted in cell culture medium to the concentrations outlined under “Results.” RNA blotting was performed as described (26Kelly D.P. Gordon J.I. Alpers R. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18921-18925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from rat neonatal cardiac myocytes in cell culture or mouse ventricle using the RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc.) method. Probes used included a rat M-CPT I cDNA, a mouse ATPase subunit e cDNA (27Levy F.H. Kelly D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 41: C457-C465Crossref Google Scholar), a cDNA probe encoding 18 S ribosomal RNA, and a human β-actin cDNA. Band intensities were quantified by laser densitometry using an LKB Ultrascan XL (Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.) or by phosphorimaging using a Bio-Rad GS 525 Molecular Imager System. For Northern blot analyses with mouse tissues, total RNA was isolated from ventricles of adult (2–3-month-old) male mice null for PPARα or age-matched wild-type controls. The production and initial characterization of mice lacking PPARα have been described (28Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the human M-CPT I gene was cloned by PCR amplification of a BAC subclone template known to contain the M-CPT I gene (GenBank data base accession number U62317; a gift from the Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD). The region from 1025 to 12 bp 5′ of the initiation codon adenine (1Neely J.R. Rovetto M.J. Oram J.F. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1972; 15: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was amplified using the proofreading polymerase Pwo (Boehringer Mannheim). Automated DNA sequencing confirmed that the nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was 100% identical to the template sequence. MCPT.Luc.1025 was constructed by cloning the human M-CPT I gene 5′-flanking region from 12 to 1025 bp upstream of the start codon adenine into the promoterless pGL2-Basic plasmid (Promega). The deletion constructs MCPT.Luc.915, MCPT.Luc.781, and MCPT.Luc.724 were generated by PCR amplification of the BAC subclone template using the same 3′ primer used to construct MCPT.Luc.1025 and 5′ primers beginning 915, 781, and 724 base pairs 5′ of the start codon adenine, respectively. The M-CPT I promoter point mutant construct, MCPT.Luc.781m1, was generated by PCR amplification of the M-CPT I gene 5′-flanking genomic DNA extending from 781 to 12 base pairs 5′ of the start codon adenine using a 5′ PCR primer containing a cytidine for guanine mismatch substitution at position −771 (as illustrated in Fig. 3 B). All PCR products were ligated into the XhoI (5′) and HindIII (3′) sites in pGL2-Basic. The heterologous promoter-reporter constructs MCPT(FARE)2TKLuc and MCPT(FAREm1)2TKLuc were constructed by ligation of two copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide (single-copy sense-strand sequences: MCPT(FARE)2TKLuc: 5′-GATCCGGTGACCTTTTCCCTACAG-3′ and MCPT(FAREm1)2TKLuc: 5′-GATCCGGTGACgTTTTCCCTACAG-3′ (lowercase bold letter denotes mutation)) containing BamHI overhangs into aBamHI site upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in a plasmid described previously (16Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR-generated mutations were excluded by automated sequence analysis of each promoter-reporter plasmid. Transient transfection of rat neonatal cardiac myocytes was performed as described (13Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using N-[1-(2, 3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP; Boehringer Mannheim). For each transfection, 1–2 μg of reporter plasmid was cotransfected with 100 ng of pRSVβ-Gal, a plasmid containing a β-galactosidase gene downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, to control for transfection efficiency. For the cotransfection experiments with the PPARα expression vector, human HepG2 cells were plated in 12-well dishes at 2 × 105cells/well and maintained in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient cell transfections were performed using a modified calcium-phosphate precipitation method (29Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. II. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Four micrograms of reporter plasmid and 100 ng of pRSVβ-Gal were added to each well of transfected cells. In some wells, 1 μg of pCDM.PPAR, a mammalian expression vector containing a mouse PPARα cDNA (30Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), or 1 μg of pCDM(−), the expression vector backbone lacking the PPARα cDNA, was added. Oleate, etomoxir, and vehicle were added to the cell medium 16 h after transfection. The cells were harvested 24 h later. Luciferase activities were determined by the standard luciferin-ATP assay, and β-galactosidase activity was measured by the Galacto-Light chemiluminescence assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in an Analytical Luminescence Monolight 2010 luminometer. EMSAs were performed as described (16Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pT7lac-RXRα bacterial expression vector was generously provided by Dr. Tod Gulick (Harvard University). Nuclear receptor was overproduced in bacterial cells and partially purified as described (16Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCal-n (m.PPAR) was generated by PCR cloning of mouse PPARα cDNA into the pCAL-n vector (Stratagene) and used for in vitro transcription/translation in the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) per standard protocol. The M-CPT I FARE-1 probe sense strand sequence is 5′-GATCCGGTGACCTTTTCCCTACAG-3′. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was 32P-labeled by Klenow “fill-in” of a 5′-GATC overhang. Antibody “supershift” experiments were performed with polyclonal antibodies directed against human PPARα (a gift of Dr. Michael Arand, University of Mainz), or a monoclonal antibody directed against RXRα (a gift from Dr. Pierre Chambon, INSERM, Strasbourg, France). Specific antibody or preimmune sera was added to a mixture containing labeled probe and protein, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by resolution on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Differences between mean mRNA levels were determined by unpaired Student's t test analysis. A statistically significant difference was defined as P < 0.05. All values shown represent the mean ± the standard error of the mean (S.E.). To determine whether M-CPT I gene expression is regulated by long-chain fatty acids in cardiac myocytes, M-CPT I mRNA levels were delineated in primary ventricular myocytes in culture following exposure to oleate (C18:1). For these experiments, myocytes isolated from 1-day-old rat ventricle were exposed to 0.5 mm oleate complexed to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or vehicle (BSA alone) for 90 h in serum-free medium. Mean M-CPT I mRNA levels were 4.5-fold higher in cardiac myocytes exposed to oleate compared with vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 1). Expression of the genes encoding several mitochondrial β-oxidation cycle enzymes including very-long-chain and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase also increased in the presence of oleate (data not shown). The level of β-actin mRNA, a control for loading, was not different in vehicle compared with oleate-treated cells. Similarly, the expression of the mRNA encoding ATPase subunit e, a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein, was not affected by exposure to oleate indicating that the regulatory effect does not involve all nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. To determine whether the oleate-induced increase in M-CPT I gene expression occurs at the transcriptional level, the oleate experiments were repeated with cardiac myocytes transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the human M-CPT I gene promoter region fused to a luciferase reporter gene. A 1013-bp fragment of M-CPT I gene 5′-flanking DNA was cloned by PCR amplification of a BAC subclone template containing the human M-CPT I gene (see “Materials and Methods”). The human M-CPT I gene 5′-flanking DNA contains two untranslated exons, 1A and 1B, that extend from 746 to 633 and 523 to 470 base pairs upstream of the start codon, respectively (31van der Leij F.R. Takens J. van der Veen A.Y. Terpstra P. Kuipers J.R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The 5′ ends of exons 1A and 1B function as independent transcription start sites (32Yamazaki N. Yamanaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The M-CPT I gene 5′-flanking region (from 1025 to 12 base pairs 5′ of the start codon adenine) was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in a promoterless reporter plasmid to generate MCPT.Luc.1025 (Fig. 2 A). The basal transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.1025 in cardiac myocytes was significantly higher (over 15-fold) than that of the promoterless vector backbone (data not shown). Oleate markedly induced the transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.1025 (approximately 25-fold; Fig. 2 A). The dose dependence of the oleate response was delineated by repeating the cardiac myocyte transfection experiments in serum-deprived medium containing 50, 250, or 500 μm oleate versusvehicle alone. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.1025 increases with increasing oleate concentration. To determine whether the fatty acid-induced transcription of the M-CPT I gene is acyl chain length-specific, dose-response experiments were repeated using decanoate (C10:0) and hexanoate (C6:0). Compared with the oleate response, the activity of MCPT.Luc.1025 was induced only modestly by decanoate and was not affected by hexanoate at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these data indicate that M-CPT I gene transcription is activated by long-chain fatty acids in a concentration-dependent and acyl chain length-specific manner. These results are consistent with the role of M-CPT I in the mitochondrial import of long-chain fatty acids. Cardiac myocyte transfections were repeated with a MCPT.Luc deletion series to localize the oleate-responsive region within the human M-CPT I gene promoter region. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing M-CPT I 5′-flanking DNA extending from 1025 (MCPT.Luc.1025), 915 (MCPT.Luc.915), 781 (MCPT.Luc.781), and 724 (MCPT.Luc.724) bp upstream of the M-CPT I start codon adenine were used for these experiments. The oleate response was preserved with the MCPT.Luc.915 and MCPT.Luc.781 constructs but was absent with MCPT.Luc.724 (Fig. 3 A). The basal transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.724 was approximately 50% lower than that of MCPT.Luc.781 but still significantly greater than that of the promoterless, reporter vector backbone indicating that the lack of an oleate response is not due to the loss of promoter function. Thus, the M-CPT I gene 5′-flanking region between −781 and −724 contains a fatty acid response element. DNA sequence analysis of the M-CPT I gene promoter oleate-responsive region revealed the presence of an imperfect hexameric repeat separated by a single nucleotide (DR-1;−775-TGACCTTTTCCCT-−763). The antisense sequence of each half-site of the putative fatty acid-responsive element (Fig. 3 B) conforms to the consensus ((A/G)GG(T/G)NA) for binding class II members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The transfections were repeated with a mutated MCPT.Luc.781 construct containing a cytidine substitution for the invariant consensus second position guanine within the 5′-most hexameric half-site of the DR-1 sequence (MCPT.Luc.781m1; Fig. 3 B). The basal transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.781m1 was not significantly different than that of MCPT.Luc.781 (data not shown). However, the oleate response was abolished by this single bp substitution (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the DR-1 located between −775 and −763 is required for the M-CPT I gene fatty acid response in cardiac myocytes. This element will be referred to as thefatty acid responseelement-1 or FARE-1. Previous studies have shown that DR-1 elements serve as binding sites for PPAR·RXR heterodimers (33Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Given the results of previous studies demonstrating that PPARα regulates the transcription of genes encoding other mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation enzymes (33Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), we speculated that this receptor was a candidate for the fatty acid-mediated control of M-CPT I gene expression. Indeed, PPARα has been shown to be activated by fatty acids (34Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M.

To determine whether FARE-1 is activated by PPARα, hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cells were cotransfected with a PPARα mammalian expression vector (pCDM.PPAR) and MCPT.Luc.781 or MCPT.Luc.781m1 in the presence or absence of oleate or etomoxir, known PPARα activators (30Gulick T.

Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). The HepG2 cell line was chosen because, in contrast to cardiac myocytes, the MCPT.Luc.781 oleate response is minimal allowing for a “null” background. The transcriptional activity of MCPT.Luc.781 increased less than 1.5-fold in the presence of oleate or etomoxir alone (Fig. 4 A). Cotransfection of pCDM.PPAR in the absence of an exogenous activator induced MCPT.Luc.781 transcription nearly 7-fold. The addition of oleate or the CPT I inhibitor etomoxir to cells cotransfected with pCDM.PPAR induced MCPT.Luc.781 transcription 2–3.5-fold higher than pCDM.PPAR cotransfection alone (total activation 16–24-fold; Fig. 4 A). In contrast, transcription of the point mutant construct MCPT.Luc.781m1 was not induced by pCDM.PPAR cotransfection in the absence or presence of activators (Fig. 4 A). To test whether FARE-1 could confer PPARα responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, two copies of FARE-1 were cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus TK promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene (MCPT(FARE)2TKLuc). Cotransfection studies were performed with MCPT(FARE)2TKLuc and pCDM.PPAR in the presence and absence of oleate or etomoxir (Fig. 4 B). Neither oleate nor etomoxir alone activated MCPT(FARE)2TKLuc. Overexpression of PPARα resulted in a 5-fold activation of MCPT(FARE)2TKLuc activity with an additional 1.6–2-fold induction with addition of oleate or etomoxir (total activation 8–10-fold; Fig. 4 B). When a point mutation identical to that present in MCPT.Luc.781m1 was introduced into both copies of FARE-1 in the context of TKLuc (MCPT(FAREm1)2TKLuc), PPARα responsiveness was abolished (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these results define FARE-1 as a PPARα response element. PPARα binds cognate DNA elements as a heterodimer with RXR (36Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed to characterize the interaction of PPARα·RXRα heterodimers with the PPARα-responsive element, FARE-1. EMSA was performed with a radiolabeled FARE-1 oligonucleotide probe, RXRα (produced by overexpression in bacteria), and PPARα produced byin vitro coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation. The FARE-1 probe formed a light complex with PPARα alone and no complex with RXRα alone (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). A prominent FARE·protein complex formed when both PPARα and RXRα were added to the incubation (Fig. 5, lane 4). Competition experiments performed with a molar excess of specific (FARE-1) or an unrelated, size-matched, double-stranded nonspecific oligonucleotide confirmed that the prominent complex of lowest mobility formed with PPARα and RXRα represented a specific DNA-protein interaction (Fig. 5, lanes 5–7). Antibody recognition studies confirmed that PPARα and RXRα were present in the FARE-1/protein complex. The FARE-1/protein complex was supershifted by either a polyclonal antibody that recognizes mouse PPARα (37Gebel T. Arand M. Oesch F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or an anti-RXRα antibody, whereas addition of preimmune sera did not alter its mobility (Fig. 5,lanes 8–10). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, as reported for other PPARα response elements, PPARα and RXRα bind FARE-1 as a heterodimer. To determine the importance of PPARα in the regulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidative enzyme gene expression in vivo, M-CPT I gene expression was characterized in mice null for PPARα (PPARα−/−; Ref. 28Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell.

Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation cycle enzyme gene expression is reduced in the liver of PPARα−/− mice (28Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J.

Northern blot studies demonstrated that steady-state levels of M-CPT I mRNA are significantly lower (by 51 ± 9%) in the hearts of adult PPARα−/− mice compared with controls (Fig. 6 A). The studies were repeated following a 5-day administration of etomoxir, a known activator of PPARα. As expected, etomoxir induced myocardial expression of M-CPT I mRNA in PPARα+/+ mice (194 ± 15versus 100 ± 7). In contrast, the PPAR activator did not induce M-CPT I gene expression in the hearts of PPARα−/− mice (64 ± 10 versus 58 ± 10) (Fig. 6 B). These results confirm the role of PPARα as an activator of M-CPT I gene expression in heart in vivo. The energy substrate preference of the mammalian heart is tightly controlled during development and in response to diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions (2Bing R.J.

The fetal heart produces energy primarily through catabolism of glucose and lactate (1Neely J.R. Rovetto M.J. Oram J.F. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1972; 15: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Following birth, the mammalian heart switches to fatty acids as the chief energy substrate. Compared with glucose, the oxidation of fatty acids provides more ATP per mole of substrate, albeit at the expense of increased oxygen consumption. Thus, fatty acid oxidation provides a greater capacity for energy production to meet the physiologic demands imposed on the postnatal mammalian heart. During cardiac hypertrophy and in the failing heart, the myocardium reverts to the fetal energy substrate utilization pattern using glucose as the chief energy substrate (4Bishop S.P. Altschuld R.A.

Previous studies have shown that expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation cycle enzymes is regulated at the transcriptional level in parallel with fatty acid utilization rates during development and in the hypertrophied and failing heart (12Sack M.N. Rader T.A. Park S. McCune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 13Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A.

Thus, the capacity for myocardial fatty acid oxidation is dictated, at least in part, via transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. In this report we describe a mechanism for the induction of M-CPT I gene expression by long-chain fatty acids in heart, namely transcriptional control by the fatty acid-activated nuclear receptor, PPARα. These results extend the gene regulatory paradigm established for the cardiac FAO cycle to mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid import, a highly regulated step in the myocardial lipid utilization pathway. Prior to this report, several lines of evidence suggested that fatty acids induce the expression of M-CPT I and other enzymes in the cellular fatty acid utilization pathway. First, the activity of CPT I and FAO cycle enzymes is up-regulated in parallel with the ingestion of a fatty acid-enriched diet during the suckling period (2Bing R.J. Harvey Lect. 1955; 50: 27-70Google Scholar, 3Taegtmeyer H. Curr. Prob. Cardiol. 1994; 19: 57-116Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The cardiac expression of these enzymes falls upon weaning in rats and mice (13Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Kelly D.P. Gordon J.I. Alpers R. Strauss A.W. J. Biol.

Second, long-chain fatty acids induce expression of CPT I in hepatocytes and pancreatic islet cells in culture (40Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Roche E. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 41Chatelain F. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Pegorier J-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Third, FAO enzyme gene expression is induced by fasting in liver and heart (39Nagao M. Parimoo B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24114-24124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results shown here demonstrate that M-CPT I gene transcription is activated by long-chain fatty acids via FARE-1, a PPARα response element. The activation of FARE-1 is acyl-chain length-specific and can be conferred to a heterologous promoter. Moreover, the reduced expression of M-CPT I in the PPAR−/− mouse heart suggests that, in vivo, fatty acids influence the basal transcription of this gene which is consistent with the presence of circulating lipids and reliance on fatty acids as the chief energy substrate in the adult mammalian heart. These results strongly suggest that intracellular fatty acid derivatives, several of which are known to activate PPARα, comprise a metabolic signaling pathway in heart. The role of PPARα in the control of hepatic lipid metabolism is well established. PPARα was first identified as a transcription factor involved in the hepatic response to peroxisome proliferators (42Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). The expression of PPARα target genes encoding enzymes involved in peroxisomal, cytochrome P450, and mitochondrial FAO is reduced in the liver of mice null for PPARα (28Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Further, the expected induction of peroxisomal PPARα target enzymes in response to peroxisome proliferators is absent in PPARα−/− mice (28Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). In addition to liver, PPARα is expressed abundantly in tissues with high capacity for fatty acid oxidation such as heart, kidney, and brown adipose tissue. The role of PPARα in extrahepatic tissues has not been characterized. Our results demonstrate one important function for PPARα in heart: transcriptional control of the gene encoding M-CPT I, a pivotal enzyme in the uptake of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. Taken together with the previous observation that the promoter of the gene encoding the cardiac-enriched mitochondrial FAO cycle enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase contains a PPARα response element (30Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11012-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), our results indicate that PPARα regulates myocardial as well as hepatic lipid metabolism. In summary, we have demonstrated that long-chain fatty acids regulate M-CPT I gene expression in heart through PPARα. We speculate that this transcriptional regulatory mechanism is activated as a component of the coordinate control of myocardial fatty acid utilization pathways following birth and is altered in pathophysiologic settings such as cardiac hypertrophy and failure. We thank Dr. Frank Gonzalez (National Cancer Institute) for the use of the PPARα−/− mice, Dr. Tod Gulick (Harvard University) for helpful discussions, and Kelly Hall for expert secretarial assistance.

Binding of these GTPases to a conserved p21-binding domain (PBD, also known as CRIB forCdc42/Rac1 interactivebinding) stimulates their serine/threonine kinase activities by a mechanism involving autophosphorylation (15Manser E.

The important roles that Paks play as effectors of Cdc42/Rac1 signaling have been established from genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and mammalian cells. The budding yeast homolog of mammalian Paks, Ste20, acts in concert with Cdc42 in the pheromone response to activate a MAP kinase cascade leading to transcription of genes required for cell cycle arrest. The same protein functions as an effector of Cdc42 to activate a different MAP kinase cascade leading to filamentous growth in response to nitrogen starvation (19Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The yeast model in which Pak/Ste20 links Cdc42 to transcriptional and cytoskeletal events is paralleled in mammalian cells; constitutively activated Pak mutants can activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAP kinase cascade leading to transcriptional control (12Bagrodia S.

This has been made all the more clear from the observations that Pak1 function is required for cellular transformation by Ras (8Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and that Pak2 activation is involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Rudel T. Bokoch G.M.

Here we describe the identification of two isoforms of a novel Pak-binding protein, probably resulting from alternative splicing of the same message, one of which is able to suppress Pak activation by upstream regulators.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify potential Pak-binding partners we used the yeast two-hybrid screen. One positive clone was used to screen cDNA libraries and data bases (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield two Pak3-binding proteins, p50 and p85Cool-1. They share an N-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 7–65), followed by a Dbl homology (DH) domain (amino acids 100–279) and an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (amino acids 295–400) (Fig. 1 A). Because p50 and p85Cool-1 are identical at the nucleotide level over amino acids 1–418, it is likely that they arise from alternative splicing of the same message. p85Cool-1 is identical to two recently cloned proteins, p85SPR (25Oh W.K. Yoo J.C. Jo D. Song Y.H. Kim M.G. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and β-PIX (26Manser E. Loo T.-H. Koh C.-G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Molec. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The DH domain of the Cool proteins shows the highest sequence identity to the DH domains of Dbl (33%), Scd1 (30%), Dbs (29%), Tiam-1 (29%), Still Life2 (29%), Cdc24 (26%), and Vav2 (24%). In addition to the genetic screen, we used recombinant GST-Pak3 (amino acids 148–239) to purify Pak-binding proteins from Src(Y527F)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Sequence obtained from an ∼85-kDa Pak-binding protein was identical to portions of p50 and p85Cool-1 (data not shown). We also identified a closely related cDNA from the data bases, and we have found that its product also interacts with Pak3. 2S. Bagrodia, M. Hart, and R. Cerione, unpublished observations. This protein, Cool-2, is identical to the recently described α-PIX (26Manser E. Loo T.-H. Koh C.-G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Molec. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar).To determine whether the Cool proteins bind to Pak3 in mammalian cells, we transiently co-expressed Myc-tagged p50Cool-1 and HA-tagged Pak3 in COS cells and assayed for complex formation by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). HA-Pak3 was detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B, lane 8, upper panel) and Myc-p50Cool-1 was detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B, lane 13, lower panel). Mutation of a conserved tryptophan residue within the SH3 domain (W43K) eliminated the ability of p50Cool-1 to associate with Pak3 (Fig. 1 B, lane 10, upper panel, and lane 14, lower panel), indicating that the SH3 domain of p50Cool-1 binds Pak3. The Src SH3-binding protein, Sam68, did not co-immunoprecipitate with Myc-p50Cool-1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 9, upper panel), although it bound to the SH3 domain of Cool-1in vitro, 3S. J. Taylor, S. Bagrodia, and R. Cerione, unpublished observations. and SH3 domains from the Dbl family proteins Dbs and Vav did not bind Pak3 (data not shown), showing specificity of the Cool-1/Pak3 associationin vivo. Pak3 contains four conventional (PXXP motif) SH3-binding sites (P1–P4); Pak3 containing Pro to Ala mutations in the P1-P4 sites, alone or in combination, were used to establish that these sites do not mediate Pak3-Cool-1 interactions (data not shown). While this manuscript was in preparation, Manser et al. reported binding of α-PIX and β-PIX (which correspond to Cool-2 and p85Cool-1) to residues 182–203 of Pak1, confirming the atypical (non-PXXP motif) nature of Cool binding to Paks (26Manser E.

Using a rabbit antiserum raised against full-length p50Cool-1, we detected two predominant proteins (from NIH 3T3 fibroblast lysates) that migrated at ∼85 and ∼78 kDa on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1 C, right panel, lane 1). Both of these proteins were detected in anti-Cool-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C, right panel, lane 3) as well as in anti-Pak3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C, right panel, lane 2), demonstrating an interaction between endogenous Cool proteins and Pak3 in NIH 3T3 cells. The less reactive band at ∼50 kDa recognized by the anti-Cool-1 antibody (Fig. 1 C, right panel, lane 1) may represent p50Cool-1; however, we were unable to determine whether p50Cool-1 was present in the immunoprecipitates because of the overlapping signal for IgG.The presence of a DH-PH tandem motif in Cool-1, a hallmark of Dbl family exchange factors (27Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), initially led us to consider the possibility that Cool-1 might activate Cdc42 or Rac. However, we were unable to detect stimulation of [3H]GDP dissociation from Cdc42 or Rac by recombinant p50Cool-1 purified fromEscherichia coli or insect cells under conditions where the Dbl oncoprotein strongly stimulated GDP dissociation from Cdc42 or RhoA (data not shown).We then considered the possibility that Cool-1 exchange activity may require cellular co-factors or post-translational modifications as proposed for Vav, Sos, and Tiam-1 (28Crespo P.

Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). To measure Rac1 or Cdc42 activation in vivo, we used a modification of a recently described assay for activated, GTP-bound Ras (24Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The PBD of Pak3 was expressed as a GST fusion protein and immobilized by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The immobilized GST-PBD was used to precipitate activated Cdc42 or Rac1 from transfected COS cell lysates (Fig. 2). In untreated control cells, relatively low levels (<5%) of HA-Rac1 (upper panel) or HA-Cdc42 (lower panel) were precipitated with GST-PBD (compare lane 1 (cell lysates) and lane 9(affinity-precipitated GTPase) in both panels). When Dbl was co-expressed with HA-tagged GTPases, there was a marked increase in the amounts of activated HA-Rac1 and HA-Cdc42 that were precipitated with GST-PBD (lane 16). The cellular activation of both Cdc42 and Rac by Dbl is consistent with results from micro-injection studies (32Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In contrast, p50Cool-1 did not detectably activate either HA-Rac1 or HA-Cdc42 (compare lanes 9 and 10), even after exposure to a number of different biological stimuli (lanes 11–15). Activation of Rac1 or Cdc42 by p85Cool-1 was also not detected, even when co-expressed with Pak3, under conditions where Tiam-1 resulted in the activation of Rac1 but not Cdc42 (data not shown). We have not detected Cool-1-mediated Rac1 activation in cells co-expressing potential activators of Rac including Src(Y527F), Ras(G12V), and Cdc42(Q61L)2. We next tested whether p50/p85Cool-1 could directly modulate Pak activity. Although p85Cool-1 was without significant effect (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2and 4), p50Cool-1 inhibited Dbl-stimulated Pak3 activity (lanes 2 and 3). p50Cool-1 (W43K) did not inhibit Dbl-activated Pak3 (lanes 2 and 5), indicating that binding of p50Cool-1 to Pak3 was required for its inhibitory effect. Immunoblotting confirmed that wild type and mutant Cool-1 proteins were equally expressed and that Dbl expression levels were unaffected by Cool-1 expression (data not shown); immunoprecipitated Pak3 levels were equal (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). We also found that purified, recombinant p50Cool-1 completely blocked Cdc42(Q61L)-stimulated autophosphorylation of Pak3 and strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein in Pak3 immunoprecipitates (data not shown).Figure 2Cool-1 does not detectably activate Cdc42 or Rac1 in vivo. COS cells were transfected with HA-Rac1 (top) or HA-Cdc42 (bottom) alone (lanes 1 and 9) or co-transfected with Myc-p50Cool-1 (lanes 2–7 and lanes 10–15) or with Dbl (lanes 8 and 16) for 48 h and then serum-starved for another 4 h and treated with 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) plus 25 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), 40 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 20% fetal calf serum, 50 ng/ml interleukin 1 (IL-1) for 10 min, or 200 μm methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) for 1 h as indicated. Cells were lysed and affinity-precipitated with immobilized GST-PBD (GST-PBD AP, lanes 9–16), and bound proteins were Western blotted and probed with anti-HA.Lanes 1–8 represent 5% of the whole cell lysate (WCL) used in the binding reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Cool-1 inhibits Dbl- and Cdc42-stimulated Pak3 activity. A, COS cells were transiently co-transfected with Pak3 (0.5 μg), Myc-p50Cool-1 (1 μg), Myc-p85Cool-1 (1 μg), Myc-p50W43KCool-1 (1 μg), or Dbl (1 μg), and Pak3 kinase activity was measured in Pak3 immunoprecipitates using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate. The top part (bottom panel) of the blot was probed with anti-Pak3, and the bottom part (top panel) of the blot was autoradiographed. Based on Western blot analysis the amount of Dbl was similar in lanes 2–5, the amounts of p50Cool-1 and p50Cool-1(W43K) were also similar in lanes 3 and 5, and p85Cool-1 was present in a slightly larger amount. B, COS cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg each of Myc-Pak3, Myc-p50Cool-1, and Myc-p50W43KCool-1. Cells were lysed and affinity-precipitated with immobilized GST-Cdc42 (lanes 5, 7, 9, and 11) or with constitutively active GST-Cdc42(Q61L) (lanes 6, 8, 10, and 12). Bound proteins were Western blotted and probed with anti-Myc. Lanes 1–4 represent 10% of the whole cell lysate used in the binding reaction. C, COS cells were transiently co-transfected with empty vector (lane 1) or plasmids encoding HA-Pak3 (lanes 2–6, 0.5 μg of DNA), Myc-p50 Cool-1 (lanes 1, 4, and 6, 0.5 μg of DNA, and lane 5, 1.5 μg of DNA), Myc-p85 Cool-1 (lanes 3, 4, and 5, 0.5 μg of DNA, and lane 6, 1.5 μg of DNA). Cells were lysed and affinity-precipitated (AP) with immobilized GST-Cdc42L61 (∼12 μg, lanes 7–12). Bound proteins were Western blotted, and the blot was probed with anti-HA and anti-Myc. Lanes 7–12 of the blot were reprobed with anti-Cool-1 to detect p50 Cool-1. Lanes 1–6 represent 10% of the whole cell lysate (10% WCL) used in the binding reaction. Numbersabove the lanes denote the ratio of p50 to p85 Myc-tagged Cool-1 cDNA that was transfected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We examined the effects of Cool-1 on binding of activated Cdc42 to Pak3 by expressing Myc-tagged Pak3 and/or p50Cool-1 in COS cells and assaying the binding of Pak3 to GST-Cdc42 by affinity precipitation and anti-Myc-immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B). Pak3 was precipitated by immobilized GST-Cdc42(Q61L) (GTPase-defective GTP-bound,lane 6) but not by GST-Cdc42 (GDP-bound, lane 5) and displayed a gel mobility shift due to Cdc42(Q61L)-stimulated autophosphorylation (compare lanes 1 and 6). (Pak3 autophosphorylation is sustained by the presence of Mg2+ during affinity precipitation.) Although p50Cool-1 expression did not affect Pak3 recovery in GST-Cdc42(Q61L) precipitates (compare lanes 1 and 6 with lanes 3 and 10), the precipitated Pak3 did not display the gel shift observed in the absence of p50Cool-1 or when co-expressed with p50Cool-1(W43K) (compare lanes 6, 10, and 12). Therefore, p50Cool-1 binding to Pak3 did not inhibit Cdc42 binding but did inhibit Cdc42-stimulated Pak3 autophosphorylation. Relative to Myc-Pak3, very little Myc-p50Cool-1 is detected in these precipitates (lane 10), which may be due to dissociation of p50Cool-1from Pak3 during the precipitation and washing procedures but may also reflect the relatively poor ability of anti-Myc to detect Myc-tagged p50Cool-1 co-precipitated with activated Cdc42 and Pak3 (see below).Unlike p50Cool-1, expression of p85Cool-1 did not inhibit Cdc42(Q61L)-stimulated Pak3 autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 8 and 9), which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3 A. As expected from the presence of identical SH3 domains, p50 and p85Cool-1 competed for binding to Pak3 in vitro(lanes 9–12). In these experiments, p50Cool-1co-precipitating with Pak3 was not detected with anti-Myc (upper panel, lanes 8 and 10–12) but was readily detectable with an anti-Cool-1 antibody (lower panel, lanes 8 and 10–12). The fact that an ∼3-fold excess of either p50Cool-1 or p85Cool-1 was able to significantly inhibit the binding of the other to Pak3 suggests that they have similar affinities for Pak3.Our results suggest that p50Cool-1, by competing with endogenous p85Cool-1 or other Cool proteins for binding to Pak3, might sequester Pak3 away from its site(s) of activation. On the other hand p85Cool-1, which has a permissive effect on the stimulation of Pak activation by Dbl or other Rho family exchange factors, could play an important role in recruiting Pak to its sites of activation, possibly via its C-terminal region, which is not present in p50Cool-1. In support of this model, our preliminary data indicate that p50Cool-1 has a diffuse cytoplasmic localization, 4A. Ridley, S. Bagrodia, and R. Cerione, unpublished observations. whereas p85Cool-1 is concentrated at focal adhesions (25Oh W.K. Yoo J.C. Jo D. Song Y.H. Kim M.G. Park D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, HeLa cell p85Cool-1 (β-PIX) has recently been shown to localize to focal complexes and appears to mediate Pak1 recruitment to these sites by activated Cdc42 (26Manser E. Loo T.-H. Koh C.-G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Molec. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). However, this would not account for the ability of p50Cool-1 to inhibit Cdc42-stimulated Pak3 activity in vitro. Because both p50Cool-1 and p85Cool-1 appear to bind to a common site on Pak3, the specific inhibition of Pak3 activity by p50Cool-1 may be due to the differences in the C-terminal regions of p50 and p85Cool-1.Protein kinases are often subject to multiple levels of regulation. The involvement of Paks in cellular signaling pathways leading to changes in gene expression or cytoskeletal architecture and their participation in both Ras-mediated transformation (8Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Rudel T. Bokoch G.M.

The ability of p50Cool-1 to suppress and p85Cool-1 to permit Pak activity indicates that signaling through Pak-dependent pathways may be regulated by cell type, cell cycle, or developmental-specific expression patterns. It will be important to establish the role of DH and PH domains in Cool function and how differential expression of Cool impacts upon Pak signaling to different effector pathways. The Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 mediate diverse biological events including changes in the cytoskeletal architecture (1Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Binding of these GTPases to a conserved p21-binding domain (PBD, also known as CRIB forCdc42/Rac1 interactivebinding) stimulates their serine/threonine kinase activities by a mechanism involving autophosphorylation (15Manser E.

The important roles that Paks play as effectors of Cdc42/Rac1 signaling have been established from genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and mammalian cells. The budding yeast homolog of mammalian Paks, Ste20, acts in concert with Cdc42 in the pheromone response to activate a MAP kinase cascade leading to transcription of genes required for cell cycle arrest. The same protein functions as an effector of Cdc42 to activate a different MAP kinase cascade leading to filamentous growth in response to nitrogen starvation (19Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The yeast model in which Pak/Ste20 links Cdc42 to transcriptional and cytoskeletal events is paralleled in mammalian cells; constitutively activated Pak mutants can activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAP kinase cascade leading to transcriptional control (12Bagrodia S.

The apparent multiplicity of Pak-mediated signaling pathways suggests that Pak activity must be tightly regulated. This has been made all the more clear from the observations that Pak1 function is required for cellular transformation by Ras (8Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and that Pak2 activation is involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Rudel T. Bokoch G.M.

Here we describe the identification of two isoforms of a novel Pak-binding protein, probably resulting from alternative splicing of the same message, one of which is able to suppress Pak activation by upstream regulators.

Here we report additional members of the Vesl/Homer family of proteins, Vesl-1L and Vesl-2. Vesl-1L (366 amino acids), a splicing variant of Vesl-1S, shares N-terminal 175 amino acids with Vesl-1S and contains additional amino acids at the C terminus. Vesl-2 (354 amino acids) was highly related to Vesl-1L in that both contain EVH1- and PDZ-like domains at the N terminus (86% conservation) and an MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer)-like domain and a leucine zipper at the C terminus. In contrast to vesl-1S, we observed no changes in the levels of vesl-1L and vesl-2 mRNAs during dentate gyrus LTP. All these proteins interacted with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) as well as several hippocampal proteins in vitro. Vesl-1L and Vesl-2, but not Vesl-1S, interacted with each other through the C-terminal portion that was absent in Vesl-1S. Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 may mediate clustering of mGluRs at synaptic junctions. We propose that Vesl-1S may be involved in the structural changes that occur at metabotropic glutamatergic synapses during the maintenance phase of LTP by modulating the redistribution of synaptic components.

This indicates that a particular set of genes, up-regulated following LTP induction, play an important role in the maintenance of late LTP. vesl (VASP/Ena-related gene up-regulated during seizure andLTP)/homer was isolated as a synaptic plasticity-regulated gene from rat hippocampus (8Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Hirai K. Inokuchi K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we denote the vesl cDNA that codes for a protein of 186 amino acids as vesl-1S. The expression of thevesl-1S transcript is induced in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus of both freely moving un- anesthetized and urethane-anesthetized rats following a delivery of high frequency stimuli (HFS) to the perforant pathway, which elicits a persistent LTP lasting either several weeks or ∼20 h, respectively. The induction isN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent. The Vesl-1S protein has significant homology to the EVH1 domain of VASP/Ena family of proteins, which is implicated in the control of actin filament dynamics (10Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The EVH1 domain of Mena, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Ena, is thought to mediate targeting of Mena to focal contacts by interacting with zyxin, and probably with vinculin, which is localized to the focal contacts. The Vesl-1S protein also contains a PDZ-like domain within the EVH1 homologous region. The PDZ domain constitutes an interface for certain kinds of protein-protein interactions, specifically interactions with integral membrane proteins such as receptors (for reviews, see Refs.11Gomperts S.N.

For example, PDZ domains of PSD95/SAP90 bind the R2 subunit of the NMDA receptor and a subunit of the Shaker K+ channel (14Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 15Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). One of the well known functions of PDZ proteins is their ability to cluster associated integral membrane proteins at synapses (14Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 16Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The PDZ-like domain of Vesl-1S/Homer interacts with mGluR1 and mGluR5 (9Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Vesl-1S/Homer is the first PDZ-domain protein that is found to be up-regulated by extracellular stimulation such as LTP. Thus, Vesl-1S/Homer may function as a modulator for mGluR signaling. Here we report additional members of the Vesl-1S/Homer family of mGluR-binding proteins. Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out as described (17Inokuchi K. Kato A. Hirai K. Hishinuma F. Inoue M. Ozawa F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plaque hybridization was performed with a λZAPII cDNA library constructed from rat hippocampal mRNA (Stratagene) (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.117Google Scholar). The DNA probes for plaque hybridization were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random-prime labeling kit (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence was determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain-termination method using automatic DNA sequencers, ALFII (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and PRISMTM 377 (Applied Biosystems). DNA fragments covering the entire coding region of vesl-1S, vesl-1L, and vesl-2 were amplified with PCR and introduced into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX 5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) for production of GST fusions and MBP fusions, respectively. Similarly, DNA fragments corresponding to the C-terminal portions of Vesl-1L (amino acids 177–366), Vesl-2 (121–354), and Vesl-2Δ11 (121–343) were inserted into pGEX 5X-1 and pMAL-c2. A bacterially expressed GST-Vesl-1S fusion protein was affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Vesl-1S was separated from GST by cleaving with 1/10 (w/w) of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) for 16 h at 16 °C, followed by separation through Mono Q column chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m) in 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0). Approximately 1 mg of purified Vesl-1S protein was used to immunize a rabbit. To isolate a Vesl-1S-specific antibody, the crude antiserum was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with Vesl-1S-affinity resin, which was prepared by covalently linking GST-Vesl-1S to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5), followed by immediate neutralization with 0.10 volume of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The elute was dialyzed against PBS buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4)) and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) was added. Male Wistar rats (6 weeks) were injected intraperitoneally with kainate (15 mg/kg body weight) to produce seizure. Animals were sacrificed at the time indicated, and the hippocampus was dissected and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 320 mm sucrose at 4 °C. The homogenates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane filter (PROTRAN, Schleicher & Schuell). Vesl proteins were detected with rabbit antibody raised against recombinant Vesl-1S protein and with a Western blot chemiluminescence reagent kit (NEN Life Science Products). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial cells, expressing MBP fusion proteins, were sonicated in PBS buffer in the presence of a protease inhibitor (1 mmPefabloc SC, Boehringer Mannheim), and the resultant homogenates were used without purification. Adult hippocampus was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 3 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 320 mm sucrose and 1 mm Pefabloc SC. Hippocampal homogenates or E. coli lysates expressing MBP fusion proteins were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred at 4 °C onto a nitrocellulose filter in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine. All the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The filters were blocked overnight in buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 5% skim milk) and then incubated with one of the GST fusion proteins (1 μg/ml) in buffer A for 8 h. After being washed three times with buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm KCl), the filters were incubated overnight with 5.5 μg/ml of rabbit anti-GST antibody (Sigma) in buffer A. They were then washed three times with buffer B, incubated for 8 h with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit-IgG (diluted by 1:10,000, provided by N. Shinohara) in buffer A, and then washed three times with buffer B. Blots were visualized with a Western blot chemiluminescence reagent kit. Hippocampal tissue from an adult female rat (body weight, 300–350 g) was homogenized in 500 μl of PBS buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), pepstatin A (1 μm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and aprotinin (1 μg/ml). After the addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration of 1%), the hippocampal lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g to remove cell debris. GST fusion proteins of the full length of Vesl-1S, Vesl-1L, and Vesl-2 were expressed in E. coli cells, and a bacterial lysate was prepared by sonicatingE. coli cells. After a brief centrifugation to remove cell debris, bacterial lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resin was washed with PBS. Resin that bound GST fusion protein (215 μg of GST-Vesl-1S, 73 μg of GST-Vesl-1L, or 230 μg of GST) was added to the hippocampal lysate (150 μl). After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the resin was washed three times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. The bound proteins were eluted from the resin by boiling in 50 μl of SDS-loading buffer. The elutes (15 μl) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted either with rabbit anti-mGluR1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1/100 dilution or with a rabbit anti-mGluR5 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody at 1/1000 dilution. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody at 1/10,000 dilution. Immunosignal was visualized with Vistra ECF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a FluorImager (Molecular Dynamics). FLAG (DYKDDDDK)- or Myc (EQKLISEEDL)-tagged Vesl constructs were generated by PCR using specific primers and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which contains cytomegalovirus promoter. FLAG- and Myc-epitope tags were inserted between the initiation codon and codon for the second amino acid to construct FLAG-Vesl-1L and Myc-Vesl-2, respectively. To generate Vesl-1S-FLAG and Vesl-2-Myc, FLAG and Myc tags were added at the C-terminal end, respectively. In Vivo Interaction of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2—Transfections to COS-7 cells were performed with 50 μg of each plasmid using the electroporation method (Gene PulserTM, Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instruction. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmPefabloc SC) at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris. One μg of monoclonal antibody (anti-FLAG M2 antibody, Eastman Kodak Co.; anti-Myc antibody (IgG2b), kindly supplied by Dr. Masami Takahashi; or control IgG, IgG1 from mouse MOPC 21, Organon Teknika Co.) was added to each cell lysate (400 μg of proteins), and the lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed by adding 30 μl of 30% protein G-agarose (Pierce), followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C and a brief centrifugation. The precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot was performed as described above except anti-FLAG or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was used. All the LTP experiments were performed on freely moving unanesthetized animals. Adult male Wistar rats (16–20 weeks old, >400 g) were implanted with electrodes made of tungsten wire under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) as described previously (8Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Hirai K. Inokuchi K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Coordinates were as follows: bipolar stimulating electrode, 8.0 mm posterior, 4.5 mm lateral, and 5.0 mm inferior to bregma; recording electrode, 4.0 mm posterior, 2.5 mm lateral, and 3.8 mm inferior to bregma ipsilaterally. After the surgery, each animal was allowed to recover in an individual home cage for at least 3 weeks. All the stimuli were constant current, biphasic rectangular pulses (200-μs width). During recording and tetanic stimulation, the animals were connected to a slipring connector so that the animals were able to move freely. One day before the LTP experiment, an input-output curve was determined by delivering biphasic pulses starting from an intensity of 100 μA with steps of 100 μA. For each intensity, 5 pulses at a frequency of 0.1 Hz were applied, and the evoked response was then averaged. Following a 5-min interval, the stimulation intensity was increased by 100 μA. A stimulation intensity was selected that evoked a population spike with 60% of its maximal amplitude. This intensity was used for test and tetanic stimuli. LTP was induced by HFS following a 20-min base-line recording. HFS (total of 2400 pulses) consisted of 4 bursts delivered at a 15-min interburst interval. Each burst consisted of 20 trains delivered at 5-s intertrain intervals (each train, 400 Hz, 30 pulses). The evoked field potentials were amplified, digitized at 50 kH, and stored sequentially on computer discs (NEC PC9801 DX) for off-line analysis. Both slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike amplitude were monitored as an index of LTP. In Situ Hybridization—Animals were deeply anesthetized either with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for LTP animals or with diethyl ether for pups. Brains of anesthetized LTP animals were prefixed by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Anesthetized pups were by decapitation, and brains were dissected. Dissected brains from LTP animals and pups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 h at 4 °C and then embedded in O.C.T. compound (Miles). In situ hybridization was carried out essentially as described (17Inokuchi K. Kato A. Hirai K. Hishinuma F. Inoue M. Ozawa F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes, which were designed to hybridize specifically to vesl-1S, vesl-1L, or vesl-2. Western blot analysis with anti-Vesl-1S antiserum showed that hippocampal lysate contained a protein of expected size (28 kDa) of Vesl-1S (Fig. 1). The intensity of the band increased following kainate treatment, indicating that the band indeed corresponds to Vesl-1S protein. The Western blot showed an additional signal of 45 kDa, the level of which, in the hippocampus, was not increased by kainate treatment. This strongly suggests the presence of either the splicing variant or homologous protein of Vesl-1S in the hippocampus. We examined these possibilities by screening a hippocampal cDNA library. The hippocampal cDNA library was screened with probe A that encompasses the entire coding region of vesl-1S (Fig. 2 A). Forty cDNA clones that hybridized with probe A were obtained by screening approximately 106 plaques. A DNA sequence analysis of 9 of these revealed that 2 coded for the Vesl-1S protein, whereas the remaining 7 corresponded to an alternatively spliced cDNA. This cDNA, termed vesl-1L, encoded a protein of 42 kDa (366 amino acids) that shares the N-terminal 175 amino acids with the Vesl-1S protein and contains an additional 191 residues at the C terminus (Fig. 2 B). As an alternative method of isolating the vesl-1S homolog, we employed the RT-PCR method. From a DNA data base search, we observed that several expressed sequence tags (ESTs) isolated from mouse and human encoded a protein homologous to, but distinct from, Vesl-1S. This was also observed by Brakeman et al. (9Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). According to the nucleotide sequence of the mouse EST, a pair of PCR primers was designed to amplify a rat counterpart of the mouse EST (5′-AGGAACAGCTATCGGATCATCAGTGT-3′ and 5′-CAGCTCCATCTCCCACTTCTTCAC-3′). An RT-PCR fragment amplified from the total RNA, prepared from the adult rat hippocampus with this primer pair, was used as a probe to screen a rat cDNA library. By these means, a novel cDNA, vesl-2, was isolated, which coded for an additional member of the Vesl family (354 amino acids) (Fig. 2 B). We also found an alternative spliced form of Vesl-2 (Vesl-2Δ11) in which 11 amino acid residues (129–139) were deleted. In agreement with the apparent molecular mass from the Western blot analysis (45 kDa), vesl-1L and vesl-2 cDNAs encode protein products with an expected molecular mass of 42 kDa. In fact, the heterologously expressed vesl-1L and Vesl-2 proteins in cDNA-transfected COS-7 cells migrated at the same size as the band in the brain (45 kDa) (see Fig. 6). Whereas the N-terminal half of Vesl-1L (amino acids 1–175) shares exactly the same amino acid sequence with Vesl-1S, the C-terminal half contains an additional polypeptide, indicating that Vesl-1L is a splicing variant of Vesl-1S. Vesl-2 has a similar structure in that it has a highly Vesl-1S-homologous region at the N terminus (86% identical in 120 amino acid residues) and an extra polypeptide at the C terminus. The EVH1-homologous region is conserved both in Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 proteins. Importantly, Vesl-1S, Vesl-1L, and Vesl-2 all contain the RXXXXXGLGF motif that is conserved in all the PDZ proteins reported and that, in the case of PSD95/SAP90, constitutes a binding pocket for the NMDA receptor (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). The homology in the amino acid sequences between Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 decreases at the C-terminal half but is still significant (34% identical in 246 amino acids). Specifically, the C-terminal end containing the leucine zipper was highly conserved, suggesting that Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 form a dimeric structure. Both proteins have putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A and protein kinase C. A unique characteristic of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 as a PDZ protein is that they lack both the Src homology 3 region and a domain homologous to the low molecular weight guanylate kinases. A search in the GenBankTM DNA data base revealed an existence of a homologous protein fromDrosophila (Fig. 2 B). The structure of Vesl family has been highly conserved throughout evolution. The search further showed that both Vesl-1L (amino acid residues 195–245) and Vesl-2 (183–233) have a homologous region to the MCC protein, a putative colorectal tumor suppressor (20Kinzler K.W. Nilbert M.C. Vogelstein B. Bryan T.M. Levy D.B. Smith K.J. Preisinger A.C. Hamilton S.R. Hedge P. Markham A. Carlson M. Joslyn G. Groden J. White R. Miki Y. Miyoshi Y. Nishimoto I. Nakamura Y. Science. 1991; 251: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). The corresponding region of MCC has similarity with the G protein-activating region of the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and is implicated in the G protein-mediated response (20Kinzler K.W. Nilbert M.C. Vogelstein B. Bryan T.M. Levy D.B. Smith K.J. Preisinger A.C. Hamilton S.R. Hedge P. Markham A. Carlson M. Joslyn G. Groden J. White R. Miki Y. Miyoshi Y. Nishimoto I. Nakamura Y. Science. 1991; 251: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Vesl-1S/Homer interacts with mGluR1 and mGluR5 in vitro (9Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). We reasoned that both the Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 proteins also interact with mGluRs, because both proteins have a PDZ-like motif and contain the Vesl-1S-conserved region that binds to the receptors. A solution binding assay demonstrated that all these proteins interacted with mGluR1 and mGluR5 (Fig. 3). GST-Vesl-1S, GST-Vesl-1L, and GST-Vesl-2 fusion proteins expressed in bacteria bound both mGluR1 and mGluR5 in hippocampal extract. We employed Far-Western blot analysis to elucidate the functional role of the C-terminal region of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2. Proteins from the adult hippocampus were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a membrane filter, and overlaid with GST fusion proteins. Binding of the fusion proteins was detected with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 4). GST-Vesl-1L and GST-Vesl-2, but not GST-Vesl-1S, fusion proteins bound to the 45-kDa protein(s) in the brain extract, suggesting that the C-terminal portion of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 mediates the interaction with the 45-kDa protein(s). In fact, the C-terminal portion of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 fused to GST (GST-Vesl-1L(C) and GST-Vesl-2(C), respectively) bound to the 45-kDa protein(s). Because the migration of the 45-kDa protein(s) on SDS-PAGE was the same as that of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 proteins (not shown), we examined whether the 45-kDa protein(s) were actually Vesl-1L or Vesl-2. The bacterially expressed Vesl family, fused to MBP, was subjected to the Far-Western blot analyses with purified GST fusions (Fig. 5). Signals were visualized with anti-GST antibody. GST fusions of Vesl-1L, Vesl-2, and Vesl-2Δ11 bound to the MBP fusions of Vesl-1L, Vesl-2, and Vesl-2Δ11 but not to the MBP-Vesl-1S fusion. Vesl-1L prefers to bind heterophilically compared with Vesl-2, which bound both homo- and heterophilically. GST and GST-Vesl-1S failed to bind any of the MBP fusions. The C-terminal portion of either Vesl-1L or Vesl-2 was sufficient for these interactions. Thus, Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 interact with each other in a homophilic and heterophilic manner in vitro. To ascertain whether a complex of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 exists physiologically, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment was carried out (Fig. 6). When COS-7 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged Vesl-1L (FLAG-Vesl-1L) and Myc-tagged Vesl-2 (Vesl-2-Myc or Myc-Vesl-2), FLAG-Vesl-1L coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 6 A), indicating an interaction between Vesl-1L and Vesl-2in vivo. To determine whether the enrichment of FLAG-Vesl-1L observed in anti-Myc immunoprecipitate was specific, we asked if a control protein, FLAG-tagged Vesl-1S, was similarly enriched in these fractions. We observed that this protein was absent in the precipitate (Fig. 6 A). Thus, the coprecipitation of FLAG-Vesl-1L with Myc-tagged Vesl-2 was specific. Similar results were obtained when lysates of COS-7 cells cotransfected with expression plasmids were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6 B), where Myc-tagged Vesl-2 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-Vesl-1L. When control IgG was used for immunoprecipitation, neither FLAG-Vesl-1L nor Myc-tagged Vesl-2 coimmunoprecipitated. All the immunoprecipitation target proteins were efficiently expressed in COS-7 cells after the transfection (data not shown). Taken together, these results support the notion that Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 exist as a complex in vivo. In addition to Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 per se, GST fusions of Vesl-1S, Vesl-1L, and Vesl-2 bound to several other proteins (Fig. 4). These interactions were mediated by the N-terminal region of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2, because both GST-Vesl-1L(C) and GST-Vesl-2(C) failed to bind to these proteins. The proteins of 150 kDa might be mGluR1 and mGluR5. The binding profiles for all the GST fusion proteins did not change when we used the hippocampal lysate prepared from adult rats that had undergone kainate-induced seizure (3 h) (data not shown). We examined whether the expression of vesl-1L and vesl-2 mRNAs is regulated by persistent dentate gyrus LTP using the specific cRNA probes, probe I, probe II, and probe III (Fig. 2 A). A filter hybridization experiment revealed that each probe did not cross-hybridize with any other cDNAs (not shown). In unanesthetized, freely moving animals, repeated HFS (a total of 2400 pulses) given to the perforant pathway elicited a long-lasting (>2 weeks) LTP, recorded from the dentate gyrus. 2Y. Saitoh and K. Inokuchi, unpublished observation. Thevesl-1S mRNA was markedly induced in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to the stimulating electrode 30 min after the delivery of the last tetanic stimulation (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, we did not detect any changes in the mRNA levels of vesl-1L and vesl-2 following the HFS. Therefore, vesl-1SmRNA was up-regulated by persistent LTP, whereas vesl-1Land vesl-2 transcripts were constitutively expressed in the adult hippocampus. To compare the amounts of vesl-1S and vesl-1L transcripts during LTP, we next employed a cRNA probe X that consisted of a part of the vesl-1S-coding region and consequently hybridized to both of the mRNAs with equal efficiency (Fig. 2 A). Even though probe X could detect both forms, in situ hybridization with probe X showed a marked increase in the signal intensity in the dentate gyrus 30 min after the last tetanic stimulation (data not shown). Therefore, following LTP induction, the expression level of vesl-1S mRNA was significantly higher than that of constitutively expressedvesl-1L mRNA. We have previously observed that veslmRNA is expressed at a high level during hippocampal development between postnatal days 7 and 14 (P7-P14) (8Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Hirai K. Inokuchi K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The probe used forin situ hybridization in reference (8Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Hirai K. Inokuchi K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) contained the entire coding region of the vesl-1S (probe A, see Fig. 2 A) and thus hybridized with both vesl-1S and vesl-1L. We re-examined the developmental regulation of each mRNA expression using specific cRNA probes (Fig. 7 B). The level of vesl-1S mRNA was low throughout the development of the hippocampus, whereasvesl-1L mRNA was expressed at P8. The expression profile of vesl-2 mRNA was similar to that of vesl-1L, relatively high at P8 and low at P15 and P22. Taken together, the expression of vesl-1L and vesl-2mRNAs was regulated during hippocampal development but not during LTP of adult hippocampus. In marked contrast, vesl-1Sexpression was up-regulated following LTP induction, but not during development. The Vesl proteins constitute a novel family of PDZ proteins that bind to mGluR1 and mGluR5, G protein-coupled glutamate receptors that mediate phosphatidylinositol turnover. This family is unique in that it contains an inducible form, the Vesl-1S protein, that is up-regulated during seizure and LTP in the adult hippocampus. This is the first PDZ-domain protein whose expression is regulated by certain kinds of extracellular stimuli. Fig. 8 summarizes the structure of the Vesl family of proteins. Vesl-1S is a splicing variant of Vesl-1L, which lacks the C-terminal portion present in Vesl-1L. The N-terminal portions of Vesl-1S and Vesl-1L (175 amino acids) are derived from the same exon. Vesl-2 is closely related to Vesl-1L. Specifically, the N-terminal portion, which contains the RXXXXXGLGF motif of the PDZ domain and the EVH1-homologous region, is highly conserved between Vesl-1L and Vesl-2. As expected given their structural similarity, all these proteins were able to bind to mGluR1 and mGluR5, probably through the RXXXXXGLGF motif. In contrast, the C terminus was less conserved between Vesl-1L and Vesl-2. Both proteins have a leucine-zipper at the C-terminal end. In fact, they generated a multimeric structure both in a homophilic and heterophilic manner. This interaction was mediated by the C-terminal. mGluR5 normally forms a disulfide-linked dimer on the membrane that is mediated by cysteine residues located at the N terminus in the extracellular domain (21Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Other mGluRs, including mGluR1, also exist as dimers (21Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The multimeric structures of both Vesl-1L/Vesl-2 and mGluRs permit a formation of multivalent aggregation. We hypothesize that Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 mediate the formation of mGluR1 and mGluR5 clusters in the synaptic junction. In this model, Vesl-1L/Vesl-2 and mGluRs form multivalent cross-linking, and this in turn generates clustering of the receptors on the plasma membrane. Thus, homo- or heteromultimerization of Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 could contribute to the aggregation of their partner. In addition to mGluRs and Vesl-1L/Vesl-2, an overlay experiment revealed that the N-terminal portions of the Vesl proteins interacted with several other hippocampal proteins. The N-terminal region of the Vesl family, which contains EVH1-like and PDZ domains, appears to serve as an interface that mediates protein-protein interactions. The EVH1 domain of Mena interacts directly with zyxin, a component of the actin cytoskeleton (10Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). PDZ domain 3 of PSD95/SAP90 binds to the neural cell surface proteins, neuroligins (22Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). These interactions serve as a link between the NMDA receptor and the synaptic cell adhesion molecule. Therefore, it is quite likely that proteins binding to the N terminus of the Vesl family involve cell adhesion molecule(s) and cytoskeletal components. The Vesl family may provide a molecular framework for the assembly of synaptic proteins that are involved in mGluR signaling. It is unclear how the level of vesl-1S transcript is regulated following LTP induction. Although vesl-1S and vesl-1L share the same exon, which corresponds to the N-terminal end of the proteins, the expression of vesl-1LmRNA in the dentate gyrus was not modulated during LTP. One possibility is that the transcription of each mRNA is under the control of the same cis-acting regulatory element/transcriptional promoter, which, during LTP, promotes an elevated transcription of thevesl-1 gene, whereas the regulation of alternative splicing results in the production of different mRNAs. According to this possibility, before the LTP, mRNA precursor of thevesl-1 gene will be spliced out to generate mainlyvesl-1L mRNA. On the other hand, the induced mRNA precursor will be alternatively spliced to preferentially generatevesl-1S mRNA during long lasting LTP. Another possible way that these mRNAs are produced is that two distinct promoters, one inducible and the other constitutive, may be responsible for the transcription of vesl-1S and vesl-1L, respectively. In this case, the first exons for each mRNA would be different and this might cause a selection of distinct 3′-exons during splicing. These possibilities remain to be examined. In the developing hippocampus, the expression of vesl-1L and vesl-2 mRNA was high at P8, then decreased along with the progression of hippocampal development. In contrast, the level of vesl-1S transcript was constitutively low and not regulated during hippocampal development. Therefore, during ontogenesis of the nervous system, Vesl-1L and Vesl-2, but not Vesl-1S, may play a role in the formation of metabotropic glutamatergic synapses. A characteristic feature of Vesl-1S is its inducibility during hippocampal LTP of the adult brain. How does the inducible Vesl-1S protein function during long lasting neuronal plasticity? As reported previously, Vesl-1S contains a PEST sequence that has been thought to mediate rapid protein degradation (8Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Hirai K. Inokuchi K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although the level of thevesl-1S transcript was significantly higher than thevesl-1L and vesl-2 mRNA levels during LTP and seizure, the protein levels in the hippocampus did not reflect the mRNA levels, i.e. the level of Vesl-1S protein was far less than Vesl-1L and/or Vesl-2 following kainate-induced seizure. This may be due to either the instability of the Vesl-1S protein or an inefficient translation initiation of thevesl-1S transcript. We have examined the later possibility by introducing the Kozak consensus sequence around the initiation codon of vesl-1S and vesl-1LcDNAs. 3A. Kato, Y. Fukazawa, F. Ozawa, and K. Inokuchi, unpublished observation. When transfected into Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells the Kozak-vesl-1Splasmid produced a low level of Vesl-1S protein in these cells, whereas the Kozak-vesl-1L plasmid generated a large amount of Vesl-1L protein. This strongly suggests a rapid turnover of the Vesl-1S protein, because efficiency of the translation initiation would be the same for these constructs. Two characteristics of the Vesl-1S protein, inducibility during LTP and rapid degradation, and the presence of the homologous proteins Vesl-1L and Vesl-2, expressed constitutively, suggest a functional role for Vesl-1S as a dominant-negative regulator of protein-protein interactions in the macromolecular complex, mediated by Vesl-1L and Vesl-2 at the synaptic junctions. Disruption of the interactions caused by increased levels of Vesl-1S could lead to a redistribution of synaptic components, specifically mGluR1 and mGluR5. Redistribution, in turn, could contribute to synapse restructuring associated with the maintenance phase of hippocampal LTP (23Geinisman Y. Detoledo M.L. Morrell F. Persina I.S. Beatty M.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 368: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This structural alteration may occur at both postsynaptic and presynaptic sites, because an electron microscopic study of the hippocampus demonstrated the presence of mGluR5 immunoreactivity in dendritic spines and shafts, as well as in presynaptic axon terminals (24Romano C. Sesma M.A. McDonald C.T. O'Malley K. Van den Pol A. Olney J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 455-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Further isolation and characterization of proteins that interact with the Vesl/Homer family of proteins will provide more insight into the functional role of this family in synaptic plasticity.

Masami Takahashi, Hiroshi Ohnishi, and Maki Inoue for their advice on the production of the antibody, Far-Western analysis, and the LTP experiment with unanesthetized animals, respectively.

Unlike other human chemokines, the chemokine domain of fractalkine has three amino acids between two conserved cysteines, referred to as the CX 3C motif. Both plasma membrane-associated and shed forms of fractalkine have been identified. Here, we show that the recombinant 76-amino acid chemokine domain of fractalkine is a potent and highly specific chemotactic agonist at a human orphan receptor previously named V28 or alternatively CMKBRL1 (chemokine β receptor-like 1), which was shown previously to be expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and several solid organs, including brain. CMKBRL1/V28 also functioned with CD4 as a coreceptor for the envelope protein from a primary isolate of HIV-1 in a cell-cell fusion assay, and fusion was potently and specifically inhibited by fractalkine.

Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar) and its apparent mouse counterpart, named neurotactin (5Pan Y.

Nature. 1997; 387: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The C subgroup also only contains one known member in mouse and human, whereas both CC and CXC subgroups each have many members. Unlike other chemokines, fractalkine and neurotactin are both multimodular proteins consisting of four distinct domains: a chemokine domain N-terminal to an extended mucin-like stalk; a transmembrane domain, which tethers the molecule to the plasma membrane; and a cytoplasmic domain. After transfection of HEK 293 cells, human fractalkine can be detected on the cell surface, and the cells adhere to human monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils. In addition, a truncated 95-kDa “shed” form, which can be found in the supernatant, induces chemotaxis of monocytes and T cells (4Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the recombinant chemokine domain of mouse neurotactin (amino acids 22–105) induces in vitrochemotaxis of human neutrophils and T cells and in vivoaccumulation of mouse neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells (5Pan Y. Lloyd C. Zhou H. Dolich S. Deeds J. Gonzalo J.A. Vath J. Gosselin M. Ma J. Dussault B. Woolf E. Alperin G. Culpepper J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Gearing D.

Nature. 1997; 387: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the putative receptor that mediates its action might be most closely related to known CC chemokine receptors (CCR1; 6–12), which are all members of the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. In this regard, CMKBRL1 (chemokine β receptor-like 1) (13Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a previously identified “orphan” receptor also known as V28 (14Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gray P.W. Gene. 1995; 163: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), stood out as a particularly good candidate because it has ∼40% amino acid sequence identity to most CCRs; its gene is located on chromosome 3p21–3pter near a cluster of CCR genes (13Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gray P.W.

Med. 1997; 185: 2015-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and its RNA, as well as RNA for fractalkine, are both present constitutively at high levels in human brain. CMKBRL1/V28 appears to be the human orthologue of RBS11, a rat orphan receptor expressed in leukocytes and brain (17Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 169: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since identification of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as the first HIV-1 coreceptor, several other chemokine receptors and chemokine receptor-like proteins have been shown to have similar activity for HIV-1 and in some cases for HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (18Doms R.W. Peiper S.C. Virology. 1997; 235: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Because of its sequence relationship to chemokine receptors, CMKBRL1/V28 has previously been tested and shown to be a coreceptor for certain isolates of HIV-2 (19Reeves J.D. McKnight A. Potempa S. Simmons G. Gray P.W. Power C.A. Wells T. Weiss R.A. Talbot S.J. Virology. 1997; 231: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here we identify functional interactions of CMKBRL1/V28 with HIV-1 and demonstrate that it is a receptor highly specific for fractalkine. A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–27 of the CMKBRL1/V28 sequence was produced by FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)chemistry, conjugated to KLH, and injected into rabbits. Preimmune sera and sera harvested after serial boosts were tested for reactivity with various cell lines by flow cytometry using a previously published method (20Alkhatib G. Locati M. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A. Virology. 1997; 234: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with two modifications. A donkey anti-rabbit phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) was used as the second antibody, and seven-amino actinomycin D (Sigma) was used to gate dead cells. Sera harvested after the third immunization was used for all experiments at a dilution of 1:50. The cloning of a 1.6-kilobase pair cDNA named clone 74.2 coding for CMKBRL1, construction of recombinant pBluescript and pREP9 plasmids containing this cDNA, and creation of HEK 293 cell lines stably transfected with pREP9-CMKBRL1 have been described previously (13Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, the cDNA was excised from Bluescript usingBamHI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites in the polylinker and subcloned between the corresponding sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and additional HEK 293 cell lines were derived using previously described methods (13Combadiere C.

HEK 293 cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum containing streptomycin 100 μg/ml and penicillin 100 units/ml, supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. Changes in [Ca2+]i were measured using ratio fluorescence of FURA-2-loaded cells in suspension exactly as described previously (21Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

The following recombinant human chemokines were tested: SDF-1, HCC-1, lymphotactin, and I-309 (R&D, Minneapolis, MN); neutrophil-activating peptide 2, Bachem (Philadelphia, PA); macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, eotaxin, interleukin-8, growth-related oncogene α (GROα), GROβ, GROγ, and ENA-78 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). ckβ4 (also known as MIP-3α, exodus, and liver activation-related chemokine) was kindly provided by G. Garrotta (Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD). The 76-amino acid chemokine domain of fractalkine (amino acids 25–100) produced in Escherichia coli was purchased from R&D (product name = recombinant human fractalkine). In this paper, we will refer to this material as “fractalkine.” Binding experiments were carried out using 125I-fractalkine obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (specific activity = 2200 Ci/mmol). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, 106 cells were incubated in triplicate with 125I-labeled fractalkine in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled recombinant human chemokines in binding medium (Hanks' buffered saline solution with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.01% azide, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, unbound chemokines were separated from cells by washing with 1 ml of Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% azide. Gamma emissions were then counted in the cell pellet. S.E. was less than 5% of the mean value for each set of replicates. HEK 293 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, then loaded in a total volume of 25 μl into the upper compartment of a microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). A final volume of 32 μl of buffer ± fractalkine was placed in the lower compartment. The two compartments were separated by a polyvinylpyrollidone-free polycarbonate filter with 10-μm pores coated for 1 h with mouse collagen type IV (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 20 μg/ml. The chemotaxis chamber was incubated at 37 °C, 100% humidity, and 5% CO2 for 5 h. The filter was then removed, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with Diff-Quick. The number of cells in 5 high power fields was counted for each data point. All conditions were tested in triplicate. The CMKBRL1 cDNA was subcloned into the StuI site of the vector pSC59, which contains a synthetic vaccinia early/late promoter (23Chakrabarti S. Sisler J.R. Moss B.

Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, effector cells were prepared by coinfecting HeLa cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (vP11T7gene1) and the indicated HIV-1 Envs. In some experiments, HIV-1 Env was expressed by transfecting cells with pSC59-based plasmids instead of infecting with recombinant vaccinia virus. The target cells were prepared by transfecting NIH 3T3 cells with pSC59-based plasmids expressing the indicated chemokine receptors and coinfecting with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding CD4 (vCB-3) and a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene linked to the T7 promotor (vCB21R-LacZ). After transfection and infection, cells were maintained at 31 °C overnight. The following day, 1 × 105effector cells were mixed with an equal number of target cells and incubated together for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and assayed for fusion by measuring β-galactosidase activity. For all experiments, the low background signal obtained using target cells that lacked coreceptor was subtracted for presentation of the results with each Env. We previously reported that HEK 293 cell lines stably transfected with a pREP9 plasmid encoding CMKBRL1 expressed CMKBRL1 RNA in large amounts but did not exhibit calcium flux responses to any agonists tested at the time, including the CC chemokines MIP-1α, RANTES, MIP-1β, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3 and I-309; the CXC chemokines interleukin-8, IP-10, neutrophil-activating peptide-2, GROα, GROβ, platelet factor 4, and Mig; and the nonchemokine leukocyte chemoattractants formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, C3a and C5a (13Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because of the functional specificity that we now describe, we have renamed CMKBRL1/V28 as CX 3CR1 (CX 3C chemokine receptor 1), which is consistent with nomenclature guidelines established at the 2nd Gordon Conference on Chemotactic Cytokines (Plymouth, NH, 1996). We created an additional set of HEK 293 cell transfectants using a pcDNA3 expression plasmid and screened them plus the first generation of transfectants for cell surface expression of CX 3CR1 based on reactivity with a polyclonal anti-CX 3CR1 rabbit antiserum. We selected two cell lines transfected with the pcDNA3 construct named 3.2 and 3.3 for further study because they exhibited the highest level of specific staining, which was consistently ∼10-fold greater than either untransfected HEK 293 cells or HEK 293 cells expressing CCR5 and CX 3CR1-transfected cells stained with preimmune serum (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Neither CX 3CR1-expressing cell line exhibited a calcium flux response when stimulated with 100 nm interleukin-8, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, eotaxin, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, SDF-1, I-309, MIP-3α, or lymphotactin, whereas both cell lines consistently responded to 100 nm fractalkine (Fig. 1 B and data not shown for the ineffective chemokines; n > 7 and = 3 for fractalkine for the 3.2 and 3.3 cell lines, respectively). Consistent with this, we did not detect endogenous RNA by Northern blot analysis for CXCR1, CXCR2, CCR1–5, or CCR8 in these cells. As previously reported, HEK 293 cells stably transfected with CCR1, CCR5, or CCR6 responded to MIP-1α, MIP-1α, and liver activation-related chemokine, respectively (8Baba M. Imai T. Nishimura M.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but we observed no responses by any of these cell lines or by untransfected HEK 293 cells to fractalkine (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Thus, we infer from this gain-of-function result that fractalkine is a specific agonist acting at CX 3CR1 in this system. For both the 3.2 and 3.3 cell lines, the relationship between fractalkine and calcium flux response was concentration-dependent. We carried out a detailed study for the 3.2 cell line (Fig. 1 C) and found that the threshold, half-maximal, and saturating concentrations were 0.5, 2, and 10 nm, respectively. This is consistent with the potency range that we and others have reported for other chemokines acting at other chemokine receptors for this response. However, the potency of natural forms of soluble fractalkine and membrane-anchored fractalkine could differ, either in this system or at endogenous CX 3CR1. When the cells were pretreated with ineffective chemokines at 100 nm, there was no effect on the magnitude or kinetics of the fractalkine-induced calcium flux response, suggesting that other chemokines are not antagonists at CX 3CR1 (Fig. 1 B, top tracings). In contrast, when cells were sequentially stimulated with the same concentration of fractalkine, no response to the second application was observed (Fig. 1 B, top right tracing), suggesting homologous desensitization of the receptor. To directly examine the interaction of fractalkine with CX 3CR1, radioligand binding was performed (Fig. 2).125I-Fractalkine specifically bound to CX 3CR1- but not to CCR5-transfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2 A). In pilot experiments we observed that the ratio of specific to nonspecific binding was significantly higher in assays carried out at 23 versus 4 °C (data not shown), and all subsequent experiments were done at the higher temperature and in the presence of azide to prevent receptor internalization. The addition of excess unlabeled chemokines revealed that fractalkine competed highly effectively for the labeled site on CX 3CR1, but RANTES, MCP-3, eotaxin, and MIP-1α did not compete at all (Fig. 2 B). These results are consistent with the specificity observed in the calcium flux assay. Consistent with this, we were unable to observe specific binding of125I-labeled MIP-1α or MCP-3 to CX 3CR1-expressing HEK 293 cells using conditions where high affinity binding was observed with CCR1- and CCR2B-expressing HEK 293 cells, respectively (data not shown). Unlabeled fractalkine competed in a concentration-dependent manner for the 125I-fractalkine-labeled site on the 3.2 cell line with an IC50 = 1.6 ± 0.2 nm(n = 3) (Fig. 2 C). Maximal binding varied by less than 5% in these three experiments. In one comparative experiment, the IC50 values observed for the 3.2 and 3.3 cell lines varied by less than 10% (data not shown). In direct binding studies, fractalkine bound to the 3.2 cell line in a saturable manner (Fig. 2 D). Scatchard analysis of the data were consistent with a single binding site, with a K d = 0.74 ± 0.36 nm and 62,000 ± 7800 sites/cell (n = 3) (Fig. 2 D). To test the biological function of CX 3CR1, we carried out chemotaxis assays using the 3.2 cell line stably transfected with CX 3CR1 cDNA. Fractalkine was able to significantly induce concentration-dependent transmigration of CX 3CR1-expressing cells across a filter in a modified Boyden chamber assay of chemotaxis, but RANTES had no activity (Fig. 3). The dose-response curve was bell-shaped, which is typical for chemotaxis, and the optimal concentration and EC50 were 100 and 20 nm, respectively. Thus, by gain-of-function criteria we infer that fractalkine is a chemotactic agonist at CX 3CR1 in this system. To determine whether CX 3CR1 functions as a coreceptor for HIV-1, we used a vaccinia-based β-galactosidase reporter assay for Env-dependent cell-cell fusion, which models the viral envelope-target cell fusion step in HIV-1 infection (26.). This assay was used to identify CXCR4 as the first HIV-1 coreceptor (24Feng Y Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar), and subsequently several other chemokine receptors and chemokine receptor-like proteins have been shown to have similar activity using the same or related assays (see Ref. 18Doms R.W. Peiper S.C. Virology. 1997; 235: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar for review and primary references). HIV-1 strains vary in the coreceptors they can use for cell entry, and this determines strain cytotropism. Among other classification schemes, classification of HIV-1 strains according to their ability to infect primary macrophages and use CCR5 (M-tropic or R5 strains) versus transformed T cell lines and CXCR4 (TCL-tropic or X4 strains) has been particularly useful. Some primary isolates can infect both cell types and use both coreceptors and are classified as dual-tropic strains. CX 3CR1 was able to reconstitute fusion activity in target NIH 3T3 cells expressing CD4 when mixed with effector cells expressing Env from the dual-tropic primary isolate 89.6, inducing approximately half the level of fusion found for the same Env tested with CXCR4- or CCR5-expressing target cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, no significant level of fusion was detected with Envs from three R5-tropic isolates or with Env from a X4-tropic isolate. Thus, by gain-of-function criteria, we infer that CX 3CR1 has HIV-1 Env fusion coreceptor activity. CX 3CR1 was analyzed for its sensitivity to inhibition of Env-mediated fusion by various chemokines. Fractalkine, but not any other chemokines tested, was able to inhibit fusion mediated by 89.6 Env-expressing effector cells with CD4- and CX 3CR1-expressing target cells (Fig. 5 A). Fractalkine inhibited the β-galactosidase signal to background levels. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of fractalkine on fusion was specific for CX 3CR1 and not other HIV-1 coreceptors, its effect on fusion mediated by CXCR4 and CCR5 with the 89.6 Env was assayed in a parallel experiment. No significant inhibition of fusion was seen with either CXCR4 or CCR5 (data not shown). Fractalkine inhibited CX 3CR1-dependent fusion activity for the 89.6 Env in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 5 ± 1 nm, n = 3 experiments; Fig. 5 B). This value correlates well with the IC50 for homologous competition of fractalkine binding to CX 3CR1-expressing HEK 293 cells and the EC50 values for fractalkine induction of calcium flux. Complete inhibition was seen at concentrations of 100 nm or greater. In summary, we have shown by four different assays, direct radioligand binding, ligand-induced calcium flux and chemotaxis, and ligand inhibition of HIV-1 coreceptor activity, and by both gain and loss of function criteria that fractalkine is a highly specific ligand for the previously identified orphan receptor CMKBRL1/V28, thus justifying renaming it as CX 3CR1 according to guidelines of an accepted nomenclature system. While this work was under review, Imai et al. (27Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H. Schall T.J. Yoshie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) also reported that fractalkine is a functional ligand for the same receptor and also renamed it CX 3CR1. In addition to showing as we have here that the receptor mediates chemotactic responses to a soluble form of fractalkine, they also showed that it directly mediates cytoadhesion to cells expressing fractalkine on the surface. Since RNA for CX 3CR1 is expressed in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and T lymphocytes, it is an excellent candidate for the cellular receptor involved in fractalkine-dependent signal transduction in these cell types that have previously been described; however, specific blocking agents will have to be developed before this can be specifically tested. Based on its in vitro properties, future research will be directed toward examining the role of CX 3CR1 in specific leukocyte traffickingin vivo. Like other leukocyte chemoattractants and chemoattractant receptors, fractalkine and its receptor have the potential to function beneficially, for example in host defense and tissue repair, as well as harmfully, for example in immunologically mediated inflammatory diseases. In this regard, our identification of CX 3CR1 may be useful in future research aimed at evaluating the fractalkine signal transduction pathway as a target for development of potential anti-inflammatory therapies. Also while this paper was in review, Rucker et al. (28Rucker J. Edinger A.L. Sharron M. Samson M. Lee B. Berson J.F. Yi Y. Margulies B. Collman R.G. Doranz B.J. Parmentier M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8999-9007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that CX 3CR1 functions as a weak fusion cofactor for a small percentage of HIV-1 Envs, including the 89.6 Env that we have tested, the X4-tropic Env from strain 92UG024.2, and the Env from strain 93ZR001.3, which is of undefined tropism. Our results are in support of this and extend an earlier report regarding HIV-2 usage of this molecule as a coreceptor (19Reeves J.D. McKnight A. Potempa S. Simmons G. Gray P.W. Power C.A. Wells T. Weiss R.A. Talbot S.J. Virology. 1997; 231: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, our results show that the functional interaction of CX 3CR1 with HIV-1 Env can be blocked potently, effectively, and specifically by fractalkine. The importance of this coreceptor to HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis in vivoremains speculative, as is the case for many of the coreceptors identified by in vitro assays; however, based on its high expression in brain (13Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gray P.W.

Lett. 1994; 169: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it could conceivably play an important role there. Studies of CX 3CR1 usage by primary brain isolates of HIV-1 are needed to further address this hypothesis. Having identified fractalkine as a ligand for this receptor, it remains possible that, as for other chemokine receptors, additional agonists specific for CX 3CR1 may exist, including novel members of a putative CX 3C chemokine family not yet discovered or even CC chemokines. It is also possible that CC chemokines may be agonists at CX 3CR1 in other cellular contexts such as primary leukocytes or for other functions not tested here. Recombinant vaccinia virus encoding 89.6 Env (MVA/89.6 Env) was a gift of L. S. Wyatt and B. Moss (Laboratory of Viral Diseases, NIAID)."

Although the precise mechanisms whereby multiple mutations in SOD1, including several that involve the essential copper binding ligands, result in neuronal injury remain unclear, current evidence implicates enhanced free radical generating activity associated with the copper bound by the mutant SOD1 enzymes (10Wiedau-Pazos M.

The delivery of copper to specific proteins within the cell is mediated by distinct intracellular carrier proteins termed chaperones (13Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, recent studies have identified a protein termed the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) as the factor responsible for copper incorporation into SOD1 (14Culotta V.C.

In this study, comparison of the amino acid sequences of SOD1 and CCS revealed a striking homology between this enzyme and its putative chaperone, including residues involved in SOD1 homodimerization. This observation suggested a mechanism by which copper may be delivered to SOD1 by CCS through direct protein-protein interaction, and thus further analysis was undertaken to examine this possibility in vitro and in vivo. The results validate this concept and suggest a novel paradigm whereby the multiple FALS-associated SOD1 mutations may result in neurodegenerative disease. The coding region for full-length CCS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Similarly, the coding region for amino acids 86–274 (domains B/C) of CCS was amplified by PCR and subcloned into this expression plasmid using the same restriction sites. The coding region for amino acids 1–85 of CCS was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides with NdeI and EcoRI sites and then subcloned into the pET 28a(+) expression plasmid (Novagen). Full-length and truncated CCS constructs subcloned into glutathione S-transferase (GST) or (His)6vectors were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 or BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described previously (15Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 64: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). GST and His tag column binding assays were performed as described (16Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pau M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). For these assays, the CCS fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) or His-binding resin (Novagen) and allowed to interact with cell lysate (50 μg of protein) or purified human SOD1 (Sigma) in 100 μl of PBS at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Following binding, the beads were washed extensively with PBS, and protein complexes were released by the addition of sample buffer with dithiothreitol (DTT) and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and following incubation with specific antisera were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (17Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The copper content of the purified CCS and SOD1 was determined utilizing bicinchoninic acid as described (18Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). COS-1 and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown to confluence in medium with fetal calf serum as described (17Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pEFBOS vector containing wild-type or FALS-associated mutants as described previously (19Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S.

Cells were lysed in PBS supplemented with 1 μm pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After one cycle of freeze-thaw, lysates were precleared overnight with normal rabbit serum and protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). CCS antiserum was added to 1 mg of total protein, incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, and the immunoprecipitated CCS was extracted from solution by the addition of protein A-agarose beads (16Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pau M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The coimmunoprecipitated complex was released from the beads by the addition of sample buffer with DTT followed by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblot analysis was performed as described (17Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To generate CCS-specific antisera, a cDNA fragment encoding the first 85 amino acids (domain A; Fig. 1) of CCS was subcloned into pET 28a(+), expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and the purified protein was subsequently injected into rabbits (Animal Pharm, Healdsburg, CA). Anti-SOD1 polyclonal antiserum was generated in rabbits by injection of purified human SOD1 (Sigma). For immunofluorescence, HepG2 cells were plated on glass coverslips pretreated with poly-l-lysine, 1 mg/ml, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to incubation with primary and secondary antibodies (17Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For double-immunofluorescence studies, either a murine monoclonal anti-human SOD1 antibody (Sigma) or a sheep polyclonal anti-human catalase antibody (Biodesign) was utilized. Amino acid sequence alignment of human CCS and SOD1 revealed a region in CCS from residues 86–234 (domain B), which is 47% identical to SOD1 (Fig. 1). Importantly, the identical residues include all of the known SOD1 copper and zinc ligands except His120 as well as those amino acids at the SOD1 dimer interface (20Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nature. 1983; 306: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and most of the amino acid residues mutated in FALS (21Siddique T. Deng H.X. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1996; 271: 1406-1409Google Scholar). The first 85 amino acid residues of CCS (domain A) contain the copper binding consensus sequence MXCXXC found in the copper transporting ATPases (22Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H.

Analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of CCS (domain C), which includes residues 235–274, revealed no homology to SOD1 or other known proteins but did indicate a putative peroxisomal localization sequence (AHL) at the COOH terminus (Fig. 1) (28Elgermsa Y. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SOD1 is a homodimer and the striking homology between CCS and SOD1 suggested to us that these two proteins may form a heteromeric complex during copper delivery. To investigate this, column binding assays were performed utilizing a GST-CCS fusion protein. GST-CCS was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and mixed with either cell lysates from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the pEFBOS vector containing the SOD1 gene or purified human SOD1 with or without the addition of CuSO4 or DTT. Following incubation, eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antisera specific for SOD1. As can be seen in Fig. 2 A, SOD1 was readily detected following incubation of GST-CCS with cell lysates. Although variability in the amount of SOD1 recovered was observed, no consistent effect on this interaction was detected with the addition of copper or DTT. The CCS-SOD1 interaction is direct and not mediated by additional components in the cell lysate, because incubation of GST-CCS with purified SOD1 gave identical results (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6–8). To further evaluate the effect of copper on this interaction, column binding assays were performed utilizing apo- and holo-CCS and apo- and holo-SOD1. The copper status of the purified proteins was verified by bicinchoninic acid assay (18Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In each case the copper status of the protein had no effect on the observed binding (data not shown), suggesting that structural elements independent of copper binding are essential for the interaction of CCS and SOD1. To further examine the specificity of CCS-SOD1 interaction and to determine which domains of CCS function in this process, column binding assays were repeated using GST or His-tagged constructs containing the indicated CCS domains or the human copper chaperone HAH1 (Fig. 2 B). Cell lysates from COS-1 cells overexpressing human SOD1 were mixed with these proteins complexed to the agarose beads. As anticipated from the homology noted above, a CCS construct containing domains B and C was found to interact with SOD1 in a manner identical to that observed previously with full-length CCS. In contrast, a CCS construct containing only domain A did not interact with SOD1, indicating that the copper-binding MXCXXC motif is not necessary for CCS-SOD1 interaction. The interaction of CCS and SOD1 observed here is highly specific, as no SOD1 was recovered following incubation of cell lysates with GST or GST-HAH1 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1and 2). An A4V mutation in SOD1 is responsible for almost 50% of SOD1 mutations in FALS cases (21Siddique T. Deng H.X. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1996; 271: 1406-1409Google Scholar). This A4V mutant retains significant superoxide dismutase activity, indicating the presence of copper in the mutant enzyme (19Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). As CCS is responsible for copper delivery to wild-type SOD1, we examined interaction between CCS and SOD1 A4V utilizing the column binding assay and COS-1 cell lysates expressing this mutant protein. These studies revealed interaction of SOD1 A4V with CCS similar to that observed for wild-type SOD1 (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and 3). Identical results were obtained using lysates from COS-1 cells expressing several other common SOD1 FALS mutants (19Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Two FALS-associated SOD1 mutants, H46R (29Carri M.T. Battistoni A. Polizio F. Desideri A. Rotilio G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and H48Q, are devoid of copper due to loss of an essential histidine copper ligand, and yet both mutations result in significant motor neuron disease (21Siddique T. Deng H.X. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1996; 271: 1406-1409Google Scholar). Interestingly, these mutants also displayed a similar interaction with CCS (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4 and 5) leading to the intriguing possibility that this chaperone may interact with and attempt to deliver copper to SOD1, even when the enzyme cannot readily accept it. Such a finding immediately suggests a common mechanism for motor neuron disease associated with many different FALS mutants dependent upon the process of CCS interaction with an impaired SOD1 target resulting in inappropriate release of free copper. These in vitro experiments revealed a direct interaction between CCS and SOD1. To examine this process in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation utilizing a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for domain A of CCS. Immunoblotting with this antiserum revealed endogenous CCS as a single 34-kDa protein in human liver and HepG2 cell lysates (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoprecipitation of lysates from metabolically labeled HepG2 cells with this antisera also detected CCS (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). Despite abundant SOD1 detectable in these same cells by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4), as anticipated from the lack of homology in the region utilized to generate the CCS antisera (domain A Fig. 1), no SOD1 was detected with the CCS antisera under these stringent conditions (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1, 2, and 5). Having established the specificity of the CCS antisera, we next performed coimmunoprecipitation of HepG2 cell lysates (Fig. 3 B). Following immunoprecipitation and washing under gentle conditions, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the presence of CCS confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). After removal of the CCS signal from this blot, the presence of SOD1 was examined utilizing an SOD1-specific antisera (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 4). As can be seen from the data, immunoprecipitation of CCS results in the presence of SOD1 in these same samples. This association of SOD1 with CCS was specific and not the result of washing conditions, as immunoprecipitation with antisera for the copper chaperone HAH1 did not result in any detectable SOD1 (Fig. 3 C, lane 1), whereas identical experiments utilizing either SOD1 or CCS antisera resulted in detection of SOD1 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and 3). In all cases, no specific bands were detected following immunoprecipitation with preimmune sera, and the band corresponding to SOD1 was specifically blocked when SOD1 antisera was preincubated with purified SOD1 prior to immunoblotting (data not shown). As might be anticipated based upon homology, the SOD1 antisera used in these experiments did cross-react with CCS precluding the interpretation of similar coimmunoprecipitation experiments using this antibody. These studies suggested that copper delivery to SOD1 is mediated via a direct interaction with CCS. Previous studies have revealed that SOD1 is a soluble protein localized in the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells (30Chang L. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Crapo J.D. Oury T. Rabouille C. Slot J.W. Chang L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10405-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if CCS and SOD1 interact in vivo,then these proteins should be detectable in the same intracellular locations. To examine this question, we performed indirect immunofluorescence of HepG2 cells using the CCS antisera and a murine monoclonal SOD antibody that did not react with CCS (data not shown). In these experiments, CCS was found diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus with a somewhat punctate appearance in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, a and b). Double-immunofluorescence revealed that the distribution of CCS in these cells was identical to that of SOD1 (Fig. 4,c and d). Digitonin permeabilization prior to antibody staining resulted in a marked diminution of the signal for CCS and SOD1 within both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, consistent with the concept that these are freely diffusable within the cell (Fig. 4,e and f). Sequence analysis of CCS revealed a potential peroxisomal localization sequence in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1), and although recent studies have suggested that in neurons SOD1 is localized in part to peroxisomes (32Moreno S. Nardacci R. Ceru M.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 45: 1611-1622Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), no overlap was observed for either SOD1 or CCS when double-immunofluorescent studies were performed in these same cells utilizing a sheep anti-human catalase antibody that identified peroxisomes (data not shown). Copper is an essential redox metal, and recent studies have revealed a complex pathway of intracellular copper trafficking mediated by unique chaperones functioning to deliver this metal to specific proteins while protecting cellular constituents from untoward redox-mediated injury (13Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which mutant SOD1 results in neuronal injury remains unclear, it is apparent that copper is an integral part of this process, as chelation of this metal abrogates the deleterious effects of FALS SOD1 mutants (10Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 33Hottinger A.F. Fine E.G. Gurney M.E. Zurn A.D. Aebischer P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1548-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our finding that CCS directly interacts with FALS-associated SOD1 mutants is consistent with the results reported recently that these same mutants can acquire catalytic copper in Saccharomyces cerevisiae via this chaperone (34Corson L.B. Strain J.J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As previous studies on these SOD1 mutants have revealed dramatically altered metal binding sites (35Lyons T.J. Liu H. Goto J.J. Nersissian A. Roe J.A. Graden J.A. Café C. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12240-12244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), our findings suggest a novel paradigm by which multiple SOD1 FALS mutants may result in neuronal injury. The delivery of copper by CCS to a target protein either unable or less able to incorporate this metal would inevitably lead to copper-mediated toxicity. Such a model is consistent with the failure to observe FALS in transgenic mice lacking SOD1, because under such circumstances no CCS-SOD1 interaction and thus copper transfer will occur (8Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7765-7769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Taken in this context, our findings place CCS in a central role in pathogenesis of neuronal injury in FALS and suggest a novel therapeutic approach directed toward this CCS-SOD1 interaction to prevent copper delivery to the mutant enzyme.

In the current experiments, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) was found to bind to the C-terminal SH2 domain of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) with an apparent K d of 2.4 μm and to displace the C-terminal SH2 domain from the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). To investigate the in vivorelevance of this observation, intracellular inositol trisphosphate (IP3) generation and calcium release were examined in HepG2 cells expressing a series of PDGFR mutants that activate PLCγ with or without receptor association with PI3K. Coactivation of PLCγ and PI3K resulted in an ∼40% increase in both intracellular IP3generation and intracellular calcium release as compared with selective activation of PLCγ. Similarly, the addition of wortmannin or LY294002 to cells expressing the wild-type PDGFR inhibited the release of intracellular calcium. Thus, generation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3by receptor-associated PI3K causes an increase in IP3production and intracellular calcium release, potentially via enhanced PtdIns-4,5-P2 substrate availability due to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-mediated recruitment of PLCγ to the lipid bilayer.

Recently, Bae et al. (11Bae Y. Cantley L. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S. J. Biol.

This possibility is supported by the observation that wortmannin, an inhibitor of the catalytic site of PI3K, as well as several related enzymes, diminishes the intracellular calcium transient seen in adrenal glomerulosa cells, neutrophils, and rat leukemia cells following stimulation (12Nakanishi S.

To determine whether phospholipase Cγ might interact with the lipid products of PI3K in a manner capable of modifying ligand-dependent IP3 generation and calcium signaling, we examined PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 binding to the SH2 domains of PLCγ and found that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 associates with high affinity with the C-terminal SH2 (CT-SH2) domain of PLCγ and is capable of displacing the CT-SH2 domain of PLCγ from the activated PDGFR. We demonstrate that activation of a PDGFR mutant that selectively activates PLCγ (Y1021) results in a substantially diminished intracellular calcium release when compared with coactivation of PI3K and PLCγ by the wild-type PDGFR. In addition, inhibition of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 generation by either wortmannin or LY294002 partially inhibits PDGF-mediated calcium release by the wild-type PDGFR, but has no effect on calcium release initiated by the Y1021 PDGFR. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and extracted as described (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.2-17.44Google Scholar). Synthetic water-soluble 3H-labeled dioctanoyl (C8)-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (5 × 107 cpm/μmol) (17Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 5905-5910Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was incubated with Sepharose beads containing ∼0.3 nmol of GST-CT-SH2 domain fusion protein or GST alone in HNE buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. After 1 h at room temperature, the beads were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The supernatant was then collected, mixed with scintillation liquid, and counted on a Beckman counter. The amount of [3H]PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 bound to the CT-SH2 domain was calculated by subtracting the amount of free3H present in the GST-CT-SH2 domain supernatant from the amount of free 3H present in the control GST supernatant under identical conditions. A nonlinear least squares fit to the data (Kaleidagraph) was determined using the following equation: [bound] =B max × [free]/(K D + [free]), where [bound] is the concentration of [3H]C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 bound, [free] is the concentration of [3H]C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 free in solution, B max is the saturation binding, and K D is the dissociation constant. For the competition assay, [3H]C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (6500 cpm; 0.93 mm) was incubated with unlabeled PtdIns-4,5-P2 (Avanti Polar Lipids) or unlabeled synthetic PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (17Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 5905-5910Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and 20 μl of Sepharose beads containing ∼0.3 nmol of GST-CT-SH2 or GST-N+CT-SH2 domain fusion protein in HNE buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature to allow binding to reach equilibrium, after which the beads were washed with 1 ml of HNE buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The washed beads were mixed with scintillation liquid, and the radioactivity associated with them was measured in a Beckman scintillation counter. The data were plotted as a percentage of the control with no additional competitive lipid added. A nonlinear least squares fit to the data was performed using the following equation: % bound = 100 − n × L/(K i(app) + L), where nindicates the percent specific binding, L indicates the concentration of unlabeled lipid added, and K i(app) is the apparent competitive dissociation constant for the unlabeled lipid. GST-CT-SH2 domain-containing beads were incubated with the appropriate concentration of PtdIns-4,5-P2 or PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (sonicated in HNE buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated with PDGF for 5 min and lysed in HNE buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 ×g, and supernatants were added to the GST-CT-SH2 domain/lipids for 10 min. Beads were washed three times with HNE buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer, and incubated for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blotted using anti-Tyr(P) antibody (4G10), and visualized using chemiluminescence detection (DuPont). The autoradiograms were quantified using the NIH Image program. These clones are as described previously (18Valius M. Kazlauskas A.

Briefly, HepG2 cells were transfected with PDGFR constructs encoding the wild-type PDGFR; a mutant that selectively excludes PI3K binding (F740/751); a mutant that excludes PI3K, RasGAP, and SHP-2 binding, but associates with PLCγ (Y1021); a mutant that selectively associates with PI3K (Y740/751); or a mutant that excludes binding to all four signaling molecules (F5). Cell lines were fluorescence-activated cell-sorted to normalize receptor expression and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following 24 h of serum deprivation, cells were treated with either PDGF (100 ng/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or vehicle control for 2 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (see above). Cells were vortexed vigorously and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. One-mg aliquots were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) using protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm sodium vanadate; two times with 0.1m Tris, 0.5 m LiCl, and 2 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.5; and two times with 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.5. The final pellet was boiled for 5 min in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). Blots were probed for anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-p85 (generous gift of Brian Schaffhausen), or anti-PLCγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. The blots were exposed to the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody prior to detection of proteins using a chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham International). Cells were plated at a concentration of 400,000 cells/well on 12-well plates and incubated for 48 h in inositol-free medium supplemented with 5 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stimulated for 30 s with PDGF (100 ng/ml), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were lysed by sonication for 30 s, extracted three times with water-saturated ether, and filtered, and [3H]inositol polyphosphates were analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC, using a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman), as described previously (2Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4251-4255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as follows. Nearly confluent 150-mm2 plates of cells were incubated for 1 min in 5 ml of HBBS/EDTA buffer (HBBS buffer = 118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mmHepes, pH 7.2, prepared in calcium-free water; HBBS/EDTA buffer = HBBS + 0.02% EDTA). HBBS/EDTA buffer was then aspirated, and cells were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C, followed by scraping in 25 ml of HBBS/CaCl2 buffer (HBBS buffer + 1 mmCaCl2). Cells were pelleted at 1000 × gfor 10 min and resuspended in 5 ml of HBBS/CaCl2 buffer. Fura-2/AM was then added at a final concentration of 1 mm,and cells were incubated in the dark for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with HBBS/CaCl2 buffer and resuspended in HBBS/CaCl2 buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Intracellular free calcium measurements were performed in a constantly stirred 37 °C cuvette using a dual-beam fluorescence spectrophotometer (Spex AR-CM). For experiments performed in the absence of extracellular calcium, 10 mm EGTA was added at the beginning of the experiment, followed by a 60-s equilibration period. Controls were performed for each condition with addition of vehicle alone. Minimal fluorescence and maximal fluorescence were determined for each experiment by adding digitonin (final concentration = 50 mm) and CaCl2 (final concentration = 11 mm), respectively. Curves shown were generated by determining 5-s [Ca2+]i values using a best fit of the raw data. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. To determine whether PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 might interact with PLCγ in vivo, binding of the SH2 domains of PLCγ to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 was examined in vitro. Water-soluble C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 bound to the recombinant C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1 with aK d of 2.4 μm and a stoichiometry of ∼1 mol/mol (Fig. 1). In contrast, the N-terminal SH2 domain did not significantly associate with C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 under these conditions, whereas a construct including both SH2 domains had an affinity for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 that was similar to that of the C-terminal SH2 domain alone (data not shown). To determine the specificity of the C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 association with the PLCγ1 C-terminal SH2 domain, competition assays were performed. When incubated with [3H]C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, unlabeled dipalmitoyl (C16)-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 competed for association with the PLCγ1 C-terminal SH2 domain with aK i(app) of 1.3 μm, whereas PtdIns-4,5-P2 had an ∼3-fold lower affinity (Fig. 2). Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, at concentrations up to 100 μm, competed minimally with the C8-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 binding. The combined N-terminal + C-terminal SH2 domain construct displayed a slightly lower affinity than did the isolated C-terminal domain (K i(app) = 3.7 μm for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and 11 μm for PtdIns-4,5-P2), consistent with this construct containing both a high and low affinity binding site. Since SH2 domains mediate the interaction of PLCγ with phosphotyrosine residues, we postulated that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 might compete for PLCγ binding to the phosphorylated PDGFR. To examine this, the CT-SH2 domain of PLCγ1, immobilized on beads, was preincubated with increasing concentrations of either PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 or PtdIns-4,5-P2. PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cell lysates were added to the beads, and the ability of the SH2 domain to associate with the PDGFR was determined. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 blocked the association of PLCγ with the phosphorylated PDGFR in a dose-dependent fashion with aK i(app) of ∼9 μm (Fig. 3). The higherK i(app) for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3binding in this circumstance as compared with competition with [3H]dioctanoyl-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 2) is likely due to the high affinity of the phosphorylated PDGFR for the CT-SH2 domain of PLCγ. In agreement with the relative affinities observed in Fig. 2, PtdIns-4,5-P2 competed with the PDGFR for SH2 domain binding with a 3.6 times lower affinity than did PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. To examine thein vivo effect of the lipid products of PI3K on PLCγ signaling, we utilized PDGFR mutants stably expressed in HepG2 cells. To ensure that the PDGFR mutants were similarly expressed and recruiting the appropriate downstream signaling proteins, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of PDGF-stimulated HepG2 cells were examined for co-immunoprecipitation of phospholipase Cγ and PI3K (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of the PDGFR in response to added PDGF was nearly equivalent for all cell lines (top panel). As expected from previous studies, PLCγ associated with the F740/751, Y1021, and wild-type receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion, but did not associate with the F5 receptor (middle panel). Interestingly, the association of PLCγ with the Y1021 mutant was increased as compared with the wild-type receptor (see “Discussion”). The p85 subunit of PI3K associated only with the wild-type receptor (bottom panel) and with the Y740/751 mutant (data not shown). Thus, activation of only the wild-type receptor resulted in recruitment of both signaling molecules. HepG2 cells expressing either the wild-type PDGFR or the F740/751 receptor were loaded with [3H]inositol for 48 h, and total IP3 generation in response to PDGF was determined by HPLC analysis. A time course of IP3 generation in cells expressing the wild-type PDGFR revealed that total IP3began increasing 15 s following PDGF stimulation and peaked at 30 s (Fig. 5 A). The addition of PDGF to cells expressing the F740/751 mutant receptor resulted in a lesser increase in intracellular total IP3 as compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5 B, 1762 ± 201 dpm for the F740/751 mutant versus 3028 ± 148 dpm for the wild-type receptor at 30 s following stimulation;p < 0.01), with the increase in IP3diminished by ∼40%. HepG2 cells were loaded with Fura-2 as described, and extracellular calcium was removed by the addition of excess extracellular EGTA. Resting intracellular calcium in all clones in the absence of extracellular calcium was ∼15 nm (Fig. 6) and remained stable for ≥5 min. The addition of PDGF to HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type PDGFR resulted in a peak intracellular free calcium concentration of 93 ± 6 nm ∼75 s following stimulation (Fig. 6, closed circles). In cells expressing either the Y1021 mutant (which selectively activates PLCγ) or the F740/751 mutant (which activates all of the signaling pathways except PI3K), the peak intracellular calcium response to PDGF was significantly diminished (51 ± 7 and 58 ± 7 nm, respectively) and delayed (105 and 90 s, respectively). Cells expressing the Y740/751 mutant (which selectively binds PI3K, but not PLCγ, RasGAP, or SH-PTP2) or the F5 mutant (which binds none of these signaling enzymes) demonstrated no release of intracellular calcium in response to PDGF. Thus, coactivation of PLCγ and PI3K resulted in a 1.5–2 fold increase in intracellular free calcium release as compared with selective activation of PLCγ. Thein vivo effect of the interaction between PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and PLCγ was examined by inhibition of PI3K-dependent PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 generation by the HepG2 mutant receptor cell line. The addition of 100 nmwortmannin to HepG2 cells (which results in inhibition of 80% of the immunoprecipitable PI3K activity in these cells) expressing the wild-type PDGFR resulted in a 24% inhibition of the calcium transient (Fig. 7), whereas wortmannin had no effect on the calcium transient in either the Y1021 or F740/751 mutant. The specificity of this effect of wortmannin for tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated coactivation of PI3K and PLCγ was confirmed by comparison with the calcium transient induced following fetal calf serum addition (Fig. 8). Fetal calf serum contains lysophosphatidic acid, which causes a rapid calcium transient (peak [Ca2+]i at ∼10 s) secondary to release of intracellular calcium stores following GTP-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis (22Seckl M.J. Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6143-6147PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12232-12239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin inhibited the intracellular calcium release following PDGF addition while having no effect on calcium release in response to FCS.Figure 8Wortmannin effects on PDGF- versusFCS-stimulated calcium release in HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type PDGFR. Peak intracellular calcium release was determined following stimulation of HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type PDGFR with either 100 ng/ml PDGF or 1% fetal calf serum in the absence of extracellular calcium. The peak calcium release occurred at ∼75 s following PDGF addition (see Fig. 6) and ∼10 s following FCS addition. The PDGF-dependent intracellular calcium increase was inhibited by 38% in the presence of wortmannin, whereas the FCS-mediated calcium transient was not affected (n = 7;p = 0.02 for PDGF versus PDGF + wortmannin and p = 0.002 for PDGF + wortmannin versusFCS + wortmannin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on our observation that 100 nm wortmannin only partially inhibited PI3K activity in our cells, we also examined the effects of the alternative PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type PDGFR (Fig. 9). In these experiments, wortmannin again inhibited the peak [Ca2+]i by 25%, whereas 50 μmLY294002 inhibited the maximal intracellular calcium release by 47%, consistent with the 40–50% lower calcium release detected in cells expressing the Y1021 PDGFR mutant (Figs. 6 and 7). Similarly, in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing the wild-type PDGFR, LY294002 inhibited the intracellular calcium transient following PDGF stimulation better than did wortmannin (Δ[Ca2+]i = 39.0 ± 1.9 nm following PDGF, 31.0 ± 4.7 nmfollowing PDGF + wortmannin, and 18.7 ± 5.0 nmfollowing PDGF + LY294002). Thus, inhibition of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 generation using PI3K inhibitors prevented the enhanced release of intracellular calcium following PDGF stimulation of cells that coactivate PI3K and PLCγ and had no effect on the lesser calcium response in the Y1021 and/or F740/751 cells, which activate PLCγ without coactivation of PI3K. The present data demonstrate that the PDGF-dependent coactivation of phospholipase Cγ and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase results in enhanced intracellular generation of IP3 and an augmented intracellular calcium transient as compared with those observed with selective activation of PLCγ, suggesting that recruitment of active PI3K to the PDGFR results in increased hydrolytic activity of PLCγ. The importance of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 in this PI3K-dependent increase in intracellular calcium release is demonstrated by two observations. First, the inhibition of intracellular calcium release following the addition of wortmannin or LY294002 (Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9) (10Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G.

This could be due to differences in the importance of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 for PLCγ activation by different receptors or to different cell sensitivities to wortmannin inhibition. Second, the observation by Bae et al. (11Bae Y. Cantley L. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar)that constitutive expression of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K can cause sustained increases in cellular IP3 levels, without the necessity of receptor activation, also supports the importance of local generation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 in enhancing PLC activity. Recent data demonstrating that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can directly associate with SH2 domain-containing proteins and regulate their activity therefore led us to examine PtdIns-3,4,5-P3association with the SH2 domains of PLCγ1. The in vitrodata presented demonstrate that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 binds to the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1 with an affinity similar to that which we have observed with PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 binding to the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85PI3K and ∼3-fold weaker than its binding to the PH domain of BTK (24Rameh L.E.

Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) have found that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can directly activate PLCγ hydrolytic activity in vitro and that this activation can be blocked by the addition of isolated SH2 domains of PLCγ. In addition, the PH domain of PLCγ may be involved in the association of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with the enzyme. Data from the laboratory of Dr. Joseph Schlessinger (10Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the N-terminal PH domain of PLCγ can bind PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and that mutations of this domain diminish recruitment of PLCγ to the cell membrane, raising the possibility that simultaneous binding of the PH and SH2 domains to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 may be involved in enzyme activation. In contrast, the split PH domain of PLCγ does not appear to bind PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (11Bae Y. Cantley L. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We postulate that the mechanism by which the PI3K mediates enhanced activation of PLCγ may directly relate to the SH2 domain/PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 interaction. As seen in Fig. 3, the association of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 with the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ prevents association of the SH2 domain with the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFR. Dissociation of PLCγ from the receptor due to local production of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 could thus allow translocation of the enzyme to the lipid bilayer, increasing its substrate availability. Since PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 itself is not hydrolyzed by PLCγ, its presence in the lipid bilayer would also serve to stabilize PLCγ at that site, via association with the SH2 domain, the amino-terminal PH domain, or both domains simultaneously. Coactivation of PLCγ and PI3K by the wild-type PDGFR, with subsequent dissociation of PLCγ from the activated receptor due to local production of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, might also explain the observation of greater association of PLCγ with the Y1021 PDGFR mutant as compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4). In our experiments, PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 prevented binding of the PLCγ CT-SH2 domain to the phosphorylated PDGFR with only a 3.6-fold higher affinity than did PtdIns-4,5-P2. The low total cellular concentration of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 as compared with PtdIns-4,5-P2 thus raises the question of the physiologic relevance of this observation. It is likely, we believe, that recruitment of active PI3K to the receptor results in the local conversion of much of the PtdIns-4,5-P2 into PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, resulting in a reversal of these concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the receptor. We postulate that the generation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 as a high affinity “anchor” for PLCγ at the membrane is therefore important for stabilization of the enzyme in the vicinity of its substrate. It is conceivable that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 production at the membrane could recruit non-phosphorylated PLCγ to this site (via association with the PLCγ SH2 and/or PH domain) and thereby trigger PtdIns-4,5-P2 hydrolysis in the absence of PLCγ recruitment to receptors. This is not the case in all circumstances, however, since activation of neither the Y740/751 PDGFR mutant (Fig. 6) nor the insulin receptor (26Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which activate PI3K but not PLCγ, will cause an intracellular calcium transient. The present results, along with the recent observations that PtdIns-3,4-P2 and/or PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can activate the serine/threonine protein kinases Akt/PKB and PDK1 (3Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and that PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can stimulate the Arf1 nucleotide exchange protein, Grp1 (25Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C.

We have previously shown that either selective activation of PI3K or the direct addition of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 to epithelial cells is capable of initiating cell motility, at least in part by activation of calcium-independent protein kinases C (4Toker A.

Our present data suggest that receptor-mediated activation of PI3K could result in enhanced activation of calcium-dependent protein kinase C isoforms by enhancing PLCγ substrate hydrolysis and therefore IP3production and intracellular calcium release. The possibility that the magnitude and/or duration of intracellular calcium transients can moderate cell fate has recently been confirmed by the work of Dolmetschet al. (28Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar), in which it was shown that activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase occurred with rapid high calcium transients, whereas NFAT was preferentially activated by a low, more sustained calcium release. The present data demonstrate that coactivation of PI3K and PLCγ results in an increase in IP3 generation and intracellular calcium release. The ability of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 to bind to the CT-SH2 domain of PLCγ and to compete for its association with the phosphorylated PDGFR suggests that the mechanism of the increased calcium signaling involves PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-mediated recruitment and/or stabilization of PLCγ at the lipid bilayer."

The significance of cell surface metalloreductases in iron and copper homeostasis in yeast is that iron and copper ions in the environment are largely present in insoluble, oxidized valent states. Bioavailability of these ions increases through reduction to the ferrous and cuprous states. Fre1 and Fre2 appear to elaborate a diffusible reductant to accomplish this solubilization and mobilization (5Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism of scavenging iron in certain other species is to mobilize iron by secreting Fe(III)-chelating siderophores into the environment (9van der Helm D. Winkelmann G. Winkelmann G.

The regulation of expression of these genes occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated by Aft1 (14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These genes are down-regulated in iron- or copper-replete conditions. Fre1 is also homologous to the gp91 subunit of the NADPH oxidase that is critical for production of microbicidal oxidants in human neutrophils (20Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

The gp91 subunit combines with a smaller subunit p22 to generate a heterodimeric, transmembrane oxidase complex (22Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Redox centers in the oxidase include a cytochromeb, FAD, and NADPH binding domains (20Rotrosen D.

Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Fre1 is a flavocytochrome, has NADPH oxidase activity, and shares sequence similarity with gp91 in regions believed to be FAD and NADPH binding sites (5Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol.

Four critical histidines have been identified in Fre1 as candidate cytochrome b heme ligands, and these histidines are conserved in gp91 (25Finegold A.A. Shatwell K.P. Segal A.W. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 31021-31024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The disruption of FRE1 and FRE2 resulted in cells lacking surface ferric reductase activity but retaining residual cupric reductase activity (6Georgatsou E. Mavrogiananis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). With the sequence of the S. cerevisiae genome completed, we found five unidentified, candidate ORFs1 that share considerable sequence similarity to Fre1 and especially Fre2. Four homologs exhibit more than 30% sequence identity to Fre2 but less than 30% identity to Fre1. The similarities between Fre1, Fre2, and the Fre2 homologs are so considerable, it is likely that these molecules will be structurally and functionally related. Sequence identity in excess of 30% typically predicts similar tertiary folds (26Lesk A.M. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Protein Architechture: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 68Google Scholar). Our approach was to initially determine whether the five candidate yeast genes were metalloregulated as an initial criterion of whether the candidate gene product may be important in copper or iron ion uptake. Our results show that all five Fre2 homologs are metalloregulated. Four are specifically modulated by iron salts through Aft1 and one uniquely regulated by copper salts in a Mac1-dependent manner.

Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The PCR amplified FRE7 5′ fragment was subcloned into pAlter-1 for mutagenesis using the Promega Altered Sites Mutagenesis System. Mutations were generated in the TTTGCnC sequences resulting in TTTCAXC at positions −169 (pF7A), −128 (pF7B), and −345 (pF7C), respectively. Plasmids containing double mutations were generated by subcloning the mutagenized FRE7 promoter from pF7A-Alter and pF7B-Alter back into pAlter-1 generating vectors pF7A′-Alter and pF7B′-Alter, and the third mutagenic primer was then used to change the TTTGCnC sequence at position −345 to TTTCAnC in pF7A′-Alter and pF7B′-Alter generating vectors pF7AC-Alter and pF7BC-Alter. Mutagenesis was carried out as described by the Promega instructions. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis confirmed the inclusion of the mutagenic sequence. The mutagenized FRE7promoters were excised and subcloned into YEp354. The minimal copper-responsive region of CTR1 was mapped to a segment −339 to −299 (numbers indicate bp upstream of translation start). This segment was inserted into SalI/XbaI sites in the ΔUAS vector pNB404 (29Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which uses the lacZreporter gene. A BglII site was introduced between the TTTGCTCA repeats in the CTR1 promoter by PCR. The PCR product was digested with SalI/XbaI and subcloned into vector pNB404 generating pCTR109. DNA for the insertional mutagenesis was obtained by PCR from CTR1 sequences 5′ to the repeats. This segment contributed no activation of lacZexpression when cloned into the pNB404. The PCR fragments havingBglII sites at both the 5′ and 3′ ends were ligated into pCTR109 digested with BglII and treated with calf alkaline phosphatase. The spacing between the TTTGCTCA repeats was increased from 14 nucleotides to 60 (pCTR110), 114 (pCTR111), or 164 (pCTR112) nucleotides. Plasmids pCTR109–112 and pNB404 were transformed into strain DY395. Mutated FRE7-lacZplasmids were transformed into strain S288c. Yeast transformants were grown in low copper synthetic medium (BIO101) lacking uracil to anA 600 nm value of 1. The cells were then diluted 100-fold into medium containing either no added copper or 100 μm CuSO4 for DY395 and 30 μmbathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) or 100 μmCuSO4 for S288c. The cells were harvested at stationary phase and washed with buffer (85 mmNa2HPO4, 45 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of the mentioned buffer and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. The extract was filtered clarified, and β-galactosidase was assayed using ς-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1995Google Scholar). Assays were incubated at 30 °C until theA 420 nm was between 0.1 and 0.4, at which time 1 m Na2CO3 was added to stop the reaction. The A 420 nm was recorded, and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Activity is quantified as A 420 nm (×1000)/min/mg protein. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. S1 nuclease assays were carried out as described previously and quantified by PhosphorImaging (32Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from mid-logarithmically grown cells. For certain experiments cells were incubated in BCS or bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS) prior to isolation of RNA. Details of each experiment are outlined in the figure legends. DNA probes used consisted of 60 nucleotides for FRE1, 60 forFRE2, 55 for FRE3, 66 for FRE4, 65 forFRE5, 69 for FRE6, and 72 for FRE7. The sequences used for S1 probes arise from 5′ ORF sequences. In the experiment presented in Fig. 5, different DNA probes were used forFRE6 (55 nucleotides) and FRE7 (50 nucleotides). The CMD1 calmodulin probe was 40 nucleotides in length arising from 5′ ORF sequences. Fre1 and Fre2 share only 25% sequence identity, yet sequences involved in the candidate NADPH and FAD binding sites are conserved in the two as are the four candidate heme-liganding histidyl residues (25Finegold A.A. Shatwell K.P. Segal A.W. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 31021-31024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The five homologs exhibit sequence conservation in the same regions, and four of the homologs show >30% sequence identity to Fre2 (Fig. 1). The homologs also share similar polypeptide lengths, pI, and the predicted number of transmembrane segments from hydropathy plots (Fig. 1). Fre7 shows the weakest similarity to Fre2 and Fre1 yet exhibits sequence conservation in the NADPH, FAD, and heme binding sites. The sequence similarities suggest that these gene products are part of a protein family with Fre1 and Fre2. Family names are suggested based on sequence relatedness to Fre2 (Fig. 1). The initial goal was to determine whether the five FRE2homologous genes were expressed genes. Because FRE1 and FRE2 are expressed under copper and iron limiting conditions, respectively, we carried out mRNA quantitation using the S1 nuclease RNA protection assay on RNA extracted from logarithmically growing CM3260 cells cultured in the presence or absence of metal ion chelators (Fig. 2). The Cu(I)-selective chelator, BCS, or the metal chelator, BPS, was added to the culture medium to decrease the availability of metal ions. The addition of the copper-specific BCS chelator to the culture medium led to a prominent enhancement (20-fold) in mRNA levels for onlyFRE1 and FRE7 relative to the calmodulin mRNA control (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the addition of BPS, which exhibits a preference for Fe(II) over Cu(I) ions resulted in a marked enhancement of five Fre genes FRE1-FRE5 and limited enhancement (2.8-fold) in FRE6 mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B). FRE6 exhibited high basal expression in cells cultured in the absence of chelators. No enhancement in FRE7 mRNA levels was observed with the BPS treatment. The stimulatory effects of BCS and BPS on mRNA levels on theFRE2 homologous genes may arise from either transcriptional activation or enhancement of mRNA stability. Transcriptional activation is suggested by two facts. First, FRE1 and FRE2 mRNA levels are known to be transcriptionally metalloregulated (8Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 15Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Second, promoter-lacZ fusions of FRE3, FRE4, FRE6, and FRE7(nearly 900 bp of 5′ sequences of each Fre gene were fused tolacZ) show similar chelator-induced expression (data not shown). FRE3-, FRE4-, and FRE6-lacZ fusions were enhanced in their expression by the addition of BPS, whereas FRE7-lacZ was specifically induced by the addition of BCS. Because BPS is not specific for iron ions, we sought to determine whether the BPS-induced expression of FRE3-FRE6was a result of iron deprivation. Iron deprivation occurs in cells lacking a functional FET3 (strain DEY1397,fet3Δ), which encodes a critical protein involved in high affinity iron uptake (10Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Quantitation of mRNA levels of the chromosomal Fre genes in fet3Δ cells showed clear iron-inhibited mRNA levels for FRE1-FRE6(Fig. 3). No changes in FRE7expression levels were observed. Only limited iron inhibition of FRE6 expression was observed, consistent with the minimal BPS induction observed in Fig. 2 B. FRE1 is metalloregulated by both iron and copper salts through two independent sensory pathways (8Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 15Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Quantitation of mRNA levels in stationary phase fet3Δ cells revealed marked diminution in FRE3 and FRE4 levels but a 2-fold increase in FRE6 mRNA levels relative to that in logarithmically growing cells (data not shown). To determine whether the iron regulation of FRE3-FRE6 expression was mediated by the iron-responsive factor Aft1, mRNA levels were quantified in wild-type, aft1Δ, and AFT1-1 cells using the S1 nuclease assay (Fig. 4). FRE3, FRE4, FRE5, and FRE6 mRNA levels were attenuated 5-, 2.6-, 3.9-, and 1.3-fold in aft1Δ cells (strain Y18) cultured in BPS medium compared with wild-type CM3260 cells (Fig. 4 A). Iron inhibition of gene expression is abrogated in AFT1-1 cells (strain M2) resulting in elevated expression (14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Likewise, FRE3, FRE4, FRE5, and FRE6 were elevated in AFT1-1 cells with respect to wild-type CM3260 cells (Fig. 4 B). The Aft1 modulation of FRE4 was the most modest of the Fre homolog genes in the CM3260 background. In two different experiment the ratios of FRE4 mRNA levels in AFT1-1 versus null cells were 6 and 10. Thus, Aft1 mediates iron regulation of transcription of the four new iron-regulated Fre genes (FRE3, FRE4, FRE5, and FRE6) in addition to its known effect on FRE1 and FRE2. FRE7 and FRE1 were the only genes up-regulated by the addition of the copper-specific BCS chelator to the culture medium suggestive of specific copper regulation. The BCS-induced expression of FRE1 and FRE7 is consistent with FRE7being copper-regulated as is known for FRE1 (8Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). IfFRE7 is copper-metalloregulated, the prediction is thatFRE7 expression would be elevated in copper-deficientctr1, ctr3 cells but inhibited in copper-treated cultures. The absence of either high affinity copper permease is known to limit copper uptake into cells (13Knight S.A.B. Labbe S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). DY395 cells lacking functional Ctr1 and Ctr3 copper ion permeases revealed copper-inhibited expression of FRE7 (Fig. 5 A). Cu(II) can be transported in ctr1, ctr3 cells by low affinity transporters (11Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 16Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Copper salts had no effect on expression levels of FRE2 and FRE4-FRE6. FRE3 mRNA levels were slightly attenuated in copper-treated cells, but it is known that iron uptake can be compromised in ctr1, ctr3 cells by virtue of the requirement of copper ions in Fet3 for its ferro-oxidase activity (12De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The inhibition of FRE7 expression was specific for copper salts, because the addition of iron salts did not attenuate FRE7expression. To document whether the copper metalloregulation of FRE7involves Mac1, the known copper-regulated activator of FRE1, CTR1, and CTR3, FRE7 expression was quantified in cells containing the semidominantMAC1 allele, which precludes the normal copper inhibition of expression (27Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). FRE7 and, as expected,FRE1 were clearly induced in MAC1cells (strain UPC31) relative to the isogenic wild-type cells (strain BR10) (Fig. 5 B). The MAC1 allele had no effect on expression of FRE2-FRE6. No BCS-induced expression of FRE7 was observed in mac1-1 cells (data not shown). Curiously, FRE3 and FRE4 are well expressed in BR10 wild-type cells but not in CM3260 wild-type cells. To test whether the elevated expression of FRE3 and FRE4 in BR10 cells resulted from a iron-deficient state, BR10 cells were cultured in the presence of added iron salts in the growth medium. FRE3and FRE4 were attenuated in their expression 6- and 11-fold, respectively, relative to standard unsupplemented medium (data not shown). Thus, BR10 cells cultured in minimal medium are iron-deficient. Mac1-responsive genes (CTR1, CTR3, and FRE1) are known to contain two TTTGCTCA repeats, both of which are critical for transcriptional initiation (Fig. 6 B) (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The 5′ sequence of FRE7 contains one consensus copper-regulated Mac1-specific UAS elements (TTTGCTCA−128 inverted) and two imperfect elements (TTTGCGCA−169 and TTTGCGCA−345 inverted). The site centered at −172 is palindromic TTTGCGCAAA. To determine whether these sequences were copper-regulated UAS elements, mutations were engineered in each of the candidate elements converting a consensus TTTGC XCA sequence to TTTCA XCA (Fig. 6A). The mutations were introduced into the FRE7-lacZ fusion gene. A mutated proximal element (−128-bp element) attenuated BCS-induced lacZ expression by about 3-fold in S288c wild-type cells. In contrast, the mutations within the palindromic element (−172-bp element) abolished lacZ expression. The mutations in the distal element (−345-bp element) was without effect by itself, but mutations in both the distal and proximal elements reduced lacZ expression dramatically. Thus, the Mac1-responsiveness of FRE7 requires at least two elements. The preferred pair are the two proximal sites, but in the absence of the proximal element at −128, the distal element is partially functional. The lack of lacZ expression in the FRE7-lacZfusion containing double mutations in both proximal and distal elements may relate to either a dominance of the middle palindromic element or to a spacing constraint. To test whether spacing of a pair of Mac1-responsive elements is important, we carried out insertional mutagenesis with the Mac1-responsive CTR1 5′ sequences. Insertional mutagenesis was then carried out on a minimal sequence (−339 to −299) of CTR1 containing the two elements in inverted orientation (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Elimination of the upstream element abolished lacZ expression, consistent with the known importance of two elements for Mac1-mediated regulation (18Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The spacing between elements was increased from 14 to 60 to 164 bp (Fig. 7). Increasing the spacing between the two elements resulted in a gradual attenuation in lacZexpression. The spacing of 164 bp reduced lacZ expression nearly 4-fold. Thus, spacing between Mac1-responsive elements is important in CTR1. This probably accounts for the lack of Mac1-responsiveness in FRE7 containing only proximal and distal elements (construct with the −172-bp element mutated) (Fig. 6 A). The Fre1 and Fre2 metalloreductases are well known to function in increasing the bioavailability of iron and copper complexes in metal deficient S. cerevisiae cells (3Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6Georgatsou E. Mavrogiananis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These metalloreductases are believed to be NADPH oxidases based on their homology to the human neutrophil gp91 and based on the fact that Fre1 binds flavocytochrome and exhibits NADPH oxidase activity (5Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,21Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 31021-31024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The five homologs to Fre1 and Fre2 in S. cerevisiae exhibit sequence similarity in regions expected to bind FAD, NADPH, and the two hemes (25Finegold A.A. Shatwell K.P. Segal A.W. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 31021-31024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The combination of the similarities in sequences, pI, and hydropathy plots suggests that the homologs are part of a family of proteins related to Fre1 and Fre2. In the present study it is shown that the homologs are expressed genes in S. cerevisiae and that their expression is metalloregulated as is true with FRE1 and FRE2. Four of the homologs (FRE3–FRE6) are specifically iron-regulated through the Aft1 transcription factor. The evidence for iron-specific regulation through Aft1 is 3-fold. First, these genes are induced in cells treated with the BPS chelator that is known to lower the availability of Fe(II) ions in the growth medium. Because BPS is not specific for Fe(II) ions, the BPS result is not conclusive. Second, the genes are expressed in fet3 cells that are impaired for high affinity iron uptake (10Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Third, the genes are not induced in cells lacking the iron-responsive Aft1 transcriptional activator (aft1Δ cells) even in the presence of the chelator BPS. As expected, FRE3 and FRE6 contain at least one consensus Aft1 binding site in their 5′ sequences (Fig. 4 C). FRE4 and FRE5 contain candidate Aft1 sites that deviate slightly from the consensus at the 3′ base. These two genes contain a T as the 3′ base of the candidate Aft1 sites. FRE4 contains only a single candidate Aft1 site, and its expression is the lowest of the homologous genes as detected by S1 analyses. The fifth homolog FRE7 is specifically copper-regulated in its expression by Mac1. Copper modulation of FRE7 was demonstrated by the induced expression of FRE7 in copper-deficient cells resulting from either the addition of a Cu(I)-specific chelator to the growth medium or genetic disruption of the high affinity permease Ctr1. The Mac1 dependence of FRE7expression was shown by the elevated expression in MAC1 up1 cells and absence of expression in copper-deficient mac1-1 cells. Four important features emerge for Mac1-responsive promoter elements. First, two Mac1-responsive elements are critical for FRE7expression as well as Mac1-dependent CTR1 and CTR3 expression (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). FRE7 contains three Mac1-responsive promoter elements in its 5′ sequences. Two promoter elements yield Mac1-responsive expression of FRE7 as long as the central element is present. The distal element can be deleted without compromising FRE7 expression. Although the distal element is a functional UAS, it does not act synergistically with two functional proximal elements. Second, the two functional promoter elements can be either direct or inverted repeats (Fig. 6 B). The two elements in CTR1 and CTR3 are inverted repeats but direct repeats in FRE1. The proximal two elements in FRE7 are inverted repeats. FRE1 may also have additional elements. Although the two direct repeats in FRE1 are effective for Mac1-dependent expression, additional candidate elements may exist upstream. Third, the spacing between Mac1-responsive sites is of limited importance because CTR1 expression remains high when the spacing between the two elements varies from 14 to 60 bp. Expression is attenuated when the spacing is increased to 164 bp. Likewise, the combination of only the proximal and distal sites in FRE7resulting in a 209 bp spacing yields only marginal expression. Fourth, from the three Mac1-responsive elements in FRE7, a new consensus sequence for Mac1 binding can be established as TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G). The importance of two elements with loose requirements of spacing and orientation in each of the Mac1-responsive genes is suggestive that synergism but not dimerization of Mac1 is required for transactivation. Nothing is currently known of the function of the Fre homologs. All genes known to function in high affinity iron uptake are transcriptionally regulated by Aft1 (15Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This fact is consistent with Fre3-Fre6 functioning in iron homeostasis. The three known Mac1-responsive genes are important in copper ion uptake, so Fre7 may be important in copper homeostasis. The PROSITE algorithm predicts a plasma membrane localization for each homolog, and each appears to have a signal sequence. However, cells lacking Fre1 and Fre2 have no apparent Fe(III) reductase activity and only marginal Cu(II) reductase activity (6Georgatsou E. Mavrogiananis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A fre1, fre2, fre7 null strain retained the residual Cu(II) reductase activity, suggesting that Fre7 was not responsible for the weak Cu(II) reductase activity observed in the fre1, fre2 strain (data not shown). It is conceivable that the Fre homologs may function as internal metalloreductases. Alternatively, the observed homology may not accurately predict a metalloreductase function for these molecules. Future studies on localization of the homologs may provide clues for possible function.

In particular, yeast SPT3 has been shown to interact directly with TBP. Here we report the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a human homologue of yeast SPT3. Amino acid sequence comparisons between human SPT3 (hSPT3) and its counterparts in different yeast species reveal three highly conserved domains, with the most conserved 92-amino acid N-terminal domain being 25% identical with human TAFII18. Despite the significant sequence similarity with TAFII18, native hSPT3 is not a bona fide TAFII because it is not associated in vivoeither with human TBP/TFIID or with a TFIID-related TBP-free TAFII complex. However, we present evidence that hSPT3 is associated in vivo with TAFII31 and the recently described longer form of human GCN5 (hGCN5-L) in a novel human complex that has histone acetyltransferase activity.

Yeast SPT (suppressors ofTy)1 genes, including SPT3, encode global transcription regulators and were originally identified in a genetic screen for mutations that suppress transcriptional defects caused by the insertion of the retrotransposon Ty or its long terminal repeat, δ, in the promoter region of several genes (for a review see Ref. 1Winston F. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1271-1293Google Scholar). This approach also identified the gene encoding the yeast TATA-binding protein (TBP) asSPT15 (2Eisenmann D.M. Dollard C. Winston F.

Cell. 1989; 58: 1173-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to SPT15, SPT3 is not essential for yeast viability. Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that SPT3 and TBP interact in yeast (4Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and mutations in SPT3, SPT7, and SPT8, as well as particular mutations in TBP/SPT15, all result in a common set of phenotypes that include slow growth and defects in mating and sporulation (2Eisenmann D.M.

Genetics. 1987; 115: 649-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, deletion of the SPT3 gene in yeast results in gene-selective RNA polymerase II transcription defects (5Winston F. Durbin K.J. Fink G.R. Cell. 1984; 39: 675-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Winston F. Dollard C. Malone E.A. Clare J. Kapakos J.G. Farabaugh P. Minehart P.L.

The mechanisms for the gene-specific functions of SPT3 are still poorly understood but may include core promoter-selective functions of SPT3 in TATA box selection. Indeed, SPT3 has been proposed to facilitate TBP recruitment to weak TATA-containing or TATA-less promoters in yeast (4Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,8Collart M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6668-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, TFIIA overexpression in yeast partially suppresses an spt3Δ mutation, and spt3Δ/toa1 (TFIIA) double mutants are inviable (9Madison J.M. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). More recently, yeast SPT3 has been shown to be part of the 1.8-MDa multiprotein yeast SAGA (SPT-ADA-GCN5acetyltransferase) complex that also contains SPT7, SPT8, SPT20/ADA5, and the coactivators/adaptors ADA1, ADA2, ADA3, and GCN5 (10Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3220-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Altogether these observations suggest an important role for SPT3 (as well as SPT7, SPT8, and SPT20) in linking core promoter-specific functions (e.g. stabilization of TBP/TFIID-DNA interactions) in vivo to upstream activators through an adaptor/coactivator complex(es) with histone acetyltransferase activity. Recently, putative human homologues of components of the yeast SAGA complex have been isolated. These include hADA2 (12Candau R. Moore P.A. Wang L. Barlev N. Ying C.Y. Rosen C.A. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and three human GCN5 acetyltransferase family members: PCAF (p300/CBP-associatedfactor) (13Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), a short 55-kDa hGCN5 (hGCN5-S) (12Candau R. Moore P.A. Wang L. Barlev N. Ying C.Y. Rosen C.A. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), and a long 93-kDa hGCN5 (hGCN5-L) (14Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.-J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The short and long hGCN5 forms are produced from the same gene, presumably by alternatively spliced mRNAs. The longer hGCN5-L contains a 361-amino acid N-terminal domain (the PCAF homology domain) that is absent in hGCN5-S and yGCN5. This domain shares significant homology with the corresponding 351-amino acid N-terminal domain of PCAF that interacts with the coactivator p300/CBP (13Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 14Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.-J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a human homologue of yeast SPT3. We present evidence for a specific association in vivo of human SPT3 with TAFII31 (TBP-associatedfactor II 31) and hGCN5-L in a novel human complex that is distinct from TFIID and that has histone acetyltransferase activity with preference for histone H3. Our results together with those just reported by Ogryzko et al. (15Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) suggest that the human SPT3-TAFII31-GCN5-L acetyltransferase (STAGA) complex is one of perhaps several distinct human homologues of the yeast SAGA complex. A search of the GenBankTM EST division with the yeast SPT3 sequence revealed a human EST sequence (N89343) 36% identical with yeast SPT3 amino acids 7–47 and a mouse EST sequence (W71809) 42% identical with yeast SPT3 amino acids 44–88. A human SPT3 (hSPT3) cDNA fragment was obtained from a Marathon-Ready HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH) by nested PCR using degenerate primers in the mouse 3′-end EST sequence and primers in the human 5′-end EST sequence. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends and high fidelity PCR with cloned Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) were then used to obtain, from the same library, the full-length hSPT3 cDNA. The sequence was confirmed from at least two independent clones. The hSPT3 cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM with the accession number AF073930. For efficient expression of full-length recombinant hSPT3 protein in bacteria, hSPT3 cDNA nucleotides 120–128 (GGA AGG AGT; 3 codons for Gly, Arg, and Ser, respectively) were recoded to GGTCGTTCT (the silent changes are underlined) to remove a fortuitous bacterial ribosome binding site. The recoded hSPT3 cDNA, which also contained a newly created NdeI site at the first methionine and a BamHI site insertion after the natural stop codon at position 1031, was inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of 6hisT-pET11d (16Hoffmann A.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human TAFII135 will be described elsewhere.3 Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody-agarose was from Kodak-IBI. Purification of FLAG epitope-tagged TBP-containing TFIID (eTFIID) from nuclear extracts of the 3-10 cell line was as described previously (17Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations antibodies were cross-linked to protein A-agarose with dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma). The antibody resin (10–50 μl) was mixed with nuclear extracts (400–500 μl) for 5–12 h at 4 °C in binding Buffer C (BC) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 150 mm KCl (BC150) or up to 300 mm KCl (BC300) as indicated. The immune complexes were recovered by low speed centrifugation, and the resin was washed extensively with binding buffer and with BC100 and then eluted with either 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2% SDS or with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide as described previously (17Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed by standard procedures and with the ECL detection system (Amersham). HeLa cell nuclear pellets (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) were used to purify core histones. The nuclear pellet (5 ml) was homogenized with a blender in 40 ml of buffer A (0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.63 m NaCl and centrifuged in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman) at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed and incubated at 4 °C with 18 ml of preswollen Bio-Gel-HTP resin (DNA grade, Bio-Rad) for 3 h. The resin was packed into an econo column (Bio-Rad) and washed extensively (0.5 column volume/h, overnight) with buffer A containing 0.63 mNaCl. Core histones were eluted with buffer A containing 2m NaCl and dialyzed first against buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) for 3 h and then against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol for 3 h. For the inositol phosphate-HAT assays immunoprecipitations were performed in BC200 as described above, except that BC100 was replaced with HAT assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 70 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the final washes of the immune complexes that were then used directly for the HAT assays. The HAT assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in HAT assay buffer in a final volume of 25 μl and contained 10–15 μl of resin-immune complexes (or either 10 ng of recombinant PCAF or 50 ng of recombinant p300 HAT domain), 1.6 μg of purified HeLa core histones, and 125 nCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (3.8 Ci/mmol, 250 μCi/ml). The reactions were then either analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining followed by fluorography for 16–24 h at −70 °C or spotted directly onto Whatman P-81 filters that were then washed with 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.2) and counted in a liquid scintillator. Recombinant FLAG-tagged p300 HAT domain (1195–1810) was expressed in bacteria and purified as reported previously (21Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Recombinant human PCAF was a kind gift from Y. Nakatani. Because of the important role of SPT3 in the regulation of TBP/TFIID functions in a core promoter-specific manner in yeast, and because of the core promoter-specific functions of both yeast and human TFIID/TAFIIs (for reviews see Refs. 22Roeder R.G.

Cell. 1997; 88: 729-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we searched for a potential human homologue of yeast SPT3. A Blast alignment (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar) of GenBankTM data base sequences with the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) SPT3 (ySPT3) protein sequence identified two overlapping mouse and human EST sequences that together encoded a hypothetical protein with significant identity to ySPT3 amino acids 7–88 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This information allowed us to clone by PCR a full-length human cDNA of 1,165 nucleotides, including part of the poly(A) tract, that encodes a 317-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 35,790 and 27% overall sequence identity to ySPT3 (Fig. 1, A and C). This suggests that this cDNA encodes a human homologue of ySPT3 that will be referred to hereafter as hSPT3. A multiple tissue Northern blot analysis revealed a specific 1.4-kilobase hSPT3 mRNA that is approximately the size of the cloned cDNA and is expressed in all human tissues tested in a manner similar to the ubiquitously expressed β-actin and hTAFII150 mRNAs (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, a longer and less abundant 2.5-kilobase mRNA with a more restricted tissue distribution was also detected (Fig. 1 B, SPT3 2.5 kilobases), suggesting the possible existence of an additional longer tissue-specific variant of hSPT3. A Blast alignment of the hSPT3 protein sequence with the protein sequences in the data bases retrieved all the cloned SPT3genes of various yeast species as well as hTAFII18 and itsS. cerevisiae homologue FUN81/yTAFII19 (Fig. 1 C). The interspecies SPT3 alignments presented in Fig. 1 C and schematized in Fig. 1 D reveal a high degree of conservation between human and yeast SPT3 in three domains (A, B, and C) that most likely reflects functional conservation. Interestingly, the 92-amino acid domain A of hSPT3 is 38% identical to the yeast SPT3 A domains and 25% identical to human TAFII18 and its yeast homologue FUN81 (Fig. 1 D). This strongly suggests that the SPT3 domain A may fold in a structure similar to TAFII18 and may have related functions. Since hTAFII18 has been shown to interact directly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 (26Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the hSPT3 domain A also may serve as a TAFII-interacting surface, possibly also contacting hTAFII28 and/or hTAFII30. No homologies with other known proteins in the data bases were found for the less conserved domains B and C, suggesting that these regions may perform SPT3-specific functions. Interestingly, the SPT3 glutamic acid that is mutated to a lysine in the strongest yeast SPT3 suppressor mutant of thespt15-21 (TBP mutant) phenotype (4Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) is conserved in domain B between human and all yeast SPT3 proteins (Fig. 1 C, E→K). This may indicate a possible function of domain B in direct interactions with TBP. The above observations suggested that hSPT3 may interact with TFIID through direct contacts with either TBP, as in the case of its yeast counterpart, or TAFIIs. We addressed this by testing for the presence of hSPT3 in highly purified human TFIID and by analyzing the physiological interacting partners of human SPT3 in HeLa cells. Highly purified eTFIID was shown to lack any detectable hSPT3 by immunoblot analyses (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), whereas a specific 37-kDa hSPT3 protein was detected in the crude HeLa nuclear extract (lane 1). Immunopurification of eTFIID through its FLAG-tagged TBP subunit was performed after two chromatographic steps, including a high salt (0.85 m KCl) elution from phosphocellulose P11. Therefore, it remained possible that the resins or high salt could have disrupted a potential interaction between hSPT3 and TFIID and/or that the FLAG epitope at the N terminus of TBP might have interfered with hSPT3 association with eTFIID. To further address this issue we performed direct immunoprecipitations both from nuclear extracts of cells expressing FLAG-tagged TAFII100 (f:TAFII100) and TAFII135 (f:TAFII135) and from nuclear extracts of normal HeLa cells with, respectively, antibodies against the FLAG epitope and against native TAFII31 and TBP. Anti-TBP (Fig. 2 A, lane 6), anti-f:TAFII100 (lane 3), and anti-f:TAFII135 (lane 4) immunoprecipitations all failed to co-precipitate hSPT3, in agreement with the above results, whereas they efficiently precipitated TBP and TAFIIs. These results demonstrate that hSPT3 is not a component of the human TFIID complex and that it is unlikely to be part of any other TAFIIcomplex containing TAFII100 and/or TAFII135, such as, for instance, the recently described TBP-free TAFII complex TFTC (27Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). While these results do not exclude direct physical interactions between hSPT3 and TBP/TFIID, as suggested previously by co-immunoprecipitations of overexpressed ySPT3 and yTBP in yeast cells and by corresponding genetic interactions (4Eisenmann D.M. Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Rooney J.W. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), they do emphasize that in human cells native hSPT3 does not efficiently interact with TBP/TFIID in solution. Thus, a more efficient interaction may require the presence of additional components, such as promoter DNA and associated general transcription factors and/or activators. Interestingly, however, under the same conditions anti-TAFII31 antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitated hSPT3 in addition to TFIID components (Fig. 2 A, lane 5; Fig. 2 B, lane 3), suggesting that in human cells hSPT3 and TAFII31 are in association in a complex distinct from TFIID (and TFTC). This was further confirmed by immunoprecipitations with anti-hSPT3 antibodies that also coprecipitated TAFII31 but not TBP (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), TAFII18, TAFII80, TAFII100, or TAFII135 (data not shown). Because yeast SPT3 is associated with GCN5 histone acetyltransferase in the SAGA complex (10Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), we tested whether the hSPT3-TAFII31 complex also has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Fig. 3 A shows that immune complexes obtained with both anti-hSPT3 and anti-TAFII31 have significant HAT activity when compared with mock (protein A resin alone) or anti-TBP immunoprecipitates. To address the type of HAT involved we compared the pattern of core histone acetylation by the hSPT3-TAFII31 complex with that of PCAF and p300. The results presented in Fig. 3 B indicate that immune complexes obtained with anti-hSPT3 (lane 5) and anti-TAFII31 (lane 6) both preferentially acetylate histone H3. This suggests that the HAT associated with hSPT3 and TAFII31 is different from p300, which acetylates all core histones with a preference for H3 and H4 (21Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar) (lane 7), and more related to the human GCN5 family member PCAF (lane 2). In accord with this, and while this manuscript was being prepared, we learned that immunoprecipitations of ectopic FLAG-tagged PCAF and FLAG-tagged hGCN5-S from HeLa cell lines stably overexpressing these HAT factors also coprecipitated hSPT3 and TAFII31, as well as TAFII20, TAFII30, and additional proteins that include novel TAFII-related factors (15Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, we did not find significant amounts of PCAF (Fig. 3 C, lane 6 in top panel) or hGCN5-S (lane 6 in bottom panel) in our immunoprecipitated complexes. Instead, we detected predominantly the recently described long form (hGCN5-L) of hGCN5 (Fig. 3 C, lane 6 in third panel from thetop; and Fig. 3 D, lanes 2–5). The reason for the apparent absence of PCAF and hGCN5-S in our human SPT3-TAFII31-GCN5-L acetylase (STAGA) complex is not clear. However, this most likely results from the different immunoprecipitation approaches used here and in the recent study by Ogryzko et al. (15Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). One possibility is that our anti-hSPT3 and anti-TAFII31 antibodies, including different antibodies against the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of TAFII31 (data not shown), all dissociated PCAF and hGCN5-S, but not hGCN5-L, from the STAGA complex(es). Another interesting and more likely possibility is that the PCAF, hGCN5-S, and STAGA complexes are distinct and differ with respect to their associated HAT subunits (and perhaps other components as well) and their relative abundance in HeLa cells. Indeed, this is also suggested by the clear indication that the composition of the PCAF and hGCN5-S complexes are indistinguishable except for the corresponding overexpressed HAT subunits (15Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Related to this and in accord with a recent report (14Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.-J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), our results indicate that PCAF is apparently not very abundant in HeLa cells, given the difficulty in detecting it in crude nuclear extracts by immunoblot analyses that efficiently detect the recombinant PCAF protein (Fig. 3 C, lane 2 in top panel). It also is important to note that in contrast to the analyses of Ogryzko et al. (15Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), our immunoprecipitation analyses were performed with antibodies against two different native subunits of the STAGA complex that were not overexpressed. Hence, we propose from these results that hSPT3 and TAFII31 are predominantly associated with hGCN5-L in HeLa cells. In conclusion, our finding that human SPT3 exists in a novel in vivo complex (STAGA) with TAFII31 and the recently described hGCN5-L histone acetyltransferase (14Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.-J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) demonstrates the existence of TAFIIs in complexes distinct from TFIID and the recently described TFTC (27Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This is in accord with the very recent complementary findings of TAFIIs within the yeast SAGA complex (28Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and in the human PCAF and hGCN5-S complexes (15Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). It also suggests a possible diversity of human homologues of the yeast SAGA complex that differ (at least in part) by the associated HAT subunit and perhaps also by their relative abundance/activity in different tissues. This is also supported by the very recent study on PCAF and hGCN5-S complexes (15Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and by the observed higher steady state PCAF mRNA levels in muscle as compared with other tissues (13Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The future structural and functional characterizations of these human complexes, in vitro and in vivo, will provide important new insights into the mechanisms that control promoter-targeted chromatin modifications and that coordinate the transcription regulation of a selected group of genes during development, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

In neutrophils, Ca2+ mobilization by the CXCR2-specific chemokine, growth-related oncogene α (Groα), was desensitized by prior exposure to the chemoattractantsN-formylated peptides (fMLP) or a complement cleavage product (C5a). In contrast, growth-related oncogene α did not desensitize the latter receptors. To investigate this phenomenon, CXCR2 was stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells and mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, chemotaxis, and secretion. In cells co-expressing CXCR2 and receptors for either C5a (C5aR) or fMLP (FR), CXCR2 was cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized by C5a and fMLP. However, neither C5aR nor FR was cross-phosphorylated or cross-desensitized by CXCR2 activation, although CXCR1 did mediate this process. Receptor internalization induced by IL-8 was more rapid and occurred at lower doses with CXCR2 than CXCR1, although both receptors mediated equipotent chemotaxis and exocytosis in RBL. Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of CXCR2 (331T) prolonged its signaling relative to CXCR2, increased its resistance to internalization, and induced phospholipase D activation. 331T was resistant to homologous phosphorylation and cross-phosphorylation but not cross-desensitization of its Ca2+ mobilization by fMLP or C5a, indicating an inhibitory site distal to receptor/G protein coupling. In contrast to CXCR2, stimulation of 331T cross-desensitized Ca2+mobilization by both FR and C5aR. CXCR2 and the mutant 331T induced phospholipase C β3 phosphorylation to an extent equivalent to that of CXCR1. Taken together, these results suggest that CXCR1 and CXCR2 bind IL-8 to produce a group of equipotent responses, but their ability to generate other signals, including receptor internalization, cross-desensitization, and phospholipase D activation, are very different. The latter phenomena apparently require prolonged receptor activation, which in the case of CXCR2 is precluded by rapid receptor phosphorylation and internalization. Thus, receptors coupling to identical G proteins may trigger different cellular responses dependent on the length of their signaling time, which can be regulated by receptor phosphorylation.

Interleukin-8 (IL-8)1 is a key mediator of immunological reactions in inflammatory disorders such as respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma (1Baggiolini M. Dahinden C.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). IL-8 is the best characterized member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines, which includes neutrophil-activating peptide 2, interferon-inducible protein 10, stromal cell-derived factor, and growth-related oncogenes α, β, and γ (GROα, -β, and -γ) (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Leukocyte responses to IL-8 are mediated via specific cell surface receptors for IL-8. Two subtypes of IL-8 receptors have been described in neutrophils, IL-8RA (CXCR1) and IL-8RB (CXCR2) (3Holmes W.E. Lee E.J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 4Murphy M.P. Tiffany L.H. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Like the chemoattractant receptors FR and C5aR, CXCR1 and CXCR2 couple to a pertussis toxin (Ptx)-sensitive G protein to mediate leukocyte functions (5Horuk R. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Both CXCR1 and CXCR2 stimulate PI hydrolysis, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, chemotaxis, and exocytosis, whereas only CXCR1 stimulation results in the activation of PLD and the respiratory burst, indicating that the two receptors may play different physiological roles during inflammation (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). This inherent difference between two receptors with shared ligands allows the exploration of the molecular distinctions that control the ability of these receptors to initiate specific cellular activities.Studies with neutrophils and transfected cell lines have demonstrated that CXCR1 and CXCR2 undergo homologous (agonist-dependent) and heterologous (agonist-independent) phosphorylation and desensitization (6Geiser T.

In addition, Ca2+ mobilization studies in neutrophils have indicated that responses to IL-8 are desensitized by prior exposure to IL-8, fMLP, or C5a and vice versa, a phenomenon described as “class desensitization” (7Tomhave E. Richardson M.R. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar,11Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date, little is known about the mechanism governing IL-8 receptor regulation and cross-regulation. Co-expression in RBL-2H3 cells of CXCR1 with FR, C5aR, or PAFR showed that CXCR1 becomes phosphorylated and desensitized by pretreatment of the cells with IL-8, fMLP, or C5a (12Richardson R.M. Ali H.

Stimulation of CXCR1 by IL-8 also desensitized Ca2+ mobilization in response to FR, C5aR, and PAFR (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent studies in this laboratory, using wild type and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR1, have demonstrated that cross-regulation of CXCR1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization can occur as a consequence of receptor phosphorylation or at a site distal from receptor/G protein coupling, decreasing activation of PLC (14Richardson R.M. Ali H. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10690-10695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whether CXCR2, like CXCR1, cross-desensitizes responses to FR or C5aR remained to be addressed. Moreover, little is known regarding the comparative activation or regulation of these two receptors for IL-8. For this purpose, neutrophils and RBL-2H3 cells stably co-expressing the wild type or a cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant of CXCR2 with receptors for either fMLP or C5a were used to study the mechanism(s) of CXCR2 regulation and cross-regulation. The results presented here demonstrate that responses to CXCR2 can be cross-regulated by either fMLP or C5a. In contrast to CXCR1, CXCR2 did not cross-regulate responses to the other chemoattractant receptors. However, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of CXCR2 delayed its internalization and prolonged signal generation, thus disclosing the requirements for time-dependent activation in certain receptor-mediated signals.DISCUSSIONRegulation of chemoattractant receptors in leukocytes plays a critical role in inflammatory processes and host defense (24Snyderman R.

Recent studies demonstrating myriad chemokines and chemokine receptors and a relationship between these and infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus and other viruses have spawned renewed interest in the regulation of chemoattractant receptors. This laboratory has previously reported that motility versus cytotoxic responses of leukocytes to chemoattractants utilized sequential but distinct pathways (24Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar, 25Snyderman R. Pike M.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 257-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Snyderman R. Smith C.D. Verghese M.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1986; 40: 785-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The motility responses were mediated by low doses of chemoattractant and correlated with signals generated rapidly (peak = 30 s). Cytotoxic responses required higher doses (∼20–50% higher) of chemoattractant and were correlated with signals that peaked at ∼2–5 min (24Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar). It was speculated that the magnitude and duration of the signals affected the activation of these pathways, but the mechanisms were poorly understood. The chemoattractants fMLP, C5a, and IL-8 equally mediate leukocyte motility. However, despite the presence of two receptors for IL-8 on the neutrophil surface, CXCR1, and CXCR2, cytotoxic responses to IL-8 are lower in magnitude relative to fMLP and C5a. FR, C5aR, and IL-8R cross-desensitized each other's responses including chemotaxis, Ca2+ mobilization, and arachidonic acid production (7Tomhave E. Richardson M.R. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar, 12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, IL-8-mediated cross-desensitization of these receptors is lower in magnitude (20–30%) compared with fMLP and C5a (50–70%) (7Tomhave E. Richardson M.R. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar, 12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These data suggest that while IL-8 receptors mediate leukocyte migration as well as FR and C5aR, their abilities to trigger the cytotoxic and cross-desensitization signals are different. In the present work, studies of CXCR2 and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant allowed better understanding of the time-dependent nature of receptor activation for cellular responses as well as the relationship of these to receptor cross-desensitization.Previous studies in transfected RBL-2H3 cells have shown that CXCR1, upon IL-8 stimulation, cross-desensitized Ca2+ mobilization in response to fMLP, C5a, and PAF to extents similar to those observed in neutrophils (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ca2+ mobilization elicited in neutrophils by GROα, which is specific for CXCR2, was used to address whether CXCR2 also generated a cross-desensitizing signal. It was found that prior exposure of neutrophils to either IL-8, fMLP, or C5a cross-desensitized Ca2+ mobilization elicited by a first dose of GROα. In contrast to IL-8, however, GROα did not cross-desensitize Ca2+ response to either IL-8, C5a, fMLP, or PAF. These results suggest that the cross-desensitization effect observed in neutrophils with IL-8 is due to CXCR1 activation and not CXCR2. Since IL-8 activates both receptors in neutrophils, double transfected RBL-2H3 cells expressing CXCR2 and either FR or C5aR were generated to further investigate the regulation of CXCR2. As was the case in neutrophils, prior exposure of the cells to either fMLP or C5a diminished the ability of CXCR2 to mediate Ca2+mobilization, but IL-8 or GROα pretreatment failed to attenuate responses to fMLP or C5a (Table I; data not shown). These results mirrored the ones obtained in neutrophils with GROα and further indicate that despite the ability of CXCR2 to bind IL-8 and activate some cellular responses equipotent to CXCR1, others are clearly different, and cross-regulation signals are diminished or absent in CXCR2 pathways.Two mechanisms for cross-desensitization have been described: receptor/G protein uncoupling via receptor phosphorylation and modification of downstream effector(s) activity (7Tomhave E. Richardson M.R. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar). The peptide chemoattractants fMLP and C5a cross-desensitized CXCR2 as well as CXCR1 via both mechanisms. First, CXCR2 was cross-phosphorylated upon C5aR and FR activation, resulting in inhibition by ∼50% of CXCR2-mediated GTPase activity (Figs. 3 and 4). Second, Ca2+ mobilization in response to the phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptor 331T was cross-desensitized by prior exposure of the cells to either C5a or fMLP (Table II), indicating a susceptibility to regulation at a site downstream for the receptor activation. In contrast to CXCR1, CXCR2 failed to cross-phosphorylate C5aR or cross-desensitize Ca2+ mobilization to FR and C5aR (Fig. 4 and Table I). These results may be explained in two ways. First, CXCR2, like PAFR, may couple to a G protein different from FR and C5aR. However, PAFR responses are predominantly Ptx-insensitive (16Ali H. Richardson M.R. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CXCR2-mediated responses, as well as FR and C5aR, are entirely inhibited by Ptx pretreatment. Second, CXCR2 undergoes rapid internalization upon receptor activation (∼95% CXCR2versus ∼40% CXCR1 in the first 3–5 min) (Fig. 2 E). Thus, the duration of the responses to CXCR2 may not be sufficient to trigger the mechanism of cross-desensitization. This contention is supported by the finding that activation of 331T, which is resistant to internalization (∼5% after 30 min) and generates longer cellular signals than the wild type CXCR2 (Fig. 6), cross-phosphorylated C5aR (Fig. 7) and cross-desensitized Ca2+ mobilization in response to both C5a and fMLP (Table II).Recent studies from this laboratory (18Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Ali H. Sozzani S. Fisher I. Barr A.J.

Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) have indicated that phosphorylation of PLCβ upon receptor activation may be responsible for the downstream inhibition of receptor-mediated cellular responses. The peptide chemoattractant receptors, including CXCR2, couple to Ptx-sensitive G proteins to activate PLCβ via Gβγ (30Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Of the four known PLCβ isozymes (PLCβ1–PLCβ4) only PLCβ3 is expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (18Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Ali H. Sozzani S. Fisher I. Barr A.J. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11012-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, it could be reasoned that the inability of CXCR2 to cross-desensitize responses to the other chemoattractants reflects its inability to mediate PLCβ3phosphorylation. However, upon stimulation with an EC100dose of IL-8, the wild type CXCR2 and the mutant 331T mediated PLCβ3 phosphorylation to an extent similar to that of CXCR1, ∼2-fold over basal level (Fig. 8) (14Richardson R.M. Ali H. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10690-10695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Another explanation could be that CXCR2 mediated PLCβ3 phosphorylation at sites different from the other chemoattractant receptors. Two-dimensional peptide mapping, however, showed that both CXCR2 and C5aR mediated PLCβ3 phosphorylation at the same domains (data not shown). In addition, 331T, which cross-desensitizes responses to FR and C5aR, mediated PLCβ3 phosphorylation to the same extent as CXCR2 (Fig. 8). Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of PLCβ may not be the only mechanism of cross-desensitization at downstream sites. Modification of other molecules such as the regulator of G protein signaling or Gβγ, which alter PLCβ activity (32Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 33Parish C.A. Smrcka A.V. Rando R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7722-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), may play an important role in the cross-desensitization process.The observation that CXCR2 phosphorylation by either IL-8 (Fig. 5) or GROα (34Truett III, A.P. Verghese M.W. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1549-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) is resistant to inhibition by staurosporine suggests that phosphorylation of the receptor is predominantly by a GRK-dependent mechanism rather than through activation of second messenger-dependent kinases. IL-8-mediated CXCR1 phosphorylation was partially inhibited by staurosporine, indicating both protein kinase C- and GRK-dependent mechanisms (19Richardson M.R. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8555-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both CXCR1 and CXCR2 undergo phosphorylation-mediated internalization and/or down-regulation upon IL-8 stimulation. However, CXCR2 internalized more rapidly and recovered more slowly than CXCR1 (∼35% recovery of CXCR2 versus 100% of CXCR2, after 90 min) (22Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594PubMed Google Scholar,23Prado G.N. Suzuki H. Wilkinson N. Cousins B. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19186-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, differential phosphorylation between CXCR1 and CXCR2 may provide a molecular basis for their different rate of internalization/down-regulation and resensitization as well as generation of a cross-desensitizing signal. Supporting that contention is that the phosphorylation-deficient mutant 331T, which was more resistant to internalization (∼5% versus ∼95% for 331T and CXCR2, respectively, after 30 min; Fig. 6 E) and generated greater and longer signals than CXCR2 (i.e. GTPase activity, PI hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, PLD activation) (Fig. 6), cross-desensitizes Ca2+ mobilization to FR and C5aR (Table II). Taken together, these data may indicate that the ability to generate a cross-desensitizing signal may depend on the extent and length of activation of the receptor, which in the case of CXCR2 is prevented by rapid phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus followed by receptor internalization. Additionally, prolonged signal generation in 331T was accompanied by activation of PLD. In other studies, it was suggested that PLD activation, which results in the delayed (peak in 2–5 min) formation of large quantities of diacylglycerol, is correlated with activation of the respiratory burst in neutrophils (34Truett III, A.P. Verghese M.W. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1549-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the nature of the signals triggered by chemoattractant receptors appears to be governed by the length of receptor activation.In summary, these data indicate that despite the ability of both CXCR1 and CXCR2 to initiate equivalent responses in leukocytes (i.e. PI hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, PLCβ3 phosphorylation, chemotaxis, and exocytosis) their ability to generate others including PLD activation, receptor cross-phosphorylation, and cross-desensitization are vastly different. These results, together with the inability of CXCR2 to mediate PLD activation and superoxide anion production in neutrophils, support the hypothesis that the ability of chemoattractant receptors to mediate cytotoxic activation requires more prolonged receptor activation than that required for motility-related responses. This distinction appears to be determined by phosphorylation sites on the receptors' cytoplasmic tail, explaining the previously noted hierarchy among chemoattractant receptors to activate cytotoxic responses and receptor cross-regulation (24Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 421-439Google Scholar). Overall, a complete understanding of the signaling properties of CXCR2 relative to CXCR1 will require specific mutation of the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. Interleukin-8 (IL-8)1 is a key mediator of immunological reactions in inflammatory disorders such as respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma (1Baggiolini M. Dahinden C.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). IL-8 is the best characterized member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines, which includes neutrophil-activating peptide 2, interferon-inducible protein 10, stromal cell-derived factor, and growth-related oncogenes α, β, and γ (GROα, -β, and -γ) (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Leukocyte responses to IL-8 are mediated via specific cell surface receptors for IL-8. Two subtypes of IL-8 receptors have been described in neutrophils, IL-8RA (CXCR1) and IL-8RB (CXCR2) (3Holmes W.E. Lee E.J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 4Murphy M.P. Tiffany L.H. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Like the chemoattractant receptors FR and C5aR, CXCR1 and CXCR2 couple to a pertussis toxin (Ptx)-sensitive G protein to mediate leukocyte functions (5Horuk R. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Both CXCR1 and CXCR2 stimulate PI hydrolysis, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, chemotaxis, and exocytosis, whereas only CXCR1 stimulation results in the activation of PLD and the respiratory burst, indicating that the two receptors may play different physiological roles during inflammation (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). This inherent difference between two receptors with shared ligands allows the exploration of the molecular distinctions that control the ability of these receptors to initiate specific cellular activities. Studies with neutrophils and transfected cell lines have demonstrated that CXCR1 and CXCR2 undergo homologous (agonist-dependent) and heterologous (agonist-independent) phosphorylation and desensitization (6Geiser T.

In addition, Ca2+ mobilization studies in neutrophils have indicated that responses to IL-8 are desensitized by prior exposure to IL-8, fMLP, or C5a and vice versa, a phenomenon described as “class desensitization” (7Tomhave E. Richardson M.R. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 154: 3267-3275Google Scholar,11Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date, little is known about the mechanism governing IL-8 receptor regulation and cross-regulation. Co-expression in RBL-2H3 cells of CXCR1 with FR, C5aR, or PAFR showed that CXCR1 becomes phosphorylated and desensitized by pretreatment of the cells with IL-8, fMLP, or C5a (12Richardson R.M. Ali H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Stimulation of CXCR1 by IL-8 also desensitized Ca2+ mobilization in response to FR, C5aR, and PAFR (12Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,13Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Recent studies in this laboratory, using wild type and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR1, have demonstrated that cross-regulation of CXCR1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization can occur as a consequence of receptor phosphorylation or at a site distal from receptor/G protein coupling, decreasing activation of PLC (14Richardson R.M.

IRP binding specificity for the internal loop/bulge and C-bulge of IREs examined in this study, showed that conversion of the ferritin-IRE internal loop/bulge to a C-bulge, by deletion of a single base U6, decreased IRP2 binding 20-fold, with only a small effect on IRP1 binding. Similarly, a C-bulge in the natural IREs (m-aconitase, erythroid ALAS (eALAS), and the transferrin receptor (TfR)), decreased IRP2 binding 10-fold, compared with the ferritin-IRE. Natural IRP1 and IRP2 in a cell extract produced results similar to those observed with recombinant IRPs. The results coincide with structural differences observed by NMR spectroscopy (11Addess K.J.

The differential sensitivity of IRP1 and IRP2 binding to natural variations in IREs at the junction of the two helices (internal loop/bulge or C-bulge) suggests that the presence of two IRPs broadens the regulatory range of IREs and emphasizes the importance of the internal loop/bulge region in RNA-protein interactions.

In competition experiments, unlabeled RNAs were heated and annealed as described for labeled RNA before adding to the binding reaction. If RNA was only heated to 65 °C, the percentage that bound IRP1 was greatly decreased (50–60%). Binding of recombinant IRPs was accomplished by incubation of RNA (0.9 fmol, ∼1.5 × 105 cpm) and protein at 10 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of 60 mm KCl, 24 mm Hepes·Na, pH = 7.2, 4 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol; protein:RNA was 15:1. Almost all (80–90%) of the ferritin-IRE was bound by IRP1, but only 30–45% of the RNA was bound by IRP2, suggesting that inactive IRP2 was present in preparations of IRP2; 2% 2-mercaptoethanol does not decrease binding by IRP1 or IRP2 (14Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). RNA-protein complexes were separated from RNA in 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gels (acrylamide:bis = 19:1) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), 8 volts/cm for 1 h at 10 °C.

The hairpin loop is the most conserved part of the IREs; evolutionary divergence occurs in the stem and internal loop regions (1Theil E.C. Sigel A. Signel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: A1474Google Scholar), stimulated reexamination of whether IRP1 and IRP2 differentially bind to the internal loop/bulge and C-bulge IREs. To enhance RNA conformational homogeneity, we synthesized RNA of comparable size (28–30 nucleotides), purified the RNA using denaturing gel electrophoresis, heated the purified RNA to 85 °C, and annealed before each use (see “Experimental Procedures”). The influence of the internal loop/bulge characteristic of the ferritin IRE was investigated with recombinant IRPs, by examining the effect of the deletion of U6, which converted the internal loop/bulge into the C-bulge (Fig. 1, a and e). IRP2 recognizes the ferritin-IRE ΔU6 much more poorly than the ferritin-IRE (Fig. 2 Aand Table I) in contrast to IRP1. Mutated ferritin-IRE HL1, HL2, and C8A (Fig. 1, f–h and Fig. 2 A) were controls, to show that results under the conditions used were comparable to those previously observed (25Henderson B.R.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant IRP1 and IRP2 were incubated with 32P-labeled RNA, and the protein/RNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The data are the average of 2–4 experiments using 2 RNA preparations for each IRE; the error is presented as the S.D. Fer = ferritin. ND, = not determined. Natural IREs all have the same C-G base pair and the pentameric sequence, CAGUG in the terminal hexaloop, but vary in structure at the interhelix junction (internal loop/bulge or C-bulge). Conversion of the ferritin internal loop/bulge to a C-bulge by deletion (ΔU6) differentially altered IRP recognition (Fig. 2 A and Table I). Thus, IRP1 and IRP2 should also have different interactions with the natural C-bulge IREs (m-aconitase, TfR, and eALAS IREs) compared with the natural internal loop/bulge IRE (ferritin-IRE). The results proved our prediction. All natural C-bulge IREs bind IRP2 much more poorly than IRP1 (10–12%) when compared with ferritin-IRE binding (Fig. 2 A and Table I) and are similar to the ferritin-IRE ΔU6. The observation that the internal loop/bulge enhanced IRP2 binding was confirmed by competition experiments with unlabeled RNAs. A 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled ferritin-IRE (internal loop/bulge IRE) prevented binding of the labeled ferritin-IRE to IRP2, whereas >50-fold molar excess of unlabeled TfR, m-aconitase, or eALAS IREs (C-bulge IREs) were required (Fig. 2 B and Table I). To ensure that the differential binding of recombinant IRP2 to IREs with an internal loop/bulge or a C-bulge (Fig. 2 and Table I) was a property of IRPs, and independent of possible differences between natural and recombinant proteins, IRE-protein binding was examined with IRPs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates comparing of the ferritin-IRE to the TfR-IRE. IRPs in such cell extracts can regulate translation of IRE-containing mRNAs (43Dickey L.F. Wang Y.-H. Shull G.E. Wortman I.A. Theil E.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12699-12705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ferritin-IRE formed two RNA-protein complexes in the red cell extracts, in relatively equal amounts (Fig. 3 A, lane 3), whereas the TfR-IRE formed only one RNA-protein complex (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). The complex in the lower band formed with the ferritin IRE was identified as an IRP2·RNA complex with IRP2 antibody (compare lanes 5, 6, and 3, 4 in Fig. 3 A). The binding of TfR-IRE to IRP1 is 0.52 ± 0.05 that of the ferritin-IRE (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 6, upper bands). (Similar results were obtained with fresh preparations of purified natural IRP1, but with recombinant IRP1, ferritin-IRE and TfR-IRE binding was the same, either because of the His tag used or the absence of posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation or both.) The binding of TfR-IRE to endogenous IRP2 in red cell extracts was 0.10 ± 0.03 that of the ferritin-IRE (Fig. 3 A), which was comparable with binding to recombinant IRP2 (Fig. 2 A). IRP isoforms IRP1 and IRP2 showed quantitative differences in binding to IREs from different mRNAs (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). The ferritin IRE is recognized best by both IRP1 and IRP2, compared with the m-aconitase, TfR, and eALAS IREs. Accordingly, a larger fraction of the ferritin IRE is likely to be complexed with IRPs than other IREs, which explains the observation that IRE-dependent regulation in vivo and in vitro has the greatest range for the ferritin IRE (38Kim H.-Y.

Among IRE isoforms, variations in the IRE/IRP interaction were greatest for IRP2, suggesting that IRP2 will make the major contribution to differential IRE-dependent regulationin vivo. IRP1/IRP2 ratios vary considerably in different cell types, exemplified by liver, kidney, and intestine: IRP1 > IRP2 (50Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in RRL: IRP1∼IRP2 (Fig. 3 A) and in a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line, which appears to have only IRP2 (51Schalinske K.L.

IRP2 is sensitive to engineered changes in the IRE hairpin loop and internal loop/bulge. Because the hairpin loop structure is conserved in all natural IREs, its contribution to IRP2 binding will be constant. However, the variation in structure of natural IREs, with C-bulge or the internal loop/bulge, will differentially influence IRP2 binding to natural IREs (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). The ferritin-IRE ΔU6 with the C-bulge was an even poorer competitor for IRP2 binding than natural IRE isoforms with a C-bulge (Fig. 2 B), suggesting context effects even within the group of IREs with a C-bulge. NMR studies suggest more conformational flexibility at the internal loop/bulge than at the C-bulge in IREs (11Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), contained a C-bulge, ΔU6, and 3 G-C base pairs next to the bulge in the lower stem, creating an analogue of the ΔU6 ferritin-IRE, which likely behaves similarly in IRP2 binding. Note that in addition to the C-bulge or internal loop/bulge, effects of IRE flanking regions have been observed on the predicted structure (m-aconitase IRE) (52Schalinske K.L. Chen O.S. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3740-3746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and on both solution structure and translation regulation (ferritin-IRE) (53Dix D.J. Lin P.-N. McKenzie A.R. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). RNA conformational flexibility which is matched to differences in the binding proteins, as recently emphasized for BIV-TAT/tar interactions (54Frankel A.D. Smith C.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 149-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), may also explain the differential binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to the IRE isoforms (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). For example, the appropriate conformation around the C residue required to bind IRP2 may be more readily achieved by an IRE with an internal loop/bulge, whereas IRP1 may be able to lock onto the C in any IRE. The C residue was disordered in both C-bulge and internal loop/bulge IREs (11Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the internal loop/bulge forms a flexible pocket in the major groove near the conserved C residue (12Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IRP contacts the RNA surface on the minor groove (55Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the flexibility of the internal loop/bulge in the major groove may allow an “induced fit” needed for IRP2 binding on the minor groove surfaces. The question of IRE-dependent coordination of ferritin, m-aconitase, or TfR synthesis is raised by the tissue- and cell type-specific distribution of IRP1 and IRP2 and the differential binding of IRP2 to ferritin, m-aconitase, and TfR IREs in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). When IRP2 predominates in cells, IRE-dependent repression may be greater for ferritin than for other mRNAs, which can explain differential iron regulation of ferritin and m-aconitase mRNAs in rat liver and cultured cells (38Kim H.-Y.

On the other hand, the apparently equal regulation of TfR and ferritin by iron in B-lymphocyte cells lacking IRP1 (51Schalinske K.L. Blemings K.P. Steffen D.W. Chen O.S. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10681-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) could be attributed to other factors such as multiple IRE copies and/or to alternate structures (56Mullner E.W.

Since both IRP2 and IRP1 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (24Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of IRP2 may change IRE binding and could allow coordinate regulation of m-aconitase and TfR mRNAs with ferritin mRNA in IRP2-dominant cell types. Controlled coordination of IRE-dependent regulation through protein kinases would create a regulatory interface between the IRE-dependent regulatory pathways and other metabolic pathways. Differential binding among IRE isoforms, coupled with IRP responses to iron (17Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2020036405,"To examine the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK; EC 2.7.1.109) in the regulation of autophagy, rat hepatocytes were incubated with the AMPK proactivators, adenosine, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), orN 6-mercaptopurine riboside. Autophagic activity was inhibited by all three nucleosides, AICAR and N 6-mercaptopurine riboside being more potent (IC50 = 0.3 mm) than adenosine (IC50 = 1 mm). 2′-Deoxycoformycin, an adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) inhibitor, increased the potency of adenosine 5-fold, suggesting that the effectiveness of adenosine as an autophagy inhibitor was curtailed by its intracellular deamination. 5-Iodotubercidin, an adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20) inhibitor, abolished the effects of all three nucleosides, indicating that they needed to be phosphorylated to inhibit autophagy. A 5-iodotubercidin-suppressible phosphorylation of AICAR to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside monophosphate was confirmed by chromatographic analysis. AICAR, up to 0.4 mm, had no significant effect on intracellular ATP concentrations. Because activated AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.88), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, the strong inhibition of hepatocytic cholesterol synthesis by all three nucleosides confirmed their ability to activate AMPK under the conditions used. Lovastatin and simvastatin, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, strongly suppressed cholesterol synthesis while having no effect on autophagic activity, suggesting that AMPK inhibits autophagy independently of its effects on HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol metabolism.

Numerous biochemical processes are involved in the maintenance and support of cell function and cellular growth. These processes need to be coordinated not only relative to each other but also in relation to the metabolic energy available to the cell. The coordination is generally thought to be effectuated in a diffuse fashion by the adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP), which are both carriers of energy (ATP and ADP) and capable of serving as direct regulators of the activity of many enzymes. Although the cellular energy metabolism is too complex to be described by a manageable algorithm, the activities of most metabolic pathways have been found to correlate reasonably well, positively or negatively, with the overall cellular energy state as embodied e.g. in the concept of “energy charge” ([ATP + ½ADP]/[ATP + ADP + AMP]) (1Atkinson, D. E. (1971) in Metabolic Pathways: Metabolic Regulation (Vogel, H. J., ed) Vol. 5, Chapter 1, pp. 1–21, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). In recent years, the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)1 (EC 2.7.1.109) has been emerging as a “master switch” that mediates at least part of the coordination between energy state and metabolism (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme is regulated in a complex fashion by adenine nucleotides as well as by an upstream kinase (itself activated by AMP) and becomes active when the AMP level is high relative to ATP. Activated AMPK in turn shuts down energy-requiring pathways like fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of the pertinent key enzymes while indirectly activating an energy-producing pathway like fatty acid oxidation (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). However, so far the documented regulatory effects of AMPK have been largely confined to lipid metabolism. It would obviously be of interest to study other metabolic pathways to assess the generality of this enzyme's role in metabolic regulation. Autophagy occupies a central position in cellular metabolism, supplying small molecules both for anabolic and catabolic purposes through the bulk degradation of proteins and other cellular macromolecules. By a poorly understood sequestration process, pieces of cytoplasm become encapsulated by cellular membranes, forming autophagic vacuoles that eventually fuse with lysosomes to have their contents degraded. The autophagic-lysosomal pathway is subject to complex regulation at the initial sequestration step, by hormones, growth factors, metabolites, and various signaling molecules (3Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Two previous sets of observations are particularly pertinent to the energy-metabolic control of autophagy: (i) ATP depletion has been shown to reduce the autophagic activity (4Plomp P.J.A.M. Wolvetang E.J. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the overall autophagic-lysosomal protein degradation (5Seglen P.O. Grinde B. Solheim A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 95: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and the fractional volume of autophagosomes (6Schellens J.P.M. Vreeling-Sindelárová H. Plomp P.J.A.M. Meijer A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in isolated hepatocytes, apparently by inhibiting several steps in the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (7Plomp P.J.A.M. Gordon P.B. Meijer A.J. Høyvik H. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6699-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Adenosine and, more potently, N-substituted adenosine analogues are capable of suppressing hepatocytic autophagy (8Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Holen I. Høyvik H. Kovács A.L. Strømhaug P.E. Berg T.O. Courtoy P.J. Endocytosis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 247-254Crossref Google Scholar) and protein degradation (9Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that a large increase in hepatocytic AMP levels is a characteristic feature of both ATP depletion (10Hue L. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Aw T.Y. Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C435-C441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bontemps F. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and adenosine addition (13Carabaza A. Ricart M.D. Mor A. Guinovart J.J. Ciudad C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2724-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility should, therefore, be considered that AMP, perhaps through activation of AMPK, might be a mediator of autophagy suppression under both conditions. Because autophagy apparently requires energy (4Plomp P.J.A.M. Wolvetang E.J. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Plomp P.J.A.M. Gordon P.B. Meijer A.J. Høyvik H. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6699-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it would seem logical that it be included it among the processes shut down by AMPK under conditions of energy depletion (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In the present work we have therefore investigated whether the autophagy-inhibitory effect of adenosine might be mediated by its phosphorylation to AMP. Furthermore, we tested the effect of 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR), shown to be a potent activator of AMPK after its intracellular phosphorylation to AICA-ribotide or ZMP (14Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Henin N. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both adenosine and AICAR were found to inhibit autophagy strongly. An inhibitor of adenosine kinase (EC2.7.1.20), 5-iodotubercidin (ITu) (16Henderson J.F. Paterson A.R.P. Caldwell I.C. Paul B. Chan M.C. Lau K.F. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1972; 3: 71-85Google Scholar), suppressed the autophagy-inhibitory effects of both treatments, indicating that formation of AMP and ZMP, respectively, was necessary to inhibit autophagic activity. The results thus support the contention that AMPK may be involved in the regulation of hepatocytic autophagy. [2-14C]acetic acid, (50–62 mCi/mmol, 200 μCi/ml) and [32P]phosphoric acid (∼200 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham International Inc. (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). TLC plates (silica Gel F 1500) were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). Analytical reagents for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (EC 1.1.1.27) measurements were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). ATP-monitoring reagents were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Leupeptin was purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). 5-Iodotubercidin (ITu) was purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). 2′-Deoxycoformycin (dCF) was generously donated by Parke-Davis (Ann Arbor, MI). The luciferin/luciferase assay kit was purchased from LKB-Wallac Oy (Oulu, Finland). Metrizamide was from Nycomed A/S (Oslo, Norway). All disposable accessories for reverse phase HPLC, including 0.45- and 0.22-μm HA filters, were from Millipore (Milford, MA). Collagenase (type IV, from Clostridium histolyticum) and other biochemicals, including AICAR, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide (ZMP), N 6-mercaptopurine riboside (N 6-MPR), and adenosine, were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or from other suppliers of analytical grade chemicals. Hepatocytes were isolated by two-step collagenase perfusion (17Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar) from male albino Wistar rats (250–300 g) fasted for 18 h. After isolation and washing with wash buffer (148 mm Na+, 6.7 mm K+, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 151 mm Cl−, pH 7.4) (17Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar), the hepatocytes were suspended in fortified suspension buffer (122 mmNa+, 6.5 mm K+, 1.2 mmCa2+, 2.0 mm Mg2+, 77 mm Cl−, 1.1 mmPO43−, 0.7 mmSO42−, 30 mm Hepes, 30 mm Tes, 30 mm Tricine, 20 mmpyruvate, pH 7.6, 37 °C) (17Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar). By this method we obtained about 4 g of wet mass of >90% intact hepatocytes (cells able to exclude trypan blue). The wet mass was measured by weighing sedimented cell pellets, which have a composition corresponding exactly to intact liver tissue (17Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated as 0.4-ml aliquots (70–80 mg cellular wet mass/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h in rapidly shaking glass tubes; the shaking ensures adequate oxygenation as indicated by the maintenance of high physiological ATP levels (4Plomp P.J.A.M.

Biophys. 1982; 217: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequestration of a long-lived cytosolic enzyme, LDH, was used to measure autophagy (18Kopitz J. Kisen G.Ø. Gordon P.B. Bohley P. Seglen P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Leupeptin (0.3 mm), a cysteine proteinase inhibitor (5Seglen P.O. Grinde B. Solheim A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 95: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), was added to the cell suspensions during incubation to prevent the lysosomal degradation of LDH (18Kopitz J. Kisen G.Ø. Gordon P.B. Bohley P. Seglen P.O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). After the incubation, the cells were washed twice with 4.0 ml of isotonic sucrose solution (10% w/v) followed by centrifugation (1600 × g, 4 min). The cells were then resuspended in 500 μl of 10% sucrose, briefly warmed to 37 °C, electrodisrupted by a single high voltage pulse (2 kV/cm), and transferred to a new tube containing 0.5 ml of ice-cold post-disruption buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mm sucrose, pH 7.5). To separate autophagic vacuoles from the rest of the cellular material, 0.6 ml of the cell suspension was carefully layered on top of a 4-ml density cushion (2.2% sucrose, 8% metrizamide, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 3700 ×g for 30 min (i.e. approximately 1.1·105 g·min−1). After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant (containing the cytosol), the pellet (containing the autophagic vacuoles) was washed in 10% sucrose and resuspended in resuspension buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and frozen at −70 °C. The remaining 0.4 ml of the cell suspension was also frozen at −70 °C, to be used for measuring the total cellular LDH. LDH activity in resuspended pellets (autophagocytosed LDH) and in the disrupted cells (total LDH) was measured spectrophotometrically with a Technicon RA 1000 autoanalyzer. The amount of sequestered LDH relative to total cellular LDH was taken to indicate the autophagic sequestration rate and was expressed as percent/h. The intracellular ATP content was measured with a luminometer from LKB-Wallac Oy (Oulu, Finland) using a luciferin/luciferase assay procedure. Immediately after incubation the cells were acid-precipitated by ice-cold perchloric acid (final concentration, 2% w/v), followed by a 10-min incubation on ice and a 15-min centrifugation at 3700 ×g. A fixed volume of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, neutralized with freshly made 1 n KOH, and frozen at −20 °C. On the measurement day, the samples were diluted 40 times with Tris acetate buffer (0.1 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.75), before measuring the intensity of the produced light in each sample relative to an ATP standard. Intracellular nucleosides and nucleotides were separated and quantified by reverse phase HPLC as described by Shevchuket al. (19Shevchuk I. Chekulayev V. Moan J. Berg K. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using a reverse phase Supelcosil LC-18-T column (25 cm × 4.6 mm) from SUPELCO (Park Bellefonte, PA). The HPLC instrument system was from Waters (chromatographic division of Millipore Co., Milford, MA), consisting of a Waters 486 tunable absorbance detector adjusted to 254 nm, a WISP 710B automated injector and pump, and a Waters multisolvent delivery system. Data were analyzed by a Waters Maxima 820 chromatography work station. After incubation, the samples were immediately treated with 2% perchloric acid and incubated for 15 min at 0 °C. The samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 3700 × g, the supernatants were transferred to a new set of tubes, neutralized with freshly made 1N NaOH, and stored at −20 °C until the measurement day. All samples and solutions used in the HPLC system were filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter. The mobile phase consisted of two buffers: buffer A (100 mmKH2PO4, pH 5.0, 1.5% acetonitrile, 0.08% tetrabutyl ammonium bromide) and buffer B (150 mmKH2PO4, pH 5.0, 10% acetonitrile, 0.08% tetrabutyl ammonium bromide). The measurement time for each sample was 45 min at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min with detection at 254 nm. The chromatographic procedure was divided into three phases: (i) the gradient phase (in which the mobile phase gradually changed from 100% buffer A to 100% buffer B within 2 min), (ii) the constant phase (100% buffer B for the next 30 min), and (iii) the wash phase (100% buffer A for 15 min). Each peak was identified by coelution of the samples with added standards. Cholesterol synthesis in isolated hepatocytes was measured as the incorporation of [2-14C]acetate according to Rustan et al.(20Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Osmundsen H. Drevon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation in the presence of [2-14C]acetate (100 μm; 1 μCi/ml), the cells were washed in 10% isotonic sucrose (4 min at 1600 × g) to remove dead cells and excess [2-14C]acetate. The cells were then dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and frozen at −70 °C until the next day, when extraction was performed. The cell samples were thawed and homogenized by sonication (60 mA/s), and 400 μl of homogenate was transferred to a new tube. Cellular lipids were extracted by mixing with 20 times the volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), incubation for 30 min, addition of four times the volume of 0.9% NaCl solution, and incubation for 15 min, which allowed the mixture to separate into two phases. After centrifugation (5000 × g for 5 min), the inorganic phase, and the protein layer was gently removed, and the organic phase was dried under nitrogen at 40 °C. The residual lipid extract was redissolved in 200 μl of hexane and separated by thin layer chromatography (acid-resistant silica gel TLC-foils, F 1500, from Schleicher & Schuell) using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v) as the developing system. Lipids were recognized by visualizing added standards in iodine vapor and cut out, and their radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in an LKB Wallac beta counter (1261 multigamma). Previous studies have shown that adenosine and (more potently) some of itsN 6-substituted derivatives,e.g. N 6-dimethyladenosine and N 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside, inhibit protein degradation in isolated rat hepatocytes (9Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, adenosine was able to suppress hepatocytic autophagy (measured as the sequestration of endogenous LDH), which would explain its degradation-inhibitory ability. The effect of adenosine was strongly potentiated by dCF, a specific adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) inhibitor (21Henderson J.F. Brox L. Zombor G. Hunting D. Lomax C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 1967-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that lowered the IC50 of adenosine from 1 to 0.2 mm. The inhibition of autophagy by adenosine would thus normally seem to be restrained by rapid adenosine deamination. Incubation in the presence of 10 μm ITu, a potent and specific inhibitor of adenosine kinase (16Henderson J.F. Paterson A.R.P. Caldwell I.C. Paul B. Chan M.C. Lau K.F. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1972; 3: 71-85Google Scholar), virtually completely abolished the inhibitory effect of adenosine + dCF on autophagy (Fig. 1 B). This absolute requirement for adenosine phosphorylation would suggest that its inhibitory effect on autophagy is mediated by AMP. Measurements of intracellular AMP levels (by HPLC) indeed revealed a 10-fold increase (transiently peaking at 3 μmol/g wet mass) after the addition of adenosine + dCF. 2A. L. Kovács, P. B. Gordon, E. M. Grotterød, and P. O. Seglen, unpublished results. One possible mechanism for the inhibition of autophagy by AMP might be through activation of the AMPK. To investigate this possibility, we incubated hepatocytes with the nucleoside analogue, AICAR, which in its monophosphorylated form (AICA-ribotide, or ZMP) is a potent activator of hepatocytic AMPK (22Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, AICAR inhibited hepatocytic autophagy in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of about 0.3 mm). Its effect on autophagy was completely suppressed by 10 μm ITu, consistent with a requirement for phosphorylation to ZMP.N 6-MPR, an adenosine analogue thiolated at the N 6 position, also inhibited autophagic seqestration in an ITu-sensitive manner suggestive of a phosphorylation requirement (Fig. 2 B).N 6-MPR was more potent than adenosine, perhaps because the thiol group at theN 6-position prevented its deamination by adenosine deaminase, as previously suggested to explain the potent protein degradation-inhibitory effects of otherN 6-substituted adenosine derivates (9Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The intracellular phosphorylation of AICAR to form ZMP and suppression of this process by ITu were confirmed by reverse phase HPLC analysis of intracellular metabolites in hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 3 A, addition of 0.4 mm AICAR to the hepatocyte suspension resulted in its rapid intracellular accumulation. Accumulated AICAR was effectively phosphorylated to form ZMP, which at 2 h had almost completely replaced AICAR (Fig. 3 B). This phosphorylation was suppressed by the addition of 10 μm ITu (Fig. 3 C), indicating the involvement of adenosine kinase. Autophagic sequestration has previously been shown to correlate positively with intracellular ATP levels (4Plomp P.J.A.M. Wolvetang E.J. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting a requirement for energy. To check whether AICAR might inhibit autophagy by altering the intracellular ATP concentration, its effect on hepatocellular ATP levels was measured. As shown in Fig. 4, AICAR concentrations below 0.6 mm had no effect on intracellular ATP levels, although autophagic sequestration was inhibited 80%. At higher AICAR concentrations, some reduction in ATP (about 30% at 1 mm) was observed. Apparently, AICAR does not exert its inhibitory effect on autophagy by altering intracellular ATP. One of the established biological roles of activated AMPK its to phosphorylate and inactivate HMG-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.88), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (23Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 24Henin N. Vincent M.-F. Gruber H.E. Van den Berghe G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). If adenosine, AICAR, and N 6-MPR really activate AMPK, they would therefore be expected to inhibit hepatocellular cholesterol synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5, all these compounds inhibited cholesterol synthesis in isolated hepatocytes, with about the same potencies as in their inhibition of autophagy. ITu (10 μm) supressed these effects on cholesterol synthesis completely, demonstrating the need for phosphorylated intermediates (AMP, etc.). The results in Fig. 5 thus support the notion that adenosine, AICAR, and N 6-MPR are able to activate hepatocellular AMPK under the experimental conditions employed. The parallel suppression of autophagy and HMG-CoA reductase activity by adenosine and its analogues would be consistent with a role for HMG-CoA reductase in the regulation of autophagy. To examine this possibility, we incubated hepatocytes with lovastatin or simvastatin, two potent and specific drugs that lower cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (25Alberts A.W. Cardiology. 1990; 77: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, neither lovastatin (panel A) nor simvastatin (panel B) exerted any effect on autophagy, although they potently inhibited hepatocellular cholesterol synthesis (IC50 < 5 μm). HMG-CoA reductase would thus not seem to be involved in regulation of autophagy. Autophagy, or macroautophagy, is a cellular process that plays a major role in the bulk sequestration and subsequent lysosomal degradation of long-lived cytosolic proteins, ribosomal RNA, and cytoplasmic organelles (3Seglen P.O.

The initial autophagic sequestration step is highly regulated by growth factors, hormones, and metabolites such as amino acids and adenosine (which can be regarded as negative feedback inhibitors of autophagy) and by protein phosphorylation (8Seglen P.O.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12823-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the regulation of autophagy in isolated rat hepatocytes. Depletion of ATP inhibits autophagic sequestration, suggesting that autophagy is an energy-dependent process (4Plomp P.J.A.M. Wolvetang E.J. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Plomp P.J.A.M. Gordon P.B. Meijer A.J. Høyvik H. Seglen P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6699-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ATP depletion also leads to increases in intracellular AMP and adenosine (10Hue L. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Bontemps F. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because adenine, adenosine, and some of their thiolated or methylated derivates also inhibit autophagic protein degradation (8Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Holen I. Høyvik H. Kovács A.L. Strømhaug P.E. Berg T.O. Courtoy P.J. Endocytosis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 247-254Crossref Google Scholar, 9Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1988; 175: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the posibility should be considered that at least part of the autophagy-inhibitory effect of ATP depletion might be mediated by adenosine or AMP, perhaps through AMPK. AMPK is the central component in a multisubstrate protein kinase cascade involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism (37Hardie D.G. Carling D. Sim A.T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar). AMPK is activated in response to elevations of the AMP/ATP ratio, causede.g. by hypoxia, environmental stress, starvation, cell damage, heat, etc. (23Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 38Vincent M.F. Bontemps F. Van den Berghe G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Upon its activation, AMPK shuts down major ATP-consuming biosynthetic processes like cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, thereby preserving ATP for more essential and immediate cellular needs such as the maintenance of ion gradients. It has been suggested than AMPK may serve as a general integrator of metabolic responses to changes in energy availability likely to have regulatory effects extending beyond lipid metabolism (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In the present study, the ability of the adenosine kinase inhibitor ITu (16Henderson J.F. Paterson A.R.P. Caldwell I.C. Paul B. Chan M.C. Lau K.F. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1972; 3: 71-85Google Scholar) to abolish the autophagy-suppressive effect of adenosine clearly shows that the suppression requires AMP formation and most likely is mediated by AMP. This effect of ITu would effectively rule out the possibility that adenosine might mediate its effect through purinergic (adenosine) receptors, known to be present at the surface of rat hepatocytes (39Okajima F. Tokumitsu Y. Kondo Y. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13483-13490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The administration of adenosine alone has previously been shown to raise the concentration of AMP in isolated rat hepatocytes (13Carabaza A. Ricart M.D. Mor A. Guinovart J.J. Ciudad C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2724-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions used in the present experiments, with the adenosine and adenylate deaminase inhibitor, dCF (21Henderson J.F. Brox L. Zombor G. Hunting D. Lomax C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 1967-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), included to prevent the deamination of adenosine and AMP, a rapid increase in intracellular AMP to very high levels has been demonstrated.2 The marked synergism between adenosine and dCF in suppressing autophagy would thus be consistent with a mediation by AMP. Both adenosine and dCF are also capable of elevating the hepatocytic levels of other adenosine metabolites, likeS-adenosylhomocysteine and (secondarily)S-adenosylmethionine (41Hoffman D.R. Marion D.W. Cornatzer W.E. Duerre J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Helland S. Ueland P.M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1130-1136PubMed Google Scholar), but this pathway would be potentiated rather than antagonized by ITu (43Bontemps F. Van den Berghe G. Hers H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2829-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). AMP can directly activate or inactivate a number of enzymes,e.g. in glucose/glycogen metabolism (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 13Carabaza A. Ricart M.D. Mor A. Guinovart J.J. Ciudad C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2724-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the ability of AMP to inhibit autophagy does not, therefore, prove that AMPK is involved. However, the equally effective inhibition of autophagy by AICAR would more strongly implicate AMPK. AICAR becomes a potent and specific activator of AMPK after its intracellular phosphorylation to AICA-ribotide or ZMP (14Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Henin N. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 44Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AICAR was rapidly converted to ZMP under the present conditions, and the autophagy-suppressive effect of AICAR was abolished by ITu, strongly suggesting that ZMP rather than the nucleoside itself was the active autophagy suppressant. Furthermore, the ability of AICAR to virtually completely inhibit hepatocellular cholesterol synthesis, reflecting the inactivating phosphorylation of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase by AMPK (24Henin N. Vincent M.-F. Gruber H.E. Van den Berghe G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 37Hardie D.G. Carling D. Sim A.T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 45Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9261-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrated that AMPK was activated by AICAR under our experimental conditions. AICAR, at concentrations that inhibited autophagy by 80%, had no significant effect on hepatocellular ATP levels, in accordance with previous observations (22Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), nor did it detectably reduce cellular viability. Its effect on autophagy would therefore be likely to be mediated by AMPK activation rather than by energy depletion. N 6-MPR, an aminothiolated adenosine analogue, inhibited autophagy more potently than did adenosine in our experiments. Like in the case of adenosine and AICAR, its autophagy-suppressive effect was abolished by ITu, indicating mediation by a 5′-phosphorylated derivative, i.e. an AMP analogue, likely to activate AMPK. However, previous work (15Henin N. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) indicated thatN 6-MPR 5′-monophosphate did not activate purified rat liver AMPK, in contrast to AMP and ZMP. To see if the situation might be different in intact cells, we measured the effect of N 6-MPR on hepatocellular cholesterol synthesis, as an indirect measure of in situ AMPK activity.N 6-MPR was found to strongly inhibit cholesterol synthesis, and in an ITu-sensitive manner, suggesting that its 5′-monophosphate was in fact able to activate AMPK in intact cells. The discrepancy between this observation and the inability of N 6-MPR 5′-monophosphate to activate purified AMPK can perhaps be explained by the complex manner in which AMPK is regulated. The direct allosteric activation of AMPK by 5′-nucleotides may increase its activity maximally 5-fold (46Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), whereas its phosphorylation by an upstream AMP-activated protein kinase kinase may cause a more than 20-fold activation (47Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 48Weekes J. Hawley S.A. Corton J. Shugar D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These two effects can act synergistically to produce, potentially, a more than 50-fold activation of AMPK (48Weekes J. Hawley S.A. Corton J. Shugar D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because the effects of 5′-nucleotides on the two enzymes are independent (49Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), it is theoretically quite possible for a given nucleotide, like N 6-MPR, to cause a substantial activation of AMPK by binding to the upstream kinase rather than to AMPK itself. In the present work, hepatocellular cholesterol synthesis has been used as an indirect measure of AMPK activity. However, the data also demonstrate that all the investigated nucleosides cause a strong suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity and of cholesterol formation, raising the possibility that the latter effects could be instrumental in mediating the inhibition of autophagy. The effects of lovastatin and simvastatin, two potent and specific inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (25Alberts A.W. Cardiology. 1990; 77: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), were therefore investigated. Both inhibitors completely blocked cholesterol synthesis while having no effect on autophagy. It would thus seem clear that neither HMG-CoA reductase activity nor de novo cholesterol formation is required for autophagic activity. The effects of adenosine, AICAR, and N 6-MPR on cholesterol metabolism and on autophagy should probably be regarded as two independent consequences of AMPK activation: HMG-CoA reductase phosphorylation/inhibition and modification of another as yet unknown protein. In conclusion, the present results suggest that hepatocytic autophagy can be suppressed by AMP through activation of AMPK. The adenosine-antagonistic effect of ITu would rule out a direct regulation by adenosine, making it unlikely that adenosine (an RNA degradation product) can function as a physiological feedback inhibitor of autophagic degradation. Although 0.5 mm added adenosine could elevate intracellular AMP levels dramatically in the presence of dCF, physiological adenosine concentrations would probably be too low to have much regulatory effect in the absence of inhibitors. On the other hand, high levels of AMP can be reached under hypoxia and other conditions of energy depletion (10Hue L. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Aw T.Y. Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C435-C441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bontemps F. Vincent M.F. Van den Berghe G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2724-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also cause a suppression of autophagy (4Plomp P.J.A.M. Wolvetang E.J. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O.

The physiological relevance of the regulation of autophagy by AMP/AMPK may therefore be to shut down this energy-requiring process under conditions of energy depletion.

The collagenases share the unique ability to cleave the native helix of fibrillar collagens at a single peptide bond, generating fragments of about three-fourths and one-fourth the size of the intact molecule (15Goldberg G.I.

However, the three human collagenases characterized to date show distinct substrate preferences toward the different fibrillar collagens. Thus, collagenase 1 preferentially cleaves type III collagen (18Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol.

These data have led us to propose that the three human collagenases have evolved as specialized enzymes to degrade tissues with different collagen composition, thereby performing different functional roles in the human body (20Knäuper V.

In fact, all previous attempts to verify the presence of collagenases 1 and 2 in murine tissues have been unsuccessful, which has suggested that collagenase 3 may be the only interstitial collagenase occurring in murine tissues. One possibility to explain the lack of detection of the remaining collagenases in murine tissues is that their expression is highly restricted and circumscribed to very specific normal or pathological conditions. This may be especially the case of collagenase 2. This member of the MMP gene family was originally cloned from mRNA extracted from the peripheral leukocytes of a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia (16Hasty K.A. Pourmotabbed T.F.

Berliner N. Blood. 1991; 77: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that collagenase 2 is a 75–80-kDa glycoprotein that is synthesized as a latent proenzyme during the myelocyte stage of neutrophil development (25Hasty K.A. Hibbs M.S.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10620-10627Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in marked contrast to the other collagenases that are secreted immediately after synthesis, collagenase 2 is stored intracellularly within specific granules, being released upon chemotactic stimulation in vitro or during inflammatory conditions in vivo (27Schettler A. Thorn H. Jockusch B.M. Tschesche H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Knäuper V. Osthues A. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E. Bläser J. Tschesche H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Once released and activated through proteolytic or oxidative mechanisms, the enzyme appears to play a major role in the connective tissue turnover occurring in inflammatory processes (29Weiss S.J. Peppin G. Ortiz X. Ragsdale C. Test S.T. Science. 1985; 227: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition to its degrading activity on connective tissue components, collagenase 2 also has the ability to proteolytically inactivate the α1-proteinase inhibitor, which has suggested that this enzyme may be involved in the development of pulmonary emphysema (30Knäuper V. Reinke H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Desrochers P.E. Mookhtiar K. Van Wart H.E. Hasty K.A. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

Finally, recent studies have shown that, besides its expression in neutrophils, human articular chondrocytes, rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, and endothelial cells are also a source of collagenase 2 (32Cole A.A. Chubinskaya S. Schumacher B. Huch K. Cs-Szabo G. Yao J. Mikecz K. Hasty K.A. Kuettner K.E. J. Biol.

The expression in articular cartilage is significantly enhanced in osteoarthritic patients and can be strongly up-regulated in primary cartilage explants treated with interleukin-1β (34Chubinskaya S. Huch K. Mikecz K., CS- Szabo G. Hasty K.A. Kuettner K.E. Cole A.A. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 232-240PubMed Google Scholar). These data, together with the observation that purified collagenase 2 can cleave the interglobular domain of aggrecan at the aggrecanase site (Glu373–Ala374), have suggested that this MMP may be an important mediator of cartilage destruction in arthritic diseases (35Fosang A.J. Last K. Neame P.J. Murphy G. Knäuper V. Tschesche H. Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Because of the relevance of collagenase 2 in both normal and pathological processes, we have examined the possibility that a putative homologue of this enzyme is produced by mouse tissues. In this work, we describe the molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of a cDNA coding for mouse collagenase 2. We also show that, in addition to its expected secretion from polymorphonuclear cells during inflammatory processes induced in the mouse, it is strongly expressed in the postpartum uterus where it may play an essential role in the degradation of the collagen fibers during uterine involution.DISCUSSIONIn this work we describe the identification of the murine homologue of collagenase 2 (MMP-8) and report that it is a protease associated with inflammatory conditions. We also propose that collagenase 2 may play a role in the massive resorption of connective tissue that takes place during postpartum involution of the uterus. This finding suggests an additional function for this proteolytic enzyme whose presence had been so far described exclusively in human cells, but whose participation in this involuting process was unknown.The identification and cloning of the cDNA for this murine protease was the result of studies directed to clarify the debated question about the number and identity of collagenolytic enzymes present in murine tissues. To date, only the murine homologue of human collagenase 3 had been identified, whereas successive attempts carried out by different groups including ours had failed to clone the homologues of collagenases 1 and 2. By using a combined strategy involving the search of YAC genomic clones containing a hypothetical MMP gene cluster followed by PCR amplification of positive YAC clones with degenerate oligonucleotides encoding conserved regions in human collagenases, we identified a partial genomic sequence encoding a putative mouse collagenase 2. This genomic information was used to design the specific oligonucleotides required for RT-PCR and RACE procedures, which finally led us to obtain a collagenase 2 full-length cDNA from RNA of mouse embryos. Pairwise comparisons with the sequences of previously described MMPs strongly suggest that the obtained sequence corresponds to the murine homologue of human collagenase 2. This finding demonstrates that collagenase 3 is not the only collagenolytic enzyme encoded in the genome of rodents and emphasizes the necessity of performing further studies to clarify whether a homologue of collagenase 1 is also present in murine tissues.The availability of the cDNA for murine collagenase 2 provided a specific reagent to perform functional studies in animal models directed to elucidate the tissue distribution and physiological role of this proteolytic enzyme. In this work, we show that collagenase 2 is expressed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes released under inflammatory conditions. The expression analysis performed in this work also revealed the presence of collagenase 2 at late stages during mouse embryogenesis likely associated with the appearance of mature polymorphonuclear cells in the developing mouse. This observation is consistent with studies of location and temporal appearance of hematopoietic cells during murine embryogenesis showing that totipotent stem cells first originate in the yolk sac, then migrate to the fetal liver, and finally colonize the bone marrow shortly before birth (56Medvinsky A.L. Samoylina N.L. Müller A.M. Dzierzak E.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the most striking finding in this collagenase 2 expression analysis in murine tissues was its presence at large levels in the postpartum uterus. A likely role for collagenase 2 in this context would be the degradation of collagen fibers during the process of massive connective tissue resumption occurring immediately after parturition. In support of this proposed role, collagenase 2 preferentially degrades type I collagen (19Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a predominant fibrillar collagen in the uterine tissue. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that another collagenolytic enzyme, collagenase 3, can be detected in the rat postpartum uterus (53Wolf K. Sandner P. Kurtz A. Moll W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5429-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 54Rudolph-Owen L.A. Hulboy D.L. Wilson C.L. Mudgett J. Matrisian L.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the presence of collagenase 3 transcripts was only detected at very low levels and, usually, these transcripts could only be visualized after using highly sensitive RT-PCR procedures (53Wolf K. Sandner P. Kurtz A. Moll W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5429-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting a secondary role of this enzyme in the involuting process when compared with other abundantly expressed MMPs such as matrilysin and collagenase 2. Similarly, over the last year a series of in vitro studies have reported the ability of cultured uterine smooth muscle cells to produce murine collagenase 3 upon stimulation with serotonin (57Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S. Roswit W.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 58Wilcox B.D. Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20752-20757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these studies have shown the in vivopresence of RNA transcripts for collagenase 3 in the involuting uterus, thus hampering the extrapolation of the above results with cultured cells to the in vivo situation. Finally, it is remarkable that although the present study has confirmed that matrilysin is expressed at very high levels shortly after parturition, it should be taken into account that this enzyme is unable to cleave fibrillar collagens suggesting that its role in the involuting process may be distinct from that of collagenase 2 (51Abramson S.R. Conner G.E. Nagase H. Neuhaus I. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16016-16022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 52Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). One possibility is that both enzymes could form part of an activation cascade with the ability to generate the collagenolytic activity required in this resorptive process. In fact, we have shown that matrilysin is able to activate murine procollagenase 2 in a time-dependent manner, providing an indirect support for this hypothesis. In addition, the dynamics of temporal appearance of both enzymes during the involutive process is consistent with the presence of matrilysin upstream of collagenase 2 in this putative activation cascade. Further studies will be required to provide a more definitive evidence on the putative collaborative role of both metalloproteases in the process of postpartum involution of the uterus.The proposed role of collagenase 2 in the process of uterine resumption could also explain previous observations of the impaired reproductive ability of transgenic female animals having a mutant type I collagen that cannot be cleaved into the characteristic three-fourths and one-fourth fragments (59Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Jeffrey J.J. Krane S. Jaenisch R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 60Krane S.M. Byrne M.H. Lemaitre V. Henriet P. Jeffrey J.J. Witter J.P. Liu X. Wu H. Jaenisch R. Eeckhout Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In fact, the uterine wall of these transgenic mice accumulates multiple nodules consisting of large collagen aggregations that reflect the impaired collagen degradation during the postpartum period. The maintenance of this high collagen content in the postpartum uterus would be a consequence of the inability of collagenase 2, the predominant collagenolytic enzyme in this process, to remove a mutant collagen carrying alterations in the collagenase cleavage site. The availability of genomic and cDNA clones for murine collagenase 2 opens the possibility to generate animals in which the expression of this gene can be deregulated or ablated. These animal models will be essential to further extend the proposed functional relevance of this enzyme in both inflammatory and reproductive processes. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 form a group of structurally related endopeptidases that mediate the degradation of the different macromolecular components of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes (1Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar, 2Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). These proteolytic enzymes have been implicated in the connective tissue remodeling occurring in normal processes such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, bone growth, or wound healing (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar, 4Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). In addition, abnormal expression of these enzymes may contribute to a variety of pathological processes including atherosclerosis (5Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davies M.J. Foster K. Hembry R. Murphy G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). At present, the family of human MMPs is composed of 16 members that can be classified into four different subfamilies: collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs, although there are some enzymes like macrophage metalloelastase (10Belaaouaj A.

The collagenase subfamily of human MMPs is composed of three members: fibroblast collagenase (collagenase 1 or MMP-1), neutrophil collagenase (collagenase 2 or MMP-8), and collagenase 3 (MMP-13). An additional collagenase called collagenase 4 (MMP-18) has been cloned from metamorphosing Xenopus laevis tadpoles, but no human homolog of this enzyme has been described yet (14Stolow M.A. Bauzon D.D. Li J. Sedgwick T. Liang V.C.T. Sang Q.A. Shi Y.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The collagenases share the unique ability to cleave the native helix of fibrillar collagens at a single peptide bond, generating fragments of about three-fourths and one-fourth the size of the intact molecule (15Goldberg G.I.

However, the three human collagenases characterized to date show distinct substrate preferences toward the different fibrillar collagens. Thus, collagenase 1 preferentially cleaves type III collagen (18Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and collagenase 2 is more active against type I collagen (19Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas collagenase 3 is especially effective against type II collagen (20Knäuper V. López-Otı́n C. Smith B. Knight G.

Geoghegan K.F. Hambor J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). These data have led us to propose that the three human collagenases have evolved as specialized enzymes to degrade tissues with different collagen composition, thereby performing different functional roles in the human body (20Knäuper V.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5429-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting a secondary role of this enzyme in the involuting process when compared with other abundantly expressed MMPs such as matrilysin and collagenase 2. Similarly, over the last year a series of in vitro studies have reported the ability of cultured uterine smooth muscle cells to produce murine collagenase 3 upon stimulation with serotonin (57Jeffrey J.J. Ehlich L.S. Roswit W.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 58Wilcox B.D. Rydelek-Fitzgerald L. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20752-20757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these studies have shown the in vivopresence of RNA transcripts for collagenase 3 in the involuting uterus, thus hampering the extrapolation of the above results with cultured cells to the in vivo situation. Finally, it is remarkable that although the present study has confirmed that matrilysin is expressed at very high levels shortly after parturition, it should be taken into account that this enzyme is unable to cleave fibrillar collagens suggesting that its role in the involuting process may be distinct from that of collagenase 2 (51Abramson S.R.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). One possibility is that both enzymes could form part of an activation cascade with the ability to generate the collagenolytic activity required in this resorptive process. In fact, we have shown that matrilysin is able to activate murine procollagenase 2 in a time-dependent manner, providing an indirect support for this hypothesis. In addition, the dynamics of temporal appearance of both enzymes during the involutive process is consistent with the presence of matrilysin upstream of collagenase 2 in this putative activation cascade. Further studies will be required to provide a more definitive evidence on the putative collaborative role of both metalloproteases in the process of postpartum involution of the uterus.The proposed role of collagenase 2 in the process of uterine resumption could also explain previous observations of the impaired reproductive ability of transgenic female animals having a mutant type I collagen that cannot be cleaved into the characteristic three-fourths and one-fourth fragments (59Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Jeffrey J.J. Krane S. Jaenisch R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 60Krane S.M. Byrne M.H. Lemaitre V. Henriet P. Jeffrey J.J. Witter J.P.

In fact, the uterine wall of these transgenic mice accumulates multiple nodules consisting of large collagen aggregations that reflect the impaired collagen degradation during the postpartum period. The maintenance of this high collagen content in the postpartum uterus would be a consequence of the inability of collagenase 2, the predominant collagenolytic enzyme in this process, to remove a mutant collagen carrying alterations in the collagenase cleavage site. The availability of genomic and cDNA clones for murine collagenase 2 opens the possibility to generate animals in which the expression of this gene can be deregulated or ablated. These animal models will be essential to further extend the proposed functional relevance of this enzyme in both inflammatory and reproductive processes. In this work we describe the identification of the murine homologue of collagenase 2 (MMP-8) and report that it is a protease associated with inflammatory conditions. We also propose that collagenase 2 may play a role in the massive resorption of connective tissue that takes place during postpartum involution of the uterus. This finding suggests an additional function for this proteolytic enzyme whose presence had been so far described exclusively in human cells, but whose participation in this involuting process was unknown. The identification and cloning of the cDNA for this murine protease was the result of studies directed to clarify the debated question about the number and identity of collagenolytic enzymes present in murine tissues. To date, only the murine homologue of human collagenase 3 had been identified, whereas successive attempts carried out by different groups including ours had failed to clone the homologues of collagenases 1 and 2. By using a combined strategy involving the search of YAC genomic clones containing a hypothetical MMP gene cluster followed by PCR amplification of positive YAC clones with degenerate oligonucleotides encoding conserved regions in human collagenases, we identified a partial genomic sequence encoding a putative mouse collagenase 2. This genomic information was used to design the specific oligonucleotides required for RT-PCR and RACE procedures, which finally led us to obtain a collagenase 2 full-length cDNA from RNA of mouse embryos. Pairwise comparisons with the sequences of previously described MMPs strongly suggest that the obtained sequence corresponds to the murine homologue of human collagenase 2. This finding demonstrates that collagenase 3 is not the only collagenolytic enzyme encoded in the genome of rodents and emphasizes the necessity of performing further studies to clarify whether a homologue of collagenase 1 is also present in murine tissues. The availability of the cDNA for murine collagenase 2 provided a specific reagent to perform functional studies in animal models directed to elucidate the tissue distribution and physiological role of this proteolytic enzyme. In this work, we show that collagenase 2 is expressed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes released under inflammatory conditions. The expression analysis performed in this work also revealed the presence of collagenase 2 at late stages during mouse embryogenesis likely associated with the appearance of mature polymorphonuclear cells in the developing mouse. This observation is consistent with studies of location and temporal appearance of hematopoietic cells during murine embryogenesis showing that totipotent stem cells first originate in the yolk sac, then migrate to the fetal liver, and finally colonize the bone marrow shortly before birth (56Medvinsky A.L. Samoylina N.L. Müller A.M. Dzierzak E.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the most striking finding in this collagenase 2 expression analysis in murine tissues was its presence at large levels in the postpartum uterus. A likely role for collagenase 2 in this context would be the degradation of collagen fibers during the process of massive connective tissue resumption occurring immediately after parturition. In support of this proposed role, collagenase 2 preferentially degrades type I collagen (19Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a predominant fibrillar collagen in the uterine tissue. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that another collagenolytic enzyme, collagenase 3, can be detected in the rat postpartum uterus (53Wolf K. Sandner P. Kurtz A. Moll W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5429-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 54Rudolph-Owen L.A. Hulboy D.L. Wilson C.L. Mudgett J. Matrisian L.M.

We have used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify the genes that encode the SWP59 and SWP61 subunits. Surprisingly, we find that SWP59 and SWP61 are encoded by theARP9 and ARP7 genes, respectively, which encode members of the actin-related protein (ARP) family. Sequence analyses have shown that ARP9 and ARP7 are 24–26% identical (48–51% similar) to yeast actin and that they are likely to maintain the overall actin fold. Deletion of either the ARP9 or ARP7 gene causes typical swi/snf phenotypes, including growth defects on media containing galactose, glycerol, or sucrose as sole carbon sources. ARP9 and ARP7 are also required for expression of an HO-lacZ fusion gene and for full transcriptional enhancement by the GAL4 activator. The identification of two ARP family members as crucial subunits of the SWI/SNF complex suggests that the complex may contain a total of three different ATPase subunits; furthermore, the similarity of ARP7 and ARP9 to the HSP and HSC family of ATPases suggests the possibility that chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF may involve chaperone-like activities.

The Actin-related protein (ARP)1 family is a branch of the larger actin superfamily of proteins that includes conventional actins, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), sugar kinases, glycerol kinase, and other ATP-binding proteins from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kabsch W.

The ARP family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of 10 different ARPs (ARP1–10) that share 17–45% overall identity (38–69% similarity) to conventional actins (3Poch O. Winsor B. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These similarities span the length of actin, including 13 blocks of homology that encompass sequences that are known to be important for actin structure or function. Furthermore, even the most distantly related ARP, ARP10, contains 41% similarity to the ATPase domain of the yeast Hsp/Hsc70, SSA1, indicating that the ATP binding pocket is well conserved among all ARP family members.Phylogenetic tree analyses (3Poch O. Winsor B. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggest that the 10 yeast ARPs may each define a separate class of ARP that has a distinct function or cellular localization. In yeast, the majority of ARPs were identified based on sequence analysis, and a genetic analysis has only been applied to ARP1–4. Although not an essential gene, ARP1 encodes a component of the dynactin complex that is required for orientation of the mitotic spindle and nuclear migration; ARP2 and ARP3, on the other hand, are essential genes in yeast that are believed to function together and with the actin cytoskeleton (2Frankel S. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ARP4 is also an essential protein, but it is localized in the nucleus, and the phenotype of aarp4 mutant suggests a role in chromatin structure or function (4Weber V. Harata M. Hauser H.

The yeast SWI/SNF complex is composed of 11 different polypeptide subunits, and it is required in vivo for the transcriptional induction of a subset of yeast genes and for the functioning of a variety of sequence-specific transcriptional activators. Genetic studies in yeast indicate that the role of the SWI/SNF complex in transcriptional regulation is to antagonize chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression. Likewise, a mammalian counterpart of SWI/SNF, the BRG1 complex, is associated with hormone-bound glucocorticoid receptor and is required for glucocorticoid receptor-dependent changes in chromatin structure in vivo (7Fryer C.J.

In the present paper, we confirm the existence of Lewis X structuresO-linked to mannose within the mammalian brain, demonstrate that these structures are present on a well defined mucin-like glycoprotein, cranin (dystroglycan), and report studies suggesting that the linkages involved may be predominantly 2-linked to mannose. Mannose-linked Lewis X is the latest in an increasing list of oligosaccharide recognition “tags” that have been shown to be expressed on cranin (dystroglycan) purified from brain. triethanolamine collision-activated dissociation gas chromatography mass spectrometry fast atom bombardment. The Lewis X epitope, Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-R, has been implicated in cell-cell recognition events in a number of systems. For example, Lewis X structures appear to participate in calcium-dependent compaction of 8-cell embryos (1Eggens I. Fenderson B. Toyokuni T. Dean B. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neural tube closure (2Roberts C. Platt N. Streit A. Schachner M. Stern C.D. Development. 1991; 112: 959-970PubMed Google Scholar). In brain, Lewis Xepitopes are expressed on the proteoglycan phosphacan, several glycolipids, and a number of cell adhesion molecules (3Allendoerfer K.L. Magnani J.L. Patterson P.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Streit A. Yuen C.-T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Finne J. Schmitz B. Feizi T. Stern C.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 834-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). LewisX antibodies reveal distinctive spatial and temporal patterns of expression that strongly suggest a role for LewisX epitopes in forebrain development (5Tole S. Kaprielian Z. Ou S.K. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 957-969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that correlate with patterns of selective calcium-dependent adhesion of cells taken from different telencephalic regions (6Gotz M. Wizenmann A. Reinhardt S. Lumsden A. Price J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 551-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Margolis and co-workers (7Finne J. Krusius T. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10295-10300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Krusius T. Finne J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8237-8242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to report the existence of Lewis X sequences linked to mannose in mammalian glycoconjugates. In studies of rat brain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans they found mannitol-containing oligosaccharides among the products of mild alkaline borohydride treatment. These were identified as small neutral and sialylated oligosaccharides attached to the proteoglycan by a 3-substituted mannose residue: GlcNAcβ1–3Man-Ser/Thr, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Man-Ser/Thr, and the LewisX sequence Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAcβ1–3 Man-Ser/Thr. No similar mannose-linked oligosaccharides were identified in mammalian tissues in the ensuing 10 years. Indeed, until recently, mannose-linked oligosaccharides were widely believed to be very rare constituents of brain proteoglycans. Within the past two years, however, it has become clear thatO-linked mannose is not as rare as previously thought and is present in glycoproteins as well as proteoglycans. Thus Endo and co-workers (9Chiba A. Matsumura K. Yamada H. Inazu T. Shimizu T. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Kobata A. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2156-2162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) have shown that bovine peripheral nerve α-dystroglycan is rich in sialylated oligosaccharides of sequence NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Man-Ser/Thr, whereas Feizi and co-workers (10Yuen C.T. Chai W. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Margolis R.U. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8924-8931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have found that the major HNK-1-immunoreactiveO-linked oligosaccharides from total rabbit brain extracts terminate with 2-substituted mannose (HSO3-3GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Man-Ser/Thr). This latter group also reported preliminary evidence for the presence of fucosylated oligosaccharides linked through mannose in the rabbit brain extracts. In this paper we identify the mucin-like extracellular matrix receptor cranin (dystroglycan) as an important glycoprotein carrier of O-linked mannosyloligosaccharides in the brain, and we provide evidence for sheep brain cranin having the same sialylatedO-linked mannose structure, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Man-Ser/Thr, as bovine peripheral nerve α-dystroglycan (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Importantly we also demonstrate a novel Lewis X-containing oligosaccharide (Gal1–4[Fuc1–3]GlcNAc1–2Man-Ser/Thr) as a minor neutral component of cranin glycans; this structure has not yet been localized upon any protein. Cranin was purified exactly as described previously (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and several of the same preparative runs characterized in the previous paper were also analyzed here. Briefly, sheep brains were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm pheylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, pH 7.6. Pellets were rinsed in high salt-urea solutions and solubilized in 2% Triton X-100 in TEA buffer1 (0.01 mtriethanolamine, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Extracts were incubated with DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, rinsed, and eluted in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, TEA buffer. DEAE eluates were adjusted to 1 mm in MnCl2, passed over a concanavalin A-lectin affinity column, rinsed, and eluted with 0.4 α-methyl-mannoside, 0.1% Triton X-100, TEA buffer. Concanavalin A eluates were passed over a Jacalin lectin affinity column and eluted with 0.8 m melibiose, 0.1% Triton X-100, TEA buffer. Jacalin eluates were passed over a laminin affinity column and eluted with 1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmEGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, TEA buffer. The laminin column eluates were treated to remove excess salt, passed over a laminin affinity column again, and eluted with 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, TEA buffer. Purified cranin gave two bands (corresponding to its alpha and beta subunits) on one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, as assessed by silver staining and lectin-blotting. The bands were confirmed as cranin (dystroglycan) by amino acid sequencing and immunoblotting with anti-peptide antibodies (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Removal of traces of contaminating detergent was achieved by acetone precipitation. Acetone (high performance liquid chromatography grade) was cooled to 4 °C. The cranin sample was dissolved in 1 ml of 5% acetic acid and placed on ice before adding 2 ml of cold acetone. After standing at 4 °C for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the precipitated cranin was used for the reductive elimination experiments described below. O-Glycans were released from 100 μg samples of cranin by reductive elimination (1m NaBH4 in 0.05 m NaOH at 45 °C for 16 h) and desalted through a Dowex 50W-X8(H) column. Excess borates were then removed by co-evaporation with 10% acetic acid in methanol under a stream of nitrogen. Permethylation using the sodium hydroxide procedure was performed as described (12Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). FAB mass spectra were acquired as described (12Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Collisionally activated decomposition (CAD) tandem mass spectrometry collision-activated decomposition spectra were recorded using a Fisons VG analytical four sector ZAB-T mass spectrometer in the array detector mode as described (13Khoo K-H. Sarda S. Xu X. Caulfield J.P. McNeil M.R. Homans S.W. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17114-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The reagent was prepared by bubbling dry HCl gas into methanol as described (12Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). After cooling, a 20-μl aliquot of this reagent was added to the permethylated sample at room temperature. 1-μl aliquots were removed at time points for FAB-MS analysis, and the remainder of the sample was dried under nitrogen. GC-MS analysis was carried out as described (13Khoo K-H. Sarda S. Xu X. Caulfield J.P. McNeil M.R. Homans S.W. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17114-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). O-Linked oligosaccharides were liberated from cranin by reductive elimination, and their methylated derivatives were characterized by FAB-MS before and after mild methanolysis and by linkage analysis. Because of the availability of only limited amounts of material, the oligosaccharides were analyzed as mixtures. Structural assignments were based on molecular weight and fragment ion information (the latter derived from CAD experiments on a tandem mass spectrometer as well as unassisted fragmentation in the normal FAB-MS experiment), susceptibility to mild methanolysis, and linkage data. The FAB spectrum of the methylated products of reductive elimination is shown in Fig. 1, and assignments are given in Table I. All assignments were corroborated by observing mass shifts after deuteromethylation (data not shown). The compositions in Table I suggest the presence of two families of O-glycans. Members of the first family have compositions Hex1HexNAc1-ol, NeuAc1Hex1HexNAc1-ol and NeuAc2Hex1HexNAc-ol, which are consistent with non-, mono- and disialylated type 1 cores ((±NeuAc-Galβ1–3(±NeuAc)GalNAc); note that anomeric configurations were not defined in our study because of limited material. CAD-MS/MS experiments on the mono- and disialylated molecular ions gave fragment ions consistent with this interpretation (data not shown). Data from linkage analysis (not shown) were also consistent with core type 1 structures being abundant. This is not unexpected because sialylated core type 1 structures are commonly found in mammalian glycoproteins. Members of the second family are of greater interest because their compositions are indicative of unusual hexose-rich core structures. This family has [M + H]+/[M + Na]+ quasimolecular ion pairs at m/z716/738, 890/912, and 1077/1099 corresponding to compositions (Hex2HexNAc1)-ol, (Fuc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol, and (NeuAc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol, respectively. Evidence for these glycans being attached to cranin via 2-substituted mannose was provided by the following experiments.Table IAssignments of molecular and fragment ions observed in FAB spectra of permethylated O-glycans from ovine craninSignalAssignmentm/z260HexNAc+344NeuAc+ minus methanol376NeuAc+464HexHexNAc+512(Hex1HexNAc1)-ol + H+534(Hex1HexNAc1)-ol + Na+716(Hex2HexNAc1)-ol + H+738(Hex2HexNAc1)-ol + Na+793NeuAcHexHexNAc+ minus methanol825NeuAcHexHexNAc+873(NeuAc1Hex1HexNAc1)-ol + H+890(Fuc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol + H+895(NeuAc1Hex1HexNAc1)-ol + Na+912(Fuc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol + Na+1077(NeuAc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol + H+1099(NeuAc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol + Na+1234(NeuAc2Hex1HexNAc1)-ol + H+1256(NeuAc2Hex1HexNAc1)-ol + Na+ Open table in a new tab Collisional activation of the [M + H]+ ions for (Hex2HexNAc1)-ol and (NeuAc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol gave major A-type fragment ions at m/z 464 (HexHexNAc+) and 825 (NeuAcHexHexNAc+), respectively, indicating that both oligosaccharides have hexitol at the proximal position (data not shown). Both m/z 464 and 825 were accompanied by secondary fragment ions 32 mass units lower (minus methanol). Formation of these ions requires the 3-position of the HexNAc to be unsubstituted. Collisional activation of the [M + Na]+ ion of (NeuAc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol,m/z 1099, gave the data shown in Fig. 2. It is known that ring fragmentation of permethylated oligosaccharides is enhanced and A-type fragmentation is reduced when [M + Na]+ quasimolecular ions are substituted for [M + H]+ in the CAD experiment (14Haslam S.M. Coles G.C. Munn E.A. Smith T.S. Smith H.F. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30561-30570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this instance, ring fragmentation of HexNAc (Fig. 2, inset), together with the A-type fragmentation data described earlier, provided unequivocal evidence for the sequence NeuAc-Hex-HexNAc-hexitol in which the HexNAc is 4-substituted. The structure of the oligosaccharide giving quasimolecular ions consistent with a fucosylated analogue of Hex-HexNAc-hexitol ([M + H]+/[M + Na]+ at m/z890/912, Fig. 1, Table I) was deduced from chemical and mass spectrometric degradation. The presence of fucose was confirmed by mild methanolysis of the methylated products of reductive elimination using conditions that are known to liberate fucose but not other potentially acid labile sugars such as sialic acids. In this experiment the methanolysis reagent is added to the sample at room temperature, and an aliquot was taken immediately for FAB analysis. Further aliquots are analyzed at intervals of 1 to 3 min, with the reaction being terminated by removal of the reagents under nitrogen as soon as the FAB data indicate a successful outcome of the experiment. Typically, 3-linked fucose residues are liberated within the first few minutes of methanolysis, whereas fucoses in other linkages are released more slowly. All [M + H]+ molecular ions observed before mild methanolysis (Table I) were preserved in the FAB spectrum taken after 3 min of methanolysis, with the notable exception of m/z 890 (Fig. 3). The disappearance of this ion correlated with the appearance of a new [M + H]+ signal at m/z 702, consistent with the loss of methylated fucose. It should be noted that analysis of the zero time point is important despite little chemical activity having occurred at this point. This is because the acidity of the reagent enhances A-type fragmentation, and the first aliquot may give fragment information additional to that found in the spectrum before addition of the reagent. Significantly the A-type ion atm/z 638 ([Fuc, Hex]-HexNAc+) was enhanced immediately after addition of the reagent (data not shown) and disappeared, concomitant with an increase of m/z450 ([(OH), Hex]-HexNAc+) after 3-min methanolysis (Fig. 3). Notably m/z 638 did not show a loss of methanol (m/z 606), indicating that the HexNAc has a substituent at position 3. Taking into account the molecular and fragment ion information as well as the rate of fucose release, these data suggest the sequence Hex-(Fuc1–3)HexNAc-hexitol form/z 890/912 (Fig. 1, Table I). This sequence was corroborated by CAD-MS/MS of the sodiated molecular ion (m/z 912) in the unmethanolyzed sample (Fig. 4, inset).Figure 4Positive ion CAD mass spectra of the sodiated molecular ion of (Fuc1Hex2HexNAc1)-ol.

A peak was observed in the GC chromatogram at the elution time of authentic 2-substituted mannitol. This gave the mass spectrum in Fig. 5, which is identical to that derived from linkage analysis of Manα1–2Man-ol (data not shown). The FAB and linkage data provide convincing evidence for the presence of both GalNAc- and Man-linked oligosaccharides in the cranin sample. Those linked through GalNAc have compositions consistent with type 1 structures with and without sialylation. The Man-linked oligosaccharides are assigned the following sequences: Gal1–4GlcNAc1–2Man-ol, NeuAc2–3Gal1–4GlcNAc1–2Man-ol, and Gal1–4(Fuc(1–3)GlcNAc1–2Man-ol. In addition it is probable that GlcNAc1–2Man-ol is present because terminal GlcNAc is observed in the linkage analysis (data not shown) and an A-type ion for HexNAc+ is present in the FAB spectra (Figs. 1 and 3). However, its abundance cannot be assessed because it is isobaric to Gal1–3GalNAc-ol, which is abundant in cranin. In the present paper, we (a) confirm the existence of Lewis X structures O-linked to mannose within the mammalian brain, (b) demonstrate that these structures are present not only on proteoglycans but on a well defined mucin-like glycoprotein as well, and (c) report studies suggesting that the linkages involved may be predominantly 2-linked to mannose. In the original study of Finne et al. (7Finne J. Krusius T. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10295-10300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mass spectroscopic data indicated that the linkage to mannose was either 1–2 or 1–3; based on fragment ion shifts upon deuteration, they concluded that a 1–2 linkage was unlikely (7Finne J. Krusius T. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10295-10300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in our studies and in the recent studies of glycoproteins performed by others (9Chiba A. Matsumura K. Yamada H. Inazu T. Shimizu T. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Kobata A. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2156-2162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 10Yuen C.T. Chai W. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Margolis R.U. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8924-8931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the mannose residue has been clearly 2-substituted. Moreover, it is interesting to note that each 3-substituted mannosyloligosaccharide identified by Margolis and co-workers (7Finne J. Krusius T. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10295-10300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Krusius T. Finne J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8237-8242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in proteoglycans has now been shown to have its 2-substituted mannosyl counterpart in brain glycoproteins. A reassessment of proteoglycans may be warranted to confirm whether they contain 3-substituted mannose, in contrast to the predominance of 2-substituted mannose in glycoprotein-linked species. In previous studies, neither we (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) nor Yamada et al. (15Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Hori H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. Matsumura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) detected Lewis X epitopes on cranin (dystroglycan) by immunoblotting with Lewis X antibodies. Antibody binding might not have been sensitive enough to detect minor constituents; alternatively, antibody binding might have been inhibited by steric hindrance within regions of highly clustered mucin-like saccharides, particularly when the epitope is located relatively close to the peptide linkage site. Cranin (dystroglycan) is a widely expressed extracellular matrix receptor synthesized as a single precursor that is cleaved into an extracellular subunit (α) and a transmembrane subunit (β) (Ref. 16Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J. Leveille C. Slaughter C. Sernett S. Campbell K. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 17Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The α-subunit is highly glycosylated and exhibits high affinity calcium-dependent binding to a set of matrix proteins including laminins, agrin, and perlecan (16Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.

The carbohydrate moieties of cranin have become the focus of heightened attention as being critical for regulating the functions of this protein. (a) High affinity binding of laminin to the α-subunit appears to be carbohydrate-dependent, since it is destroyed by treatments that oxidize carbohydrate moieties on cranin or deglycosylate the core protein and is competitively inhibited by a specific series of free saccharides (23Smalheiser N.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). There is also an indication that multivalent interactions are involved in binding, as is typical for carbohydrate-mediated recognition (23Smalheiser N.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis, that the N-terminal globular domain is sufficient to mediate binding to laminin (25Brancaccio A. Schulthess T. Gesemann M. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is unlikely since bacterially expressed recombinant N-terminal globular domain fails to bind laminin with high affinity (26Brancaccio A. Schulthess T. Gesemann M. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 246: 166-172Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (b) Cranin (dystroglycan) exhibits extensive tissue-specific heterogeneity, due to differential glycosylation of the same core protein (16Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J. Leveille C. Slaughter C. Sernett S. Campbell K. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 17Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin.

Skeletal muscle and brain forms both bind laminin and merosin but exhibit tissue-specific differences in affinity (27Gesemann M. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 600-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and in the extent of inhibition by heparin (28Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3817-3821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). (c) Peptide sequence analyses have predicted the existence of a discrete mucin-like domain within the α-subunit (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cranin isolated from sheep brain is highly susceptible toO-sialoglycoprotease, an enzyme that attacks mucin-like glycoproteins (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Its lectin binding profile indicates the presence of heterogeneous N- and O-linked saccharides including O-glycanase-resistant, neuraminidase-resistantO-linked saccharides (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The chemical studies of Chibaet al. (9Chiba A. Matsumura K. Yamada H. Inazu T. Shimizu T.

We have recently noted that the peptide sequence of dystroglycan predicts the existence of amphipathic helices near the N terminus and C terminus of the α subunit (29Smalheiser, N. R. (1998) Cell Adhes. Commun., in pressGoogle Scholar); similar amphipathic helices have been described in a variety of other mucin-like glycoproteins associated with the cell surface, including GlyCAM-1 and densin-180 (30Dowbenko D.

(d) It was initially expected that dystroglycan would prove to be a proteoglycan (hence the name); however, despite the efforts of many groups, no one has yet demonstrated that glycosaminoglycan chains are expressed (see detailed discussion in Ref. 11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For example, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, several different glycosaminoglycan-deficient mutant lines express dystroglycan that is indistinguishable from wild type in abundance, mobility, and ability to bind laminin (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, cranin (dystroglycan) is demonstrably similar to typical mucin-like glycoproteins in many ways and does not resemble proteoglycans previously found to bear Lewis X epitopes. We do not feel that mannose-linked Lewis X structures are likely to be sufficient for mediating the direct binding of laminin to cranin, since preliminary experiments failed to detect significant high affinity binding between mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm laminin and multivalent Lewis X conjugated to polyacrylamide polymers. 2N. Smalheiser, unpublished observations. Rather, mannose-linked Lewis X is the latest in an increasing list of oligosaccharide recognition tags that have been shown to be expressed on cranin (dystroglycan) purified from brain (11Smalheiser N.R. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15425-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), including high mannose/hydrid structures, HNK-1 epitopes, terminal GalNAc residues as well as mannose-linked sialyllactosamine (Ref. 9Chiba A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2156-2162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar and this paper). At least some of these tags contribute to tissue-specific heterogeneity; for example, within dystroglycan purified from muscle, HNK-1 epitopes are presumed absent (32Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and terminal GalNAc residues are masked by sialylation (33Ervasti J.M. Burwell A.L. Geissler A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22315-22321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These tissue-specific tags may be involved in modulating the fine specificity of binding to matrix proteins or may be mediating other recognition events entirely (9Chiba A. Matsumura K. Yamada H.

For example, it is noteworthy that Lewis X has been implicated in cell-cell adhesion in both neural and nonneural tissues (1Eggens I. Fenderson B. Toyokuni T. Dean B. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Roberts C. Platt N. Streit A. Schachner M. Stern C.D. Development. 1991; 112: 959-970PubMed Google Scholar), in view of the observation that cranin (dystroglycan) can be facultatively recruited to sites of cell-cell contact (22Belkin A.M. Smalheiser N.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). If such a recruitment should occur in cells whose cranin expresses Lewis X structures, the latter would thereby be recruited to the contact site as well."
https://openalex.org/W2015784513,"The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major inflammatory hormone which activates a broad range of genes during inflammation. The signaling mechanisms triggered by IL-1 include activation of several distinct protein kinase systems. The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), also termed Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), is activated particularly strongly by the cytokine. In an attempt to delineate its role in activation of gene expression by IL-1, we inhibited the IL-1-induced SAPK/JNK activity by stable overexpression of either a catalytically inactive mutant of SAPKβ (SAPKβ(K-R)) or antisense RNA to SAPKβ in human epidermal carcinoma cells. A detailed analysis of signal transduction in those cells showed that activation of neither NFκB nor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was affected, suggesting that we achieved specific blockade of the SAPK/JNK. In untransfected and vector-transfected KB cells, IL-1 induced a strong increase in expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA, along with the synthesis of high amounts of the proteins. In two KB cell clones stably overexpressing the mutant SAPKβ(K-R), and three clones stably overexpressing antisense RNA to SAPKβ, expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in response to IL-1 was strongly reduced at both the mRNA and protein level. These data indicate that the SAPK/JNK pathway provides an indispensable signal for IL-1-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1)1 is the prototype inflammatory cytokine. It is produced in two forms (α and β) by activated monocytes/macrophages during acute or chronic inflammatory responses. It acts by inducing many genes, including cytokines (e.g. IL-2 and IL-6), chemokines (e.g.IL-8 and MCP-1), proteases (e.g. collagenase and stromelysin), adhesion molecules (e.g. ICAM-1 and E-selectin), and cyclooxygenase. Strength and duration of the expression of these genes is crucial for the intensity of an inflammatory process (reviewed in Ref. 1Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore much interest has focused on molecular mechanisms through which these genes are controlled by IL-1. Two IL-1 receptors have been cloned (type I and type II) that are expressed on many different cell types (2Martin M.U. Falk W. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 5-17PubMed Google Scholar). Only the type I receptor, heterodimerized to the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, is capable of signal transduction (3Wesche H. Korherr C. Kracht M. Falk W. Resch K. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7727-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Recently the understanding of IL-1 signaling pathways has been markedly increased by identification of novel molecules. IL-1 treatment of cells can activate at least four protein kinase cascades. One cascade involves association of an IL-1 receptor-associated protein kinase and TRAF6 with the IL-1 receptor complex (4Cao Z. Henzel W. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 5Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar), leading to activation of an NFκB-inducing kinase (6Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), which activates the IκB kinase complex. Phosphorylated IκB is ubiquitinated, then degraded by the proteasome. This releases NFκB, a major transcription factor regulating IL-1 responsive genes, and allows it to translocate to the nucleus (7Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The other cascades activated by IL-1 are those activating the three best known types of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), namely p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and the stress-activated protein kinase that phosphorylates the N-terminal region of c-Jun (SAPK/JNK) (9Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Although IL-1 has been shown to activate ERK in some cells (10Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Marshall C.J. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14343-14352Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), it is a much more potent inducer of SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK in cultured cells (12Kracht M. Shiroo M. Marshall C.J. Hsuan J.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J.J. Saklatvala J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). A central role of SAPK/JNK for IL-1 signaling is suggested by our finding that IL-1 activates it and its activator, MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7), in rabbit liver in vivo, without activating either p38 MAPK or ERK (15Finch A. Holland P.M. Cooper J. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ten different SAPK isoforms derived from three different genes (called SAPK α, β, and γ in rat and JNK 2, 3, and 1 in man, respectively), which are highly conserved across species, have been cloned from vertebrate tissues (16Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 17Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The homology among SAPK/JNK isoforms is 80–90% on the protein level (18Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A., J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). We purified a 46-kDa form of SAPK/JNK activated by IL-1 from KB cells, and 50- and 55-kDa forms from rabbit liver. They accounted for essentially all of the biochemically detectable IL-1-activated JNK activity in liver and were both identified as SAPKα (JNK2) by amino acid sequencing a number of peptides. This suggested that SAPK/JNK isoforms might be expressed or activated in a tissue-specific manner (19Kracht M. Truongh O. Totty N.F. Shiroo M. Saklatvala J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2017-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The functional consequence of general activation of SAPK/JNK, or of the individual isoforms, on the regulation of IL-1 responsive genes is unclear (20Force T. Pombo C.M. Avruch J.A. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). SAPK/JNK have been shown to phosphorylate the proteins c-Jun and ATF-2, which are components of the dimeric transcription factor AP-1. These phosphorylations result in enhanced transcription of AP-1-dependent reporter genes (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). Besides phosphorylating the activation domains of the transcription factors, SAPK/JNK isoforms bind Jun and ATF-2 proteins with different affinities, a mechanism which could result in targeting them to different intracellular substrates and to exert distinct functions (18Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A., J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 25Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K.

Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Although AP-1 can be considered to be a principal target of SAPK/JNK, other transcription factors, like the ternary complex factors ELK-1 and SAP-1, are also substrates (28Zinck R.

In an attempt to elucidate the function of IL-1-induced activation of SAPK/JNK in the human keratinocyte line KB, we stably overexpressed either an inactive mutant of the enzyme or antisense RNA. This allowed us to study the role of SAPK/JNK on endogenous gene expression. We investigated the role of SAPK/JNK in the regulation of IL-6 and IL-8, two cytokines which are highly inducible by IL-1 in keratinocytes. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that promotes B-cell growth and differentiation and stimulates acute-phase protein synthesis in liver (32Hirano T. Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). IL-8 is a chemokine attracting and stimulating leukocytes at sites of inflammation (33Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We report here that inhibition of SAPK/JNK activation in cells stimulated by IL-1 results in inhibition of IL-1-induced IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression. KB cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. Human recombinant IL-1 α was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified as described (12Kracht M. Shiroo M. Marshall C.J. Hsuan J.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). E64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane), pepstatin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and all other chemicals were from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from Hartmann Analytics, Braunschweig, Germany. Expression plasmids for GST-Jun (amino acids 1–135) and GST p54 SAPKβ were kind gifts of Dr. J. R. Woodgett, The Ontario Cancer Research Institute, Toronto, Canada. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli by standard methods. Recombinant bacterially expressed histidine (His) epitope-tagged MAPK activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2) was a kind gift of Dr. M. Gaestel (Max-Delbrueck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany). The chicken anti-p54 SAPKβ antibodies were produced by immunizing chicken with recombinant GST p54 SAPKβ and immunoglobulins were purified from eggs. Besides the p54 SAPKβ (which is identical to human JNK3), the antibodies also recognize purified rabbit SAPKα and the human JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms in cells transiently transfected with the respective cDNA, 2M. Kracht, unpublished observation. and proteins of corresponding sizes in human mesangial cells (34Uciechowski P. Saklatvala J. von der Ohe J. Resch K. Szamel M. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum to p38 MAPK was to synthetic peptide ISFVPPPLDQEEMES (amino acids 346–360). Rabbit anti-chicken IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase was from Sigma. cDNAs for IL-6 (1100 bp), IL-8 (700 bp), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1400 bp) were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Fast Flow S Sepharose, Protein A, and glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose were from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden. The cDNA encoding the open reading frame of p54 SAPKβ was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the following primer pairs (sense, 5′-gcgcggatccagcaaaagcaaggtagataa-3′; antisense, 5′-gcgcggatcccctgcaacaacccagcg-3′) using the GST p54 SAPKβ plasmid as template. Introduction of a point mutation in subdomain II (L55R) was done by the overlapping primer method using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and the primer (5′-gctgagcttcctaatcgcgacatttctgtcgaggacagcg-3′). The resulting p54 SAPKβ(K-R) cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI site of peVRF0HA (35Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in sense or antisense orientation. Sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. KB cells were transfected with the cationic lipid Dosper (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and 1 μg of peVRFOHA-SAPKβ(K-R) and 1 μg of the pCDNA3 vector encoding the neomycin resistance gene (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands). Vector-transfected cells were obtained by co-transfection with peVRF0HA and pCDNA3. Stably transfected cells were selected by incubation with 600 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and pooled. Single cell clones from those pools were generated by limited dilution (0.1 cells/well) in 96-well plates and cultured in conditioned medium. SAPKβ(K-R) sense and antisense RNA overexpressing cell clones were maintained without G418. Vector-transfected cells were maintained in 300 μg/ml G418. Confluent KB cells were stimulated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) added to the culture medium. After 15 min at 37 °C, the medium was removed, cells placed on ice, washed once in PBS, and scraped in PBS. Cells were collected at 500 ×g for 5 min and lysed in whole cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 30 mm NaPPi, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate and freshly added 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate, 400 nm okadaic acid). After 10 min on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of supernatants was determined by the method of Bradford and samples stored at −80 °C. KB cells were stimulated with IL-1, washed, and scraped in PBS at 4 °C as described above. Collected cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, and feshly added 200 μm leupeptin, 10 μmE64, 300 μm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mmDTT, 400 nm okadaic acid, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and vortexed. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, supernatants were taken as cytosolic extracts and frozen. Pellets were resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μm leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 300 μm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm DTT, 400 nm okadaic acid). After 1 h on ice nuclear extracts were cleared at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and supernatants frozen at −80 °C. The assay was performed as described (36Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treismann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl containing 30 μg of whole cell extract or 10 μg of cytosolic extract protein were incubated with 10 μl of GST-Jun (1 μg) and 10 μl of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 60 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [32P]ATP). After 15 min at room temperature 20 μl of GSH beads, equilibrated in lysis buffer + 1 mm DTT, were added. Samples were shaken for 30 min at room temperature. Beads were recovered at 10,000 × g for 5 min and washed twice in 200 μl of whole cell lysis buffer. Bound GST-Jun was eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (8% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 24% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Equal recovery of GST-Jun was confirmed by Coomassie staining. Phosphorylated GST-Jun was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager and the Molecular Analyst Program (Bio-Rad). 500 μg of whole cell extract protein was diluted in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 154 mm NaCl, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100). 2 μl of rabbit anti-p38 MAPK antiserum were added for 2 h at 4 °C. Then 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose, equilibrated in IP buffer was added. After 1 h at 4 °C beads were spun down at 10,000 × g for 5 min, washed three times in 500 μl of IP buffer, and resuspended in 10 μl of IP buffer. Then 10 μl of HIS-MAPKAPK-2 (750 ng) and 10 μl of kinase buffer (see above) were added. After 20 min at room temperature assays were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged, and proteins separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. KB cells were stimulated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min, washed, and scraped in ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm E64, and 1 μmpepstatin). Cells were broken by passaging them three times through a 26-gauge needle. Cytosolic extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. 1 mg of cytosolic protein was brought to pH 6.0 by adding 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, and loaded on a 0.5-ml Fast Flow S Sepharose cation exchange chromatography column equilibrated in buffer C (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). The column was washed in buffer C and proteins eluted with 4 × 0.75 ml of buffer C including 0.6 m NaCl. To the fractions were added 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μm pepstatin. Fractions were stored at −80 °C. 15 μl of the first two 0.6 m NaCl fractions were incubated with 15 μl of GST p54 SAPKβ (1 μg) in 15 μl of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP) for 30 min at room temperature. Then 20 μl of GSH beads equilibrated in lysis buffer were added and samples shaken for 15 min. Beads with bound GST SAPKβ were collected by microcentrifugation, washed twice in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and resuspended in 10 μl of lysis buffer. 10 μl of GST-Jun (1 μg) and 10 μl kinase buffer including 4 μCi of [32P]ATP were added for 15 min. Assays were stopped with SDS sample buffer, boiled, microcentrifuged, and proteins separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. GST-SAPKβ and GST-Jun were visualized by Coomassie staining of gels and phosphorylation analyzed by autoradiography. Extracts of nuclear proteins were prepared as described above. Protein DNA-binding reactions, preparation, and labeling of the oligonucleotide used for measurement of NFκB activity were carried out exactly as described (37Brigelius-Flohe R. Bilgin B. Eickemeier S. Hipskind R. Singh M. Szamel M. Resch K. BioFactors. 1996; 9: 1-6Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. KB cells were stimulated for 1–30 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1 or left untreated for 1 and 30 h. Cells were scraped and washed in PBS and total RNA prepared using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 10 μg of RNA was separated by denaturing 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium acetate, 6.8% formaldehyde. RNA was blotted onto nitrocellulose Hybond-N membranes (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and incubated in pre-hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 4 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 5% dextran-sulfate, 20 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA) for 2 h at 42 °C. 25 ng of IL-6, IL-8 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs were labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP using a commercial kit (Amersham) and incubated for 22 h with the membranes at 42 °C in pre-hybridization buffer. Membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC, incubated 15 min in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 15 min in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 62 °C. Blots were then autoradiographed. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (ImmobilonR, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) overnight. Membranes were then incubated for 4–24 h with chicken anti-p54 SAPKβ antibodies, washed in TBS, and incubated for 2–4 h with the peroxidase-coupled second antibody. Proteins were detected using the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence system. Autoradiographs were scanned with the GelDoc100system and quantitated with the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad). 2.5 × 106 KB cells were trypsinized and seeded onto six-well plates with 1 ml of culture medium. One day later medium was replaced and cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1 for 24 h or left untreated. The medium was recovered, cells collected by a 500 ×g centrifugation and the medium stored at −20 °C. Cells were resuspended in PBS and counted. Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-6 and IL-8 were performed in duplicates exactly to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham) and cytokine release normalized for cell number. In our efforts to identify a functional role of SAPK/JNK in IL-1-induced gene expression, we followed approaches that have been used successfully to demonstrate a role for the p42/p44 MAPK cascade in growth factor-regulated fibroblast proliferation;i.e. stable overexpression of MAPKK mutants (38Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelmann H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). We constructed a mutant rat p54 SAPKβ cDNA, in which a lysine residue critical for kinase activity was replaced by arginine. This lysine residue is highly conserved in the protein kinase family (40Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar) and is involved in ATP binding of the p42 MAPK (ERK2) as shown by structural studies (41Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of the SAPKβ(K-R) mutant was placed 5′ to the hemagglutinin (HA)-tag sequence under the control of a cytomegalovirus promotor. KB cells were stably transfected with the construct or the vector alone. Cell clones were analyzed by Western blotting using chicken egg antibodies that were raised against bacterially expressed full-length GST-p54 SAPKβ protein. Thereby we identified six KB cell clones overexpressing the SAPKβ mutant. Western blot detection of two of these is shown in Fig. 1 A. Both clones strongly overexpressed the transfected protein, compared with the endogenous SAPK/JNK. Identity of the HA-SAPKβ(K-R) band was confirmed by detection of a product of identical size with anti-HA tag antibodies (not shown). As expected from their high homology to each other, different SAPK/JNK isoforms are recognized by the chicken anti-SAPKβ antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the KB cells they detected several endogenous JNK isoforms which appear as two doublet bands of about 45 to 48 kDa and 54 to 57 kDa. As detailed by Gupta et al.(18Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A., J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), the JNK 1 and JNK 2 genes each can give rise to differently spliced transcripts which encode proteins of 46 and 55 kDa. The JNK 3 gene transcripts apparently are translated into two doublets of 45–48 kDa and 54–57 kDa, due to partial usage of an additional upstream-located start codon (18Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A., J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Thus while it is not possible to unequivocally assign each product to a specific isoform, the observed pattern is in close accordance with that reported in Ref. 18Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A., J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar. All four bands were confirmed to represent different SAPK isoforms, since we observed protein kinases of corresponding sizes in in-gel kinase assays with GST-Jun as substrate. 3M. Kracht, data not shown.Three proteins of higher M r on SDS-PAGE were not related to SAPK activity and represent proteins reacting nonspecifically with the chicken egg immunoglobulin. On the cDNA level sequence comparison between the 1.3-kilobase open reading frames of SAPKβ and those of JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 revealed a homology of 78, 74, and 91%, respectively. Therefore, overexpression of the full-length open reading frame in antisense orientation was likely to hybridize to all JNK mRNAs present in KB cells and inhibit their translation. In fact, suppression of similarly related proteins has been demonstrated in a study where a 1.75-kilobase antisense fragment of the ERK1 gene inhibited both, the expression of ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms (39Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The homology of ERK1 and ERK2 is comparable to that between the JNK isoforms. We isolated several clones stably overexpressing antisense RNA. Endogenous SAPK/JNK protein levels in three of those clones and in untransfected KB cells were compared by Western blot. The bands corresponding to endogenous JNK isoforms were all significantly reduced in all three clones (Fig. 1 B). The abundance of three cross-reacting proteins of higher molecularM r on SDS-PAGE was not reduced. According to densitometric quantitation the amounts JNK proteins in the three different clones were 24, 54, and 28% of the amount in control cells. We next investigated whether overexpression of the kinase-inactive SAPKβ had a dominant negative effect and interfered with SAPK/JNK activity induced by IL-1. Kinase activity was determined in vitro using GST-Jun (amino acids 1–135) as substrate. The Jun protein was then purified from the reaction mixture by adsorption to GSH beads. This assay allowed quantitative measurement of SAPK/JNK activity in the presence of both endogenous SAPK isoforms and the SAPKβ mutant. In whole cell lysates of clones overexpressing SAPKβ(K-R), IL-1-mediated stimulation of total SAPK/JNK activity was decreased by about 50% (Fig. 2 A). A comparable degree of inhibition was observed when kinase activity was analyzed in cytosolic extracts of the cells (Fig. 2 B). No apparent differences were observed in the kinetics of the IL-1 induced transient SAPK/JNK activation in clones 2 and 11 compared with untransfected or vector-transfected KB cells. After 60 min of IL-1 treatment Jun kinase activity was down-regulated irrespective of the presence of SAPKβ(K-R) (Fig. 2 B). In agreement with this, the expression of MKP-1, a highly specific MAPK phosphatase implicated in down-regulation of SAPK/JNK (42Hirsch D.D. Stork P.J.S"

The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Here we show that the binding of calcineurin to NFAT is substantially increased when calcineurin is activated with calmodulin and calcium. FK506·FKBP12 drug-immunophilin complexes inhibited the interaction of NFAT with activated calcineurin much more effectively than they inhibited the interaction with inactive calcineurin, suggesting that part of the interaction with activated calcineurin involved the enzyme active site. We have previously shown that NFAT is targeted to inactive calcineurin at a region distinct from the calcineurin active site (Aramburu, J., Garcia-Cozar, F. J., Raghavan, A., Okamura, H., Rao, A., and Hogan, P. G. (1998)Mol. Cell 1, 627–637); this region is also involved in NFAT binding to activated calcineurin, since binding is inhibited by an NFAT peptide spanning the calcineurin docking site on NFAT. The interacting surfaces are located on the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A chain and on an 86-amino acid fragment of the NFAT regulatory domain. NFAT binding to the calcineurin catalytic domain was inhibited by the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain and the RII substrate peptide, which bind in the calcineurin active site, as well as by the NFAT docking site peptide, which binds to a region of calcineurin distinct from the active site. We propose that, in resting cells, NFAT is targeted to a region of the calcineurin catalytic domain that does not overlap the calcineurin active site. Upon cell activation, displacement of the autoinhibitory domain by calmodulin binding allows NFAT to bind additionally to the calcineurin active site, thus positioning NFAT for immediate dephosphorylation at functional phosphoserine residues.

Calmodulin binding to this disordered region is presumed to displace the autoinhibitory domain from the calcineurin active site, thus permitting the access of substrates to the active site. The clinically important immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, have long been known to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and NFAT activation, primarily because of their ability to inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin toward phosphoprotein substrates (reviewed in Refs. 34Schreiber S.L.

CsA and FK506 do not inhibit calcineurin activity directly, but form inhibitory complexes with intracellular receptors, known as immunophilins, that are present at high abundance in all cells; the immunophilin receptors for CsA are known as cyclophilins (CyPs), while those for FK506 are known as FK-binding proteins or FKBPs. The structures of human and bovine calcineurin, in complex with FK506·FKBP12, have been solved: the drug-immunophilin complex binds to the calcineurin B-binding α-helix of the calcineurin A chain and inhibits calcineurin by an indirect mechanism (32Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E.

Here we show that NFAT proteins interact more strongly with calmodulin-activated than inactive calcineurin. Two regions of calcineurin are implicated in the interaction, both of which are located on the calcineurin catalytic domain. One of these is a targeting region complementary to a region we have recently defined as the docking site for calcineurin on NFAT (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), while the second is a region overlapping the active site that is preferentially exposed in activated calmodulin-bound calcineurin. Based on our data, we suggest that NFAT proteins are targeted to calcineurin in resting cells, and that they make an additional interaction with the active site of calcineurin in activated cells. Our results have implications for the regulation of NFAT by calcineurin in resting and activated cells, and for the development of new types of immunosuppressive drugs. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins GST-LSF, GST-human (h) NFAT1 (1–415), GST-hNFAT2 (1–418), and GST-hNFAT4 (11–419) (abbreviated GST-NFAT1, GST-NFAT2, and so forth) have been described (27Aramburu J.

The hexahistidine-tagged NFAT1(1–415) was generated by subcloning the coding region for the 415 N-terminal amino acids of NFAT1 into the pQE32 vector (Qiagen). Hexahistidine-tagged NFAT1 truncation mutants were generated by a polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pQE vectors (Qiagen). Recombinant bacterially expressed human calcineurin and human FKBP12 were prepared as described previously (32Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J.

The recombinant catalytic domain of human calcineurin (CnCAT), incorporating a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus, was made by expressing amino acids 1–347 in bacteria. The recombinant bacterially expressed His151 → Ala mutant of human calcineurin A was coexpressed with calcineurin B in the pET-15b vector, and was a kind gift of Dr. Jun Liu (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) (39Mondragon A.

For some experiments the RII peptide was purchased from Bachem Fine Chemicals, Switzerland. The polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against the autoinhibitory peptide has been described (13Loh C.

Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem. Calcineurin or the calcineurin catalytic domain (CnCat) (∼100 μg) was iodinated with 1 mCi carrier-free Na125I (NEN Life Science Products) using IODO-BEADs (Pierce), then separated from free Na125I on a Sephadex G-25 spin column Biospin 6 (Bio-Rad) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Specific activities ranged from 150 to 600 cpm/fmol. Identical results were obtained whether recombinant human calcineurin or bovine calcineurin (Sigma) were used in the binding assay. In some experiments, calcineurin binding to GST proteins was assessed by Western blotting as described previously (13Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol.

For 125I-calcineurin binding to GST fusion proteins, equivalent amounts of GST-NFAT or GST-LSF fusion proteins were immobilized on gluthathione-Sepharose beads by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Tris phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were washed, resuspended in binding buffer, and incubated with125I-calcineurin for 30 min at 4 °C. Binding of calcineurin to hexahistidine-tagged NFAT proteins was assessed after binding them to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen); in these experiments 30 mm imidazole was added to the binding reaction and to the washes to prevent nonspecific binding of calcineurin to the nickel beads. Background binding of calcineurin to the nickel beads is shown in all such experiments. Final concentrations of 200 μm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 500 nm calmodulin were used unless otherwise noted. Where indicated, CsA·CyPA and FK506·FKBP12 complexes, formed by incubation of equimolar concentrations (40–400 μm) of the drugs with the immunophilins for 1 h on ice, were added at the indicated final concentrations to the binding reaction. The RII, autoinhibitory, and control peptides were used at final concentrations of 200 μm. SPRIEIT and SPAIAIA peptides were used at the indicated final concentrations. After incubation, individual binding reactions were filtered through a 5-μm hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore) using a vacuum manifold (Millipore) to separate bound and unbound 125I-calcineurin. Filters were washed rapidly under continuous suction with 24 ml of 50 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100. Washed filters were transferred to tubes and 125I-calcineurin retained by the immobilized GST or hexahistidine-tagged proteins was quantified in a Hewlett Packard Gammacounter. We measured the binding of125I-calcineurin to GST fusion proteins containing the first 415 and 418 amino acids of NFAT1 and NFAT2, respectively. We have previously shown that these N-terminal regions of NFAT proteins are sufficient for calcineurin binding (13Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl.

Preliminary experiments (not shown) indicated that peak levels of 125I-calcineurin binding were attained by 30 min, and that binding was linear with the amount of GST-NFAT protein used. Using this assay, we showed that the binding of125I-calcineurin to NFAT1 and NFAT2 was markedly dependent on the presence of calcium and calmodulin (Fig. 1). In the absence of calcium (i.e. in buffer containing 5 mm EGTA), a low but significant level of binding was observed (Fig. 1 A, open bars). Note that this low level of binding had not previously been detected by Western blotting (13Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), confirming that the binding assay using iodinated calcineurin was significantly more sensitive. In the presence of 100 μm calcium, there was a substantial increase in calcineurin binding to NFAT1 (not shown) and NFAT2 (Fig. 1, A and B, gray bars), consistent with our earlier results using Western blot analysis (13Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,15Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A.

When calmodulin was included in the binding reaction, the level of binding was again reproducibly increased, by a further 2–5-fold depending on the batch of iodinated calcineurin (Fig. 1, Aand B, hatched bars). As expected from the known calcium requirement for calmodulin to bind and activate calcineurin, calmodulin had no effect on the NFAT-calcineurin association in the absence of calcium (Fig. 1 A, black bars). Neither calcium nor calmodulin had any effect on the background binding of calcineurin to the unrelated DNA-binding protein LSF (Fig. 1 A, right), emphasizing the specificity of the NFAT-calcineurin association. To determine the region of NFAT1 involved in binding calcineurin, we tested a series of systematic truncations of the NFAT1 regulatory domain, expressed as hexahistidine-tagged proteins in bacteria. These experiments identified an 86-amino acid fragment, NFAT1(97–183), which bound calcineurin as effectively as the original NFAT1(1–415) recombinant protein (Fig. 2). A shorter fragment, NFAT1(97–144), was also able to bind calcineurin in a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent fashion, but binding was decreased by comparison with NFAT1(1–415) or NFAT1(97–183). These results indicate that the 86-amino acid fragment, NFAT(97–183), contains the region of NFAT involved in calcineurin interaction. This fragment contains the sequence 110SPRIEITPS118, which we have recently shown represents a docking site for calcineurin on NFAT1 (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Indeed the docking sequence is present in both short NFAT1 fragments, (97–144) and (97–183), that are capable of binding to calcineurin, but absent in NFAT1(1–96) and (140–415), which show little or no calcineurin binding, confirming that the docking sequence makes a major contribution to the NFAT-calcineurin interaction and that regions outside the 87-amino acid fragment NFAT1(97–183) do not interact effectively with calcineurin. To define the region of calcineurin involved in NFAT binding, we generated a recombinant calcineurin containing only the catalytic domain (residues 1–347) of human calcineurin A (CnCAT). Despite lacking the calcineurin B-binding helix, the calmodulin-binding region and the autoinhibitory domain, this protein showed substantial binding to NFAT (Fig. 3). Binding of 125I-CnCAT to GST-NFAT was equivalent in the presence and absence of calcium (Fig. 3 A), consistent with the expectation that CnCAT should not need calcium or the calcineurin B chain to assume a stable protein conformation. Binding of 125I-CnCAT to GST-NFAT was also equivalent in the presence and absence of calmodulin (Fig. 3 B), consistent with the fact that CnCAT lacks the autoinhibitory region and the calmodulin-binding domain. Finally, binding of 125I-CnCAT to GST-NFAT proteins was unaffected by drug-immunophilin complexes (Fig. 3 C), which are not expected to bind CnCAT since they bind to the CnB-binding helix of the calcineurin A-calcineurin B heterodimer, which is lacking in CnCAT. The use of inhibitory peptides defined two distinct regions for NFAT interaction with the calcineurin catalytic domain. The RII substrate peptide and the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain peptide, both of which bind to the calcineurin active site in their unphosphorylated forms, caused significant but partial inhibition of CnCAT binding to NFAT, indicating that at least part of the binding involved a region close to the calcineurin active site (Fig. 3 D). Additionally, binding was inhibited by the SPRIEIT-25 peptide spanning the calcineurin docking site of NFAT1 (Fig. 3 E), indicating that the complementary surface on calcineurin that interacts with the NFAT SPRIEIT sequence is present within the calcineurin catalytic domain. Because the SPRIEIT peptides do not inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the docking region for NFAT on calcineurin is distinct from the calcineurin active site. Thus NFAT binding to the calcineurin catalytic domain involves at least two regions, the docking site on NFAT that was first defined using inactive calcineurin (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and a region overlapping the calcineurin active site that is constitutively exposed in the calcineurin catalytic domain. In the following sections we show that these same regions are involved in the interaction of NFAT with calmodulin-activated calcineurin. The SPAIAIA mutation in the SPRIEIT docking sequence (R112A, E114A, T116A) impaired not only the basal binding of NFAT1 to inactive calcineurin in the absence of calmodulin (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but also the calmodulin-dependent binding of activated calcineurin to NFAT (Fig. 4 A). Moreover the peptides SPRIEIT-25 and SPRIEIT-13 spanning 25 and 13 residues of this docking sequence competed the binding of activated calcineurin to NFAT1(1–415), whereas the peptide SPAIAIA-25, which incorporated the inactivating mutations, did not (Fig. 4 A). The concentration of SPRIEIT peptides required for half-maximal inhibition of the binding of activated calcineurin to NFAT1 was ∼25 μm (Fig. 4 A), compared with the ∼12 μm required for half-maximal inhibition of the binding of inactive calcineurin to NFAT (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The binding of activated calcineurin to NFAT2 and NFAT4 was also inhibited by the SPRIEIT peptides (Fig. 4 B) with an IC50 of ∼50 μm, again a higher concentration than necessary to inhibit the binding of inactive calcineurin to these proteins (IC50 of ∼25 μm) (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). SPRIEIT peptides were also able to inhibit binding of active and inactive calcineurin to the short NFAT1 fragment (97–183) (data not shown). To determine whether NFAT binding to active calcineurin involved the calcineurin active site, we tested the effect of FK506·FKBP12 complexes on the binding of active (calmodulin-dependent) and inactive calcineurin to NFAT1(97–183). In both cases binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the drug-immunophilin complexes, but the extent of inhibition was much greater in the case of active compared with inactive calcineurin (∼80% versus ∼50% inhibition at 10 μm FK506·FKBP12) (Fig. 5, compare panels A and B). Moreover, approximately 10-fold higher concentrations of FK506·FKBP12 were required to achieve equivalent inhibition of inactive versus active calcineurin (i.e. 0.1 μm FK506·FKBP12 sufficed to inhibit binding of active calcineurin by 30%, whereas 1 μm FK506·FKBP12 was required for equivalent inhibition of binding of inactive calcineurin to NFAT; compare Fig. 5, A and B). The immunophilins CyPA and FKBP12 had no effect on the NFAT-calcineurin in the absence of the relevant immunosupressive drugs (data not shown). Since the previous experiments implicated the calcineurin active site in NFAT-calcineurin binding, we asked whether the catalytic activity of calcineurin was required for binding to NFAT proteins (Fig. 6). Recombinant wild-type calcineurin or the inactive His151→ Ala mutant were incubated with GST-NFAT2 in the presence or absence of calmodulin. The beads were then washed and the amount of bound calcineurin was assessed by Western blotting with an antibody to the autoinhibitory peptide of calcineurin A, exactly as described previously (15Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that there was equivalent binding of the catalytically active and inactive calcineurin to NFAT, indicating that the NFAT-calcineurin interaction does not require the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. Consistent with this result, catalytically inactive calcineurins, when overexpressed, inhibited the nuclear import of NFAT4 (16Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), indicating that these proteins remained capable of interaction with NFAT. The NFAT-calcineurin interaction is central to the proper regulation of the immune response (6Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 35Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), and also plays a role in the function of cells and tissues outside the immune system (11Delapompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Potter J. Wakeham A. Marengere L. Langille B.L. Crabtree G.R. Mak T.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 12Ranger A.M. Grusby M.J. Hodge M.R. Gravallese E.M. Delabrousse F.C. Hoey T. Mickanin C. Baldwin H.S. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We show here that calmodulin-activated calcineurin binds significantly more strongly than does inactive calcineurin to NFAT. The interacting regions are located on the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A chain and on an 86-amino acid fragment of the NFAT regulatory domain. Our results suggest that the interaction of activated calcineurin with NFAT involves at least two functionally separable regions. One of these is the SPRIEIT sequence of NFAT1, which we have previously identified as the docking site for inactive calcineurin in resting cells (27Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.J. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), while the second involves the enzyme active site. The active site interaction is inhibited by the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain and the RII substrate peptide, which bind in the active site, as well as by drug-immunophilin complexes that partially occlude the active site. The active site contact appears to make a substantially stronger contribution to the NFAT-calcineurin interaction under stimulatory conditions, when the calcineurin has been activated with calcium and calmodulin. These results shed light on previous findings in which calcineurin was shown to coprecipitate with NFAT4 in cell lysates only after activation of the cells (16Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It is likely that the Western blotting assay used was insensitive and permitted detection of the NFAT4-calcineurin interaction only under conditions of calcineurin activation. In other work, cells were not previously activated, but coprecipitation of NFAT and calcineurin was assessed using calcineurin bound to calmodulin beads (13Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 26Wesselborg S. Fruman D.A. Sagoo J.K. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1274-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or in the presence of calcium concentrations that allowed activation by calmodulin in the cell lysates (17Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the fact that activated (dephosphorylated) as well as inactive (phosphorylated) NFAT bind equivalently to calcineurin (13Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 26Wesselborg S. Fruman D.A. Sagoo J.K. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1274-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the increased binding seen under conditions of cell activation reflects the significant increase in NFAT binding to calcineurin in the activated state. Analysis of deletion mutants of NFAT4 suggested that NFAT possessed multiple regions of interaction with calcineurin (17Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data with both NFAT1 and NFAT4 emphasize the importance of the SPRIEIT docking sequence in the NFAT-calcineurin interaction, and point to a major involvement of the (97–183) fragment of NFAT1. Nevertheless the truncation mutants NFAT1(1–96) and NFAT1(140–415) showed weak calmodulin-dependent binding to calcineurin, suggesting that regions outside the SPRIEIT sequence and the (97–183) region might contribute to calcineurin binding. This may be particularly true for NFAT4. Based on our data, we propose a model for the interaction of calcineurin with NFAT proteins in resting and activated cells. We suggest that NFAT is targeted to inactive calcineurin via the SPRIEIT docking sequence (and possibly other regions within the (97–183) NFAT1 fragment). This targeting interaction involves a region of the calcineurin catalytic domain that does not overlap the calcineurin active site and ensures the proximity of the enzyme to its substrate in resting cells. Upon cell activation, displacement of the autoinhibitory domain of calcineurin by calmodulin allows NFAT to bind additionally to the calcineurin active site, positioning specific regulatory phosphoserine residues of NFAT for immediate dephosphorylation. Further analysis of this dynamic interaction will facilitate our understanding of how calcineurin regulates NFAT-mediated gene transcription. Moreover it may speed the development of new immunosuppressive drugs that block the NFAT-calcineurin interaction but lack the deleterious site effects of cyclosporin A and FK506. We thank Drs. Jun Liu, Brian Perrino, Fernando Macian, Christopher Walsh, and Patrick Hogan for gifts of reagents and many helpful discussions."

Science. 1997; 277: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Previous studies of protein transmembrane (TM)1 segments have therefore tended to regard their helicity as a given parameter and focused principally on their hydropathy properties (6Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 7Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). Yet considering the array of residues occurring in TM domains, including those considered classically as helix breakers (i.e. Gly, Ile, Val, Thr, and Pro) in aqueous-based proteins, it appears unlikely that all residues will possess identical helical propensities in the membrane environment. Previous studies of peptide/protein secondary structures in aqueous solution indicate that individual amino acids have distinct conformational preferences (α-helical and β-sheet) that influence protein structure and folding (8Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar, 9Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Baldwin R.L.

However, in membranes, fatty acyl chains of lipid molecules present a hydrophobic environment to embedded proteins, and consequently, protein folding in membranes is subject to different rules versus those governing proteins in the aqueous milieu (14Chang D.K. Chien W.J. Arunkumar A.I. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 554-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Kothekar V. Mahajan K. Raha K. Gupta D. J. Biomol. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3782-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The need for such information has become more crucial, because the genomes of various organisms recently analyzed indicate that large proportions (20–40%) of the genes correspond to membrane proteins. We have now examined this situation using a set of de novodesigned Ala-based peptides. Features of these peptides mimic a prototypical single-spanning membrane domain with respect to length, hydrophobicity, and residue occurrence. An excellent correlation is found between the experimentally measured helicity in the non-polar phase and the occurring frequency of a given residue computed from a data base of native protein TM helices. These findings identify a novel pathway through which the amino acid composition of a membrane protein can assist its accommodation in a hydrophobic environment. Peptides were synthesized by the continuous flow Fmoc solid phase method (17Liu L.-P. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5476-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). C termini of peptides were aminated after cleavage from NovaSyn KR 125 resin. Purification of peptides was carried out on a reverse-phase Vydac-C4 semi-preparative HPLC (10 × 250 mm, 300 Å), using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purified peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC, amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry. The aggregation states of peptides were monitored by CD measurements and by size exclusion HPLC, from which it was found that through the concentration range of 5–250 μm, peptides remained monomeric in all experimental media. Concentrations of peptides were determined in triplicate through quantitative amino acid analysis using Ala recovery as the standard and BCA protein assay (enhanced protocol). Peptides were stored as solid powders at −20 °C. To avoid the complexity of synthesizing a multiple Cys-containing peptide, only the central X residue was substituted by Cys, and the other two X residues were replaced by Leu. CD measurements were performed on a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path length quartz cell at 25 °C. Each spectrum was the average of four scans with buffer background subtracted. Curves reported are based on triplicate measurements; standard deviation is ± 1%. Peptide concentration was typically 30 μm in aqueous buffer and in n-butanol. The aqueous buffer was prepared from 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The rationale for the design of the peptides used in the present study, of sequence KKAAAXAAAAAXAAWAAXAAAKKKK-amide (whereX indicates one of the 20 commonly occurring amino acids) (17Liu L.-P. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5476-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Liu L.-P. Li S.-C. Goto N.K. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), is given as follows: (i) The hydrophobic segment of peptide is comprised of 19 amino acids, which when folded into an α-helical conformation is of sufficient length to span a phospholipid bilayer (19Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). (ii) Distributions of the three “guest” residues Xhave been designed to preserve both angular and longitudinal symmetry around the helix, thereby minimizing any bias from amphipathic character that may arise when X is a polar or charged residue. In addition, triple substitutions of guest residueX in the hydrophobic core serve to amplify the effect of guest replacements, ensuring that the spectroscopic measurements can detect their structural impact. (iii) Ala, the most appropriate background residue as demonstrated by previous studies (20Deber C.M. Li S.C. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Li S.C. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was chosen as the “host” residue. (iv) A Trp residue was incorporated into the hydrophobic segment as a fluorescence probe to monitor characteristics of the local microenvironment. (v) Lys residues were added at N and C termini to enhance the water solubility of peptides, whereas the C terminus was aminated to eliminate potential electrostatic attractions that might occur inter- or intramolecularly. The solubility of these peptides in a wide variety of media make it feasible to investigate and compare specifically the conformational preferences of each residue in aqueous buffer versusnon-polar media. Because the only difference among the present peptides is the guest X residues, it is reasonable to assume that variations in peptide helicity can be interpreted as a manifestation of the propensity for each X amino acid to form an α-helical structure in a specific environment. CD spectroscopy, which is sensitive to secondary structure of proteins and polypeptides in solution, was used to monitor the conformations of model peptides. In aqueous buffer, peptides formed partial or non-helical conformations as shown by θ222data in Table I and CD spectra shown for selected peptides (Fig. 1 A); a generally good correlation was obtained when comparing peptide helicities with Pα values predicted by Chou and Fasman (Fig. 1 B) (8Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), as well as with those obtained in several experimental systems (9Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 10Blaber M. Zhang X.-J. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 12Munoz V. Serrano L. Proteins. 1994; 20: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Because this group of algorithms is based on data from water-based peptides and proteins, these results imply that the present peptide design is an appropriate model to derive the helix propensities of each amino acid. That the Asp peptide showed relatively high helical propensity in this series of peptides, as does the Glu peptide, may be due to the fact that salt bridges potentially formed between these residues and that the terminal Lys residues may extend and stabilize peptide helices. However, any such overestimation of helicity for these two peptides is probably minor, because fairly good correlation is obtained when plotting their helicity in aqueous solution versus the C.-F.

Organic solvents with dielectric constants between pure water and the hydrocarbon interior of biological membranes have been widely used to mimic the non-polar environments of membranes (22Chung L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Li S.-C. Goto N.K. Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To create a quasi-membranous yet homogenous (isotropic) environment and to eliminate the complexities involved in protein/peptide-lipid interfacial interaction (viz. partitioning, electrostatics), peptides were dissolved in n-butanol, a moderate non-polar solvent of dielectric constant 17.8 at 25 °C (26Lide D.R. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 72nd Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar), and their CD spectra were recorded. n-Butanol was chosen as a membrane-mimetic environment on the basis that (i) it effectively dissolved all 20 peptides, and (ii) in comparison to iso-propanol,n-propanol, and iso-butanol, n-butanol produced only minimum background absorbance at the lower wavelength region (<200 nm) of the CD measurements. Experiments with selected peptides in the above four solvents demonstrated that the CD spectra for a given peptide were essentially superimposable, indicating that the measured ellipticity is a property largely determined by the amino acid sequence of a peptide in this set of related solvents. Similar results were obtained for alcohol-induced helix formation of melittin, where end point ellipticities were essentially independent of the alcohol used (27Hirota N. Mizuno K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast to results obtained in aqueous buffer, all peptides formed predominantly α-helical conformations in n-butanol (Table I; spectra shown for selected peptides in Fig. 2 A). CD spectra were found to be independent of peptide concentration over the range 7.5–120 μm (not shown), and thus the helicity differences observed among the peptides are not caused by their differential solubility but by their intrinsic propensities to form the α-helical conformation in a non-polar environment. Aromatic residues are known to contribute specifically to CD spectra in regions ascribed to secondary structure (28Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Padmanabhan S. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Although a Trp residue is incorporated at the midsegment of all peptides as an integral part of the host sequence, no specific bias or distortion of spectra was observed. However, in those peptides containing multiple aromatic residues (i.e. when X indicates Trp, Phe, and Tyr at guest positions), aromatic contributions may be amplified, as suggested by the “off-line” points observed for Trp, Phe, and Tyr peptides in Figs. 1 B and 2 B. The observation that there is a wide range of helical preferences for individual amino acids (∼35% drop from Ile to Glu, and ∼56% drop from Ile to Pro) in n-butanol appears to be a direct function of the ability of the solvent to “solvate” a given side chain. For example, amino acids with relatively non-polar side chains (Ile, Leu, Val, Ala, Gly, and Phe) showed higher helical-forming tendency than those with polar and charged side chains. Comparing the value of θ222 of each peptide in aqueous bufferversus n-butanol, we found that there are drastic differences regarding the rank order of helical propensity for these residues in the two media (Table I). Environment is thus a key regulatory factor in determining the conformation adopted by a given protein sequence. As a further example, although Gly and Pro are among the most destabilizing residues of α-helices in globular proteins and polypeptides (8Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar, 9Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Baldwin R.L.

Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), they do display a considerable tendency to form α-helices in membrane environments (see Table I). Li et al. (23Li S.-C. Goto N.K. Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6676-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) also found that in a membrane environment, suitably placed Pro tends to protect rather than break α-helical structures. Based on these data, it should not be unexpected that one finds Gly and Pro quite commonly in native transmembrane helices, especially Pro in transporter proteins (30Deber C.M. Glibowicka M. Woolley G.A. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Rao J.K.M. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Notably, Ser and Thr display a higher tendency to occur in TM helices than in aqueous-based helices. These residues can satisfy their hydrogen-binding capacity by forming H bonds with the carbonyl oxygen in the preceding turn of the α-helix, permitting such residues to occur in helices buried within a hydrophobic milieu (33MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 34Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A.

Several workers have analyzed the membrane inclusion preference of individual amino acids based on known membrane proteins (36Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Reithmeier R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 37Taylor W.R. Jones D.T. Green N.M. Proteins. 1994; 18: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 38Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), analogous to the C.-F. algorithm for globular proteins (8Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar); for example, Jones et al. (38Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) used a dynamic programming algorithm to provide a membrane topology model from single sequence information. To obtain a membrane-based predictor comparable with the conventional C.-F. Pα parameter, we converted the “log likelihood” parameter of Jones et al.(si) to: P α(TM) =qi/pi, where P α(TM), the preference of an individual amino acid for occurrence in a TM helix, is the ratio of qi, the relative frequency of occurrence of the amino acid i in a particular structural class, topi, the relative frequency of occurrence of the amino acidi in all the sequences in the data set. The resulting values of P α(TM) derived from the “helix middle” of single-spanning membrane proteins are listed in Table I. There is good correlation (r = 0.93 when Pro was excluded) between the θ222 (n-butanol) and theP α(TM) (Fig. 2 B). Thus, rather than simple identification of highly hydrophobic segments in the primary sequences of membrane proteins, the uncoupling of hydrophobicity from helicity in transmembrane domains allows a clearer delineation as to where helices are highly probable as a function of both protein sequence and environment. The correspondence observed between the experimentally determined helical propensity for individual amino acids and their non-random occurring frequency in protein TM helices suggests that the high frequency of occurrence in membranes of residues such as Leu, Val, Ile, and Phe derives not only from their hydrophobicity but also from their intrinsic propensity to form the α-helical conformation in the non-polar environments of membranes."

In all organisms the mitochondrial genome is composed of a high number of DNA copies encoding a small number of components which are essential to mitochondrial function. It is thus important for mitochondria to have developed error avoidance systems to eliminate the errors produced during replication of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).1 Fidelity of DNA replication can be achieved by three mechanisms: selection of the correct nucleotide, which depends on the intrinsic discrimination capacity of the polymerase; 3′-5′ exonucleolytic editing which removes mismatches at the 3′ end of the growing DNA chain, and mismatch repair. Based on the rapid evolution of mtDNA in mammals (1Brown W.M. George Jr., M. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar) it was first postulated that replication of the mitochondrial genome was not faithful due to the absence of repair systems (2Kunkel T.A.

In a previous report (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we have shown that in S. cerevisiae the 140-kDa mtDNA polymerase encoded by the MIP1 gene (13Foury, F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. (1989) 264,20552–20560Google Scholar) has a potent 3′-5′ exonucleolytic editing activity located in the N-terminal part of the protein. The amino acid sequence of this domain, which is highly conserved in all pol-γ (11Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12Lecrenier N. Van Der Bruggen P. Foury F. Gene (Amst .). 1997; 185: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is characterized by three motifs, Exo1, Exo2, and Exo3, that contain aspartate and glutamate residues conserved in all editing DNA polymerases (14Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, the carboxylic groups of these residues coordinate two metal ions which play an essential role in the catalytic reaction (15Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In previous works (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Hu J.P. Vanderstraeten S. Foury F. Gene (Amst .). 1995; 160: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated by site-directed and random mutagenesis that the 3′-5′ exonucleolytic activity of the yeast mtDNA polymerase plays an important role in the fidelity of mtDNA replication. Single substitution mutants in conserved aspartate residues of the Exo sites exhibit a 100–200-fold increase in the frequency of mtDNA point mutations, while the stability of their mitochondrial genome is only slightly affected. Using crude mitochondrial extracts from an overexpressing yeast strain, we have shown that in these mutants, the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity is considerably decreased and that the processivity of DNA synthesis on primed single-stranded DNA is impaired.In S. cerevisiae, mismatch repair also plays an important role in the fidelity of mtDNA replication. The MSH1 gene, which is the homologue of the bacterial mutS gene, encodes a mitochondrial protein which binds to mismatches and has an associated ATPase activity (17Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The msh1 mutants exhibit high instability in their mitochondrial genome and an increased rate of point mutations (18Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the current paper, we tried to determine in a more accurate way the respective contributions of proofreading and mismatch repair to the fidelity of mtDNA replication. First, in order to have a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity as low as possible and to determine the highest mtDNA mutation rate which can be reached in proofreading-deficient mutants, we have constructed a double substitution mutant, D171G/D230A, in the conserved aspartate residues of Exo1 and Exo2 sites. Using a purified pol-γ fraction, we have characterized the biochemical properties of the enzyme and, in particular, we have estimated the capacity of mismatch extension and mispairing in the single and double substitution mutants. Second, we have shown that the combination of proofreading and mismatch repair deficiencies in the same strain is lethal for mitochondria. Finally, we have compared the mtDNA mutational spectra in the wild-type strain and in the proofreading and mismatch repair-deficient mutants.DISCUSSIONThe 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of yeast mutants at any one of the invariant aspartate residues which participate in the catalytic reaction (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has been estimated in this study to be about 104 times lower than that of the wild-type. Although extremely low, this residual proofreading activity is still able to maintain, among the large population of DNA molecules present in mitochondria, a sufficient number of functional molecules to allow their correct segregation into the daughter cells (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have shown that in the double substitution D171G/D230A mutant the frequency of mitochondrial point mutations is about 10 times higher than that in the single substitution mutants and 1500 times higher than in the wild-type strain. In addition, the increased mutator activity is associated with high instability of the mitochondrial genome. The increase in the mutation rate of mtDNA is one of the highest observed for proofreading-deficient mutants, if one excludes the special case of mutD5 mutants of E. coli DNA polymerase III (28Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8126-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the combination of the exonuclease-deficient pol2-4 (DNA polymerase ε) and pol3-01 (DNA polymerase δ) mutant alleles is lethal in a haploid while it is viable in a homozygous diploid, as the probability to have mutations in the two copies of an essential gene is low. The mutation rate is in the same range as for D171G/D230A (29Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, these data would suggest that in D171G/D230A, the accumulation of replication errors is such that there is a high probability that nonfunctional mtDNA molecules segregate into the daughter cells, giving rise to mutants devoid of mtDNA. Moreover, even a highly amplified rho− genome which does not bear any genetic information and is stably maintained in D171G and D230A, is lost at high frequency in D171G/D230A. We also found that when overexpressed, theRNR1 gene rescues the thermosensitive growth defect of mutant D171G/D230A. Rescue by RNR1 was previously shown for other mip1 mutants bearing mutations in the polymerase domain of pol-γ (21Lecrenier N. Foury F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was suggested that an increase in the ribonucleotide reductase activity and dNTP synthesis could elicit an increased uptake of dNTPs in the mitochondria and thus stimulation of mtDNA replication in these mutants, that have a low mtDNA polymerase activity. The same conclusion might be proposed for the D171G/D230A mutant that bears mutations in the exonuclease domain of pol-γ.What might explain the greater alteration of mtDNA in the double substitution mutant? Despite the extreme mutator phenotype of D171G/D230A, a residual 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was still observedin vitro, that is two to three times lower than in the single substitution mutants. Although it cannot be excluded that this is a contaminant activity, it must be noted that the exonuclease activity of the same double mutant in bacteriophage Φ29 is also decreased two times with respect to the single mutants (30Esteban J.A. Soengas M.S. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31946-31954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The polymerization and processivity activities are impaired in both D171G and D171G/D230A pol-γ. In particular, they are more sensitive to salt concentration than the wild-type enzyme; in addition, theK m for dNTP (dCTP) is slightly increased. This is not the case for E. coli DNA polymerase I or T7 DNA polymerase (15Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, a link between polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities has recently been discovered in several DNA polymerases (31Soengas M. Esteban J.A. Lazaro J.M. Bernad A. Blasco M.A. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4227-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29245-29254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Thus, the properties of D171G/D230A pol-γ are not basically different from that of the single substitution mutants; however, the deficiencies in the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and processivity of DNA synthesis, the increase in the K m for dNTPs and in the A:A mispairing are significantly more pronounced in D171G/D230A than in the single substitution mutants. It is probably the combination of all these parameters that causes a more severe in vivophenotype.The propensity of mismatch extension and base misincorporation is a property shared by the exonuclease-deficient mutants from many organisms. We have shown that the yeast pol-γ mutants efficiently extend mismatches and have high misincorporation rates. As expected, G:T is the most common mispairing and the C:C mispair is poorly produced (33Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The A:A mispair also occurs frequently, as is the case for E. coli DNA polymerase I and DNA polymerases α; in contrast, in chicken and porcine pol-γ, G:A and C:A mispairing preferentially occur (7Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24702-24711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kunkel T.A. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In order to determine the highest rate of mutations that could be reached in the yeast mitochondrial genome, we have combined both proofreading and mismatch repair deficiencies in the same strain. The mitochondrial genome was lost after a small number of generations. Thus the combination of proofreading and mismatch repair deficiencies generates a mitochondrial error catastrophe. A close link between the proofreading and mismatch repair systems was first pointed out in E. coli for mutD mutants altered in the 3′-5′ exonuclease proofreading activity of subunit ε of DNA polymerase III (28Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8126-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A surprisingly high rate of mutations led to propose that the mismatch repair system was partially saturated by the excessive rate of mutations resulting from the proofreading defect (35Schaaper R.M. Radman M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Fijalkowska I.J. Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An error catastrophe was also created in a haploid strain of S. cerevisiae having mutations in the mismatch repair PMS1gene and in the 3′-5′ exonuclease part of the POL3 gene (37Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnson L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).In an effort to better understand the contribution of mismatch repair and proofreading to the fidelity of mtDNA replication, we have compared the mtDNA mutational spectrum of the wild-type strain and mutants D171G/D230A and msh1. In the wild-type strain, both transitions and transversions were produced; however, transversions (specifically A to T or T to A) were produced at higher frequency. A majority of transitions were observed in the msh1-01 mutant which has a severe mismatch repair-deficient phenotype. These data support the observation that in vitro the purified Msh1p protein has the highest affinity for the T:G mismatch (18Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, almost all mutations present in the D171G/D230A exonuclease-deficient mutant were A to T or T to A transversions. Altogether, these data suggest that mismatch repair preferentially eliminates transitions while proofreading preferentially repairs transversions. It appears that mismatch repair and proofreading behave similarly in yeast mitochondria and in bacteria, since in both systems proofreading-deficient mutants accumulate transversions, and more specifically A to T changes (77% in E. coli), and mismatch repair-deficient mutants accumulate transitions (28Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8126-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Schaaper R.M. Dunn R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a striking and very specific feature of the mutation spectrum in yeast mitochondria is the anomalously high proportion of A to T (or T to A) transversions in wild-type strains. Colson (40Colson A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) has sequenced the mtDNA of 39 mitochondrial cytochrome b mutants eliciting resistance to a variety of drugs. We have calculated that the mutations occurred at 14 different positions of the nucleotide sequence; 30 were transversions, and of these 73% were A to T (or T to A) changes. The accumulation of A to T transversions correlates with the high AT content of yeast mtDNA, an observation suggesting that during evolution A to T substitutions were favored. Several hypotheses can be proposed to explain the excess of A to T transversions. First, transient misalignments (41Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during replication of the numerous AT repetitive stretches of the yeast mitochondrial genome might be frequent. Second, our in vitro assays show that A:A mispairs are frequently produced by the proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerases, suggesting that yeast pol-γ may have a low ability to discriminate between A:A and A:T pairings. Moreover, the wild-type enzyme can extend A:A mismatches, a property that in vivo could facilitate the fixation of the mutations.The mutation spectrum of the human mitochondrial genome is completely different. A 32-fold bias favoring transitions over transversions has been observed (42Aquadro C.F. Greenberg B. Genetics. 1983; 103: 287-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from the analysis of some 600 natural polymorphic variants listed in the data bases we have found that more than 75% of the changes are transitions (43Kogelnik A.M. Lott M.T. Brown M.D. Navathe S.B. Dallas D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been found that animal pol-γ (44Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast pol-γ 3S. Vanderstraeten, unpublished data. produce in vitro more transitions than transversions. This suggests that while in yeast transitions are efficiently eliminated, mainly by mismatch repair, they are poorly repaired in human mitochondria. It must be kept in mind that, in contrast with yeast, the mutation rate in mammalian mtDNA is high (1Brown W.M. George Jr., M. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). A mutS-like gene has recently been identified in the mtDNA of an invertebrate, the octocoralSarcophyton glaucum (45Pont-Kingdon G.A. Okada N.A. Macfarlane J.L. Beagly C.T. Wolstenholme D.R. Cavalier-Smith T. Clark-Walker G.D. Nature. 1995; 375: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It would be extremely interesting to determine whether mitochondrial mismatch repair exists in humans.Highly faithful DNA replication is an absolute prerequisite to the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome. The segregation and recombination opportunities offered by the yeast mitochondrial multicopy genome system are not sufficient to counterselect incorrect mtDNA molecules. Two universal replication error correction mechanisms, exonucleolytic editing and mismatch repair, play an essential role in yeast mitochondria. In all organisms the mitochondrial genome is composed of a high number of DNA copies encoding a small number of components which are essential to mitochondrial function. It is thus important for mitochondria to have developed error avoidance systems to eliminate the errors produced during replication of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).1 Fidelity of DNA replication can be achieved by three mechanisms: selection of the correct nucleotide, which depends on the intrinsic discrimination capacity of the polymerase; 3′-5′ exonucleolytic editing which removes mismatches at the 3′ end of the growing DNA chain, and mismatch repair. Based on the rapid evolution of mtDNA in mammals (1Brown W.M. George Jr., M. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar) it was first postulated that replication of the mitochondrial genome was not faithful due to the absence of repair systems (2Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Science. 1981; 213: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Avise J.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 45-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a comparison between three yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Candida glabrata has shown that the frequency of nucleotide changes is higher in their nuclear DNA than in their mtDNA (4Clark-Walker G.D. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From biochemical and sequencing data it is now clear that all pol-γ characterized so far in the fungus and animal kingdoms have an associated editing 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (5Kaguni L. Olson M.W.

Van Der Bruggen P. Foury F. Gene (Amst .). 1997; 185: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is characterized by three motifs, Exo1, Exo2, and Exo3, that contain aspartate and glutamate residues conserved in all editing DNA polymerases (14Bernad A.

In Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, the carboxylic groups of these residues coordinate two metal ions which play an essential role in the catalytic reaction (15Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev.

Gene (Amst .). 1995; 160: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated by site-directed and random mutagenesis that the 3′-5′ exonucleolytic activity of the yeast mtDNA polymerase plays an important role in the fidelity of mtDNA replication. Single substitution mutants in conserved aspartate residues of the Exo sites exhibit a 100–200-fold increase in the frequency of mtDNA point mutations, while the stability of their mitochondrial genome is only slightly affected. Using crude mitochondrial extracts from an overexpressing yeast strain, we have shown that in these mutants, the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity is considerably decreased and that the processivity of DNA synthesis on primed single-stranded DNA is impaired. In S. cerevisiae, mismatch repair also plays an important role in the fidelity of mtDNA replication. The MSH1 gene, which is the homologue of the bacterial mutS gene, encodes a mitochondrial protein which binds to mismatches and has an associated ATPase activity (17Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The msh1 mutants exhibit high instability in their mitochondrial genome and an increased rate of point mutations (18Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current paper, we tried to determine in a more accurate way the respective contributions of proofreading and mismatch repair to the fidelity of mtDNA replication. First, in order to have a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity as low as possible and to determine the highest mtDNA mutation rate which can be reached in proofreading-deficient mutants, we have constructed a double substitution mutant, D171G/D230A, in the conserved aspartate residues of Exo1 and Exo2 sites. Using a purified pol-γ fraction, we have characterized the biochemical properties of the enzyme and, in particular, we have estimated the capacity of mismatch extension and mispairing in the single and double substitution mutants. Second, we have shown that the combination of proofreading and mismatch repair deficiencies in the same strain is lethal for mitochondria. Finally, we have compared the mtDNA mutational spectra in the wild-type strain and in the proofreading and mismatch repair-deficient mutants. DISCUSSIONThe 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of yeast mutants at any one of the invariant aspartate residues which participate in the catalytic reaction (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has been estimated in this study to be about 104 times lower than that of the wild-type. Although extremely low, this residual proofreading activity is still able to maintain, among the large population of DNA molecules present in mitochondria, a sufficient number of functional molecules to allow their correct segregation into the daughter cells (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have shown that in the double substitution D171G/D230A mutant the frequency of mitochondrial point mutations is about 10 times higher than that in the single substitution mutants and 1500 times higher than in the wild-type strain. In addition, the increased mutator activity is associated with high instability of the mitochondrial genome. The increase in the mutation rate of mtDNA is one of the highest observed for proofreading-deficient mutants, if one excludes the special case of mutD5 mutants of E. coli DNA polymerase III (28Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8126-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the combination of the exonuclease-deficient pol2-4 (DNA polymerase ε) and pol3-01 (DNA polymerase δ) mutant alleles is lethal in a haploid while it is viable in a homozygous diploid, as the probability to have mutations in the two copies of an essential gene is low. The mutation rate is in the same range as for D171G/D230A (29Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, these data would suggest that in D171G/D230A, the accumulation of replication errors is such that there is a high probability that nonfunctional mtDNA molecules segregate into the daughter cells, giving rise to mutants devoid of mtDNA. Moreover, even a highly amplified rho− genome which does not bear any genetic information and is stably maintained in D171G and D230A, is lost at high frequency in D171G/D230A. We also found that when overexpressed, theRNR1 gene rescues the thermosensitive growth defect of mutant D171G/D230A. Rescue by RNR1 was previously shown for other mip1 mutants bearing mutations in the polymerase domain of pol-γ (21Lecrenier N. Foury F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was suggested that an increase in the ribonucleotide reductase activity and dNTP synthesis could elicit an increased uptake of dNTPs in the mitochondria and thus stimulation of mtDNA replication in these mutants, that have a low mtDNA polymerase activity. The same conclusion might be proposed for the D171G/D230A mutant that bears mutations in the exonuclease domain of pol-γ.What might explain the greater alteration of mtDNA in the double substitution mutant? Despite the extreme mutator phenotype of D171G/D230A, a residual 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was still observedin vitro, that is two to three times lower than in the single substitution mutants. Although it cannot be excluded that this is a contaminant activity, it must be noted that the exonuclease activity of the same double mutant in bacteriophage Φ29 is also decreased two times with respect to the single mutants (30Esteban J.A. Soengas M.S. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31946-31954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The polymerization and processivity activities are impaired in both D171G and D171G/D230A pol-γ. In particular, they are more sensitive to salt concentration than the wild-type enzyme; in addition, theK m for dNTP (dCTP) is slightly increased. This is not the case for E. coli DNA polymerase I or T7 DNA polymerase (15Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, a link between polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities has recently been discovered in several DNA polymerases (31Soengas M. Esteban J.A. Lazaro J.M. Bernad A. Blasco M.A. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4227-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29245-29254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Thus, the properties of D171G/D230A pol-γ are not basically different from that of the single substitution mutants; however, the deficiencies in the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and processivity of DNA synthesis, the increase in the K m for dNTPs and in the A:A mispairing are significantly more pronounced in D171G/D230A than in the single substitution mutants. It is probably the combination of all these parameters that causes a more severe in vivophenotype.The propensity of mismatch extension and base misincorporation is a property shared by the exonuclease-deficient mutants from many organisms. We have shown that the yeast pol-γ mutants efficiently extend mismatches and have high misincorporation rates. As expected, G:T is the most common mispairing and the C:C mispair is poorly produced (33Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The A:A mispair also occurs frequently, as is the case for E. coli DNA polymerase I and DNA polymerases α; in contrast, in chicken and porcine pol-γ, G:A and C:A mispairing preferentially occur (7Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24702-24711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kunkel T.A. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In order to determine the highest rate of mutations that could be reached in the yeast mitochondrial genome, we have combined both proofreading and mismatch repair deficiencies in the same strain. The mitochondrial genome was lost after a small number of generations. Thus the combination of proofreading and mismatch repair deficiencies generates a mitochondrial error catastrophe. A close link between the proofreading and mismatch repair systems was first pointed out in E. coli for mutD mutants altered in the 3′-5′ exonuclease proofreading activity of subunit ε of DNA polymerase III (28Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8126-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A surprisingly high rate of mutations led to propose that the mismatch repair system was partially saturated by the excessive rate of mutations resulting from the proofreading defect (35Schaaper R.M. Radman M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Fijalkowska I.J. Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An error catastrophe was also created in a haploid strain of S. cerevisiae having mutations in the mismatch repair PMS1gene and in the 3′-5′ exonuclease part of the POL3 gene (37Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnson L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).In an effort to better understand the contribution of mismatch repair and proofreading to the fidelity of mtDNA replication, we have compared the mtDNA mutational spectrum of the wild-type strain and mutants D171G/D230A and msh1. In the wild-type strain, both transitions and transversions were produced; however, transversions (specifically A to T or T to A) were produced at higher frequency. A majority of transitions were observed in the msh1-01 mutant which has a severe mismatch repair-deficient phenotype. These data support the observation that in vitro the purified Msh1p protein has the highest affinity for the T:G mismatch (18Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, almost all mutations present in the D171G/D230A exonuclease-deficient mutant were A to T or T to A transversions. Altogether, these data suggest that mismatch repair preferentially eliminates transitions while proofreading preferentially repairs transversions. It appears that mismatch repair and proofreading behave similarly in yeast mitochondria and in bacteria, since in both systems proofreading-deficient mutants accumulate transversions, and more specifically A to T changes (77% in E. coli), and mismatch repair-deficient mutants accumulate transitions (28Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8126-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Schaaper R.M. Dunn R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a striking and very specific feature of the mutation spectrum in yeast mitochondria is the anomalously high proportion of A to T (or T to A) transversions in wild-type strains. Colson (40Colson A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) has sequenced the mtDNA of 39 mitochondrial cytochrome b mutants eliciting resistance to a variety of drugs. We have calculated that the mutations occurred at 14 different positions of the nucleotide sequence; 30 were transversions, and of these 73% were A to T (or T to A) changes. The accumulation of A to T transversions correlates with the high AT content of yeast mtDNA, an observation suggesting that during evolution A to T substitutions were favored. Several hypotheses can be proposed to explain the excess of A to T transversions. First, transient misalignments (41Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during replication of the numerous AT repetitive stretches of the yeast mitochondrial genome might be frequent. Second, our in vitro assays show that A:A mispairs are frequently produced by the proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerases, suggesting that yeast pol-γ may have a low ability to discriminate between A:A and A:T pairings. Moreover, the wild-type enzyme can extend A:A mismatches, a property that in vivo could facilitate the fixation of the mutations.The mutation spectrum of the human mitochondrial genome is completely different. A 32-fold bias favoring transitions over transversions has been observed (42Aquadro C.F. Greenberg B. Genetics. 1983; 103: 287-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from the analysis of some 600 natural polymorphic variants listed in the data bases we have found that more than 75% of the changes are transitions (43Kogelnik A.M. Lott M.T. Brown M.D. Navathe S.B. Dallas D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been found that animal pol-γ (44Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast pol-γ 3S. Vanderstraeten, unpublished data. produce in vitro more transitions than transversions. This suggests that while in yeast transitions are efficiently eliminated, mainly by mismatch repair, they are poorly repaired in human mitochondria. It must be kept in mind that, in contrast with yeast, the mutation rate in mammalian mtDNA is high (1Brown W.M. George Jr., M. Wilson A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1967-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). A mutS-like gene has recently been identified in the mtDNA of an invertebrate, the octocoralSarcophyton glaucum (45Pont-Kingdon G.A. Okada N.A. Macfarlane J.L. Beagly C.T. Wolstenholme D.R. Cavalier-Smith T. Clark-Walker G.D. Nature. 1995; 375: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It would be extremely interesting to determine whether mitochondrial mismatch repair exists in humans.Highly faithful DNA replication is an absolute prerequisite to the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome. The segregation and recombination opportunities offered by the yeast mitochondrial multicopy genome system are not sufficient to counterselect incorrect mtDNA molecules. Two universal replication error correction mechanisms, exonucleolytic editing and mismatch repair, play an essential role in yeast mitochondria. The 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of yeast mutants at any one of the invariant aspartate residues which participate in the catalytic reaction (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has been estimated in this study to be about 104 times lower than that of the wild-type. Although extremely low, this residual proofreading activity is still able to maintain, among the large population of DNA molecules present in mitochondria, a sufficient number of functional molecules to allow their correct segregation into the daughter cells (9Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have shown that in the double substitution D171G/D230A mutant the frequency of mitochondrial point mutations is about 10 times higher than that in the single substitution mutants and 1500 times higher than in the wild-type strain. In addition, the increased mutator activity is associated with high instability of the mitochondrial genome. The increase in the mutation rate of mtDNA is one of the highest observed for proofreading-deficient mutants, if one excludes the special case of mutD5 mutants of E. coli DNA polymerase III (28Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8126-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the combination of the exonuclease-deficient pol2-4 (DNA polymerase ε) and pol3-01 (DNA polymerase δ) mutant alleles is lethal in a haploid while it is viable in a homozygous diploid, as the probability to have mutations in the two copies of an essential gene is low. The mutation rate is in the same range as for D171G/D230A (29Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, these data would suggest that in D171G/D230A, the accumulation of replication errors is such that there is a high probability that nonfunctional mtDNA molecules segregate into the daughter cells, giving rise to mutants devoid of mtDNA. Moreover, even a highly amplified rho− genome which does not bear any genetic information and is stably maintained in D171G and D230A, is lost at high frequency in D171G/D230A. We also found that when overexpressed, theRNR1 gene rescues the thermosensitive growth defect of mutant D171G/D230A. Rescue by RNR1 was previously shown for other mip1 mutants bearing mutations in the polymerase domain of pol-γ (21Lecrenier N. Foury F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was suggested that an increase in the ribonucleotide reductase activity and dNTP synthesis could elicit an increased uptake of dNTPs in the mitochondria and thus stimulation of mtDNA replication in these mutants, that have a low mtDNA polymerase activity. The same conclusion might be proposed for the D171G/D230A mutant that bears mutations in the exonuclease domain of pol-γ. What might explain the greater alteration of mtDNA in the double substitution mutant? Despite the extreme mutator phenotype of D171G/D230A, a residual 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was still observedin vitro, that is two to three times lower than in the single substitution mutants. Although it cannot be excluded that this is a contaminant activity, it must be noted that the exonuclease activity of the same double mutant in bacteriophage Φ29 is also decreased two times with respect to the single mutants (30Esteban J.A. Soengas M.S. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31946-31954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerization and processivity activities are impaired in both D171G and D171G/D230A pol-γ. In particular, they are more sensitive to salt concentration than the wild-type enzyme; in addition, theK m for dNTP (dCTP) is slightly increased. This is not the case for E. coli DNA polymerase I or T7 DNA polymerase (15Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, a link between polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities has recently been discovered in several DNA polymerases (31Soengas M. Esteban J.A. Lazaro J.M. Bernad A. Blasco M.A. Salas M. Blanco L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4227-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Kühn F.J.P. Knopf C.W. J. Biol.

Mutations in keratin genes expressed in skin lead to human disorders, including epidermolysis bullosa simplex and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. We examined the role of keratin 4 (K4) in maintaining the integrity of internal epithelial linings by using gene targeting to generate mice containing a null mutation in the epithelial K4 gene. Homozygous mice that do not express K4 develop a spectrum of phenotypes that affect several organs which express K4 including the esophagus, tongue, and cornea. The cellular phenotypes include basal hyperplasia, lack of maturation, hyperkeratosis, atypical nuclei, perinuclear clearing, and cell degeneration. These results are consistent with the notion that K4 is required for internal epithelial cell integrity. As mutations in K4 in humans lead to a disorder called white sponge nevus, the K4-deficient mice may serve as models for white sponge nevus and for understanding the role of K4 in cellular proliferation and differentiation.

The 10-nm intermediate filaments, along with actin and tubulin, form the cytoskeleton of cells in higher eukaryotes. Keratins are the intermediate filaments of epithelial cells. A large number of mammalian keratins have been identified and, based upon their biochemical properties, have been divided into two groups. The type I keratins, designated K9–K20,1 are acidic, have molecular masses in the range of 40,000–63,000, and are clustered on human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11(1). The type II keratins, designated K1–K8, are basic, have molecular masses in the range of 53,000–67,000, and are clustered on human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 15(1). The hair keratins also fall into these two groups, and their genes are most likely interspersed with those of the epithelial keratins (2Compton J.G. Ferrara D.M., Yu, D.W. Recca V. Freedberg I.M. Bertolino A.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The keratin proteins have an α-helical structure and form heterodimers with one member from each group. Higher order structures of the keratin heterodimers constitute the intermediate filaments (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 3Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Specific members of the type I and type II keratins are found to be characteristically associated with each other in different cell and tissue types. Simple epithelia, such as the gut, express predominantly K8 and K18. Stratified squamous epithelia express mainly K5 and K14 in their basal layers, while their suprabasal layers express K1 and K10 in skin and K4 and K13 in some internal epithelia, such as the esophagus (4Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar). Although epithelial cells in culture can survive in the complete absence of a keratin network (5Klymkowsky M.W. Miller R.H. Lane E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 494-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), there is a significant amount of evidence that keratins play critical roles in the maintenance of cell integrity in vivo. Evidence in support of this view was obtained from the study of several human genetic disorders. One of the first disorders that was molecularly characterized was epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) (OMIM 131760, 131900, and 131800). This disorder, usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, is characterized by the lysis of the basal cells in the epidermis and the formation of skin blisters following mild trauma. The dominant form of EBS was shown to be the result of missense mutations in either the K5 or K14 genes (6Bonifas J.M. Rothman A.L. Epstein Jr., E.

To understand the role of keratins and the phenotypic manifestations of mutations in keratin genes expressed in internal epithelia, we generated mice with a null mutation in K4.

These results suggest that K4 is required for the maintenance of internal epithelial cell integrity. It has recently been shown that the human disorder white sponge nevus (WSN, OMIM 193900) is the result of mutations of either K4 or K13 (14Richard G. De Laurenzi V. Didona B. Bale S. Compton J. Nat.

Although there are some differences in the spectrum of phenotypic manifestations in WSN patients and mice lacking the K4 protein, the mice could serve as genetic models for this disorder and may help us understand the pathophysiology resulting from the absence of K4 and the role of K4 in squamous epithelial cell differentiation. Based on the similarities between the K4-deficient mice and another human disease, hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis (OMIM 127600), we suggest that mutations in K4 or K13 may also cause this disorder. To recover a full genomic clone of mouse keratin 4, a mouse genomic library (129/Ola, gift from Dr. O. Smithies, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) was screened. The library was made with phage λ charon 35 digested with BamHI and mouse genomic DNA digested with SstI. It was plated on 20 plates with about 50,000 plaques/plate for a total of 1 million. The library represents 5 genomic equivalents and has an average insert size of 15 kb. The library was screened with a K4 insert from pMK1. The PCR-derived clone, pMK1, was digested with FokI, which released an insert of around 490 bp containing almost all of intron 3 and only 6 bp of exon 4. A set of 20 filters were hybridized with the probe according to the method of Maniatis (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Twenty positive plaques were picked. Seven of these were plaque-purified through two further rounds of plating and hybridization. Phage transformation, growth, and DNA extraction was performed by the method of Maniatis (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing, restriction enzyme analysis, and Southern blot hybridization were used to identify a phage (designated clone 3) as an ideal substrate for construction of the targeting vector. The 9.5-kb SacI subclone of clone 3 in PC-DNA II, designated pMK4–4, contained the complete K4 gene, as determined by sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis, with the protein start site 484 bp into the clone. This fragment contains a unique XmaI site at bp 519, 12 amino acids into the protein. A 1.7-kb fragment containing the PGK-Neo cassette was inserted into this site in the reverse orientation. Additionally, for negative selection, a 1.8-kb thymidine kinase cassette was inserted into a unique XhoI site in the PC-DNA II polycloning region. The targeting construct was linearized at the unique NotI site prior to transfection. Twenty-five micrograms of vector was transfected into 5 × 107 WW6 ES cells using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 250 V and 500 microfarads. Transfected cells were transferred onto 20 10-cm feeder plates containing mitomycin-treated, neomycin-resistant embryonic fibroblasts and 9 ml of ES medium prepared according to Wurst and Joyner (17Wurst W. Joyner A.L. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 234Google Scholar) except that the only serum was fetal calf, supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1000 units/ml. Twenty-four hours after transfection the neomycin analog G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Thirty-six hours after transfection, ganciclovir (GANC, Syntex, Palo Alto, CA) was added to a final concentration of 2 μM. Drug selection was continued for 14 days or until discrete colonies were visible. Colonies resistant to G418 and GANC were isolated and expanded in 24-well plates. Half of the cells from each well were frozen at −70 °C, and the other half were grown till confluence. Genomic DNA was prepared in situ by lysis and precipitation according to the method of Laird (18Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Screening for clones that were the result of gene targeting was performed using PCR. Primer set RK 825 5′-CCAATTTATGAGTCCCTGGGCT-3′, corresponding to genomic DNA outside the targeting vector, and RK 482, 5′-TGGAAGGATTGGAGCTACGG-3′, corresponding to neomycin sequences, amplified a unique 900-bp fragment from cells that had undergone a homologous recombination event. ES cells from clones that were the result of gene targeting were injected into C57BL/6 recipient blastocysts and transferred to CD-1 pseudopregnant females. Genotyping was performed using PCR with a set of three primers. They were: RK 21649, 5′-CTGACAGCTTGCCAAGCTCCCATC-3′, RK 21652, 5′-TGCCGAAGCCCCCAGAAGAGC-3′, and RK 21651, 5′-AGGGCCAGCTCATTCCTCCACTCA-3′. The primer set RK 21649 and RK 21652 yields a 727-bp product from the modified locus, and the set RK 21649 and RK 21651 yields an 830-bp product from the normal locus. Thus, wild-type mice will give one band of 727 bp, heterozygotes will give two bands of 727 and 830 bp, and homozygotes will give one band of 830 bp. Annealing was at 66 °C. PCR was performed in the Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler or MJ-PTC100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research Inc.). Reactions were typically performed using the following conditions: 0.2 μm each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.5–2.0 mmMgCl2, 1–4 units of Taq. A total of 25–35 cycles were performed (94 °C for 20–120 s, 50–68 °C for 20–120 s, and 72 °C for 45–240 s). Prior to cycling, the template was melted at 94 °C for 2 min, and, after cycling, an additional extension of 10 min was carried out at 72 °C. PCR products were run on 1× TBE gels of 1.0% agarose. The primers used in the degenerate PCR were as follows: RK567, 5′-GAGAATGA(G/A)TTTGT(G/C)(G/C)TC(C/A)T-3′, and RK568, 5′-CC(T/G)GAGGAAGTTGATCTC(A/G)T-3′, at an annealing temperature of 50 °C. Total RNA was extracted from fresh tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose gels prepared with 10% 10× MOPS buffer (200 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and 80 mm NaAC, pH 7.0) and 12.5% formaldehyde. Running buffer was 1× MOPS. A total of 5–10 μg of RNA was run per lane in three volumes of 1.33× MOPS loading buffer (674 μl of formamide, 216 μl of formaldehyde, 30 μl of 1m MOPS, 3 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 10 μl of 10% SDS, 10 μl of 1% bromphenol blue/1% xylene cyanol mix, 57 μl of glycerol, 2.5 μl of ethidium bromide stock). Sample was heated for 3 min at 65 °C and the gel was run overnight at 40 V. The RNA was transferred to Biotrans nylon membranes (ICN) using capillary transfer. For large probes, prehybridization and hybridizations were carried out in 0.25 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 7% SDS at 65 °C. Blots were first washed at 2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature. The final washes were performed at different stringencies, which varied from 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C to 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to x-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Kodak) for 1–14 days. Total RNA was treated with 1 unit of DNase (Promega) and 0.2 units of RNasin per μg of RNA at 37 °C for 1 h. The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out with 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl volume at 1× PCR buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 ng of random hexanucleotides (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 units of RNasin, and dNTPs at 1 mm each per μg of total RNA. Annealing for 10 min at 23 °C was followed by synthesis at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by an incubation at 94 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. The entire RT reaction was used in a PCR reaction of 100-μl volume at conditions appropriate for the desired primers. A reaction without reverse transcriptase was used as a control for genomic DNA contamination. PCR products were analyzed on 1.0% agarose gels. The primer pairs used were as follows: RK22651, 5′-TGCCTCCTCTCTCAGCCATGATCG-3′ and RK22652, 5′-TCGCTTGACACCACCAGCAATAGC-3′, at an annealing temperature of 65 °C; RK21651, 5′-AGGGCCAGCTCATTCCTCCACTCA-3′ and RK22651 at an annealing temperature of 65 °C; RK22649, 5′-ATCTCCAGGATCAGGTGGAAGCCG-3′ and RK22650, 5′-TGGCCTGGGTAGCGGTTTTTGC-3′ at an annealing temperature of 66 °C. After sacrificing the mice in a CO2 chamber, the tissues were sampled for Coomassie-stained gels by extraction of the cytoskeletal, Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Tissue was minced with a razor blade and resuspended in 200 μl of extraction solution (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.6 m KCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.3 mg/ml fresh phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added before use). This was sonicated in a cup-horn sonicator at full power for 2 × 2 min and spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at full speed. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of extraction solution. This was repeated twice, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of resuspension solution (9 m urea, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −70 °C. For Western blotting, total protein was extracted by mincing tissue in 100 μl of resuspension solution, sonication at full power in a cup-horn sonicator for 2 × 1 min, and boiling for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was stored at −70 °C. For Western blots, 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels were run according to Maniatis (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gels were run at 135 V for 72 h. For Coomassie Blue staining 12% gels were prepared using the LongRanger solution (FMC Bioproducts) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were run at 175 V for 13 h. Transfer of the protein from the gel onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore) was achieved using a Multiphor II Nova Blot electrophoretic transfer apparatus (LKB). Transfers were performed in a continuous transfer buffer of 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.0375% SDS, and 20% methanol for 1 h at a current of 0.8 mA/cm2. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with shaking in 0.1% Tween 20, 5% Blotto, and 10% sheep serum in 1× TBS. Two 10-min washes with 1× TBS-T were done. The membrane was then incubated in primary antibody diluted in 1× TBS-T and 5% Blotto for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed twice as above and incubated with secondary antibody from the ECL kit diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T and 5% Blotto for 1 h at room temperature. Four washes in TBS-T were done before proceeding to develop the blot with the ECL immunodetection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies used were as follows: 6B10, anti-human keratin 4 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:500 dilution; AE8, anti-human keratin 13 monoclonal antibody (ICN) at 1:250 dilution; AE1, anti-human type I keratin monoclonal antibody (ICN) at 1:200 dilution; and AE3, anti-human type II keratin monoclonal antibody (ICN) at 1:200 dilution. All are cross-reactive with their respective mouse keratins. After sacrificing the mice by CO2 asphyxiation, an autopsy was performed searching for gross abnormalities and sampling relevant organs by immersion fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned at 4 μm and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for light-microscopy. To evaluate proliferating cells, 4-μm sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were subjected to PCNA-specific immunostaining employing a PCNA antibody (anti-human PCNA, cross-reacts with mouse, PharMingen, San Diego, CA; dilution1/400) and the ABC kit according to the suggestions of the manufacturer (Vector Inc., Burlingame, CA). Pretreatment of the sections with heated citrate buffer (10 mm) was found to vastly enhance specific staining. The coding sequences of keratins share a high degree of homology. We isolated part of the mouse keratin 4 genomic sequence by generating degenerate PCR primers corresponding to sequences in exons 3 and 4. This pair of primers, designated RK567 and RK568, was used for amplification of products containing intron 3 of type II keratins from mouse genomic DNA. The PCR reaction yielded six products, one of which, pMK1, when cloned and sequenced at one end was found to have 61 bp, which had 100% identity to exon 4 of mouse keratin 4 (19Knapp B. Rentrop M. Schweizer J. Winter H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We isolated a 490-bp fragment from this clone that contained the unique sequences corresponding to intron 3 of K4 and used it to screen a genomic library from the strain 129/Ola. The screening yielded seven independent clones; the DNA from clone 3 was used to construct the targeting vector. A 9.5-kb SacI fragment from clone 3 was subcloned and found to harbor the complete K4 gene. This clone, designated pK4–4, had a unique XmaI site at nucleotide position 519 corresponding to the 12th codon of the K4 gene. A 1.7-kb neomycin phosphotransferase gene expression cassette (PGK-neo) was introduced into the uniqueXmaI site to generate the targeting vector, which also contained the PGK-tk gene for negative selection. Since the PGK-neo cassette was located at the 12th codon of the K4 gene, the modified locus was expected to result in a K4 gene null mutation. Linearized DNA from the targeting vector (Fig. 1 A) was introduced into the mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line WW6 by electroporation and the cells were subjected to selection in G418 and ganciclovir (GANC). One hundred eleven discrete colonies were isolated and examined for the desired gene targeted events by PCR. The PCR primers RK482 and RK825 were expected to yield a 900-bp product from the DNA of appropriately modified cells only. Eight of the 111 clones gave the 900-bp product for a targeted efficiency of 7.2%. The GANC selection resulted in a less than 2-fold enrichment. Cells from three of the eight clones containing the K4 gene modification, designated A5, A14, and B15, were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6 (B6) mice. All three cell lines yielded chimeras, many of which had very high levels (>95%) of contribution from the ES cells as determined by coat color. Several of these chimeras transmitted the ES cell genome through their germ line when mated with B6 females. Heterozygous mice derived from clones A5 and A14 were interbred, and the offspring were genotyped at the K4 locus. We used a PCR amplification scheme with three PCR primers to identify the wild-type and mutant loci. Results of analysis of two representative litters are shown in Fig. 1 B. The wild-type locus is represented by a 727-bp product and the mutant locus by an 830-bp product. The F2 offspring contained three classes of mice, and, among a set of 156 F2 offspring tested, 37 were +/+, 80 were +/−, and 39 were −/−. These results indicate that the modified gene segregates in a Mendelian fashion and that mice that are homozygous for the null mutation are viable. Furthermore, the wild-type K4 gene does not seem to be critical for normal development. We used three different approaches to examine the expression of K4 in mutant mice. To test the expression of the modified K4 locus at the RNA level, we used an RT-PCR. Three sets of primers were used for this purpose. The first set, RK22651 and RK22652, flank the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) cassette insertion site in the K4 gene. They yield a 98-bp fragment from the wild-type (WT) transcript and a 1.8-kb fragment, unamplified in the conditions employed, from the chimeric RNA. The second set of primers, RK21651 and RK22651, uniquely amplify a 270-bp product only from the chimeric RNA containing the neo cassette and not from the normal transcript. The third set of primers, RK22649 and RK22650, amplify a 485-bp product from the normal as well as the chimeric transcript. RNA from total esophagi of wild-type and homozygous mutant mice was used as the substrate for RT-PCR. The results are shown in Fig. 2 a. We were able to detect the expected 98-bp product with the primer set RK22651/RK22652 and the 485-bp product using primer set RK22649/RK22650 in RNA from wild-type mice. RNA from mutant mice yielded the 270-bp product with primer set RK21651/RK22651, and a small amount of the 485-bp product with the third primer set. These results show that the mutant mice indeed contained the gene modification and that the modified locus produces a chimeric transcript, although its steady state level might be low. To further assess the status of expression of the modified locus, RNA from esophagi of +/+, +/−, and −/− mice was fractionated on agarose gels and Northern blots were hybridized with a probe obtained from amplification of genomic DNA using primers RK22649/RK22650. This 485-bp product contains 125 bp of the unique 3′-end of the coding region and much of the unique 3′-untranslated region of K4. Results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 2 b. RNA from +/+ and +/− mice yielded the expected 2.25-kb product, while no transcript was detected in −/− mice. Taken together, the RNA analysis shows that the K4 −/− mice do not produce a transcript from which a full-length K4 protein could be synthesized. We attempted to detect the K4 protein by two different methods. In the first method, a keratin-enriched fraction from total protein extracts prepared from esophagi was fractionated on polyacrylamide gels and the different keratins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3 a. K4 is a 57-kDa protein and is detectable in extracts from +/+ mice, and in +/− mice at somewhat reduced levels. No K4 protein was detectable in extracts from −/− mice. The levels of K13, the partner for K4, were identical in all three groups of mice. This analysis also revealed two other interesting features. Although not quantitative, we observed increased levels of a protein at 59 kDa, consistent in molecular mass with mouse keratin 6, in K4 −/− mice. K6 is known to be expressed suprabasally in some internal stratified epithelia, and there are some reports of its expression in human esophagus (20Moll R. Moll I. Wiest W. Differentiation. 1982; 23: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Sawaf M.H. Ouhayoun J.P. Shabana A.H. Forest N. Pathol. Biol. 1992; 40: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar, 22Viaene A.I. Baert J.H. Anat. Rec. 1995; 241: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another protein with a molecular mass of 40 kDa, consistent with a type I keratin, although not present in WT mice, was present in +/− and −/− mouse extracts. The identities of these proteins remain to be definitively elucidated. In a second assay, total protein extracts from the three groups of mice were fractionated and Western blot analysis was conducted with specific antibodies against K4 and K13. Results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3 (b and c). Extracts from mice from all three groups contained K13, while the K4 antibodies detected the protein only in +/+ and +/− mice. These results unambiguously show that the genetic modification introduced into the K4 gene results in a null mutation. In addition, Western blots were performed using the antibodies AE1, which reacts with many type I keratins, and AE3, which reacts with all known type II keratins (data not shown). Blotting with AE3 confirmed the absence of MK4 in K4 −/− mice and the identity of the protein at 59 kDa as a type II keratin. The protein at 40 kDa was not detected by either AE1 or AE3. The fact that the mutant allele segregates in a Mendelian fashion suggested that K4 is not necessary for normal development. We followed the mice for up to 2 years and the homozygotes were indistinguishable from their +/+ and +/− littermates, by visual inspection. Since the expression of K4 is restricted to internal epithelia, we sampled a number of different tissues where K4 is known to be expressed and examined them by histological methods. The tissues that were sampled included skin, buccal mucosa, gum/teeth, tongue, esophagus, forestomach, glandular stomach, colon/rectum, lung, genitourinary tract, and the cornea. All these tissues, except the skin, are known to express K4. We observed histologic changes in tongue, esophagus, forestomach, cornea, and the skin. Results of histological analysis of the esophagus are shown in Fig. 4 (a–d). Changes in the esophagus were observed as early as 2 months (Fig. 4, a and b) in the −/− mice, including hyperplasia and nuclear atypia in the basal epithelial layer. The nuclear atypia consisted of enlarged nuclei and nucleoli with clumped chromatin. In the suprabasal layers, increased nuclear atypia and altered nuclear morphology were evident. The suprabasal cells also had a characteristic clear area around the nucleus, designated the “cell within a cell” appearance. Overall, the epithelium was thickened and cells appeared to be immature, with fewer differentiated cells, diminished keratohyalin granules, and a disturbance in the maturation of cell layers. The epithelium also exhibited parakeratosis and dyskeratosis with a diffuse and disorganized keratin layer. We also observed bacterial invasion and hemorrhagic exudate in the lumen and infiltration of the subepithelial space and the basal layer with neutrophils. In 5-month-old −/− mice (Fig. 4, c and d), the keratin layer became more disorganized and we observed progression of all other changes noted in the 2-month-old mice. The heterozygous mice, even at 7 months of age, did not show any of the changes and were histologically indistinguishable from their WT littermates. In contrast, the forestomach of 2- and 5-month-old −/− mice had increased cellularity of the basal layer but no dysplasia was detected (results not shown). The corneal epithelium was abnormal in 2-month-old −/− mice (Fig. 4,e and f). There was increased thickness compared with WT mice. Basal cell hyperplasia was evident. The nuclear morphology in all layers was altered, and the “cell within a cell” appearance was a common feature. The results of histological analysis of the tongue are shown in Fig. 5(a and b). At 2 months, the tongue from −/− mice did not show any significant changes. Significant differences were observed in 5-month-old −/− mice. At this"
https://openalex.org/W1964070950,"We have previously demonstrated that insulin activates farnesyltransferase (FTase) and augments the amounts of farnesylated p21 (Goalstone, M. L., and Draznin, B. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 27585–27589). We postulated that this aspect of insulin action might explain the “priming effect” of insulin on the cellular response to other growth factors. In the present study, we show the specificity of the effect of insulin on FTase. Insulin, but not insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), stimulated the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase and the amounts of farnesylated p21. Even though all four growth factors utilized the Ras pathway to stimulate DNA synthesis, only insulin used this pathway to influence FTase. Insulin failed to stimulate FTase in cells expressing the chimeric insulin/IGF-1 receptor and in cells derived from the insulin receptor knock-out animals. Insulin potentiated the effects of IGF-1, EGF, and PDGF on DNA synthesis in cells expressing the wild type insulin receptor, but this potentiation was inhibited in the presence of the FTase inhibitor, α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid. We conclude that the effect of insulin on FTase is specific, requires the presence of an intact insulin receptor, and serves as a conduit for the “priming” influence of insulin on the nuclear effects of other growth factors."

The largest AnkGprotein described to date is a 480-kDa isoform localized at the axonal initial segment and Node of Ranvier (11Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2352-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Alternatively spliced isoforms of this parent AnkG protein include a 215-kDa peptide encoded for by a 7-kb1 mRNA in mouse epithelial tissues (12Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A.

Additional immunoreactive Ank3 isoforms at 200, 170, 120, and 105 kDa have been detected in mouse tissues, but incompletely characterized (12Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A.

Such rich isoform diversity may be especially critical to the maintenance of a specific pattern of membrane protein distribution in polarized epithelial cells such as those lining various segments of the kidney tubules, each of which vectorially transports specific ions and nutrients. It is likely that such specialized tissues harbor additional isoforms of ankyrin. Indeed, antibodies raised against AnkRrecognize a prominent 190-kDa ankyrin polypeptide in kidney tissue (13Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J.

However, AnkR-deficient NB/NB mice continue to express the 190-kDa kidney ankyrin, indicating that the latter is encoded by a gene distinct from ANK1, presumably an ANK3 gene (4Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8703-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J.

Based on data obtained from cross-reacting antibodies, this 190-kDa isoform is thought to be distributed in a polarized fashion along the basolateral membranes of both native and cultured renal epithelial cells, where it colocalizes with spectrin and Na,K-ATPase (3Devarajan P.

Bennett V. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 479-486Google Scholar). Importantly, the polarized distribution of ankyrin (and Na,K-ATPase) is markedly disrupted following an ischemic kidney injury and is restored following recovery (20Kashgarian M. Van Why S.K.

Res. 1994; 36: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for the 190-kDa ankyrin in the generation and maintenance of renal cell polarity. In this study, we describe the cDNA cloning and characterization of the 190-kDa ankyrin isoform from rat kidney, which we term AnkG190 based on its predicted size and homology to the 480-kDa neuronal AnkG isoform. AnkG190 displays a unique 31-residue amino terminus, a repeats domain consisting of 24 repetitive 33-residue motifs characteristic of ankyrins, a highly conserved spectrin binding domain, and a truncated regulatory domain. Complementary DNA probes derived from the unique amino terminus hybridize to an 8-kb message exclusively in kidney and lung, and cRNA probes derived from the same unique sequences hybridize specifically to kidney outer medullary collecting duct cells by in situhybridization. Transfections of MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) and COS-7 epithelial cell lines with full-length AnkG190 constructs result in (a) expression at the lateral membrane, (b) functional assembly with the cytoskeleton, and (c) interaction with at least one integral membrane protein, namely Na,K-ATPase. These findings significantly extend the known diversity of ankyrin isoforms, directly confirm the interaction of AnkG190 with Na,K-ATPase, and suggest that ankyrins may interact with integral membrane proteins in a complex, pleiotropic manner that requires complex tertiary structural determinants not easily deducible from the primary structure. All molecular biologic procedures were carried out using standard methods (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides bracketing a highly conserved 525-bp region extending from repeat 11 to 16 of human erythrocyte and brain ankyrins (7Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 9Kunimoto M. Otto E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Otto E. Kunimoto M. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were used in a high stringency PCR reaction (23Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 3-12Google Scholar), with rat kidney RNA reverse-transcribed with random hexamer priming and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) as template. The sense primer was GGCTTTACCCCCTTACACATCGCCTGCAAAAAGAAC and the antisense primer was CTTGGCCGCCACGTGCAGAGGGGTAAATCCTTTCTTGGT. This yielded a single 525-bp product which was subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Since its amino acid sequence was only about 55% homologous to previously described ankyrins (7Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 9Kunimoto M. Otto E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Otto E. Kunimoto M. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the PCR product was used to generate a random primed 32P-labeled probe to screen a rat kidney cDNA library at high stringency (Stratagene). Three full-length clones were isolated, which were identical in sequence and differed only in the length of the 5′-untranslated region; the largest clone was completely sequenced in both directions. Oligonucleotides targeted to the unique amino terminus of AnkG190 (Fig. 1) were used in standard PCR reactions, with the full-length clone as template. The sense primer was GGAGACGCCGACCCGGGCGCAGAGCC (from within the 5′-untranslated region) and the antisense primer was TCGTGAATAACAGGATCCAAAGTCACCCTG (corresponding to residues 19–28). The 146-bp PCR product was sequenced to confirm its identity, labeled with32P and random primers, and hybridized to a rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) at high stringency. Following detection of hybridized messages by autoradiography, the blot was stripped and probed with a previously described PCR product corresponding to residues 1254–1340 of AnkG190; these residues represent a very highly conserved region within the spectrin binding domain of ankyrins (13Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Finally, the blot was probed with actin as a control for RNA loading.Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of AnkG190. The start of each repeat is marked.

Weaver D.R. Stehle J.H. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The 146-bp PCR product containing sequences unique to AnkG190 was subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) in both directions, to yield sense and antisense constructs. 35S-Labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes were generated by linearizing the constructs with the appropriate restriction endonuclease, followed by in vitrotranscription with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]α-thio-UTP (NEN Life Science Products, 1100 Ci/mmol). Rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and the kidneys were snap-frozen in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo). Sections (15 μm) were cut in a cryostat, mounted onto slides, air-dried for 15 min, and stored at −80 °C. For prehybridization, slides were warmed to room temperature and fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7, in PBS treated with 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate (PBS-DEPC). Slides were rinsed in PBS-DEPC (2 × 5 min), deproteinated in 0.2 n HCl for 20 min, rinsed in PBS-DEPC (1 × 5 min), and acetylated by immersion in 0.1 m triethanolamine in DEPC/water (pH 8.0, 2 min), followed by addition of acetic anhydride (final concentration of 0.25%) for 10 min. Slides were then rinsed in PBS-DEPC (1 × 5 min), dehydrated through ascending alcohols, air-dried, and used immediately. For hybridization, sections were covered with 40 μl of hybridization buffer containing 1.5 × 107 cpm probe/ml. The hybridization buffer contained 50% formamide, 10% w/v dextran sulfate, 2× Denhardt's solution (0.04% each polyvinylpyrrolidone, bovine serum albumin, Ficoll), 0.9 mNaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, 500 μg/ml yeast total RNA. Sections were then covered with glass coverslips and placed in humidified chambers overnight at 53 °C. The following morning, the coverslips were removed in 2× SSC, and the slides were washed in 2× SSC (30 min, room temperature), incubated in RNase A (10 μg/ml in 0.5 mNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) for 60 min at 37 °C, and washed in 2× SSC (30 min, room temperature), 0.1× SSC (twice for 30 min at 53 °C), and 0.1× SSC (twice for 30 min at room temperature). Slides were then dehydrated through ascending alcohols containing 0.3m ammonium acetate and air-dried. Film autoradiograms were generated by apposing slides to Kodak SB-5 x-ray film for 7 days. PCR techniques were utilized to create a series of AnkG190 expression constructs, each containing the eight-residue FLAG tag (IBI Biosystems) added to the carboxyl terminus. Primers were targeted to AnkG190 residues as shown in Fig. 7 A; the FLAG sequence and a stop codon were added to the 3′ end of each antisense primer. PCR products were verified by sequencing, subcloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen), and transfected into MDCK and COS-7 cells either transiently or stably with G418 (400 μg/ml) selection (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subconfluent cells were exposed to the DNA-LipofectAMINE complex in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h, and the transiently transfected cells were analyzed upon reaching confluence, after an additional 48 h incubation in normal growth medium. Both MDCK and COS-7 cells, transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length AnkG190 in pcDNA3, were grown to confluence in 150-cm2 culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and sequentially extracted in situ as described (13Devarajan P.

Briefly, cells were first extracted for 10 min at 4 °C in buffer 1 (yielding fraction 1) containing 10 mmPipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. The second extraction (yielding fraction II) was for 20 min at 4 °C in buffer 2 containing 250 mm ammonium sulfate instead of NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Equal amounts of total proteins in each extract were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with various antibodies, to determine their distribution in the soluble (fraction 1) or cytoskeletal (fraction 2) fractions. MDCK cells stably transfected with the full-length AnkG190-FLAG fusion construct were grown to confluence on coverslips and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described (19Devarajan P.

Cells were washed with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized with 100% acetone for 20 min, blocked with normal goat serum for 60 min, and incubated first with the M2 monoclonal antibody against FLAG (IBI Biosystems) for 1 h and then with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The coverslips were mounted on slides with Crystalmount (Biomeda) and viewed with a microscope equipped for epilumination (IX70, Olympus). COS-7 cells transiently transfected with each of the five AnkG190 constructs were grown to confluence in six-well plates and processed for immunoprecipitations as described (24Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 2 ml of IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Pefablock), the lysate was centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g, and precleared by a 60-min incubation at 4 °C with 25 μl of nonimmune serum and 200 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cleared supernatant was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of the M2 monoclonal antibody against FLAG and for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 200 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose solution. The lysate was centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g, washed three times with IP buffer, and the pellet subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis with a monoclonal antibody against α-Na,K-ATPase (Upstate Biotechnology). The isolation of total RNA from rat kidney used standard methods (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were as described (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of transferred proteins was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibody to nonerythroid spectrin (βII) was a kind gift from Dr. Jon Morrow (Yale University). Antibody to AnkG119 (Golgi ankyrin) has been previously characterized (13Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) ankyrins revealed a region of high conservation extending from repeat 11–16. Oligonucleotides bracketing this region were used in a PCR reaction with reverse-transcribed rat kidney RNA as template, yielding a 525-bp PCR product whose amino acid sequence was only 55% homologous to red cell or brain ankyrin. Using the PCR product as a probe, three full-length clones were isolated from a rat kidney cDNA library, which were identical in sequence and differed only in the length of the 5′-untranslated region. The largest clone provided a 6134-bp contiguous cDNA sequence for AnkG190 (Fig. 1, GenBankTM accession numberAF069525), with a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) upstream of the poly(A)+ tail, and a single open reading frame encoding for a protein of 1763 amino acids with a predicted mass of 190 kDa. We term this protein AnkG190, based on its predicted size and homology to the 480-kDa neuronal AnkG isoform (10Otto E. Kunimoto M. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Compared with AnkG480, AnkG190 possesses a unique 31-residue amino terminus, and is over 95% homologous within the repeats domain and spectrin binding domain; however, it is devoid of the large serine-rich region characteristic of the regulatory domain of AnkG480 (Fig. 2). Sequence searches with GenBankTM reveal that rat AnkG190 is only 80% homologous to mouse epithelial ankyrin (Ank3), with significant sequence diverge not only in the unique amino-terminal residues but also within the regulatory domain, where rat AnkG190 is completely devoid of a 197-residue motif present in mouse Ank3 (12Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rat AnkG190 is only 55–60% homologous to human red cell or human brain ankyrins. Nevertheless, AnkG190 retains the domain structure of ankyrins, with a characteristic repeats domain of 24 repetitive 33-residue motifs, a highly conserved spectrin binding domain, and a truncated regulatory domain (compared with AnkG480 and mouse Ank3, Fig. 2). High stringency rat multiple tissue Northern blot analysis with cDNA probes derived from the unique amino terminus of AnkG190 identified a single ≈8-kb message exclusively in kidney and lung (Fig. 3 A). Hybridization of the same blot with a cDNA probe targeted to a highly conserved region within the spectrin binding domain yielded the same 8-kb message in kidney and lung, with additional smaller transcripts in the 4.5–6-kb range, as described previously (11Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2352-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 12Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Somewhat larger isoforms were detected in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain (multiple transcripts) only with the probe from the spectrin binding domain. Hybridization with actin revealed approximately equal loading of message in all lanes (not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that AnkG190 is an alternatively spliced, tissue-specific isoform of the Ank3 family. In situ hybridization of rat kidney tissue sections with an antisense cRNA probe generated from the unique amino-terminal sequences of AnkG190 showed that it is distributed primarily in the outer medullary region, indicating that it is expressed by the outer medullary collecting duct cells (Fig. 4). The sense cRNA probes did not hybridize at all to the same region (not shown). These results are comparable to those recently obtained for mouse epithelial Ank3, the expression of which was found to be predominantly in the outer medullary collecting ducts (12Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Since antibodies that specifically recognize AnkG190 were not available, we used transfected MDCK (dog kidney collecting duct cell line) and COS-7 (monkey kidney) cells to examine the biochemical and cellular properties of an AnkG190-FLAG fusion construct. In situ extraction (13Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) followed by Western blot analysis with FLAG antibody revealed that in both cell types, the transiently or stably transfected AnkG190 assembled predominantly in fraction II, or the Triton-inextractable, cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 5). In the same cells, a similar segregation into fraction II was also detected for native nonerythroid spectrin and α-Na,K-ATPase. In contrast, the Golgi-associated ankyrin (AnkG119) in these cells was exclusively found in the soluble fraction I, as previously reported (13Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The association of AnkG190 with the plasma membrane-associated cytoskeleton was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. In confluent, polarized MDCK cells stably transfected with the AnkG190-FLAG fusion construct, the antibody against FLAG produced a predominantly lateral membrane staining (Fig. 6). The nonerythroid spectrin and α-Na,K-ATPase were also predominantly localized to the lateral membrane in these cells, as expected (not shown) (13Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Morrow J.S. Cianci C.D. Ardito T. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Given the association of AnkG190 with the plasma membrane by extractions and immunofluorescence, and the putative role of ankyrins as molecules linking integral membrane proteins (such as Na,K-ATPase) with the underlying cytoskeleton, it was of interest to demonstrate a functional interaction between AnkG190 and Na,K-ATPase. Indeed, immunoprecipitations with FLAG antibody of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the full-length AnkG190-FLAG fusion construct (construct I, Fig. 7 A), followed by Western analysis with antibody against α-Na,K-ATPase, revealed a functional complex between these proteins. Furthermore, a similar analysis using a series of AnkG190 constructs showed that both the distal 12 repeats (construct III) and the spectrin binding domain (construct IV) were capable of interacting with α-Na,K-ATPase, whereas the proximal 12 repeats and the regulatory domain were devoid of Na,K-ATPase binding activity. Ankyrins are critical adapter molecules that are thought to maintain the polarized distribution of integral membrane proteins by mediating their linkage with the underlying spectrin-based cytoskeleton (4Bennett V.

The present study identifies the primary structure of this novel ankyrin which is expressed exclusively in kidney and lung, termed AnkG190 based on its predicted size and homology to the larger neuronal AnkG isoform (10Otto E. Kunimoto M. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). AnkG190 displays a unique amino terminus, a highly conserved repeats domain and spectrin binding domain, and a truncated regulatory domain. AnkG190 is expressed primarily by the outer medullary collecting duct cells in rat kidney. In cultured epithelial cells, AnkG190 assembles predominantly with the Triton-inextractable cytoskeletal fraction at the lateral plasma membrane and forms a functional complex with α-Na,K-ATPase. Interactions between ankyrin and several integral membrane proteins have been documented, and the structural basis of some such linkages have been identified. The initial cloning and characterization of red cell ankyrin, and the elucidation of its characteristic repeats domain of 24 tandemly arrayed 33-residue motifs (7Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 27Lambert S., Yu, H. Prchal J.T. Lawler J. Ruff P. Speicher D. Cheung M.C. Kan Y.W. Palek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent evidence suggests that this membrane binding domain consists of four independently folded subdomains of six repeats each (28Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in in vitroassays, both the voltage-dependent sodium channel (29Srinivasan Y. Lewallen M. Angelides K.J. J. Biol.

Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, previous in vitro competition assays have shown that the spectrin binding domain of red cell ankyrin can also associate with liposomes containing Na,K-ATPase (31Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17252-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate for the first time that AnkG190, the isoform of ankyrin associated with the plasma membrane of polarized kidney epithelial cells, forms a functional immunoprecipitable complex with α-Na,K-ATPase in vivo. Furthermore, we show that two distinct ankyrin domains, namely the distal 12 ankyrin repeats as well as the spectrin binding domain, are capable of this interactionin vivo, whereas the proximal 12 repeats and the regulatory domains are devoid of Na,K-ATPase binding ability. These results are compatible with previous findings that both red cell and kidney ankyrins bind to two distinct cytoplasmic domains of α-Na,K-ATPase (19Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 33Jordan C. Puschel B. Koob R. Drenckhahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29971-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results provide a structural basis for the ability of even significantly truncated ankyrin isoforms, such as the Golgi-associated AnkG119 (which contains only the distal 12 ankyrin repeats and a diminutive regulatory domain), to not only bind Na,K-ATPase but indeed to mediate its trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus (13Devarajan P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In summary, ankyrins interact with integral membrane proteins such as Na,K-ATPase in a complex, pleiotropic manner that requires recognition of multiple binding sites on both ligands. Such combinatorial complexity presumably allows not only for the acquisition of the high binding affinities that characterize ankyrin-Na,K-ATPase interactions (16Morrow J.S. Cianci C.D. Ardito T. Mann A.S. Kashgarian M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 19Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17252-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also for the ability of ankyrins to accommodate an increasing number of integral membrane proteins and sequester them into specialized domains of polarized epithelial cells. With the kidney AnkG190 clone in hand, it will be important in future studies to determine the minimal Na,K-ATPase-binding residues on ankyrin, the relative contribution of the two independent binding sites, and the consequences of interference with this binding on the generation and maintenance of polarized distribution of Na,K-ATPase in epithelial cells. We are grateful to Dr. Jon Morrow for the antibody to fodrin and for insightful discussions."

Copper is an essential cofactor for a variety of proteins and is required for normal cellular functions (1Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev.

In enzymes, copper ions participate in catalytic functions or fulfill structural roles (3Adman E.T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 145-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormally low levels of copper can impair the function of many copper-dependent enzymes. However, abnormally high levels of copper can be toxic. The toxicity of copper may arise, in part, from cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen intermediates. Copper and iron ions can catalyze the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction (4Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals can react with biomolecules, resulting in polypeptide bond cleavage as well as DNA base and sugar oxidation (5Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S.

Homeostatic mechanisms exist in all cells to regulate the cellular concentration of copper ions, maintaining copper balance and minimizing the deleterious effects of excess copper ions. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model system to study the mechanisms of copper detoxification, transport, and distribution. The mechanism of high affinity copper uptake in S. cerevisiae has been determined and includes cell surface permeases as well as a metal ion reductase (8Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J.

In contrast, a frameshift mutation in MAC1, designated mac1-1, resulted in substantial loss of both Cu(II) and Fe(III) reduction as well as uptake (17Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5056-5061Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The observed phenotypes of mac1-1 cells include respiratory deficiency and sensitivity to a myriad of stresses. The phenotypes are reversed upon addition of exogenous copper salts. The mechanism of copper attenuation of Mac1 function appears to involve copper repression of both the DNA binding function and transactivation (16Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

A repeated Mac1-responsive element consisting of at least two repeats of the sequence TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G) has been identified in 5′ sequences of CTR1, CTR3, FRE1, and FRE7(15Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M.

Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The loss of protection in the in vivoDNA footprint suggests the loss of DNA binding in response to copper treatment. Whether the loss of protection of this sequence is due to the loss of DNA binding activity or nuclear export is unclear. In this study the DNA binding domain of Mac1 was mapped to within the N-terminal 159 residues. Mac1-(1–159) was purified from E. coli as either a His6 tag or a glutathioneS-transferase fusion and contained two bound Zn(II) ions. The purified zinc-Mac1-(1–159) complex was capable of specific and high affinity binding to a single TTTGCTCA element. Sequential binding of the Mac1-(1–159) protein to a DNA probe containing two TTTGCTCA elements was observed, suggesting that Mac1-(1–159) is a monomer. The requirement for at least two TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G) elements in the promoters of Mac1-regulated genes appears to be due to synergism between the Mac1 binding sites. A minimal activation domain (AD)1 from the herpes simplex virus-1 VP16 protein (VP16 AD) was amplified by PCR with vector pSJT1193 (20Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) as a template creating 5′ BamHI,NotI, and ClaI sites and a 3′ HinDIII site. The PCR product was digested withBamHI/HinDIII and subcloned into vector pVT102-U (21Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), which contains the ADH1 promoter and terminator separated by a multiple cloning site, creating vector pVT-VP16. Vector pVT-VP16 contains ClaI and NotI sites before the sequences for the VP16 AD. The N terminus of Mac1 was amplified by PCR, generating common 5′ BamHI/AflIII sites and four different 3′ ends with NotI sites. The PCR products contained sequences coding for the N-terminal 194, 159, 125, or 101 amino acids. The MAC1 PCR products were digested withBamHI/NotI and subcloned into pVT-VP16-generating vectors Mac1-(1–194)/VP16, Mac1-(1–159)VP16, Mac1-(1–125)/VP16, and Mac1-(1–101)/VP16. CTR1promoter/lacZ hybrid genes containing either one, two, three, or four TTTGCTCA elements were constructed in a derivative of the ΔUAS vector pNB404 with a LEU2 selectable marker (pNB404L) (22Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CTR1 promoter sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pNB404L to generate vectors pC1 sequences −323 to −299 (relative to the translation start site) and pC2 and −339 to −299. A promoter containing three TTTGCTCA elements (pC3) was generated by PCR mutagenesis using a mutagenic oligonucleotide, which inserted a copy of sequences −339 to −323 5′ to the repeated TTTGCTCA element in pC2. The spacing between the second and third TTTGCTCA elements was 13 nucleotides, which is similar to that seen in theCTR1 promoter of 14 nucleotides. pC4 containing four TTTGCTCA elements was constructed in a similar manner to pC3. The spacing between the third and fourth TTTGCTCA elements was 12 nucleotides. Six copies of the Myc epitope from vector CS2+MT (23Rupp R.A.W. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) were excised as a BamHI/StuI fragment and subcloned into pHolly (generously supplied by Richard Palmiter) a pBluescript derivative with a small insert creating sites for NcoI, NdeI, and StuI, to pick up a stop codon. The Myc epitope was excised as aBamHI/SalI fragment and cloned into the yeast expression vector pYeF2 generating pYeF2-Myc. The MAC1truncations were excised from the VP16 AD fusions asBamHI/ClaI fragments and subcloned into pYeF2-Myc-generating vectors Mac1-(1–194)/Myc, Mac1-(1–159)/Myc, Mac1-(1–125)/Myc, and Mac1-(1–101)/Myc for galactose-inducible expression in yeast. Mac1 Myc fusions were transformed into yeast strain YJJ1 (generously provided by Stefan Jentsch). YJJ1 (mac1-1) has a frameshift in the MAC1 gene, resulting in a loss of function of MAC1. Yeast cultures were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil or in low copper synthetic complete medium lacking uracil with either 30 μm BCS or 100 μmCuSO4 added. All cultures had 2% galactose added as a carbon source. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed with glass beads. The lysed cells were centrifuged, and the extract was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal.

Mac1-(1–194) was excised form Mac1-(1–194)/VP16 as a AflIII/NotI fragment and subcloned into a derivative of pET21d, which contained sequences coding for a single copy of the HA epitope (pET21HA) generating a C-terminal fusion of the HA epitope with Mac1-(1–194). Mutations in the two Cys pairs in the N-terminal 194-residue, C69S,C70S and C172S,C173S, and all four cysteines C69S,C70S,C172S,C173S were created in the Mac1-(1–194)pET21HA. These mutations were initially generated using the altered sites mutagenesis system (Promega) (18Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Residues 42–194 were amplified by PCR with the mutant Gal4DBD Mac1-(42–417) in pAlter as templates (18Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested withNcoI/NotI and cloned into Mac1-(1–194)pET21HA, replacing the wild type sequence from amino acid 42 to 194. DNA coding for the first 159 residues of Mac1 was amplified by PCR and was digested with NdeI/HinDIII and subcloned into pAED4-His or the C-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion vector pAED4-GST; the first 24 codons in the open reading frame were highly biased E. coli codons to optimize expression (25Anderson S.G.E. Kurland C.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 198-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The correct sequence in all the constructs was verified by restriction digestions and nucleotide sequencing. Mac1-(1–159) as either a C-terminal His6 tag or GST fusion was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 nm of 0.6 and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to induce production of the protein. Thirty min after induction, 1 mm ZnSO4was added, and the cells were grown for an additional 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once in 0.25m sucrose and finally resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The cells were lysed by freeze-thawing and repeated sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The Mac1-(1–159)-His tag protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen). The extract was loaded onto the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column and washed with 10 column volumes of sonication buffer. The Mac1-(1–159)-His tag protein was eluted with a 0–500 mmimidazole linear gradient in sonication buffer. The Mac1-(1–159)-GST fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the extract was loaded onto the glutathione-Sepharose column and washed with 10 column volumes of sonication buffer. The Mac1-(1–159)-GST fusion protein was eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. The eluted proteins were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a single band at the correct molecular weight for each fusion was observed. Plasmids Mac1 pVT102-U, Mac1-(1–194)/VP16, Mac1-(1–159)/VP16, Mac1-(1–125)/VP16, Mac1-(1–101)/VP16, and pVT102-U were cotransformed with aCTR1/lacZ reporter construct containing an inverted repeat of the TTTGCTCA element into yeast strain YJJ1. Plasmids pC1, pC2, pC3, and pC4 were cotransformed into YJJ1 with Mac1 pVT102-U. Yeast transformants were grown in low copper synthetic complete medium with 2% dextrose lacking uracil and leucine. The cells were grown to anA 600 of 1.0 with the addition of either 30 μm BCS or 100 μm CuSO4 added to the growth media. The cells were pelleted and washed with Z-buffer (85 mm Na2HPO4, 45 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 85 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmMgSO4) and frozen at −70 °C. Cells were resuspended in the same buffer and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. β-Galactosidase activities were assayed usingo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. The absorbance at 420 nm was recorded, and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Mac1-(1–194)/Myc, Mac1-(1–159)/Myc, Mac1-(1–125)/Myc, and Mac1-(1–101)/Myc in pYeF2 were grown in low copper synthetic complete medium lacking uracil to anA 600 nm of 1.0 in medium containing 2% raffinose in place of dextrose. Protein expression was induced by the addition galactose to 2%. Cells were grown for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, resuspended in lysis buffer, and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. The extract was clarified and filtered. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 12% gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the blots incubated with the 9E10 anti-c-Myc (Boehringer Mannheim) in blocking buffer (10% non-fat dry milk, phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween 20). Detection by enhanced chemiluminescene was performed after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Yeast extracts from cells expressing Mac1-(1–194)/Myc, Mac1-(1–159)/Myc, Mac1-(1–125)/Myc, and Mac1-(1–101)/Myc as well as cells harboring the starting plasmid pYeF2 were tested for binding to an oligonucleotide containing the Mac1 binding site. E. coli extracts from cells expressing Mac1-(1–194)/HA, C69S,C70S-Mac1-(1–194)/HA, C172S,C173S-Mac1-(1–194)/HA, and C69S,C70S,C172S,C173S-Mac1-(1–194)/HA were also tested for binding to this duplex. Mac1-(1–159) purified from E. coli was tested for binding to oligonucleotides containing the two TTTGCTCA copper-responsive sites in CTR1 or mutant duplexes. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, boiled for 3 min, and slowly cooled to anneal. Protein extracts or purified Mac1-(1–159) was added to a 26-nucleotide duplex containing a half-site with one copy of the repeated element (cat ggg ata TTT GCT Caa gac gac gg). Mac1-(1–159) was also tested with two mutant duplexes containing multiple changes in the Mac1 binding site. Duplex CTR-G had nucleotides at positions 10–13 changed to G (cat ggg ataGGG GCT Caa gac gac gg), and duplex CTR-A had nucleotides at positions 15–17 changed to A (cat ggg ata TTT GAA Aaa gac gac gg). Protein titrations were carried out with two 26-nucleotide duplexes containing each of the two CTR1 elements and a 48-base pair probe containing the inverted repeat of the TTTGCTCA sequence (cat ggg ata TTT GCT Caa gac gac ggt aaa atG AGC AAA aat ggc acg). The protein and DNA were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C prior to electrophoresis of the protein-DNA complexes on 6% polyacrylamide gels and were visualized by autoradiography. Many fungal transcription factors have distinct and separable DNA binding domains and transactivation domains (26Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 27Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, one strategy to map the DNA binding domain of Mac1 is to evaluate the in vivo function of Mac1 truncates fused with a heterologous activation domain. The candidate DNA binding domain of Mac1 was expected to be located near the N-terminal end of the protein as the N-terminal 40 residues are homologous to the conserved DNA binding zinc module in Ace1 and Amt1 (17Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5056-5061Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 28Farrell R.A. Thorvaldsen J.L. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The minimal DNA binding domain of Ace1 consists of two independent modules, the N-terminal 40-residue zinc motif and an adjacent domain stabilized by a polycopper cluster (28Farrell R.A. Thorvaldsen J.L. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Graden J.A. Posewitz M.C. Simon J.R. George G.N. Pickering I.J. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14583-14589Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Only the N-terminal zinc module is conserved in Mac1. If Mac1 resembles Ace1 in having two independent domains participating in DNA binding, one would expect the minimal DNA binding domain of Mac1 to consist of a region greater than just the conserved N-terminal zinc module. The minimal AD from the herpes simplex virus-1 VP16 has been used extensively as a heterologous activator (31Sadowski I. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M.

Fusion of the N-terminal 194 residues of Mac1 to residues 417–491 of VP16 generated a functional transcription factor. Transformation of theMAC1-(codons 1–194)/VP16 fusion reversed the methionine auxotrophy of mac1-1 cells (14Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5056-5061Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Cotransformation with both theMAC1-(1–194)/VP16 hybrid and aCTR1/lacZ reporter fusion resulted in lacZexpression (Fig. 2). The Mac1/VP16 fusion gave greater CTR1/lacZ expression than did an episomal full-length Mac1 containing its own activator. The VP16 AD is a strong activator and may be more potent than the Mac1 AD. The Mac1-(1–194)/VP16 AD fusion was not modulated by the addition of CuSO4 as is the full-length Mac1. The lack of copper modulation was expected as the candidate copper binding motif resides in the C-terminal activation domain (18Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To further narrow the DNA binding domain of Mac1, three other C-terminal truncations were constructed, terminating at residues 159, 125, and 101. The activity of the Mac1-(1–159)/VP16 AD fusion was identical to that of Mac1-(1–194)/VP16. However, truncation to residue 125 markedly reduced the activity of the CTR1/lacZ reporter gene, and truncation to residue 101 essentially eliminated activity (Fig. 2).Figure 2In vivo activity of Mac1/VP16 activation domain fusions. Mac1 or N-terminal truncations of Mac1 fused to the VP16 activation domain under control of theADH1 promoter were generated and tested for their ability to activate expression of a CTR1/lacZ reporter gene. Cells were cultured in the presence of 30 μm BCS or 100 μm CuSO4. Quantitation of β-galactosidase specific activity is shown along with S.D. values of two separate data sets with triplicate assays in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Yeast extracts from mac1-1 cells expressing Mac1-(1–194)/Myc were tested for binding to a DNA duplex containing a single TTTGCTCA element (Fig. 3 A). Addition of Mac1-(1–194)/Myc to the probe resulted in the appearance of a gel-retarded complex. The addition of a monoclonal anti c-Myc antibody resulted in a supershift, demonstrating that the gel-retarded complex contained Mac1-(1–194)/Myc (Fig. 3 A). The Mac1·DNA complex was observed in both copper-deficient (+BCS) and copper-replete cells (Fig. 3 B). Yeast extracts from cells expressing Mac1-(1–159)/Myc, Mac1-(1–125)/Myc, and Mac1-(1–101)/Myc were compared with Mac1-(1–194)/Myc for binding to the DNA duplex. Mac1-(1–194)/Myc and Mac1-(1–159)/Myc gave gel shifts of approximately equal intensity, whereas the shift due to Mac1-(1–125)/Myc was less intense, and no shift was observed for Mac1-(1–101)/Myc (Fig. 4 A). Western analysis of these extracts demonstrated that Mac1-(1–194)/Myc, Mac1-(1–159)/Myc, and Mac1-(1–125)/Myc were all expressed at the same level, whereas the expression of Mac1-(1–101)/Myc was substantially less (Fig. 4 B). These results suggested that the minimal DNA binding domain was within the N-terminal 159 residues.Figure 4Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay of Mac1 truncates. Mac1-(1–159)/Myc, Mac1-(1–125)/Myc, Mac1-(1–101)/Myc and pYeF2 in strain YJJ1 were tested for binding to a DNA probe containing the Mac1 binding site (A). A Western blot was performed to confirm expression of the truncated proteins (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal 194 residues of Mac1 contain the 40-residue candidate zinc module conserved in Ace1 and two downstream Cys-Cys sequences. To determine whether the conserved zinc module was important for function, a mutation in codon 11 was engineered, resulting in a Cys11 → Tyr substitution. A corresponding Cys11 → Tyr mutation in Ace1 abolished in vivo function and attenuated DNA binding activity. The mutation was engineered in the full-lengthMAC1 open reading frame, and the mutant gene was transfected into mac1-1 cells to test for function. Cells harboring a mutant Mac1 with th"

The acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), which functions as an intracellular acyl-CoA pool former and transporter, is induced during adipocyte differentiation. In this report we describe the effects of expression of high levels of ACBP antisense RNA on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Pools of 3T3-L1 cells transfected with vectors expressing ACBP antisense RNA showed significantly less lipid accumulation as compared with cells transfected with the control vector. When individual clones were analyzed the degree of differentiation at day 10 was inversely correlated with the level of ACBP antisense RNA expression at day 0. Furthermore, in the clones with the highest levels of ACBP antisense expression, the induction of expression of the adipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α as well as several adipocyte-specific genes was significantly delayed and reduced. The adipogenic potential of antisense-expressing cells was partially restored by transfection with a vector expressing high levels of ACBP. Taken together, these results are strong evidence that inhibition of differentiation is causally related to the decreased expression of ACBP, indicating that ACBP plays an important role during adipocyte differentiation.

A number of established adipoblast cell lines undergo a highly regulated adipose conversion when they are treated with an appropriate combination of adipogenic factors. This differentiation process is accompanied by sequential expression and activation of a set of transcription factors governing expression of adipocyte-specific markers. Members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) families, in particular C/EBPα and PPARγ, have been demonstrated to be of crucial importance. C/EBPα and PPARγ appear to act synergistically in adipocyte differentiation by reciprocally activating the expression of one another and by cooperatively activating the expression of adipocyte genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that fatty acids play a critical role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation in vivo (2Klyde B.J. Hirsch J. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shillabeer G. Lau D.C. J.

Whereas fatty acids or derivatives thereof may stimulate adipogenesis by combined effects on different signal transduction pathways, several results suggest that an important role of fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives in adipocyte differentiation is to activate members of the PPAR family (8Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Brandes R. Arad R. Bar T.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1949-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), most notably PPARγ. The PPAR family belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Numerous reports have shown that activators of PPARγ, such as the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones and certain prostaglandin J2 derivatives, are very potent inducers of adipocyte differentiation (10Sandouk T.

It has been debated whether fatty acids activate members of the PPAR family directly as ligands or indirectly by inducing the synthesis of ligands. However, although the identity of the physiologically most relevant ligands remains unclear, it was recently shown that fatty acids and fatty acid analogs are indeed true ligands of the PPARs (16Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transport and biological functions of fatty acids and their metabolites are at least to some extent dependent on carrier proteins (18Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem.

Despite its tight binding of acyl-CoA esters, ACBP is able to mediate acyl-CoA transport and donate acyl-CoA esters to acyl-CoA-dependent biological systems (24Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J.

Andreasen P.H. Poulsen F. Kristiansen K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 123: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by a marked increase in ACBP abundance reflecting transcriptional activation of the ACBP gene (27Hansen H.O. Andreasen P.H. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K.

In this report we show that expression of high levels of ACBP antisense RNA is able to significantly inhibit accumulation of lipid as well as induction of adipocyte-specific genes. The vector pUBI was constructed by replacing the Rous sarcoma virus enhancer and the murine mammary tumor virus LTR/promoter of the pMAMneo vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with the human ubiquitin C promoter (position −1464 to −15) (28Wiborg O. Pedersen M.S. Wind A. Berglund L.E. Marcker K.A. Vuust J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To construct the ACBP antisense expression vector pUBI-ASmACBP, the murine ACBP cDNA fragment (29Owens G.P. Sinha A.K. Sikela J.M. Hahn W.E. Brain Res. Mol.

Similarly, pCEP4-ASmACBP was constructed by inserting the murine ACBP cDNA in the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in the antisense orientation. pCMV-rACBP was constructed by inserting the rat ACBP cDNA (27Hansen H.O.

For differentiation, the cells were grown to confluence, and differentiation was induced 2 days post-confluence (designated day 0) by changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with adipogenic inducers. For the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX), dexamethasone, and insulin (MDI) differentiation protocol (31MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the medium was supplemented with 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mm MIX (Aldrich), and 1 μg/ml insulin (Boehringer) from day 0 to day 2 and with 1 μg/ml insulin from day 2 to day 4. For the dexamethasone and insulin only (DI) differentiation protocol, the medium was supplemented with 1 μm dexamethasone from day 0 to day 2 and with 10 μg/ml insulin from day 2 and on. Stable transfections were carried out according to a modified Chen and Okayama phosphate transfection procedure (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells stably transfected with pCEP4-ASmACBP or pCEP4 were selected for 10 days in growth medium containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma), trypsinized, pooled, and subjected to adipogenic inducers according to the DI and the MDI differentiation protocols, respectively. Hygromycin was maintained in the medium until confluence. Cells stably transfected with the pUBI-ASmACBP were selected 2–3 weeks in growth medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and individual clones were isolated. The isolated clones were analyzed for integration of pUBI-ASmACBP by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting and for expression of ACBP sense and antisense transcripts by Northern blotting. The ability of the individual clones to differentiate after being subjected to the DI and the MDI differentiation protocols was determined by staining the cells with oil red-O 10 days after addition of adipogenic inducers as well by Northern and Western blotting. The percentage of differentiated cells with lipid accumulation on day 10 was determined by counting the number of cells with lipid accumulation in 10 randomly chosen fields of 1 mm2. For rescue experiments, cells of the ACBP antisense RNA-expressing clone GP2-4-2 were stably transfected with pCMV-rACBP and pHYG or with pCMV plus pHYG. Clones were selected and propagated for 10 days in growth medium containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin at which point hygromycin-resistant colonies were trypsinized, pooled, and used for differentiation experiments. Two days after confluence (day 0), the cells were subjected to treatment according to the MDI differentiation protocol. Accumulation of lipid droplets was determined by oil red-O staining (33Kuri H.W. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 6107-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar) from the clones at various time points after addition of differentiation inducers and analyzed by Northern blotting (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Filters were stained with methylene blue to confirm equal loading and hybridized to DNA probes labeled with 32P by random primer extension (35Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Signals were quantitated by phosphor imaging using the ImageQuantTMsoftware (Molecular Dynamics). Cells from day 0, 2, 4, and 10, respectively, were lyzed in 0.5 ml of 2.5% SDS-sample buffer/10-cm dish. Lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16% for detection of proteins below 15 kDa and 12.5% for detection of proteins larger than 15 kDa). Approximately 20 μg of cellular protein were loaded per lane. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Ponceau S for control of equal load. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat ACBP, rabbit anti-mouse C/EBPα (M. D. Lane), rabbit anti-mouse C/EBPβ (M. D. Lane), rabbit anti-mouse PPARγ (M. A. Lazar), or anti-mouse ALBP (D. A. Bernlohr)) for 1 h and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO A/S, Denmark) for another hour. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To investigate the role of ACBP in adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were stably transfected with a vector expressing high levels of ACBP antisense RNA (pCEP4-ASmACBP) or a control vector (pCEP4), respectively. The transfectants were pooled, replated, and induced to differentiate, and the degree of differentiation by day 10 was assessed by oil red-O staining. Two different differentiation protocols were used: one where the cells were treated with MDI and one where the cells were given DI (see “Experimental Procedures”). The DI protocol gives a slower and less synchronous differentiation; however, by day 10 3T3-L1 cells differentiated by the DI protocol are morphologically almost indistinguishable from those differentiated by the MDI protocol. In the growth phase there was no clear morphological difference between the pools of cells transfected with the antisense construct and pools of control cell, but when treated with differentiation inducers, the cells transfected with pCEP4-ASmACBP had a significantly decreased ability to differentiate compared with that of control cells. The effect was most pronounced when the DI protocol was used for differentiation. Fig. 1 shows the result from one of two independent experiments in which the DI protocol was used for differentiation. Similar results were obtained in both experiments. In parallel experiments 3T3-L1 cells were stably transfected with the pUBI-ASmACBP vector in which the ubiquitin promoter controls the expression of ACBP antisense RNA. Individual clones were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, and eight clones that had integrated pUBI-ASmACBP were selected for further analyses. Southern blotting revealed that 10–20 copies of the integrated plasmid were present in the genome of the individual clones (results not shown). Some investigators using the antisense approach for abrogation of gene expression have reported that although the antisense transcript seemed to decrease the level of the endogenous sense transcript, the antisense transcript was undetectable by Northern blotting (Ref. 36Samuelsson L. Stromberg K. Vikman K. Bjursell G. Enerback S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3787-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and references therein). However, all of the selected clones expressed detectable levels of the ACBP antisense transcript at day 0 (Fig. 2 A) as well as day 10 (results not shown). In seven of the eight clones the level of antisense transcript was at least five to ten times higher than the level of endogenous ACBP sense transcript at day 0 and equal to or twice the level of sense transcript at day 10. ACBP sense transcript levels (Fig. 2 A) as well as ACBP protein levels (as quantified by Western (Fig. 2 B) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown)) at day 0 were significantly lower in the antisense-expressing clones than in untransfected 3T3-L1 cells. Thus, the antisense construct was efficiently transcribed, and endogenous ACBP expression decreased in all the clones. Because of the inherent instability of preadipocyte cell lines some variance in the phenotype of selected stably transfected clones will be expected whether the cells are genetically manipulated or not. However, when the eight ACBP antisense RNA-expressing clones were analyzed for their ability to undergo adipocyte differentiation, all clones showed a markedly decreased percentage of cells with lipid accumulation on day 10 when the DI protocol as well as when the MDI protocol was used (Fig. 3). As with the pools of pCEP4-ASmACBP transfected cells, the most pronounced difference in differentiation potential was observed with the DI protocol. The result in Fig. 3 is representative of four independent experiments. It should be noted that the percentage of differentiation of the different clones, especially using the MDI protocol, was subject to some variance. However, the GP2-4-1 clone, which had the lowest ACBP antisense RNA level, was always among the clones that differentiated the best. To analyze how expression of genes encoding members of the C/EBP and PPAR families were affected by the reduced ACBP expression, expression levels were quantitated by Northern blotting of RNA isolated from seven ACBP antisense-expressing clones and control 3T3-L1 untransfected cells. The DI protocol was used for differentiation because the inhibitory effect of ACBP antisense RNA expression on lipid accumulation had been shown to be most pronounced with this protocol, and RNA was isolated at days 0, 2, 4, and 10, respectively. Expressions of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which are thought to play a role early during the differentiation process (reviewed in Ref. 1Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), were slightly increased throughout the differentiation in all clones expressing ACBP antisense RNA compared with untransfected 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 4). The expression of PPARδ, which has also been suggested to play a role in the initiation of differentiation (37Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), was not affected by the ACBP antisense RNA expression. In contrast, induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα transcripts was significantly delayed and decreased in the antisense-expressing clones (Fig. 4). By day 2 the PPARγ transcript was detected solely in untransfected 3T3-L1 cells, and even by day 4 the transcript was still only detectable in untransfected cells and in the clone that expressed ACBP antisense RNA at a significantly lower level than the other clones. Surprisingly, however, by day 10 the levels of PPARγ transcript were only significantly reduced compared with the level in control cells in the three clones (clone GP2-5-1, GP2-1-1, and GP2-4-2) with the highest levels of ACBP antisense RNA expression and the lowest differentiation potential. The level of PPARγ transcript in the remaining clones were comparable with that in 3T3-L1 cells. Western blotting, however, revealed that PPARγ protein levels were significantly reduced in all clones that express ACBP antisense RNA (Fig. 5), suggesting that PPARγ expression is subject to translational/post-translational regulation.Figure 5Expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ at day 10 in clones expressing ACBP antisense RNA and in untransfected 3T3-L1.Protein extracts were prepared from cells at day 10 after addition of adipogenic inducers (DI differentiation protocol). Expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ was determined by Western blotting. The p42 and p30 isoforms of C/EBPα and the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of C/EBPα was induced at day 2 in the untransfected control cells, but no expression was detected in the antisense-expressing clones either at day 2 or at day 4. By day 10, the clones with a high level of PPARγ transcript had levels of C/EBPα transcript up to 50% of the level in control cells. In the clones with the lowest levels of PPARγ transcript and the highest level of ACBP antisense RNA expression, the levels of C/EBPα transcript were below 20% of that in control cells (Fig. 4). Results obtained by Western blotting showed that C/EBPα protein levels were barely detectable in these clones (Fig. 5). Thus, not only lipid accumulation but also the induction of the two adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα are inhibited in the clones expressing high levels of ACBP antisense RNA. The levels of expression of genes encoding lipoprotein lipase, adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP/aP2) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, all of which are up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation, were also assessed by Northern blotting (data not shown). The induction of expression of these genes was delayed in all clones (i.e. expression was not induced by day 4). By day 10, lipoprotein lipase, ALBP, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts were expressed at significant levels in all clones as well as control cells; however, the levels were lowest in the clones with the highest ACBP antisense expression at day 0. Thus, the induction of adipogenic transcription factors and other adipocyte-specific genes is delayed and to some degree abrogated in the clones expressing ACBP antisense RNA compared with control cells. To show that the decreased level of ACBP in the antisense-expressing clones was causally related to the inhibition of differentiation, we attempted to overcome the high level of antisense expression by introducing vectors for high level ACBP sense RNA expression. Thus, the clone GP2-4-2 was stably transfected with pCMV-rACBP and pCMV, respectively. When the selected clones were pooled and treated according to the MDI differentiation protocol, the pool transfected with pCMV-rACBP differentiated significantly better than the pool transfected with pCMV (Fig. 6). In comparison with standard 3T3-L1 cells, differentiation of the rescued antisense-expressing cells appeared to be more patchy. This behavior was observed in three independent experiments. Although all pooled cells were resistant to hygromycin, analysis of ACBP expression by immunostaining revealed that the number of cells expressing detectable levels of ACBP at day 0 varied from experiment to experiment, and only made up 30–50% of the total population of transfected cells (results not shown). Thus the patchy appearance of differentiated cells reflects the presence of ACBP-expressing and non-ACBP-expressing cells. The thiazolidinedione BRL49653 has been shown to be a ligand of PPARγ and a very potent adipogenic inducer (15Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3460) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the thiazolidinedione BRL49653 alone or in combination with other adipogenic inducers could rescue the ability of ACBP antisense-expressing clones to undergo adipocyte differentiation, we subjected the clone GP2-4-2 and control 3T3-L1 cells to various combinations of adipogenic stimuli. 10 days after addition of inducers, the cells were fixed and stained with oil red-O (Fig. 7). In 3T3-L1 cells neither insulin nor MIX had any effect on adipogenesis when administered alone; however, adipogenesis was stimulated by 2 days of treatment with dexamethasone as well as by treatment with BRL49653. The most robust adipocyte differentiation was observed by MDI treatment alone or in combination with BRL49653. In the GP2-4-2 clone, dexamethasone or BRL49653 alone had very little effect on adipogenesis; however, when administered in combination, these two agents resulted in lipid accumulation in almost 100% of the cells. Similarly, the combination of MDI and BRL49653 resulted in almost 100% differentiation. Thus, the combination of dexamethasone and BRL49653 is able to rescue the ability of the antisense-expressing clone GP2-4-2 to differentiate. Interestingly, when the GP2-4-2 cells were left in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum or in this medium plus insulin or MIX, they survived significantly better than 3T3-L1 control cells (Fig. 7). Western blot analyses of 3T3-L1 control cells and GP2-4-2 cells subjected to MDI or MDI+BRL49653 differentiation inducers, respectively, confirmed the results obtained by oil red-O staining. Although MDI treatment failed to efficiently induce expression of the adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα in GP2-4-2 cells, these transcription factors were readily detected in extracts from GP2-4-2 cells treated with MDI + BRL49653 (Fig. 8). Thus, in the ACBP antisense-expressing clone GP2-4-2 the combination of MDI and BRL49653 induced adipocyte differentiation as assessed by lipid accumulation as well as by induction of adipocyte-specific genes. In keeping with previous observations (39Xue J.C. Schwartz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we find that PPARγ1 is the predominant PPARγ isoform induced during adipocyte differentiation whether or not BRL49653 is present. Of interest, we consistently see a significant decrease in the abundance of PPARγ1 by day 10 so that the ratio between PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 at this time point approaches 1. The presence of BRL49653 considerably accelerated the induction and enhanced the expression of C/EBPα in 3T3-L1 cells. Thus, in BRL49653-treated cells the expression of C/EBPα was significantly increased, and maximal expression of C/EBPα was observed already at day 2, a time by which 3T3-L1 cells stimulated by the MDI treatment have just finished their first round of post-confluent mitoses. 3J. B. Hansen and K. Kristiansen, unpublished results. Given the well documented strong antimitotic action of p42 C/EBPα, this finding suggests that clonal expansion may be partially curtailed in the BRL49653-treated cells. In this report we present evidence that ACBP appears to play an important role during activation of the adipogenic differentiation program in 3T3-L1 cells. First we showed that pools of 3T3-L1 cells stably transfected with vectors expressing high levels of ACBP antisense RNA differentiated significantly less when subjected to two different differentiation protocols than did cells stably transfected with the control vector. In this experiment differentiation was monitored solely as morphological differentiation (i.e.cells were stained with oil red-O). To investigate in more detail how antisense expression affected the ability of individual clones to differentiate, eight clones were isolated. Seven of these expressed high levels of ACBP antisense RNA, and one expressed low levels of ACBP antisense RNA. All of these clones showed a significantly reduced ability to undergo morphological differentiation. Further evidence for a causal relation between the ACBP antisense RNA expression and the lack of morphological differentiation was obtained by stably transfecting the differentiation deficient clone GP2-4-2 with a vector expressing rat ACBP under the control of the strong CMV promoter. Transfection with this expression vector partially restored the ability to undergo adipocyte differentiation, whereas transfection with the control vector had no effect. Immunofluorescence analysis of the transfected cells revealed a clear correlation between the number of cells expressing detectable levels of ACBP at the start of the differentiation program, and the number of cells that accumulated fat during the course of differentiation. To investigate whether not only lipid accumulation but also adipocyte-specific gene expression was abrogated by high levels of ACBP antisense RNA expression, RNA was purified from the cells at different time points after addition of differentiation inducers. Northern blot analysis showed that in the clones with the highest levels of ACBP antisense RNA expression, the induction of several adipocyte-specific transcripts was significantly delayed and reduced. Thus, the induction of the two transcription factors, C/EBPα and PPARγ, known to be of decisive importance in terminal differentiation, was delayed in all clones that express ACBP antisense RNA. At day 10, levels of C/EBPα and PPARγ transcripts as well as proteins were significantly reduced in the clones with expression of ACBP antisense RNA. The fact that PPARγ protein levels appeared to be significantly more reduced than PPARγ transcript levels in these clones suggests that the expression of PPARγ is subject to translational/post-translational control. Transcript levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which are thought to play a role in the initiation of differentiation, were slightly elevated. Thus, ACBP antisense RNA expression appears to interfere not only with lipid accumulation but also with induction of adipocyte-specific transcripts at a stage where differentiation can also be inhibited by retinoic acid (39Xue J.C. Schwartz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. prior to induction of PPARγ but after induction of early adipocyte markers. Clonal expansion has generally been regarded as a prerequisite for terminal differentiation of preadipocyte cell cultures (40Hauner H. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Schmidt W. Poll-Jordan G. Loffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15489-15495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kuri H.W. Marsch M.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 43Pairault J. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5138-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Clonal expansion was not abrogated in the clones expressing ACBP antisense RNA and comparison of growth rates for the clone GP2-4-2 and untransfected 3T3-L1 cells did not reveal significant differences (results not shown), indicating that expression of ACBP antisense RNA interferes neither with preconfluent cell growth nor with the reinitiation of cell cycling induced by the addition of differentiation inducers. It is conceivable that the effect of ACBP antisense expression is related to perturbations of metabolic pathways involving handling of acyl-CoA esters. The reduction in ACBP expression may interfere with synthesis of triglycerides; however, the results presented here indicate that proper handling of acyl-CoA esters is also of importance for signal transduction pathways leading to adipocyte differentiation Long chain acyl-CoA esters play a decisive role in regulation of gene expression in bacteria via binding to the FadR transcription factor (44DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, we have recently demonstrated that perturbation of ACBP expression in yeast, which leads to changes in the intracellular levels of acyl-CoA esters (23Schjerling C.K. Hummel R. Hansen J.K. Borsting C. Mikkelsen J.M. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), results in transcriptional deregulation of the Δ-9 desaturase gene (OLE1), suggesting that ACBP/acyl-CoA esters may also be involved in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. The well documented stimulatory effect of fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives on adipocyte differentiation may to a large extent depend on the activation of members of the PPAR family (8Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Brandes R. Arad R. Bar T.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1949-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is not clear what role acyl-CoA esters play in this activation; however, cotransfection of vectors expressing acyl-CoA synthetase was shown to inhibit PPAR-mediated transactivation (38Hertz R. Berman I. Bar T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that the fatty acids or fatty acid analogs rather than their CoA derivatives are the activators of the PPARs. Recent results from our laboratory indicate that acyl-CoA esters antagonize the effects of activating ligands on the PPAR/RXR complex in vitro. 4M. Elholm, I. Madsen, C. Jørgensen, M. Göttlicher, J.-Å. Gustafsson, R. Berge, J. Knudsen, S. Mandrup, and K. Kristiansen, manuscript in preparation. Thus, acyl-CoA esters may modulate PPAR transactivation. We have also shown that ACBP localizes to the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of many cell types, including 3T3-L1, 5T. Helledie, M. Antoniussen, R. V. Sørensen, S. Kølvrå, S. Mandrup, and K. Kristiansen, manuscript in preparation. indicating that ACBP could control local concentrations of acyl-CoA esters in the nucleus. Furthermore, we showed that PPAR-mediated transactivation in CV-1 cells is modulated by cotransfection with vectors expressing high levels of ACBP and other lipid-binding proteins. Thus abrogation of ACBP expression in 3T3-L1 cells might prevent proper synthesis and/or handling of ligands necessary for PPARγ activation. This view is compatible with our finding that administration of a very potent ligand of PPARγ, BRL49653, is able to by-pass the blockade of adipocyte differentiation imposed by the down-regulation of ACBP expression. Taken together, the results presented in this report strongly support the idea that proper intracellular handling of acyl-CoA esters is of crucial importance for adipose conversion and that perturbation of the normal expression of the acyl-CoA handling protein ACBP exerts a profound influence on the differentiation process.

In mammalian cells, cytochrome P450-containing monooxygenase systems are usually classified in two main categories: the mitochondrial and the microsomal types (1Degtyarenko K.N. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 2Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 419-442Crossref Google Scholar). In both cases, electron transfer chains are involved in which electrons flow from an electron donor, NADPH, to a terminal electron acceptor, cytochrome P450. In the microsomal system, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase transfers electrons from NADPH as the reducing equivalent of microsomal cytochrome P450 forms. This protein of about 80 kDa contains FAD1 and flavin mononucleotide prosthetic groups (3Iyanagi T. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 4Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electron transport machinery of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 forms is different from that of microsomal cytochrome P450 because it consists of two proteins, NADPH-ferredoxin reductase, a 50-kDa flavoprotein attached to the inner membrane of mitochondria, and a ferredoxin, a 12–14-kDa soluble protein of the mitochondrial matrix. These two proteins contain one prosthetic group per molecule, FAD and an iron-sulfur cluster (2Fe-2S), respectively (2Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 419-442Crossref Google Scholar, 5Takemori S. Yamazaki T. Ikushiro S. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P450. 2nd Ed. Kodanska, Weinheim1993: 44-63Google Scholar). Electrons flow from NADPH to NADPH-ferredoxin reductase and are transferred to the ferredoxin. The latter donates electrons to the cytochrome P450 that catalyzes the enzymatic reaction. Mitochondrial cytochrome P450-containing monooxygenase systems are primarily involved in the hydroxylation of bile acids and in vitamin D and steroid biosynthesis. In the latter case, NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase (ADR) and adrenodoxin (ADX), corresponding to NADPH-ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin, respectively, form the electron transfer chain of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 forms. Unlike the microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, which is able to transfer electrons in a wide variety of reduction reactions, including cytochrome P450 forms, cytochrome b5, and lipid peroxidations, ADR and ADX constitute a very specific electron transfer chain, supporting the activity of only three mitochondrial cytochrome P450 forms: CYP11A1 (P450SCC), CYP11B1 (P45011β), and CYP11B2 (P450aldo) (6Blackes W.L. Schenkman J.B. Greim H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 105. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 15-34Google Scholar). All of these proteins, ADR, ADX, P450SCC, P450aldo, and P45011β, are produced mainly in adrenals, gonads, kidneys, liver, and brain of mammals. The existence of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 forms and the related electron transfer chain has not been detected in lower eucaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, either by direct mitochondrial detection or by protein sequence comparison. Recently, we successfully produced a recombinant version of the bovine cytochrome P45011β in yeast mitochondria and demonstrated that co-expression of bovine cDNAs encoding P45011β and ADX in yeast mitochondria was sufficient to observe in vivo conversion of 11-deoxycortisol into cortisol (7Dumas B. Cauet G. Lacour T. Degryse E. Laruelle L. Ledoux C. Spagnoli R. Achstetter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This observation strongly suggests the existence of a yeast protein capable of transferring electrons to recombinant bovine ADX in vivo, thus supporting the activity of the cytochrome P45011β. A yeast gene, namely ARH1, encoding a protein homologous to mammalian ADR was identified and cloned (8Nobrega F.G. Nobrega M.P. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Lacour T. Dumas B. Gene. 1996; 174: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The encoded protein, Arh1p, shares 36 and 37% of identical amino acids with human and bovine ADR, respectively, and presents the putative FAD and NADPH binding domains of mammalian ADR (10Hanukoglu I. Gutfinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The similarity between mammalian ADR and yeast Arh1p is particularly significant in the amino-terminal region, where 45% of the amino acids are identical (9Lacour T. Dumas B. Gene. 1996; 174: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Strikingly, this region is believed to contain the ADX binding domain together with FAD and NADPH binding sites (11Warburton R.J. Seybert D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We postulated that Arh1p is a protein capable of forming an electron transfer chain with bovine ADX to support the in vivo activity of the cytochrome P45011β produced in yeast mitochondria. In this article, several characteristics of Arh1p are presented. In order to investigate the biochemical properties of Arh1p, an active recombinant form of the protein, r-Arh1p, was generated in Escherichia coli using the classical glutathioneS-transferase module. The ability of Arh1p to transfer electrons to bovine ADX was challenged. In addition, the functional importance of Arh1p and its subcellular localization were assessed in S. cerevisiae by gene disruption and subcellular fractionation followed by immunochemical detection, respectively. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs; DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), T4 DNA ligase, FAD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and restriction factor Xa were from Boehringer Mannheim; and Taq DNA polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. Cytochrome c, NADPH, NADH, ferricyanide, and Triton X-100 were from Sigma. Isopropyl-thiogalactoside was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Media for cell culture were from Difco, and14C-labeled 11-deoxycortisol was from Roussel-UCLAF. The S. cerevisiae ARH1 gene was obtained from the plasmid pTG10930 (9Lacour T. Dumas B. Gene. 1996; 174: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene were modified by PCR using the oligonucleotides OTG7709 (5′-GATAGGTACCGTCGACAAAATGACCTTTGTTCAAATAAGGCAC-3′), OTG7124 (5′-TACGCTCGAGTGATCAGGTGCCAC-3′), OTG7710 (5′-GTATATGCATCTGGTTGGATCCGT-3′), and OTG7711 (5′-GTTCAGATCTACGCGTTATATGCCTTCTACACCG-3′), to give plasmid pTG10945. With these modifications, the coding sequence of ARH1 is lined with a 5′ SalI and 3′MluI, BglII sites, respectively. The yeast expression vector pTG10954 was obtained by the introduction of ARH1 as a SalI-BglII DNA fragment into pTG10385 (12Degryse E. Dumas B. Dietrich M. Laruelle L. Achstetter T. Yeast. 1995; 11: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this plasmid, expression of ARH1 is controlled by the yeast transcription elongation factor 1 promoter (TEF1), and the phosphoglycerate kinase terminator (PGK1); a hygromycine resistance gene serves as selection marker. The E. coli expression vector pTG10986 was obtained by the insertion of a SalI-NotI DNA fragment containing the ARH1 coding part and PGK1 terminator in pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 5′-end of the ARH1gene was previously modified in order to replace the DNA sequence encoding the amino-terminal region of Arh1p (Met1 to Ile9) with the specific recognition site for restriction protease Xa (9Lacour T. Dumas B. Gene. 1996; 174: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Serra E.C. Krapp A.R. Ottado J. Feldman M.F. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19930-19935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This modification was done with aSalI-MluI PCR fragment using oligonucleotides OTG7705 (5′-TTCGTCGACAAAATCATCGAAGGCCGTTCTTCACAAATAAACCGT-3′) and ORU126 (5′-CCTTTTGTTCCGAGTTCGCCAG-3′). Thus, the encoded Arh1p (Ser10 to Ile492) is linked in frame to the carboxyl-terminal region of glutathione S-transferase through the factor Xa cleavage site (Fig. 1). The integration plasmid pTG10932 was constructed with aSalI-BglII DNA fragment of pTG10930 containingARH1. This fragment was inserted into pPOLYIII (14Lathe R. Vilotte J.L. Clark A.J. Gene. 1987; 57: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) to give pTG10931. A HindIII filled in DNA fragment of the S. cerevisiae LEU2 gene from pTG10159 (12Degryse E. Dumas B. Dietrich M. Laruelle L. Achstetter T. Yeast. 1995; 11: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was inserted into the unique MluI restriction site of ARH1 (550 base pairs downstream from the ATG codon) in the plasmid pTG10931. TheMluI site of this plasmid was previously filled in using theE. coli Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The resulting plasmid, pTG10932, does not allow for replication in yeast. The integration plasmid pTG10988 derives from pTG10053 (12Degryse E. Dumas B. Dietrich M. Laruelle L. Achstetter T. Yeast. 1995; 11: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TheSpeI-SpeI DNA fragment presenting the yeast 2-μm replicon was deleted in pTG10053 to give pTG10395. ASalI-BglII DNA fragment encoding Arh1p was cloned into pTG10985 to give pTG10988. The latter does not contain any yeast replicon, and the expression of ARH1 is under the control of the inducible GAL10/CYC1 promoter (15Guarente L. Yocum R.R. Gifford P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiaeFy1679.18b (MATa, ura3-52, leu2-Δ1,his3-Δ200, GAL2) and Fy1679.28c (MATα, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63,leu2-Δ1, his3-Δ200, GAL2), derived from the strain S288C (16Thierry A. Fairhead C. Dujon B. Yeast. 1990; 6: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were crossed to give the diploid TGY106. TGY107 (ura3-52, trp1-Δ63,leu2-Δ1, his3-Δ200,ARH1/arh1::LEU2, GAL2) results from homologous recombination in theARH1 locus of TGY106 using a SalI-SalI DNA fragment of pTG10932 bearing a disrupted ARH1 gene (arh1::LEU2). TGY107 was modified by integration in the URA3 locus of pTG10988 linearized with EcoRV restriction enzyme presenting a unique site in the URA3 gene. The resulting strain, TGY109 (trp1-Δ63, leu2-Δ1, his3-Δ200,ARH1/arh1::LEU2, ura3-52::URA3-ARH1, GAL2), carries a copy of ARH1 inserted in theURA3 locus. Overexpression of ARH1 in yeast was achieved in S. cerevisiae TGY73.4 (MATa, pra1-1,prb1-1, prc1-1, cps1-3,ura3-Δ5, his3) (17Achstetter T. Nguyen-Juilleret M. Findeli A. Merkamm M. Lemoine Y. Gene. 1992; 110: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) transformed with the plasmid pTG10954. E. coli BL21 (F−, ompT, rB−, m−) (18Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) was used for expression and purification of r-Arh1p. Cell transformation was achieved according to classical lithium chloride and calcium chloride methods for yeast and E. coli, respectively (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995Google Scholar). Expression and purification of a recombinant form of Arh1p (r-Arh1p) was achieved in E. coliBL21 transformed with the plasmid pTG10986. The latter allowed the production of Arh1p fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of GST. The cDNA encoding the fusion protein GST-Arh1p is controlled by theTac promoter (20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). r-Arh1p was purified according to published methods (13Serra E.C. Krapp A.R. Ottado J. Feldman M.F. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19930-19935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. An overnight culture of E. coli BL21/pTG10986 was diluted 1:20 in 4 liters of fresh medium and grown at 37 °C; 1 mmisopropyl-thiogalactoside was added when the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.8. After 4 h of induction, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Cells were kept at 4 °C, and mild sonication was carried out with a Branson Ultrasonic 450 sonicator. The bacterial lysate was slowly homogenized for 30 min at 20 °C in the presence of 0.8% Triton X-100 and 10 μm FAD. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged twice under the same conditions. A 2.5-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column was prepared with a bulk GST purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The supernatant was loaded onto the column with a flow of 0.8 ml/min at 6 °C. The column was washed with 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 10 μm FAD, and 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. GST-Arh1p was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mmreduced glutathione. During this step, the column flow was reduced to 0.2 ml/min. The eluate (3 ml) was dialyzed for 5 h at 6 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 10 μm FAD, 1 mm CaCl2. After dialysis, factor Xa was added to the eluate at a concentration equivalent to 1:25 of the total protein amount. Proteolytic cleavage of GST-Arh1p was carried out for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting product was again loaded onto the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column previously regenerated with 20 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5; 3 ml of the flow-through containing r-Arh1p were collected and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and microsequenced. As a control, a bacterial extract of the strain E. coli BL21 harboring the plasmid pGEX4T3 was prepared according to the same protocol. Cytochrome P45011β, ADX, and ADR were prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to published methods (21Lambeth J.D. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2766-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wada A. Okamoto M. Nonaka Y. Yamano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ferricyanide reduction was assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature. The reaction mixture contained 200 μm potassium ferricyanide, 50 μm NADPH, 10 μg E. coliprotein extract presenting (or not) r-Arh1p in a 1-ml final volume. As a positive control, r-Arh1p was replaced with 40 nmpurified bovine ADR. The reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide was followed by the absorption decrease at 420 nm using ε = 1.021 mm−1·cm−1. 11β-Hydroxylase activity was measured in vitro according to published methods (7Dumas B. Cauet G. Lacour T. Degryse E. Laruelle L. Ledoux C. Spagnoli R. Achstetter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Wada A. Ohnishi T. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Yamano T. J. Biochem. 1985; 98: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 30 nm P45011β and 10 μm purified bovine ADX, 10 μg of E. coli protein extract with (or without) r-Arh1p, 1 mm NADPH, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 15 mmMgCl2, 50 μm11-[14C]deoxycortisol in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. As a positive control, r-Arh1p was replaced with 0.5 μm purified bovine ADR. After the reaction, steroids were extracted with dichloromethane and analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (7Dumas B. Cauet G. Lacour T. Degryse E. Laruelle L. Ledoux C. Spagnoli R. Achstetter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); 11-[14C]deoxycortisol and [14C]cortisol were used as standards. Cytochrome c reduction was assayed in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 20 μm cytochrome c, 50 μm NADPH, 30 nm ADX, 10 μg of E. coli protein extract with (or without) r-Arh1p. In the positive control, r-Arh1p was replaced with 30 nm purified ADR. The reduction of cytochromec was followed by the absorption increase at 550 nm, with ε = 19.1 mm−1·cm−1. The Michaelis constants (K m) of Arh1p for NADPH, NADH, and ADX were measured under similar conditions. For NADPH and NADH, 20 μm cytochrome c, 1.6 μm purified ADX, 8 μg of r-Arh1p E. coli extract, and variable amounts of NADPH or NADH were present in the mixture. In the case of ADX, 50 μm NADPH was used as electron donor, and variable amounts of ADX were added. Apparent K m values and standard deviations were calculated according to the representation of Lineweaver-Burk using a nonlinear regression program (24Duggleby R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar); six or seven different concentrations of each studied substrate (ADX, NADPH, and NADH) were used. Each experiment was repeated twice. Subcellular and submitochondrial fractions were prepared according to the protocol of Zinser and Daum (25Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Fractions resembling “contact sites” and “zwischen bande” in term of their position in the gradient were analyzed for the presence of the Arh1p antigen but were not characterized further. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to classical methods using a semidry protocol (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was saturated with 0.5% nonfat dried milk (Bio-Rad) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. r-Arh1p was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-bovine ADR antiserum (Oxygene, Dallas, TX) together with a polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit serum (Dako A/S) as a second antibody. The presence of immune complexes were analyzed by chemiluminescence with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The genomicARH1 was disrupted by the insertion of a copy of the yeastLEU2 gene. A SalI-SalI DNA fragment of plasmid pTG10932 bearing the disrupted gene was introduced by homologous recombination into the genome of the diploid strain S. cerevisiae TGY106. Genomic DNA of the resulting strain TGY107 was prepared and analyzed by Southern blot according to classical methods (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995Google Scholar). Diploid cells of strain TGY107 were inoculated in a presporulation and sporulation solid media as described (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995Google Scholar). Preparation of tetrads was done with zymolyase according to the classical method (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995Google Scholar), and spore isolation was performed with a Singer MSM micromanipulator (Singer Instruments). Spores were grown for 72 h at 30 °C in a medium containing 8 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter agar, and 2% glycerol, 2% ethanol under aerobic conditions (oxidative metabolism) or 2% glucose under anaerobic conditions (fermentation metabolism). In the latter case, plates were placed in a jar containing generator Gas-PaK H2-CO2 (BioMerieux) and palladium grains. In the case of the strain TGY109, sporulation was carried out as described above. Spores were incubated at 30 °C for 72 h in selective medium containing 1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 50 μg/ml uracil, tryptophan, adenine, leucine, histidine, 0.1% glucose, and 2% galactose for GAL10/CYC1 promoter induction. To study the biochemical properties of a recombinant form of Arh1p, an expression system in which the protein could be rapidly isolated from a bacterial lysate was developed. The E. coli expression vector pTG10986 contains the coding sequence of Arh1p fused in frame to the 3′-end of the Schistosoma japonicum glutathioneS-transferase gene cloned into plasmid pGEX4T3. Between both genes, the sequence encoding the recognition site for specific cleavage of the protease Xa was introduced immediately upstream of theARH1 coding region (Fig. 1). This construct does not present the sequence encoding the 9 amino-terminal amino acids of Arh1p. Indeed, when analyzed with the G.O.R. algorithm (26Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar), this region of the protein could form a mitochondrial targeting sequence (data not shown), which likely is cleaved off upon mitochondrial import. Thus, the modification of the 5′-end ARH1 gene permits one to produce the corresponding protein starting from Ser10 in the original amino acid sequence (9Lacour T. Dumas B. Gene. 1996; 174: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The expression of the glutathione S-transferase/Arh1p fusion protein (GST-Arh1p) was established in E. coli BL21 transformed with pTG10986 (18Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). The presence of the GST-Arh1p fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). A protein with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa was observed in the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate. It fits well with the expected size of GST (27 kDa) (20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar) fused to r-Arh1p (55 kDa). The fusion protein was enriched by affinity column chromatography and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 3). This extract mainly contained two proteins presenting apparent molecular masses of 85 and 67 kDa, respectively. The amino-terminal sequences of these proteins were determined. The 85-kDa protein presents a unique polypeptide, MSPILGYKI, corresponding to the amino-terminal region of GST. This sequence, together with the molecular mass of 85 kDa, indicates that this protein corresponds to the GST-Arh1p fusion protein. The amino-terminal sequence of the 67-kDa protein shows a unique polypeptide, AAKDVKFGNDARV, corresponding to the bacterial chaperonin GroEL. The prepurified extract, containing the 85-kDa protein, was treated with factor Xa in order to cleave off the GST protein (Fig. 2, lane 4). In that case, the amino-terminal sequence of the major 64-kDa protein, IELDKFENMGA, allowed us to identify a truncated form of the chaperonin GroEL starting at amino acid 57. Following the protease treatment, the protein extract was loaded onto the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. GST was retained on the column, whereas r-Arh1p was collected in the flow-through. Two major proteins were observed in this final extract (Fig. 2, lane 5): a 67-kDa protein, of which the amino-terminal sequence, AAKDVKFGNDARV, corresponds to the amino terminus of the bacterial chaperonin GroEL, and a 63-kDa protein, of which the amino-terminal sequence, XXQINRXXVXXVG, corresponds to the amino-terminal region of r-Arh1p. Using experimental data derived from amino-terminal sequences, the final purified product contained around 15% Arh1p and 85% GroEL. Thus, the final yield of purified product was about 0.1 mg of r-Arh1p per liter. In this purification system, r-Arh1p and the bacterial chaperonin GroEL co-purified. It was not possible to get rid of this chaperonin, even in the presence of ATP and GroES, as recently described (27Thain A. Gaston K. Jenkins O. Clarke A.R. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 209-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the partially purified r-Arh1p contained in this bacterial extract was used for biochemical characterization. Properties of the partially purified r-Arh1p were analyzed in vitro in comparison with purified bovine ADR. The latter is known to transfer electrons from NADPH to ferricyanide. It also reduces ADX in mitochondrial cytochrome P450 systems in a physiological reaction (P45011β and P450SCC) or cytochrome c reduction, a nonphysiological reaction. The ability of r-Arh1p to replace bovine ADR in these electron transport systems was challenged. As a control, anE. coli extract of BL21/pGEX4T3 expressing GST was prepared according to the r-Arh1p purification protocol. The reduction of ferricyanide was observed in the presence of the partially purified r-Arh1p and NADPH (Fig. 3 A). On the contrary, a bacterial extract of the strain E. coli BL21/pGEX4T3 that did not contain r-Arh1p was unable to reduce ferricyanide. This strongly suggests that Arh1p is the protein in the bacterial extract capable of reducing ferricyanide. The reduction of cytochrome c was observed in the presence of partially purified r-Arh1p, purified bovine ADX, and NADPH (Fig. 3 B). On the contrary, the control extract, in which r-Arh1p is absent, did not support cytochrome c reduction. Again, r-Arh1p in the bacterial extract appears to be the protein supporting cytochrome c reduction. Cytochrome c is not reduced in the presence of NADPH and r-Arh1p. Thus, r-Arh1p is unable to transfer directly electrons to cytochrome c. Similarly, bovine ADX cannot reduce cytochrome c in the absence of r-Arh1p. Consequently, Arh1p and bovine ADX seem to form an electron transfer chain allowing the cytochrome c reduction. In comparison with the mammalian electron transport system, in which electrons flow from ADR to cytochromes via ADX (21Lambeth J.D. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2766-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), r-ARH1p is assumed to transfer electrons from NADPH to ADX, which in turn reduces the cytochrome c. The hydroxylation of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol in the in vitro 11β hydroxylation reaction was also analyzed (Fig. 3 C). The production of cortisol was observed in the presence of the bovine cytochrome P45011β, ADX, and NADPH together with the partially purified r-Arh1p. As a control, a bacterial extract that did not contain r-Arh1p did not support the production of cortisol. This phenomenon points out the implication of r-Arh1p in the hydroxylation reaction. Cortisol production was completely dependent on the presence of r-Arh1p and ADX together with P45011β and NADPH. As already observed in the cytochrome c reduction, r-Arh1p and bovine ADX seem to form an electron transfer chain to support the activity of cytochrome P45011β. Arh1p is assumed to transfer electrons from NADPH to ADX. The interaction of the partially purified r-Arh1p with different substrates was determined using the cytochrome c reduction. The Michaelis constant of r-Arh1p with NADPH, NADH,"
https://openalex.org/W1990123939,"We have analyzed protein-DNA interactionsin vivo at transcriptional control elements for two hypoxia-inducible genes in mouse hepatoma cells. The promoter for the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) gene contains an initiator element, but no TATA sequence, whereas the promoter for the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) gene contains a TATA element but no initiator sequence. Our findings reveal hypoxia-inducible, Arnt-dependent occupancy of DNA recognition sites for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) upstream of both target genes. The conserved recognition motif among the five recognition sites is 5′-CGTG-3′. The PGK1 promoter exhibits constitutive occupancy of a binding site for an unknown protein(s); however, we detect no protein-DNA interaction at the initiator element, in either uninduced or induced cells. The Glut1 promoter also exhibits constitutive protein binding; in addition, the TATA element exhibits partial occupancy in uninduced cells and increased occupancy under hypoxic conditions. We find no evidence for hypoxia-induced changes in chromatin structure of either gene. Time-course analyses of the Glut1 gene reveal a temporal relationship between occupancy of HIF-1 sites and TATA element occupancy. Our findings suggest that the promoters for both hypoxia-responsive genes constitutively maintain an accessible chromatin configuration and that HIF-1 facilitates transcription by recruiting and/or stabilizing a transcription factor(s), such as TFIID, at both promoters. We have analyzed protein-DNA interactionsin vivo at transcriptional control elements for two hypoxia-inducible genes in mouse hepatoma cells. The promoter for the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) gene contains an initiator element, but no TATA sequence, whereas the promoter for the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) gene contains a TATA element but no initiator sequence. Our findings reveal hypoxia-inducible, Arnt-dependent occupancy of DNA recognition sites for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) upstream of both target genes. The conserved recognition motif among the five recognition sites is 5′-CGTG-3′. The PGK1 promoter exhibits constitutive occupancy of a binding site for an unknown protein(s); however, we detect no protein-DNA interaction at the initiator element, in either uninduced or induced cells. The Glut1 promoter also exhibits constitutive protein binding; in addition, the TATA element exhibits partial occupancy in uninduced cells and increased occupancy under hypoxic conditions. We find no evidence for hypoxia-induced changes in chromatin structure of either gene. Time-course analyses of the Glut1 gene reveal a temporal relationship between occupancy of HIF-1 sites and TATA element occupancy. Our findings suggest that the promoters for both hypoxia-responsive genes constitutively maintain an accessible chromatin configuration and that HIF-1 facilitates transcription by recruiting and/or stabilizing a transcription factor(s), such as TFIID, at both promoters. basic helix-loop-helix Per/Arnt/Sim aromatic hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator aromatic hydrocarbon receptor 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hypoxia-inducible factor-1α glucose transporter 1 phos- phoglycerate kinase 1 initiator dimethyl sulfate ligation-mediated PCR polymerase chain reaction trachealess single-minded TATA-binding protein transcription factor IID TBP-associated factor. Perturbations in the environment present a continual challenge to cellular systems responsible for maintaining homeostasis. In some cases, cells utilize transcriptional pathways for adapting to change; such responses present opportunities to understand better the mechanisms by which environmental signals alter the expression of specific sets of genes. The bHLH/PAS1 class of proteins mediate several important transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli. These proteins interact with each other via their HLH (helix-loop-helix) domains to form transcription factors (usually heterodimers and usually activators) that bind to DNA via their basic (b) regions (1Schmidt J.V.

The PAS domains contribute to protein-protein interactions and to other functions (4Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L.

The designation PAS stands for the three proteins first discovered to contain the domains: Per, aDrosophila protein that helps regulate circadian rhythmicity; Arnt, a protein that heterodimerizes with the mammalian aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in mediating transcriptional responses to xenobiotics like dioxin; and Sim, a protein implicated in Drosophila central nervous system development (7Huang Z.J.

Induction of microsomal cytochrome P4501A1 by the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a well studied example of an adaptive transcriptional response mediated by a bHLH/PAS heterodimer. TCDD enters the cell and binds AhR; subsequently, the liganded AhR heterodimerizes with Arnt, and AhR/Arnt binds to enhancer DNA upstream of the CYP1A1 gene, thereby inducing its transcription (1Schmidt J.V.

The induced cytochrome P4501A1 enzyme catalyzes the initial oxygenation step in a metabolic pathway that converts lipophilic substrates to water-soluble derivatives, facilitating their elimination from the cell. Metabolism by cytochrome P4501A1 primarily facilitates detoxification; thus, enzyme induction represents adaptation to a chemical exposure. However, the oxygenation reaction can also generate electrophilic reactants that are potentially toxic or carcinogenic, particularly when detoxification pathways become saturated (10Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar). bHLH/PAS proteins also mediate transcriptional responses to physiological perturbations, such as decreased oxygen tension. Hypoxia stabilizes the bHLH/PAS protein known as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) thereby causing it to accumulate within the cell; HIF-1α heterodimerizes with Arnt to form a DNA-binding transcription factor known as hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 mediates adaptive responses to low oxygen tension, such as the induction of genes encoding erythropoietin and some glycolytic enzymes (11Wang G. Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar, 13Guillemin K. Krasnow M.K.

The AhR/Arnt and HIF-1α/Arnt heterodimers constitute useful models for analyzing the action of bHLH/PAS proteins. The study of such prototypes is likely to generate general insights because bHLH/PAS proteins contribute to diverse biological processes required both for normal development and for adaptation to the environment (14Schmidt J.V.

We have previously developed techniques for studying AhR/Arnt function in intact cells, and we have analyzed TCDD-induced alterations in protein-DNA interactions and chromatin structure at theCYP1A1 gene in mouse hepatoma cells in vivo(23Okino S.T.

These experimental approaches permit us to study the action of bHLH/PAS proteins at chromosomal target genes under physiological conditions. Here, we have studied the response to hypoxia in vivo, and we have analyzed protein-DNA interactions at two genes, Glut1, which encodes a glucose transporter, and PGK1, which encodes phosphoglycerate kinase 1, an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. We chose to study the induction of these two genes because one (Glut1) has a transcriptional promoter that contains a TATA element but no initiator sequence, while the other (PGK1) has a transcriptional promoter that contains an initiator element but no TATA sequence (26Murakami T.

Therefore, our findings provide new insights not only into the action of the bHLH/PAS heterodimer HIF-1, but also into the function of two different types of mammalian promoters in vivo.

Total RNA was isolated from cells subjected to normoxic or hypoxic conditions using RNeasy spin columns according to the manufacturer's directions. Ten μg of total RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.

Cells subjected to normoxic or hypoxic conditions were removed from the incubator, and DMS was immediately dispersed into the culture medium (5 μl of DMS/ml of culture medium). The cells were incubated at 22 °C for 2.5 min under normoxic conditions, the culture medium was removed, and the cell monolayer was rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. 2 ml of stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mmNaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 600 μg/ml proteinase K) was then added to each plate and the viscous solution was collected into a 15-ml conical polypropylene tube containing 2 ml of dilution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h.

After a 2.5-min incubation under normoxic conditions, the digestion buffer was removed and was replaced by 2 ml of stop buffer. The viscous solution was collected into a 15-ml conical polypropylene tube containing 2 ml of dilution buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h.

Two bHLH/PAS proteins, HIF-1α and Arnt, form a heterodimer, designated as HIF-1, which regulates responses to low oxygen tension, such as adaptive increases in PGK1 and Glut1 transcription (30Li H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As a prelude to our analyses of hypoxia-inducible PGK1 and Glut1 gene expressionin vivo, we verified that, in mouse hepatoma cells, the induction mechanism for both genes involves HIF-1. We determined the requirement for Arnt by analyzing gene expression in Arnt-defective cells (Fig. 1). Studies of mRNA levels in uninduced cells reveal that both wild-type and Arnt-defective cells express the PGK1 and Glut1 genes constitutively; therefore, neither gene requires Arnt for basal expression. In contrast, low oxygen tension induces PGK1 and Glut1 mRNA in wild-type cells but not in Arnt-defective cells. Reconstitution of Arnt-defective cells with Arnt cDNA restores the response of both genes to hypoxia. Therefore, for both genes, hypoxia-responsiveness requires Arnt. In addition, the regulation of inducible expression differs from that of basal expression, because the former requires Arnt while the latter does not. Because induction requires Arnt, it also presumably requires Arnt's hypoxia-responsive heterodimerization partner, HIF-1α. However, mouse hepatoma cells defective in HIF-1α are not available, so we cannot perform genetic reconstitution experiments to document the need for HIF-1α. Therefore, we used other approaches to implicate HIF-1α in the induction mechanism, as described below. Previous electrophoretic mobility shift studies suggested that the HIF-1α/Arnt heterodimer binds to a “consensus” DNA sequence, 5′-(A/G)CGTG-3′ (12Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar, 35Semenza G.L. Jiang B.-H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.-P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar); this sequence occurs in the 5′ flanking region of both the Glut1 and PGK1 genes and confers hypoxia-responsiveness upon a reporter gene in transient transfection experiments (36Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Therefore, if HIF-1α/Arnt mediates inducible gene expression in vivo, we envisioned that these consensus sequences would exhibit hypoxia-inducible, Arnt-dependent occupancy. To test this idea, we used an LMPCR footprinting method (39Muller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) to analyze the pattern of protein-DNA interactions at the potential HIF-1 binding sites in vivo. Our findings (Fig. 2, A and B) reveal that, in uninduced wild-type cells, the DNA encompassing the potential HIF-1 binding sites upstream of the PGK1 and Glut1 genes exhibits a DNase I digestion pattern similar to that of naked DNA. These findings imply that HIF-1 sites are unoccupied in uninduced cells in vivo. This result is consistent with the observation that basal expression of both genes occurs in Arnt-defective cells (Fig. 1) and, therefore, does not require the HIF-1α/Arnt heterodimer. In contrast, hypoxia-induced cells exhibit two neighboring DNase I footprints upstream of the PGK1 gene and one DNase I footprint upstream of the Glut1 gene in vivo. The footprints are Arnt-dependent, because they are absent in Arnt-defective cells but occur in Arnt-defective cells reconstituted with Arnt. These findings reveal hypoxia-inducible, Arnt-dependent protein-DNA interactions in vivo within regions that contain DNA sequences known to bind HIF-1 in vitro. We also performed in vivo footprinting using DMS as a probe; this technique is more precise than DNase I footprinting because it can delineate the specific guanine residues that interact with proteins bound in the major DNA groove. Our findings reveal that in uninduced cells, the pattern of guanine methylation by DMS is similar to that of naked DNA, again implying that proteins do not bind to these regions under normoxic conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, induced cells exhibit a pattern of methylation protection that indicates occupancy of three HIF-1 binding sites upstream of the PGK1 gene and two HIF-1 sites upstream of the Glut1 gene (Fig. 2,A–C). Their DNA sequences reveal that each of the five protein binding sites contains a 5′-CGTG-3′ sequence, with considerable variability in the neighboring nucleotides; thus, there is no obvious consensus sequence in vivo beyond the tetranucleotide region (Fig. 2 D). At each site, the guanine residues protectedin vivo are those that interact with HIF-1 in vitro, as measured previously in a methylation interference analysis (Ref. 40Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 2 D). These findings imply that the hypoxia-inducible protein-DNA interactions identified in vivo reflect the binding of HIF-1 to cognate recognition motifs upstream of the PGK1 and Glut1 genes. Note that our in vivoanalyses reveal the existence of two additional HIF-1 binding sites (centered at −218 upstream of the PGK1 transcription start site and at −3008 upstream of the Glut1 transcription start site) that were not previously identified using reporter gene or mobility shift assays. We also performed several in vitro experiments to further analyze the DNA sites identified in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility shift studies reveal that nuclear extracts derived from mouse hepatoma cells contain a hypoxia-inducible factor, presumably HIF-1, that binds to the DNA sites occupied in vivo. Furthermore, mutation of the guanines known to interact with protein abolishes the inducible protein-DNA interaction in vitro (data not shown). Also, HIF-1α and Arnt cDNAs expressed together by in vitro transcription/translation interact with the wild-type, but not with the mutant, HIF-1 sites (data not shown). Finally, reporter gene studies reveal that the wild-type HIF-1 sites, but not the mutant sites, confer hypoxia responsiveness upon a luciferase gene after transient transfection into wild-type cells, but not after transfection into Arnt-defective cells (data not shown). These in vitroexperiments impute a functional role to the inducible protein-DNA interactions identified in vivo. In our previous studies of dioxin-induced CYP1A1 gene expression in vivo, we observed a substantial increase in the nuclease susceptibility of DNA in the vicinity of chromosomal binding sites for the AhR/Arnt heterodimer; such findings signify a change in chromatin structure from a relatively inaccessible to an accessible configuration (23Okino S.T. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is notable that we do not detect analogous hypoxia-inducible increases in the nuclease susceptibility of DNA surrounding the HIF-1 binding sites in vivo (data not shown); this finding implies that the inducible occupancy of HIF-1 binding sites upstream of the PGK1 and Glut1 genes occurs without an increase in DNA accessibility or a substantial change in chromatin structure. Therefore, we surmise that the hypoxia-inducible protein-DNA interactions take place within a chromatin structure that is constitutively accessible to HIF-1. We envision that occupancy of HIF-1 binding sites upstream of the PGK1 and Glut1 promoters is necessary for induction of gene expression and that the binding of HIF-1 activates both promoters by a similar mechanism. It is of interest that the two promoters have different organizations; the Glut1 promoter contains a TATA element but no initiator (Inr) sequence, whereas the PGK1 promoter is TATA-less, but contains an Inr element. Therefore, as an initial step in understanding promoter function in a native chromosomal context, we analyzed the occupancy of both promoters in vivo in both uninduced and induced cells. The PGK1 promoter does not contain a TATA sequence, and transcription starts at an Inr element (27McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Analyses of the PGK1 promoter in vivo (Fig. 3.) reveal that uninduced cells exhibit a DNase I footprint upstream of the Inr element, indicative of constitutive protein binding in the region spanning −20 to −80; this result agrees with observations made on the human PGK1 promoter (41Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 42Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We detect no in vivoprotein-DNA interaction at the Inr site in uninduced cells, even though the PGK1 gene exhibits constitutive expression. An 18-h period of hypoxia produces no detectable changes in the pattern of protein-DNA interactions at the PGK1 promoter; notably, there is no evidence of inducible protein binding at the Inr region even in the face of increased gene expression. We assume that PGK1 transcription requires a protein-DNA interaction(s) at the Inr (43Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 44Zawal L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); our data imply that the interaction in vivo is not strong enough to be detected by DNase I footprinting. Analysis of the PGK1 promoter using DMS as a probe reveals constitutive protection of several guanine residues within the constitutive DNase I footprint; therefore, the constitutive protein binding occurs in the major DNA groove. We observe no alteration in the pattern of guanine modification after induction. Together, our findings reveal that induction of PGK1 gene expression is not associated with detectable changes in occupancy of the PGK1 promoter using in vivofootprinting techniques. Therefore, we infer that the protein-DNA interactions associated with hypoxia-inducible transcription from an Inr-driven promoter are relatively weak, at least when compared with those at a TATA-driven promoter (see below). In addition, we observe no increase in the susceptibility of the PGK1 promoter to DNase I during induction (data not shown). These findings contrast with our previous observations at the CYP1A1 promoter, which undergoes a substantial increase in accessibility during induction of gene expression by dioxin (23Okino S.T. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 45Morgan J.E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11622-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The lack of an induced increase in nuclease susceptibility, together with constitutive protein binding, implies that the PGK1 promoter assumes an accessible chromatin structure in both uninduced and induced cells. Therefore, we envision that communication of the induction signal from HIF-1 binding sites to the PGK1 promoter does not involve substantial remodeling of chromatin. The Glut1 promoter contains a TATA element about 30 bp upstream of the transcription start site and has no initiator element. Analysis of the Glut1 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4) reveals that uninduced cells exhibit a DNase I footprint spanning −84 to −73, implying that a protein(s) binds constitutively to a region upstream of the TATA element. Analyses using DMS imply multiple guanine residues participate in the constitutive protein-DNA interaction and that binding occurs in the major DNA groove. Thus, like the PGK1 promoter, a region of the Glut1 promoter exhibits constitutive in vivo occupancy; studies in hypoxic cells indicate that occupancy persists during induction of gene expression. In vivo DNase I footprinting reveals partial occupancy of the TATA element in uninduced cells; this finding is consistent with constitutive expression of the Glut1 gene. Hypoxia-induced cells exhibit a stronger DNase I footprint at the TATA element, implying that induction increases occupancy of this sitein vivo (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). (Note that DMS is not useful for analyzing the TATA element, because the site contains no guanines and because the TATA-binding protein occupies the minor DNA groove (46Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 47Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar).). Thus, our findings indicate that induction of Glut1 gene expression is associated with increased occupancy of the TATA element. However, the increase in TATA occupancy is not accompanied by an increase in nuclease susceptibility of the Glut1 promoter in induced cells (data not shown). This finding, together with constitutive protein binding, suggests that the Glut1 promoter is in an accessible configuration in uninduced cells and does not undergo a major change in chromatin structure during induction. Both the PGK1 and the Glut1 promoters appear to assume a chromatin structure that is constitutively accessible. Therefore, we infer that the primary role of HIF-1 binding at upstream sites is to facilitate promoter occupancy by increasing the availability of a transcription factor(s) at the promoter rather than by relieving a repressive chromatin structure. HIF-1 could increase the availability of transcription factors by recruiting them to the promoter. HIF-1 could also stabilize protein binding at the promoter. Recruitment and stabilization imply the existence of a temporal relationship between upstream binding of HIF-1 and downstream promoter occupancy. Therefore, we analyzed the time course of HIF-1 occupancy and TATA element occupancy in vivo during induction and de-induction of the Glut1 gene. (We could not perform analogous studies for PGK1, because its promoter exhibits no inducible changes.) Our findings (Fig. 5 A) reveal that HIF-1 bindingin vivo is maximal after 2 h of hypoxia and remains maximal for at least 18 h. Induced occupancy of the TATA element exhibits a similar time course (Fig. 5 B). The coincidence between HIF-1 occupancy and TATA occupancy during induction is consistent with a recruitment and/or a stabilization mechanism. During de-induction (i.e. after restoration of normoxia), occupancy of HIF-1 binding sites in vivo becomes undetectable within 10 min (Fig. 5 A). Presumably, the loss of HIF-1 binding reflects the rapid degradation of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions (48Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). During de-induction, TATA occupancy in vivo falls to uninduced levels within 1 h (Fig. 5 B). Thus, TATA occupancy is not sustained in the absence of HIF-1 binding upstream. This finding implies that HIF-1 may stabilize occupancy of the TATA element in vivo. We have analyzed protein-DNA interactions at the hypoxia-responsive PGK1 and Glut1 genes in vivo. Our findings relate constitutive and inducible occupancy of protein binding sites to basal and inducible gene expression from two different types of promoters. Our studies suggest that HIF-1 facilitates core promoter occupancy via recruitment and/or stabilization processes. Our in vivo observations provide a working model for hypoxia-inducible gene expression that can be tested in future studies of chromatin structure, interactions between HIF-1 and other transcription factors, and promoter-binding proteins. Such experiments have the potential to reveal novel aspects of bHLH/PAS protein function. Our studies identify five in vivo binding sites for the HIF-1α/Arnt heterodimer. We do not observe a strong consensus recognition sequence among the five sites; the only common motif is the tetranucleotide 5′-CGTG-3′. We note that this same tetranucleotide is present in each of the DNA binding sites for the AhR/Arnt heterodimer and is required for dioxin responsiveness (49Shen E.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6815-6819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the HIF-1α/Arnt and AhR/Arnt heterodimers share a core DNA recognition sequence. UV cross-linking studies imply that the 5′-CGTG-3′ tetranucleotide interacts largely with the Arnt component of the AhR/Arnt heterodimer (50Bacsi S.G. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 432-438PubMed Google Scholar). We envision that it also interacts with the Arnt component of HIF-1α/Arnt. The in vivo binding sites do not exhibit other features that can clearly account for the DNA binding specificity of HIF-1α/Arnt versus AhR/Arnt. This situation is reminiscent of that for the Drosophila bHLH/PAS proteins Trh (trachealess) and Sim (single-minded), both of which form heterodimers with Arnt; the Trh/Arnt and Sim/Arnt heterodimers regulate different sets of genes but bind to the same DNA sequence, which includes the 5′-CGTG-3′ motif. Domain swapping studies reveal that the PAS regions of Trh and Sim confer DNA recognition specificity upon the respective heterodimers (5Zelzer E. Wappner P. Shilo B.-Z. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). By analogy, we hypothesize that a similar situation exists for the hypoxia-responsive and dioxin-responsive regulatory systems and that the PAS domains of AhR and HIF-1α contribute to specific DNA recognition. Our in vivo footprinting experiments reveal constitutive and hypoxia-inducible occupancy of the TATA element at the Glut1 promoter. These footprints presumably reflect the binding of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to DNA. Within the cell, TBP is part of a protein complex known as transcription factor IID (TFIID), which contains additional components, known as TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In vitroexperiments imply that TAFs interact with DNA, albeit more weakly than TBP does (51Oelgeschläger T. Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The binding of TFIID to a TATA-containing promoter (via TBP) permits the formation of a preinitiation transcription complex, which includes RNA polymerase II and other factors (44Zawal L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 52Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 53Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 54Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The protein(s) that interacts with Inr-containing promoters is not yet established. In vitro experiments (e.g. DNase I footprinting, electrophoretic mobility shift studies, in vitro transcription) imply that a TAF(s) can bind and activate (some) TATA-less, Inr-containing promoters (43Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 55Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The interaction between TFIID and Inr DNA is weaker than the TFIID-TATA interaction, as estimated in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (43Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Therefore, our inability to detect protein-DNA interactions at the PGK1 Inr in vivo is not surprising and is consistent with in vitroobservations. Because TFIID can mediate the formation of preinitiation complexes at both TATA-containing and TATA-less, Inr-containing promoters, we envision that the induction mechanism for both PGK1 and Glut1 reflects HIF-1-mediated recruitment and/or stabilization of TFIID at the respective promoters. It is unknown why some promoters utilize a TATA element and others utilize an Inr element to initiate transcription. The two elements are not interchangeable; for example, a TATA sequence cannot substitute for the native Inr element on the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase promoter (56Garraway I.P. Semple K. Smale S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4336-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is possible that TATA-driven promoters and Inr-driven promoters respond differentially to particular activators or inhibitors. If so, future studies may reveal that the PGK1 and Glut1 genes differ in their responsiveness to some signals, even though both genes respond to hypoxia via an apparently similar mechanism. These two hypoxia-responsive genes may constitute a useful experimental system for analyzing functional differences between mammalian TATA-containing and Inr-containing transcriptional promoters. We envision that protein-protein interactions are important in the recruitment of TFIID. HIF-1 might interact either with a component of the TFIID complex or with an intermediary (co-activator) protein. For example, others have suggested that p300/CBP functions as a co-activator during transcriptional adaptation to hypoxia (57Arany Z. Huang E.L. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn F.H. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Thus, HIF-1 might recruit TFIID via p300/CBP. Recruitment does not require Arnt's C-terminal domain because Arnt-defective cells reconstituted with truncated Arnt cDNAs respond to hypoxia (30Li H. Ko H.P. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21262-21267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We envision that a domain(s) of HIF-1α that contains transactivation capability is primarily responsible for recruiting TFIID to the Glut1 and PGK1 promoters. The availability of HIF-1α-defective cells will facilitate testing this hypothesis (32Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The PGK1 and Glut1 promoters exhibit constitutive expression; a protein(s) binds constitutively to each promoter in vivo; neither promoter exhibits an increase in nuclease susceptibility following induction. These observations imply that, in vivo,promoter chromatin is accessible to DNA-binding proteins under both uninduced and induced conditions. The mechanism for generating and maintaining an accessible chromatin structure is unknown. One possibility is that the constitutively bound proteins prevent nucleosome formation at the Glut1 and PGK1 promoters. In addition, the constitutively bound proteins might interact with a component(s) of TFIID, thereby stabilizing promoter occupancy and facilitating basal and inducible gene expression. These are intriguing areas for future study. Searches of the genomic data base indicate that the bHLH/PAS class of proteins contains numerous members, many of which remain to be characterized. Phylogenetic analyses of proteins containing PAS domains imply that HIF-1α, Arnt, and AhR are prototypes that have diverged from an ancient ancestor (58Hahn M.E. Karchner S.I. Shapiro M.A. Perera S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Their conservation during evolution suggests that bHLH/PAS proteins play interesting and important roles in both vertebrate and invertebrate species. Therefore, knowledge of bHLH/PAS protein function obtained in studies of prototypes such as HIF-1α, AhR, and Arnt has broad implications for understanding fundamental biological processes involving gene regulation and development.

However, the change in p130 phosphorylation in response to α-IFN occurs before dephosphorylation of pRb is complete because loss of p130 Form 3 occurs throughout the cell cycle prior to complete arrest in G1, whereas pRb is dephosphorylated only in G1. In contrast, p107 is dephosphorylated and is then depleted from cells as they exit the cell cycle. p130, predominantly in Form 1, and hypophosphorylated pRb bind an E2F DNA binding site; p130 complexes E2F-4, whereas pRb binds both E2F-4 and E2F-1. The phosphorylated forms of E2F-4 that bind to the E2F DNA site are different from hyperphosphorylated E2F-4, which predominates in primary hemopoietic cells in G0.

The protein encoded by the RB gene, pRb, is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is involved in regulating progression through G1 into S phase (reviewed in Refs. 1Goodrich D.W. Lee W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). It is hypophosphorylated in G0 and is phosphorylated progressively as quiescent cells progress through G1, reaching a hyperphosphorylated form at the G1-S border. Hyperphosphorylation is thought to inactivate pRb, allowing cells to enter S phase. Microinjection of an excess of purified, hypophosphorylated pRb up to mid G1 results in reversible cell cycle arrest (1Goodrich D.W. Lee W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, pRb may only be required up to a point some time in mid- or late G1, and there is evidence that pRb forms part of the mechanism controlling the G1restriction point (reviewed in Ref. 2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar).pRb is thought to be phosphorylated by a succession of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks),1 which are activated at different times during G1: for example, cdk6 and cdk4 are activated in early or mid-G1, followed by cdk2 in late G1 (reviewed in Ref. 3Tiwari S. Jamal R. Thomas N.S.B. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Academic Press, London1996: 255-282Google Scholar). pRb then remains hyperphosphorylated throughout the rest of the cell cycle and is dephosphorylated to a hypophosphorylated state during mitosis, possibly by a type 1 serine-threonine phosphatase (4Durfee T.

Like pRb, they are phosphoproteins that have consensus sites for phosphorylation by cdks. In T98G cells that are entering the cell cycle for the first time from G0, p130 is phosphorylated to Form 3 during mid G1, which coincides with the phosphorylation of pRb and the induction of cyclin D1 (13Mayol X.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1340-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).The hypophosphorylated form of pRb will bind transcription factors, such as E2F, which regulate genes encoding proteins that are required for cell cycle progression (reviewed in Ref. 22Lam E.W.-F.

Thomas N.S.B. Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Control in Cancer. Bios Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1995: 77-92Google Scholar).

Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar); for example, the genes for dihydrofolate reductase and thymidine kinase by E2F-2, for cyclin A and cdc2 by both E2F-1 and -2, and for cdk2 by E2F-3. Thus individual genes with specific E2F binding sites in their promoters are regulated by specific E2Fs, and so regulation of individual E2F-DP combinations by different pRb family members provides a mechanism for turning the transcription of specific genes on or off at specific times during entry into the cell cycle. Indeed, pRb, p107, and p130 have been shown to bind individual E2Fs at different stages during entry into the first cell cycle (Ref. 26Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and references therein), and so transcription controlled by specific E2Fs could be repressed at different times. Such coordinated activation of transcription is required for cell proliferation because transfection of either pRb, p107, or p130 will prevent progression into the cell cycle, which can be overcome by increased expression of individual E2Fs (17Vario G. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 38Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5556-5560PubMed Google Scholar). However, suppression of cell proliferation by p107 and pRb are not the same. There are two domains in p107, either of which will prevent proliferation (41Zhu L. Enders G. Lees J.A. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar): one domain binds E2F, and in this respect the mechanism of growth inhibition may be similar to that of pRb; the second growth-inhibitory domain of p107 binds cyclin A or E-cdk2, and this domain does not have a counterpart in pRb. pRb and p107 may also differ in that the c-Myc protein, which is important in driving proliferation, is inhibited by binding to p107 (42Beijersbergen R.L. Hijmans E.M. Zhu L. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4080-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating E2F activity, pRb also regulates the activity of all three classes of RNA polymerases (reviewed in Ref. 43Nasmyth K. Nature. 1996; 382: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The balance between particular E2Fs and pRb or p130 is clearly important in determining whether a cell proliferates, remains quiescent, or is driven to apoptosis. Cells driven by E2F-1 enter the cell cycle and then die later by apoptosis (44Shan B. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8166-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 45Kowalik T.F.

A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). E2F-2 and E2F-3 also cause cells to enter S phase, but neither causes apoptosis (37DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Thus, E2F-driven entry into S phase and the induction of apoptosis are not linked; rather, induction of apoptosis is unique to E2F-1. This has lead to the suggestion that E2F-1 but not E2F-2 or E2F-3 specifically induces genes that trigger apoptosis and that a proliferating cell is therefore primed for apoptosis unless rescued by the presence of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as pRb (48Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.C. Levi D. Dazin P. T'Ang A. Fung Y.-K.T. Israel M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) or p53 (37DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).From what has been described above, it is clear that regulation of cell cycle entry is complex and involves a coordinated series of phosphorylations of key cell cycle proteins and the activation of a number of genes. Cell cycle exit is also complex, and this is illustrated by the way α-IFN causes cell cycle arrest. α-IFN, which is naturally secreted as a component of the host defense mechanisms of the body, has marked antiviral properties, but α-IFN also has antiproliferative effects on certain cell types (49Baron S. Tyring S.K. Fleischman Jr., W.R. Coppenhaver D.H. Niesel D.W. Klimpel G.R. Stanton G.J. Hughes T.K. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1991; 266: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-IFN was thought to exert its antiproliferative effect in part via the pRb pathway (5Burke L.C. Bybee A. Thomas N.S.B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar, 7Thomas N.S.B. Burke L.C. Bybee A. Linch D.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 317-322PubMed Google Scholar, 50Resnitzky D. Teifenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc.

However, the cytostatic effect of α-IFN may be mediated by a more complicated series of mechanisms that lead to orderly cell cycle arrest rather than triggering apoptosis. We know about some of the processes involved: cdk activity is decreased (51Arany I. Rady P. Tyring S.K. Antiviral Res. 1994; 23: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 52Thomas N.S B. J.

The initial phosphorylation of pRb during G1A is prevented (5Burke L.C. Bybee A. Thomas N.S.B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar), and free E2F binding to DNA is reduced (8Melamed D.

Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5668-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a protein that sequesters E2F in a form that does not bind DNA. Other transcription factors that are involved in controlling cell proliferation are also down-regulated. For example, the activity and abundance of the Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors is decreased (64Dent C.L. Lillycrop K.A. Bybee A. Latchman D.S. Thomas N.S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20888-20892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and α-IFN also causes the depletion of the c-MYC protein (51Arany I. Rady P. Tyring S.K.

However, the processes regulating entry into the cell cycle (G0→G1→S) may be different from those regulating cell cycle progression through G1 in actively cycling cells (M→G1→S) (67Zetterberg A. Thomas N.S.B. Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Control in Cancer. Bios Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1996: 17-36Google Scholar) and are poorly understood. This is particularly important because negative growth factors, such as α-IFN, exert their effects on actively cycling cells. We showed previously that α-IFN causes inhibition of pRb phosphorylation and that this only occurs in G1 (5Burke L.C. Bybee A. Thomas N.S.B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar, 7Thomas N.S.B. Burke L.C. Bybee A. Linch D.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 317-322PubMed Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we investigated whether p130 and p107 are regulated by α-IFN and whether their regulation is also cell cycle-dependent. Our studies show that regulation of the phosphorylation of pRb and p107 is different from that of p130 during the cell cycle of actively proliferating cells and that each is regulated in a different manner by α-IFN as cells exit the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONMany proteins that are involved in controlling cell proliferation are regulated in susceptible cells by α-IFN (reviewed in Ref. 70Thomas N.S.B. Degos L. Linch D. Lowenberg B. Textbook of Malignant Haematology. Martin Dunitz Publishers, London1999: 133-152Google Scholar). The Daudi B-cell line has been used for a number of these studies because it is sensitive to growth arrest by α-IFN. Proliferating Daudi cells cultured with α-IFN arrest in G1, and this is accompanied by the dephosphorylation of pRb to a hypophosphorylated form (5Burke L.C. Bybee A. Thomas N.S.B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar, 7Thomas N.S.B. Burke L.C. Bybee A. Linch D.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 317-322PubMed Google Scholar, 50Resnitzky D. Teifenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently (62Iwase S. Furukawa Y. Kikuchi J. Nagai M. Terui Y. Nakamura M. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12406-12414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it was shown that this causes pRb to complex with E2F-1 and E2F-4, and it was suggested that this results in repression of E2F-containing promoters, such as those in thecdc2 and c-myc genes. We showed previously (5Burke L.C. Bybee A. Thomas N.S.B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar) that in response to α-IFN, pRb is dephosphorylated only in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and so it is only able to repress E2F activity once proliferating cells have entered G1. pRb is the first member of a family of proteins that also includes p130 and p107, each of which can bind and repress E2Fs (3Tiwari S. Jamal R. Thomas N.S.B. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Academic Press, London1996: 255-282Google Scholar, 23Whyte P. Thomas N.S.B. Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Control in Cancer. Bios Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford1995: 77-92Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we investigated whether α-IFN regulates p130 and p107 and to what extent their regulation is also cell cycle-dependent.We determined first whether the phosphorylation states of pRb, p130, and p107 are regulated in different cell cycle phases during continuous proliferation. Second, we investigated whether dephosphorylation of each is regulated coordinately during α-IFN-mediated cell cycle arrest. To answer these questions, we employed a rapid fixation method, followed by flow cytometric sorting and Western blotting, a protocol that we have used previously to analyze pRb (5Burke L.C. Bybee A. Thomas N.S.B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that (i) in actively cycling Daudi cells, p130 is present predominantly as phosphorylated Form 3 in all cell cycle phases. p107 is hypophosphorylated in G1A, becomes hyperphosphorylated in G1B, and remains fully phosphorylated throughout the remainder of the cell cycle. Regulation of the phosphorylation state of p107 during G1 is similar to pRb, except that pRb is partially phosphorylated in G1A (not hypophosphorylated) and is hyperphosphorylated from G1B onwards (5Burke L.C. Bybee A. Thomas N.S.B. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 783-788PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) In cells arrested with α-IFN, p130 Form 3 is depleted, possibly by dephosphorylation, and principally Form 1, with some Form 2, predominates in every cell cycle phase. In contrast, pRb is dephosphorylated to a hypophosphorylated state only in G1. p107 is dephosphorylated and then depleted. p130 Form 1 and hypophosphorylated p107 coimmunoprecipitate with E2F-4 from lysates of α-IFN-treated Daudi cells. Hypophosphorylated pRb coimmunoprecipitates with both E2F-4 and E2F-1. These forms of p130 and pRb bind to an E2FWT DNA binding site. The difference between the amounts of p130, p107, and pRb coimmunoprecipitated with E2F-4 from proliferating and α-IFN-treated cells is most probably due to changes in the phosphorylation state of pRb, p130, and p107 rather than to gross changes in the phosphorylation state of E2F-4. Thus, α-IFN may bring about cell cycle arrest not only through pRb but also by regulating the phosphorylation state of p130 and the abundance of p107.Several studies have investigated the E2F complexes that are present as cells enter the cell cycle from a resting state (see Ref. 26Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and references therein). Their function is presumed to be to induce the orderly transcription of specific genes, such as those encoding thymidine kinase and cdc2, which are required for progression into S phase and for controlling passage through the cell cycle (22Lam E.W.-F. LaThangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This may be true for entry into the first cell cycle. However, once in cycle the abundance of, for example, cdc2 changes only in line with the total amount of cellular protein (71Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 72Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thomas, unpublished data. Therefore, regulation of E2F activity by the pRb family is likely to be different in cells entering the cell cycle for the first time and in those proliferating continuously. Cycling cells contained predominantly phosphorylated p130 Form 3 in all cell cycle phases from G1A through to G2-M. This form does not bind E2F complexes and was not isolated by binding to an E2F DNA binding site. Because p130 only binds E2Fs and DNA when it is in Forms 1 and 2, we conclude that p130 has no major role in controlling E2F function in Daudi cells during continuous proliferation. Our conclusions differ from those published recently that showed that a p130-E2F complex exists during G1 (74Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S."

We examined which coagulation factor was targeted by hsPLA2and analyzed which region of the protein may be involved in this inhibition. Prothrombin time coagulation assays indicated that hsPLA2 did not inhibit activated factor V (FVa) activity, whereas activated factor X (FXa) one-stage coagulation assays suggested that FXa was inhibited. The inhibitory effect of hsPLA2 on prothrombinase activity of FXa, FV, phospholipids, and Ca2+complex was markedly enhanced upon preincubation of hsPLA2with FXa but not with FV. Prothrombinase activity was also strongly inhibited by hsPLA2 in the absence of PL. High concentrations of FVa in the prothrombinase generation assay reversed the inhibitory effect of hsPLA2. By using isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrated that hsPLA2 binds to FXa in solution with a 1:1 stoichiometry and a K dof 230 nm. By using surface plasmon resonance we determined the rate constants, k on and k off, of the FXa/hsPLA2 interaction and analyzed the Ca2+ effect on these constants. When preincubated with FXa, synthetic peptides comprising residues 51–74 and 51–62 of hsPLA2 inhibited prothrombinase assays, providing evidence that this part of the molecule, which shares similarities with a region of FVa that binds to FXa, is likely involved in the anticoagulant interaction of hsPLA2 with FXa. In conclusion, we propose that residues 51–62 of hsPLA2 bind to FXa at a FVa-binding site and that hsPLA2 decreases the prothrombinase generation by preventing FXa·FVa complex formation.

Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zwaal R.F.A. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Blood platelets are also a source of factor V (20Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J.W. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was thus tempting to suggest a role for hsPLA2 on blood coagulation, once it is secreted by activated platelets. The prothrombinase complex, composed of FVa, FXa, phospholipids (PL), and Ca2+, plays a central role in the coagulation cascade (17Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S.

Res. 1993; 70: 337-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and inhibits prothrombinase activity (23Inada M. Crowl R.M. Bekkers A. Verheij H. Weiss J. J. Biol.

The anticoagulant effect of hsPLA2 is phospholipid-independent and not observed when FV-deficient plasma is used for coagulation assays (24Mounier C. Franken P.A. Verheij H.M. Bon C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This observation leads to the hypotheses that the molecular target of hsPLA2 is either the FV/FVa protein, the FXa protein, or both proteins. All sPLA2s have a common active site but may possess distinct pharmacological sites, explaining the diversity of pharmacological effects of venom sPLA2s, such as neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, inhibition or potentiation of platelet aggregation, and anticoagulant action (25Ouyang C. Teng C.M. Huang T.F. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 945-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In particular, all venom anticoagulant sPLA2s have a basic pI correlated with the presence of basic amino acids located between residues 50 and 80 which may be involved in the anticoagulant effect of venom sPLA2 in addition to the lipolytic activity (27Verheij H.M.

The aim of this study was to identify the human plasma coagulation factor target for the anticoagulant effect of hsPLA2 in biochemical studies using purified proteins. Isothermal titration calorimetry affords simultaneous determination of all thermodynamic parameters relevant to protein-protein binding, including N, the stoichiometry of the association reaction; K a, the association constant (K a = 1/K d); and the enthalpic (ΔH 0) and entropic (ΔS 0) contributions to the Gibbs free energy of association (ΔG 0) (29Bhatnagar R.S.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 247: 288-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By using this technique, we demonstrated here that hsPLA2 binds to FXa in solution. By using surface plasmon resonance, we investigated the effect of calcium ion on the kinetic rate constants of the FXa/hsPLA2 interaction. Furthermore, by using overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 51–74, we determined which part of the hsPLA2 is likely to be involved in its anticoagulant action. Human prothrombin was purified according to diScipio and Davie (31diScipio R.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Human FV was purified as described (32Kane W.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1002-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (33Hackeng T.M. van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21051-21058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of human FV was performed as described previously (33Hackeng T.M. van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21051-21058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FIXa, FX, and FXa were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Recombinant FVIII was a kind gift of Dr. Roger Lundblad of Baxter Hyland, Duarte, CA. The chromogenic substrate for thrombin amidolytic activity, CBS 34.47, and the chromogenic substrate for FXa amidolytic activity, S-2222, were from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France) and Chromogenix (Cincinnati, OH). FV-deficient plasma was from George King Bio-Medical (Overland Park, KS). Innovin (recombinant tissue factor reagent) was from Dade Diagnostics (Miami, FL); BSA (fraction V) was from Sigma. The synthetic scrambled peptide containing hsPLA2 residues 51–74 as well as peptides 51–62, 59–70, 63–74, 62–51 (reverse) and d-51–62 (all residues in the d-configuration) were from Neosystem, Isochem SA (Strasbourg, France). The synthetic peptide containing residues 51–74 of the hsPLA2 was synthesized by the organic chemistry unit of Pasteur Institute (Paris, France). The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (purity ≥95%), and the predicted sequence was verified by the observed mass using mass spectroscopy. All these peptides have an N-terminal acetyl group and a C-terminal amide group. The recombinant Leu8-hsPLA2 was expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli. This phospholipase A2 species is referred to as hsPLA2 throughout this paper. Active hsPLA2 was obtained following tryptic cleavage of the fusion protein and then purified as described (24Mounier C. Franken P.A. Verheij H.M. Bon C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Franken P.A. van den Berg L. Huang J. Gunyuzlu P. Lugtigheid R.B. Verheij H.M. de Haas G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles (ratio of 1:9, phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine) (PL) were prepared essentially as described by de Kruijff et al. (35de Kruijff B. Cullis P.R. Radda G.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 406: 6-20Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Prothrombinase-purified components (the concentrations of which are given below) were mixed and subsequently assayed at 37 °C in Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.05 mNaCl, 0.5% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) in the following various combinations. In FXa/FV preincubation conditions, 20 pm FXa was incubated with 120 pm FV for 4 min, and then the reaction was started with 5 μm PL and 200 nm prothrombin. In FV preincubation conditions, 10 pm FV was incubated for 4 min, and then the reaction was started with 1 nm FXa, 5 μm PL, and 200 nm prothrombin. In FXa preincubation conditions, 10 pm FXa was incubated for 4 min, and then the reaction was started with 1 nm FV, 5 μm PL, and 200 nm prothrombin. FXa was incubated for 4 min with FVa at the indicated concentrations, and then the reaction was started with 1 μm prothrombin. 2 nm FXa was incubated for 4 min, and then the reaction was started with 5 μm PL and 1 μm prothrombin. The same experimental procedure was followed as for FXa/FV preincubation conditions, except that 120 pm FV was replaced by 20 pm FVa. After the addition of prothrombin, aliquots were taken at various time points, and prothrombin activation was immediately stopped by the addition of 50 mm EDTA (final concentration). The level of activated prothrombin activity was determined by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate CBS (300 μm, final concentration), monitored at 405 nm, and expressed in terms of thrombin concentration, using a calibration curve established with purified α-thrombin. To determine the effect of hsPLA2 or synthetic peptides on prothrombinase activity under these different conditions, these compounds (or control buffer) were added to the various reaction mixtures at the beginning of the 4-min preincubation period. FXa/FV preincubation conditions were used as described above. Briefly, 20 pm FXa was incubated with 120 pm FV for 4 min, and then the reaction was started with 5 μm PL and 200 nm prothrombin. After 6 min, the indicated amounts of FVa were added. The formation of activated prothrombin was followed as a function of time, as described above. Intrinsic tenase purified protein components were mixed at 37 °C using purified components in Tris-buffered saline under the following conditions. 25 nm FIXa was incubated for 5 min with 1 nm FVIII in the absence or in the presence of defined hsPLA2 amounts, and then FX activation was started by addition of 1 μm FX (final concentrations). Aliquots were then taken at various time points, and the reaction was immediately stopped by the addition of aliquots containing 50 mm EDTA (final concentration). The level of FXa activity was determined by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2222 (200 μm, final concentration) monitored at 405 nm, in comparison to a standard curve using purified FXa. FXa (20 nm) was incubated at 37 °C in Hepes-buffered saline (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, 0.1m NaCl) for 2 min with various concentrations of hsPLA2, in the absence or presence of 5 mmCaCl2. Then, FXa one-stage coagulation assays were performed as follows. 20 μl of the incubation mixture was added to a pre-warmed mixture of 25 μl of FV-deficient plasma and 30 μl of PL (166 μm). After 1 min, coagulation was started by the addition of 50 μl of CaCl2 (20 mm). The coagulation time was recorded using an ST4 coagulometer (Diagnostica Stago, Asnières, France). FVa (1 nm) was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C in Hepes-buffered saline containing 5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of various concentrations of hsPLA2. Then, a prothrombin time assay was performed as follows. 5 μl of the incubation mixture was added to a pre-warmed mixture of 50 μl of FV-deficient plasma and 45 μl of Hepes-buffered saline. After 1 min, coagulation was started by the addition of 50 μl of Innovin (recombinant tissue factor reagent). Clotting times were recorded using an ST4 coagulometer. FV (300 nm) was incubated for 30 min in Hepes-buffered saline containing 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C with or without 3.5 μm hsPLA2, and then the activation was started by the addition of 1 nmα-thrombin. During 60 min, the amount of generated FVa at different times was determined by performing a prothrombin time coagulation assay as described above, and FV proteolysis was also analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In experiments using PL, FV (3 nm) was incubated for 30 min in Hepes-buffered saline containing 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C in the presence of 25 μm PL, and with or without 3.5 μm hsPLA2, then the activation was started by the addition of 6 nm FXa. During 120 min, the amount of generated FVa was determined at different times by performing a prothrombin time coagulation assay as described above. Experiments were carried out on the MicroCal MCS ultrasensitive titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) using the OBSERVER software provided by the manufacturer for instrument control and data acquisition (36Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). To improve base-line stability, the temperature of the system was kept at 5 °C below the temperature of the actual experiment with a water bath, and temperature was equilibrated for 12 h. During a titration experiment, the FXa sample was thermostated at 37.0 ± 0.1 °C in a stirred (410 rpm) reaction cell (1.3514 ml), and 31 injections, each of 8-μl volume and 5-s duration, with a 3.5-min interval between injections, were carried out using a 250-μl syringe filled with hsPLA2 solution. An injection series was preceded by a 2-μl calibration injection. The reference cell of the calorimeter contained water plus 0.01% sodium azide. Data points were averaged and stored at 2-s intervals. All buffer solutions (Tris-HCl 20 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 0.125 m, and CaCl25 mm) were thoroughly degassed by stirring under vacuum before use. Protein samples were prepared in buffer of the same batch to minimize artifacts due to any differences in buffer composition. Titration experiments were performed with 1.5, 3.5, and 4.1 μm FXa and corresponding concentrations of hsPLA2 in the syringe, ensuring a final hsPLA2:FXa mole ratio of 2:1 in the reaction cell. Raw calorimetric data, i.e. heats absorbed or released accompanying the addition of aliquots of the hsPLA2solution into the FXa solution, were processed using the software package ORIGIN (36Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 37Lin L.N. Li J. Brandts J.F. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6564-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The area under the resulting peak following each injection is proportional to the heat of interaction Q.When corrected for the titrant dilution heat and normalized to the concentration of added titrant, Q is equal to the binding enthalpy ΔH' b at that particular degree of binding. The calorimetric binding isotherm was fitted by an iterative nonlinear least squares algorithm (Marquardt method) to a binding model employing a single set of independent sites. The association (K a) and dissociation (K d) constants, molar binding stoichiometry (N), and molar binding enthalpy (ΔH 0) were determined directly from the fitted curve. The Gibbs free energy and molar entropy of binding were calculated using the equations ΔG 0 = -RT In K aand ΔS 0 = (ΔH 0 - ΔG 0)/T, respectively, whereR is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin. Studies were performed using a BIACORE® 2000 system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Reagents, including surfactant P20, the amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, ethanolamine hydrochloride, and Sensor Chips CM5 were supplied by Biacore. The immobilization of FXa on the sensor chip surface was performed as follows: 30 μl of FXa (14 μg/ml in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.8) was covalently coupled via primary amino groups on a CM5 sensor chip surface according to the manufacturer's description (Biacore). The immobilization run was performed at a flow of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. The SPR signals for immobilized FXa (three different flow cells with three different quantities of FXa) were found to be 4,400 resonance units (RU), 2,000 RU, and 1,000 RU, where 1 RU corresponds to an immobilized protein concentration of ∼1 pg/mm2. Unreacted moieties on the surface were blocked by ethanolamine. One independent flow cell of the same sensor chip, used as a control flow cell, was subjected to a “blank immobilization,”i.e. with no FXa added. All experiments were carried out in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.005% surfactant P20, and 150 mm NaCl. hsPLA2, varying from 0 to 25 μg/ml, was injected in the same buffer in the presence or in the absence of CaCl2 at 5 mm, with a flow of 10 μl/min. Between each injection, surfaces were regenerated with 10 μl of 1m NaCl. Analyses were performed at 25 °C. Kinetic constants, k on (association rate constant) and k off (dissociation rate constant), for the interaction of hsPLA2 with immobilized FXa were calculated using BIA evaluation 2.1 software using curve fitting to a simple two-component model of interaction (A + B =AB) for a titration of the solution hsPLA2-immobilized FXa (38Nieba L. Krebber A. Plückhun A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Values, for a series of FXa·hsPLA2 complexes, were determined after subtraction of control signals obtained from the injection of various hsPLA2 concentrations on the control flow cell. The significance of the data was evaluated with the Student'st test for unpaired data. FXa one-stage coagulation assays, performed with FV-deficient plasma and fixed amounts of FXa that had been preincubated with varying amounts of hsPLA2, showed a dose-dependent inhibition of FXa activity by hsPLA2 (Fig. 1). The inhibition was strongly reduced in the absence of Ca2+ in the preincubation mixture, even though Ca2+ was later present during FXa one-stage assays (Fig. 1). This implies that the inhibitory effect of hsPLA2 does not involve a Ca2+-dependent action on PL, but rather an interaction with FXa that requires the presence of Ca2+. The effect of hsPLA2 on FVa activity was investigated with a prothrombin time coagulation assay using FV-deficient plasma. Fixed amounts of FVa were preincubated with hsPLA2 before the assay, in which coagulation efficiency was related to the activity of FVa. Fig. 1 shows that preincubation of hsPLA2 with FVa did not reduce the activity of FVa. Thus, hsPLA2 did not inhibit FVa activity, whereas FXa was inhibited by hsPLA2. Prothrombinase complex formation analyses can be performed under optimal conditions (FXa, FVa, PL, and Ca2+) and under suboptimal conditions (i.e.using FV instead of FVa, as well as in the absence of FVa or PL). The effect of hsPLA2 on prothrombinase complex formation was first analyzed under different conditions that were suboptimal for prothrombinase activity. Using 20 pm FXa, 120 pm FV, 5 μm PL, and 5 mmCa2+, we observed a strong inhibition of generation of prothrombinase activity by low concentrations of hsPLA2when hsPLA2 was preincubated with FXa and FV (Fig. 2 A). When the PL concentration was decreased to 1 μm, or increased to 50 μm, the inhibitory activity of hsPLA2 was essentially the same (data not shown). When hsPLA2 was preincubated with FXa (Fig. 2 B), the inhibitory action of hsPLA2 was much stronger than for preincubation with FV (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the above observations made using coagulation assays. The effect of hsPLA2 on prothrombinase activity was then tested in the absence of PL. We observed a potent inhibitory effect of hsPLA2 in the presence of FVa (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the action of FXa on prothrombin in the absence of both PL and FVa was unaffected by hsPLA2 (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that hsPLA2 does not interfere with direct prothrombin activation by FXa. Moreover, the amidolytic activity of FXa on its chromogenic substrate, S-2222, was not inhibited by hsPLA2 (data not shown). The inhibition of prothrombinase (20 nm FXa, 120 pm FVa, and 5 mm Ca2+) by hsPLA2 was never complete in the absence of PL, even at high concentrations of hsPLA2 (10 μm), and we observed that the rate of prothrombin activation decreased until a value corresponding the same as that obtained with FXa alone, i.e. 0.16 ± 0.008 nm thrombin·min−1 compared with 0.14 ± 0.004 nm thrombin·min−1 (Fig. 3 A). Under these suboptimal conditions, only a fraction of FXa is bound to FVa, and the prothrombinase activity of free FXa is not inhibited by hsPLA2. When assays were performed in the absence of PL under conditions that increase the ratio of FXa bound to FVa (1 nm FXa, 1 nm FVa, and 5 mmCa2+), the percent of inhibition by hsPLA2 was much higher, and at high hsPLA2 levels the prothrombin activation rate approached that seen for FXa alone (Fig. 3 B). The effect of hsPLA2 on intrinsic tenase activity in the absence of PL was examined. Intrinsic tenase-purified components included 25 nm FIXa, 1 nm FVIII, and 5 mm Ca2+. The substrate, FX, was used at 1 μm. We did not observe any inhibitory effect of the hsPLA2 on the ability of these components to activate FX under these conditions, even at hsPLA2 concentrations up to 10 μm (data not shown). Thus, the PL-independent anticoagulant action of hsPLA2 was specific for the prothrombinase complex. We observed an inhibition of the prothrombinase generation in the absence of FVa but in the presence of PL. This may result from an inhibition of the binding of FXa to PL vesicles due to an interaction of hsPLA2 with FXa, or PL vesicles, or both (data not shown). To investigate whether the observed inhibition of prothrombinase complex formation by hsPLA2 was caused by an effect on the activation of FV by α-thrombin or by FXa, several studies of FV activation were performed. First, 300 nm FV was preincubated for 30 min with or without 3.5 μmhsPLA2, and then activation was started by the addition of 1 nm thrombin. Second, 3 nm FV was incubated for 30 min with or without 3.5 μm hsPLA2 in the presence of 25 μm PL, and activation was started by the addition of 6 nm FXa. In both cases, the formation of FVa was determined as a function of time in a prothrombin time assay using FV-deficient plasma. We observed that hsPLA2 was unable to inhibit FV activation by either thrombin or FXa/PL (data not shown). This suggested that hsPLA2 may specifically inhibit prothrombin activation by inhibiting the formation of the prothrombinase complex. When conditions were optimal for prothrombinase assembly (i.e. 20 pm FXa, 20 pm FVa, 5 μm PL, and 5 mmCa2+), we observed a loss of the inhibitory action of hsPLA2 (data not shown). To understand the lack of the inhibitory effect of hsPLA2 on prothrombinase activity in the presence of FVa and PL, we reconstituted the prothrombinase complex with FV instead of FVa (20 pm FXa, 120 pm FV, 5 μm PL, and 5 mm Ca2+). 3.5 μm hsPLA2 was preincubated with FV, FXa, and PL for 4 min, and then prothrombin (200 nm) was added, and prothrombin activation was followed for 6 min. At this time, various amounts of FVa (4, 20, or 200 pm) were added to the prothrombinase reaction mixture. Consistent with previous experiments (Fig. 2 A), in the absence of added FVa, a strong inhibition of prothrombinase generation by hsPLA2 was seen during the first 6 min (Fig. 4). However, addition of increasing amounts of FVa at 6 min led to a dose-dependent reversal of the anticoagulant effect of hsPLA2 (Fig. 4). It should be noted in Fig. 4 that in the presence of hsPLA2and FV but in the absence of additional FVa, the maximal rate of thrombin generation indicated by the slope of the prothrombinase activity curve eventually reached that of the prothrombinase complex obtained in the absence of hsPLA2 after a prolonged lag time. Thus, in the presence of hsPLA2, the prothrombin activation curve was shifted to the right along the x axis, leading to the suggestion that the assembly of the prothrombinase complex was delaying but eventually was formed and yielded the same final activity. Using the same rationale as described above, this observation can be easily explained as follows: whereas hsPLA2 is effectively able to inhibit prothrombinase activity in the presence of FV, traces of prothrombin activation will provide enough thrombin to activate FV, yielding high enough levels of FVa to subsequently counteract the inhibitory effect of hsPLA2. To rule out the possibility that the lag wa"
https://openalex.org/W2079049550,"One or more proteins in mammalian reovirus core particles mediate two RNA methylation activities, (guanosine-7-N)-methyltransferase and (guanosine-2'-O)-methyltransferase, that contribute to forming the 5' cap 1 structure on viral mRNA. We used UV irradiation to identify core proteins that bind S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the methyl-group donor for both methyltransferases. A [methyl-3H]SAM-binding site was observed among the reovirus lambda proteins; was shown to be specific by competition with low levels of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, the product of methyl-group transfer from SAM; and was subsequently localized to protein lambda2. lambda2 mediates the guanylyltransferase reaction in cap formation and was previously proposed to mediate one or both methylation reactions as well. SAM binding was demonstrated for both lambda2 in cores and lambda2 expressed in insect cells from a recombinant baculovirus. Using three different methods to cleave lambda2, a binding site for SAM was tentatively localized to a central region of lambda2, between residues 792 and 1100, which includes a smaller region with sequence similarity to the SAM-binding pocket of other methyltransferases. Alanine substitutions at positions 827 and 829 within this predicted binding region greatly reduced the capacity of baculovirus-expressed lambda2 protein to undergo UV cross-linking to SAM but had no effects on either the guanylyltransferase activity of this protein or its conformation as judged by partial proteolysis, suggesting that one or both of these residues is essential for SAM binding. Based on these findings, we propose that the two methyltransferase activities involved in mRNA capping by reovirus cores utilize a single SAM-binding pocket within a central region of lambda2."

These residues, along with several others from the C-helix (Trp-86, Thr-89, and Asp-85) are in close proximity to the retinal chromophore and act to constrain its structure in an all-trans configuration. In addition, these residues are in a good position to couple retinal isomerization to protein changes involved in proton transport, including a change in the structure and orientation of the F-helix. A comparable combination of Trp, Pro, and Tyr residues (WXPY) is fully conserved in helix 6 of all visual pigments except the blue pigments where it is YXPY. It is possible that, although the tyrosine-proline sequence is reversed, a similar coupling between chromophore isomerization and protein exists in the two systems (22Rothschild K.J. Braiman M.S. Mogi T. Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) despite their different functions and evolutionary pathways. To investigate this possibility, we have used for the first time a combination of FTIR difference spectroscopy and isotope labeling to analyze tyrosine structural changes in rhodopsin. A comparison with earlier results obtained for bacteriorhodopsin reveals that a similar, although reversed, pattern of tyrosine/tyrosinate changes does occur. This reversed pattern might be explained if the all-trans tocis transition of the chromophore in both systems is coupled to similar changes in adjacent residues in agreement with an earlier suggestion (25Ludlam G.J. Rothschild K.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Wild-type hexahistidine-tagged rhodopsin derived from bovine rhodopsin was produced and purified as described previously (26Janssen J.J.M. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. Merkx M. DeGrip W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11220-11222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The hexahistidine tag introduces a slight redshift in the λmax of rhodopsin from 498 to 500 nm. For the purpose of isotope labeling,Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (ATCC: CRL-1711) were grown and subsequently infected in a customized serum-free and protein-free medium partially depleted in l-Tyr (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) to which an additional 2 mml-[ring-2H4]Tyr (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) was added. To determine label incorporation levels, total proteoliposome fractions were treated with Pronase to generate free amino acids. Subsequent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of two different samples revealed that 70 ± 3% of membrane protein-incorporated tyrosines were labeled. 2C. H. W. Klaassen and W. J. DeGrip, unpublished results. No detectable labeling was found to occur in Phe residues as expected, because in eukaryotic cells Tyr is degraded through the Krebs cycle, and thus the labels should not be incorporated into an essential amino acid like Phe. Rhodopsin films for transmission IR spectroscopy were prepared by isopotential spin-drying (5Rothschild K.J. Sanches R. Hsiao T.L. Clark N.A. Biophys.

The film is then rehydrated prior to insertion into a sealed transmittance cell as described previously (28Rath P. DeCaluwé L.L.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10277-10282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transmission FTIR difference spectra of the hydrated rhodopsin films were recorded at 10 °C using methods similar to those reported previously (29Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30DeGrip W.J. Gray D. Gillespie J. Bovee P.H.M. Van den Berg E.M.M. Lugtenburg J. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the H2O content of the sample was monitored by measuring the intensity ratio of the 3400-cm−1 band (O–H stretch mode) to the protein Amide II band near 1545 cm−1. The Rho → Meta II difference spectra were obtained as follows: the sample was photobleached for 3 min using light from a 150-watt tungsten illuminator (model 180, Dolan-Jenner Industries, Lawrence, MA) filtered by a 500-nm long-pass filter (Corion Corp., Holliston, MA) and several heat filters and transmitted to the sample with an annular optical fiber. Spectra were recorded at 8 cm−1 resolution and 5-min intervals for several hours before and after illumination (1350 scans for each spectrum) on a Bio-Rad FTS-60A spectrometer (Bio-Rad, Digilab Division, Cambridge, MA) equipped with a mercury-cadmium-teluride detector. Each difference spectrum shown represents a subtraction of the spectrum recorded immediately before the light is turned on from the spectrum recorded immediately after illumination. The larger set of spectra are recorded prior to and after illumination to monitor sample stability, hydration, and Meta II decay. FTIR transmission spectra of tyrosine andl-[ring-2H4]Tyr-saturated solutions were measured at room temperature at pH 12. Each sample was prepared by dissolving Tyr orl-[ring-2H4]Tyr to saturation in a borate buffer that was titrated using KOH to pH 12. A small drop (∼7 μl) of this solution was placed on a CaF2 window, and a second CaF2 window was pressed against it to form a uniform thin film. The windows were inserted into a liquid sample cell (Harrick Scientific Corp., Ossining, NY; TFC-M32) and mounted in a Nicolet 740 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Instruments, Madison, WI) equipped with a triglyceride sulfate detector. Spectra were collected consisting of 512 scans. An identical method was used to record a spectrum of the buffer, which was interactively subtracted from the absorption spectrum of the sample using the 3400-cm−1 water band as a reference. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the Rho → Meta II difference spectra from WT andl-[ring-2H4]Tyr-Rho in the region from 1800 to 1000 cm−1. To assess the reliability of assignments using tyrosine isotope labeling, three samples of both WT andl-[ring-2H4]Tyr-Rho were measured independently, and the resulting data are shown in Fig. 1. All spectra show very similar features, reflecting changes of the retinylidene chromophore, which undergoes an 11-cis to all-trans conformational transition, as well as structural changes of the protein required to create a binding site for the G-protein transducin. For example, negative bands have been assigned to the Rho chromophore on the basis of comparison with results from resonance Raman spectroscopy at 1548 cm−1 (−) (C=C ethylenic stretch) and 1238 cm−1 (−) (C12–C13 stretch mode) 3The sign shown next to the frequency in parenthesis (e.g. + or −) indicates whether the band is positive or negative; sh denotes shoulder).

In contrast, few bands have been assigned thus far to specific amino acids except in the 1700–1800-cm−1 region (C=O stretch modes of Asp and Glu carboxylic acid groups (28Rath P. DeCaluwé L.L.J.

Rothschild K.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 2085-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). As seen in Fig. 1, the introduction ofl-[ring-2H4]Tyr into Rho produces several highly reproducible changes in the region between 1800 and 1000 cm−1. In particular, several bands are altered with a change in intensity, reflecting an isotope-induced shift in frequency, including those near 1595, 1570, 1517, 1423, 1373, 1348, 1275, 1253, 1221 (sh), and 1178 cm−1. There are also bands near 1643 and 1535 cm−1 whose intensities are not reproducible within each set and are therefore not assigned to tyrosine vibrations. This variability is most likely due to sample instability observed in the highly absorbing amide I and II regions as well as small differences in sample preparation which can give rise to polarization effects. In general, the changes we have assigned to tyrosine vibrations can be caused either by an isotope-induced frequency shift of a tyrosine/tyrosinate vibrational mode out of a particular region or by a shift of a labeled tyrosine/tyrosinate mode into that region of the spectrum. Detailed assignments can be made on the basis of comparison with Tyr andl-[ring-2H4]Tyr model compounds. For example, a decrease in intensity at 1595 cm−1 and increase at 1570 cm−1 due tol-[ring-2H4]Tyr incorporation (Fig. 1, inset) agrees well with the isotope induced downshift of the 1598 cm−1 ring stretching mode of tyrosinate to 1569 cm−1 inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr measured at pH 12 (Fig. 2). Similarly, a drop in intensity near 1275 cm−1 and increase near 1253 cm−1 (Fig. 1, inset) (this increase appears as a maximum at 1245 cm−1 in a double difference spectrum; not shown) agrees qualitatively with the isotope-induced shift of a band at 1271 cm−1 in l-tyrosinate to 1238 cm−1 inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr (Fig. 2). Previously this band was assigned to the C–O− stretch mode of tyrosinate (37Rothschild K.J. Roepe P. Ahl P.L. Earnest T.N. Bogomolni R.A. Das Gupta S.K. Mulliken C.M. Herzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 38Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Overall, these data, and in particular the appearance of positive bands characteristic of (labeled) tyrosinate, indicate that a tyrosine residue is partially deprotonated in the Meta II state. This might reflect a partial deprotonation of a tyrosine residue in Rho upon formation of Meta II (see below) or, alternatively, a change in environment of an existing tyrosinate in Rho upon Meta II formation. Additional bands that exhibit reproducible isotope-induced changes are assignable to vibrational modes found in tyrosine orl-[ring-2H4]Tyr. However, the pattern is complex and may reflect one or more tyrosines that undergo a change in environment or protonation state during Meta II formation. For example, the positive 1517-cm−1 band, which drops in intensity, is close to the frequency of an intense tyrosine ring vibration in l-Tyr (37Rothschild K.J. Roepe P. Ahl P.L. Earnest T.N. Bogomolni R.A. Das Gupta S.K. Mulliken C.M. Herzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Bendit E.G. Biopolymers. 1967; 5: 525-533Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and therefore reflects a tyrosine in the Meta II state. Other bands that match known tyrosine frequencies are at 1373 cm−1 (not assigned), 1250 cm−1 (bending mode of tyrosine hydroxyl group), and 1179 cm−1 (ring CH bending mode). The 1373- and 1179-cm−1 bands are positive and therefore most likely reflect tyrosine(s) in Meta II. The 1373-cm−1 band shifts to 1348 cm−1 inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr-Rho in agreement with published spectra (38Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the increased intensity at 1250 cm−1 may reflect a change in a tyrosine residue in the unbleached state of Rho. Part of the intensity changes in this region were already attributed to the downshift of a positive tyrosinate band from 1277 cm−1 to near 1248 cm−1 in the Meta II state (see above). However, a prominent tyrosine mode due to the bending vibration of the tyrosine hydroxyl also occurs at this frequency and downshifts inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr to 1226 cm−1 (38Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in good agreement with the change observed at 1221 cm−1 inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr-Rho. This band is not likely to be due to residual Meta I, which exhibits a band near 1215 cm−1 (30DeGrip W.J. Gray D. Gillespie J. Bovee P.H.M. Van den Berg E.M.M. Lugtenburg J. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40DeLange F. Merkx M. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. Pistorius A.M.A. DeGrip W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), because no increase in the corresponding Meta I specific band at 950 cm−1 is observed (not shown). Finally, a prominent drop in intensity at 1423 cm−1 (Fig. 1) inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr-Rho might be due to the isotope-induced downshift of negative tyrosine ring mode from the 1515 cm−1 region. A band due to such a ring mode has been previously identified in thel-[ring-2H4]Tyr-labeled Photosystem II in the TyrD to TyrD* FTIR difference spectrum (38Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B.A. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this change might be due to a mode observed at 1418 cm−1 inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr at high pH, which downshifts from 1498 cm−1 inl-Tyr at high pH (Fig. 2). This would indicate that a (partially) ionized tyrosine exists in Rho. However, the loss of the corresponding unlabeled tyrosinate vibration at 1498 cm−1would lead to an increase in intensity near 1498 cm−1 inl-[ring-2H4]Tyr-Rho, which is not clearly observed, but could be partially masked by the loss of the positive band at 1517 cm−1. Strikingly, there is a similar pattern of tyrosinate-related spectral changes observed in the bR → M difference spectrum of bR (41Roepe P. Ahl P.L. Das Gupta S.K. Herzfeld J. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6696-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the Rho → Meta II difference spectrum of Rho whenl-[ring-2H4]Tyr is incorporated, although the sign of the bands is reversed. Similar to the results reported above for Rho,l-[ring-2H4]Tyr labeling causes a downshift of a band from 1590 to 1570 cm−1 in the bR difference spectrum (Fig. 3, inset), although the downshifted bands are positive in the Rho spectrum and negative in the bR spectrum. Also, similar to rhodopsin a band at 1276 cm−1 appears to shift to near 1248 cm−1 in the bR → M difference spectrum (Fig. 3, inset). Additional peaks were assigned to tyrosine vibrations previously in the bR → M difference spectrum of bR (41Roepe P. Ahl P.L. Das Gupta S.K. Herzfeld J. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6696-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) at 1517 cm−1 (−) (tyrosine) and 1419–1410 cm−1 (+) (l-[ring-2H4]tyrosine). Here again, the frequencies are similar to bands observed in the Rho → Meta II difference spectrum, although the signs of the bands are reversed. FTIR difference spectroscopy has been used extensively to study conformational changes in membrane proteins (42Rothschild K.J. Zagaeski M. Cantore W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In some cases, assignment of vibrational bands to individual amino acid residues in rhodopsin was facilitated by site-directed mutagenesis (28Rath P. DeCaluwé L.L.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. DeGrip W.J.

FTIR difference spectroscopy can also be used to study changes in the environment of individual water molecules in rhodopsin during the different steps in the photoactivation cascade (52Maeda A.

In this work, FTIR difference spectroscopy and amino acid isotope labeling were combined for the first time to analyze structural changes of tyrosines in rhodopsin. Isotope labeling was accomplished by growing Sf9 insect cells on a stringent medium containingl-[ring-2H4]Tyr. Tyrosine bands can be identified and assigned on the basis of the isotope induced shifts and by comparison with a series of model tyrosine compounds at high and low pH. Our results clearly demonstrate that a set of bands in the Rho → Meta II difference spectra can be assigned to vibrational modes of tyrosine and tyrosinate. On this basis, it can be concluded that one or more tyrosines participate in the rhodopsin photocascade up to formation of the Meta II intermediate and that at least a partial protonation of a tyrosinate is involved. A possible involvement of tyrosine residues was previously proposed on the basis of UV difference spectroscopy (55Rafferty C.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1979; 29: 109-120Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and site-specific mutagenesis (56Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also suggested by a recent study using UV resonance Raman spectroscopy (57Kochendoerfer G.G. Kaminaka S. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13153-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The similarity between the pattern of isotope-induced changes observed in bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin is particularly interesting. Earlier studies based on tyrosine isotope labels (41Roepe P. Ahl P.L. Das Gupta S.K. Herzfeld J. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6696-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis (21Braiman M.S. Mogi T. Stern L.J. Hackett N.R. Chao B.H. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 3: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and site-directed isotope labeling (58Liu X.-M. Sonar S. Lee C.-P. Coleman M. RajBhandary U.L. Rothschild K.J. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) concluded that tyrosine bands identified in the FTIR difference spectra of bacteriorhodopsin arose from protonation changes in Tyr-185 located in the F-helix. Subsequent FTIR measurements on bR containing a13C isotope label in the C1 position of Tyr-185 indicated that the Tyr-185/Pro-186 peptide bond buried in the center of the F-helix undergoes some type of structural rearrangement (59Ludlam C.F.C. Sonar S. Lee C.-P. Coleman M. Herzfeld J. RajBhandary U.L. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting possibility is that the Tyr-185/Pro-186 bond serves as a hinge, which gives rise to the apparent tilting of the F-helix late in the bR photocycle (60Subramaniam S. Gerstein M. Oesterhelt D. Henderson R. Embo J. 1993; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 61Vonck J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5870-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The present findings indicate that a similar, although reversed, pattern of tyrosine/tyrosinate changes occurs also upon photoactivation of rhodopsin. Although on the basis of this study we cannot assign these changes to any particular tyrosine(s) in rhodopsin, an interesting candidate is Tyr-268. This residue is also positioned adjacent to a Pro residue (Pro-267). It is well known that Pro residues break α-helical structure and can function as kinks allowing independent movement of adjacent helical segments. The existence of a Tyr/Pro pair in the center of helix 6 in bacteriorhodopsin (Tyr-185, Pro-186) and a Pro/Tyr pair in rhodopsin (Pro-267, Tyr-268) raises the possibility that such a pair acts synergistically independent of the order of these residues, thereby forming a potential hinge for movements in helix 6 in response to chromophore isomerization. Indeed, several lines of evidence have been presented that a rigid body movement involving part of helix 6 takes place during photoactivation of rhodopsin (62Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 63Yang K. Farrens D.L. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Also, recent structural models for rhodopsin (e.g. Refs. 64Shieh T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 65Tang L. Ebrey T. Subramaniam S. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 193-209Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) place Tyr-268 close to Glu-113, suggesting a possible role in the deprotonation of the Schiff base upon Meta II formation, which could be related to the (partial) protonation indicated by our data. In fact, mutagenesis studies show that replacement of Tyr-268 by Phe perturbs ligand binding and activation of rhodopsin (56Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the adjacent Trp-265 also is involved structurally in formation of Meta II (66Ridge K. Bhattacharya S. Nakayama T. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6770-6775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 67Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Actually, this region probably is one of the hot spots in rhodopsin activation, because in the vicinity of Tyr-268 are also residues Gly-121 and Phe-261, which form a synergistic functional unit with the 9-methyl group of the chromophore (68Han M. Lin S.W. Minkova M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1996; 271: 32337-32342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues in most cases has a profound effect on dark and/or rest activity of rhodopsin (68Han M. Lin S.W. Minkova M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1996; 271: 32337-32342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 69Han M. Lou J. Nakanishi K. Sakmar T.P. Smith S.O. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1997; 272: 23081-23085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, to definitely identify Tyr-268 as (one of) the residue(s) responsible for the changes we observe additional site-specific mutagenesis and/or site-directed isotope labeling will be required. Because mutagenesis tends to perturb functionally or structurally active sites, site-directed isotope labeling will be the preferred method. Our results suggest a common element for the primary mechanism of rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin that goes beyond the general features of a retinylidene chromophore and a seven-helix transmembrane domain. In particular, it establishes that similar tyrosine/tyrosinate changes occur during activation of both proteins. In fact, the reversal of the signs of tyrosine/tyrosinate assigned bands may be related to the respective role of the all-trans chromophore in the activation of the rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin systems as indicated by FTIR studies on the effects of removal of the all-transchromophore in rhodopsin (29Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and bacteriorhodopsin (25Ludlam G.J. Rothschild K.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If these similarities arise in changes in the F-helix (helix 6), then it is possible that a common mechanism of chromophore-protein coupling exists in both proteins. This is a very important issue that will be addressed by subsequent studies using a combination of FTIR difference spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and isotope labeling.

Glomerular disease is initiated by a variety of factors, including immunologic, infectious, and toxic agents, as well as hemodynamic processes. A central pathological feature of many types of acute and progressive glomerular disease is injury of mesangial cells, which respond by proliferating as well as by secreting growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins. This contributes to resolution of glomerular damage but may also lead to fibrosis, which occurs in many chronic disease processes. The glomerular mesangial cell is a mesenchymally derived cell that shares properties with fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and provides structural support to the glomerular tuft (1Schlondorff D. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).Experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis can be induced in rats by the injection of anti-Thy 1 antibody, which binds to the Thy 1 antigen expressed on the rat mesangial cell (2Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1769-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Binding of the Thy 1 antibody results in a complement (C5b-9)-dependent killing of mesangial cells (mesangiolysis), which is followed by a transient phase of mesangial cell proliferation (days 2–7) and matrix expansion (days 7–42) resembling mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in man (2Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1769-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Alpers C.E. Hudkins K.L. Gown A.M. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recently, repopulation of the mesangium in the anti-Thy 1 model has also been shown to involve migration of surviving mesangial cells (days 2–5) from the hilus to the periphery of the glomerulus (5Hugo C. Shankland S.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. J. Clin.

Nature. 1990; 346: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) play major roles in the mesangial cell proliferative response and extracellular matrix expansion in experimental glomerulonephritis. Despite the evident role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in processes activated by growth factor receptors with protein-tyrosine kinase activity, little information regarding the expression and biological roles of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPase)1 in glomerular disease has been reported. The potential importance of PTPases in the glomerulus has been underscored by the recent identification of GLEPP1, a type III receptor-like PTPase (rPTPase), which is localized to the specialized foot processes of the podocyte (11Thomas P.E. Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19953-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wiggins R.C. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Wharram B.L. Thomas P.E. Genomics. 1995; 27: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GLEPP1 has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of podocyte foot process structure and function. In support of this hypothesis, GLEPP1 protein levels are reduced in several types of human glomerular disease and in several animal models of glomerulonephritis (13Yang D.H. Goyal M. Sharif K. Kershaw D. Thomas P. Dysko R. Wiggins R. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 571-584PubMed Google Scholar).To identify PTPases as potential mediators of the mesangial cell response in glomerular disease, we have evaluated PTPases expressed in the rat anti-Thy 1 model. This report describes the identification, molecular cloning, and characterization of rPTP-GMC1, a new receptor PTPase expressed by glomerular mesangial cells. Our results demonstrate that rPTP-GMC1 is highly restricted to the mesangial cell and that expression is acutely up-regulated in actively proliferating and migrating mesangial cells in the anti-Thy 1 model. rPTP-GMC1 is similar in structure to GLEPP1 and may sense or regulate cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions to mediate glomerular repair.DISCUSSIONMany types of human renal disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, acute glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and acute lupus nephritis, share similarities with the anti-Thy 1 glomerulonephritis model. Loss of mesangial cells results in dissolution of the glomerular architecture, which stimulates a response to injury mediated by repopulating mesangial cells (3Alpers C.E. Hudkins K.L. Gown A.M. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 38Morita T. Churg J. Kidney Int. 1983; 24: 1-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the rat anti-Thy 1 nephritis model, the period of mesangiolysis is followed by intense mesangial cell proliferation, which is mediated by polypeptide growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (8Johnson R.J. Raines E.W. Floege J. Yoshimura A. Pritzl P. Alpers C. Ross R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 39Floege J. Eng E. Young B.A. Alpers C.E. Barrett T.B.

Electrolyte Metab. 1995; 21: 271-282PubMed Google Scholar). Responding mesangial cells appear at the glomerular hilus and migrate to the glomerular periphery (5Hugo C. Shankland S.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). During this period, they assume a contractile phenotype with de novo expression of α-smooth muscle actin and increased expression of surface adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins (2Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1769-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 23Hugo C. Hugo C. Pichler R. Gordon K. Schmidt R. Amieva M. Couser W.G. Furthmayr H. Johnson R.J. J. Clin.

Invest. 1991; 87: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).We have cloned and characterized a new type III receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase in experimental glomerulonephritis. rPTP-GMC1 exhibits a striking pattern of expression which is tightly coupled to the kinetics of the migrating mesangial cell in the rat anti-Thy 1 model. Following the acute mesangiolysis, the first identifiable mesangial cells consistently originate from the glomerular hilus or extraglomerular mesangium (5Hugo C. Shankland S.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These actively proliferating cells dramatically up-regulate expression of rPTP-GMC1. From 36 h to 7 days after disease induction, the responding mesangial cells participate in a coordinated wave of proliferation and migration which distributes them throughout the glomerulus (5Hugo C. Shankland S.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). By day 7, the proliferative/migratory phase is essentially complete and this is coincident with loss of rPTP-GMC1 expression.A role for rPTP-GMC1 is supported by genetic studies, which have provided good evidence for receptor PTPases as important regulators of cell migration and axon guidance. For example, fourDrosophila rPTPases (DLAR, DPTP10D, DPTP69D, and DPTP99A) are expressed specifically in the nervous system in overlapping subsets of neurons and play important roles in growth cone guidance and target innervation (42Zinn K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Drosophila DPTP69D null mutants express motor neuron growth cones that do not target properly and either overshoot their muscle targets or stop prematurely (43Desai C.J. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Zinn K. Development. 1997; 124: 1941-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants in DLAR result in motor axons that fail to reach their targets due to improper directional decisions at key checkpoints (44Krueger N.X. Van Vactor D. Wan H.I. Gelbart W.M. Goodman C.S. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 84: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Migrating cells interact with the extracellular matrix via focal adhesions (FA), which are contact points that link actin stress fibers to the membrane cytoskeleton and to transmembrane integrins (45Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). It is well established that protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a key role in regulating these structures. Engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix in migrating cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several FA components including pp125FAKand paxillin (46Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Specific PTPases have been linked to FA phosphorylation. For example LAR, a broadly expressed receptor PTPase, localizes to FAs in migrating cells but seems to be excluded from developing FAs at extending lamellopodia (47Serra Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a role of this receptor PTPase in FA disassembly by serving to dephosphorylate components that were activated initially by phosphorylation.Mesangial cells in culture migrate toward a variety of factors including platelet-derived growth factor, fibronectin, and thrombospondin, which may also be important stimulators of mesangial cell migration in the Thy 1 model (4Barnes J.L. Hastings R.R. De la Garza M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 585-597PubMed Google Scholar, 48Taraboletti G. Morigi M. Figliuzzi M. Giavazzi R. Zoja C. Remuzzi G. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 566-571PubMed Google Scholar, 49Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 379-382PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that rPTP-GMC1 may play a role in cell migration by either regulating the formation of cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion sites or providing a pathfinding or context-recognition function that targets the mesangial cell to its correct association with other glomerular cells. The loss of rPTP-GMC1 expression, concurrent with the end of the proliferative/migratory phase in the Thy 1 model, suggests that it plays a dynamic, rather than constitutive, role in formation of glomerular structure. Glomerular disease is initiated by a variety of factors, including immunologic, infectious, and toxic agents, as well as hemodynamic processes. A central pathological feature of many types of acute and progressive glomerular disease is injury of mesangial cells, which respond by proliferating as well as by secreting growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins.

In the rat anti-Thy 1 nephritis model, the period of mesangiolysis is followed by intense mesangial cell proliferation, which is mediated by polypeptide growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (8Johnson R.J.

Following the acute mesangiolysis, the first identifiable mesangial cells consistently originate from the glomerular hilus or extraglomerular mesangium (5Hugo C. Shankland S.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These actively proliferating cells dramatically up-regulate expression of rPTP-GMC1. From 36 h to 7 days after disease induction, the responding mesangial cells participate in a coordinated wave of proliferation and migration which distributes them throughout the glomerulus (5Hugo C. Shankland S.J. Bowen-Pope D.F. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). By day 7, the proliferative/migratory phase is essentially complete and this is coincident with loss of rPTP-GMC1 expression.A role for rPTP-GMC1 is supported by genetic studies, which have provided good evidence for receptor PTPases as important regulators of cell migration and axon guidance. For example, fourDrosophila rPTPases (DLAR, DPTP10D, DPTP69D, and DPTP99A) are expressed specifically in the nervous system in overlapping subsets of neurons and play important roles in growth cone guidance and target innervation (42Zinn K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Drosophila DPTP69D null mutants express motor neuron growth cones that do not target properly and either overshoot their muscle targets or stop prematurely (43Desai C.J. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Zinn K. Development. 1997; 124: 1941-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants in DLAR result in motor axons that fail to reach their targets due to improper directional decisions at key checkpoints (44Krueger N.X. Van Vactor D. Wan H.I. Gelbart W.M. Goodman C.S. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 84: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Migrating cells interact with the extracellular matrix via focal adhesions (FA), which are contact points that link actin stress fibers to the membrane cytoskeleton and to transmembrane integrins (45Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). It is well established that protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a key role in regulating these structures. Engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix in migrating cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several FA components including pp125FAKand paxillin (46Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Specific PTPases have been linked to FA phosphorylation. For example LAR, a broadly expressed receptor PTPase, localizes to FAs in migrating cells but seems to be excluded from developing FAs at extending lamellopodia (47Serra Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a role of this receptor PTPase in FA disassembly by serving to dephosphorylate components that were activated initially by phosphorylation.Mesangial cells in culture migrate toward a variety of factors including platelet-derived growth factor, fibronectin, and thrombospondin, which may also be important stimulators of mesangial cell migration in the Thy 1 model (4Barnes J.L.

Our results suggest that rPTP-GMC1 may play a role in cell migration by either regulating the formation of cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion sites or providing a pathfinding or context-recognition function that targets the mesangial cell to its correct association with other glomerular cells. The loss of rPTP-GMC1 expression, concurrent with the end of the proliferative/migratory phase in the Thy 1 model, suggests that it plays a dynamic, rather than constitutive, role in formation of glomerular structure. Many types of human renal disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, acute glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and acute lupus nephritis, share similarities with the anti-Thy 1 glomerulonephritis model. Loss of mesangial cells results in dissolution of the glomerular architecture, which stimulates a response to injury mediated by repopulating mesangial cells (3Alpers C.E. Hudkins K.L. Gown A.M.

In order to shed light on this subject, we examined the interactions of decorin, a proteoglycan with a well defined protein core and a single glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain, with Lp(a) and derivatives, namely Lp(a) deprived of apo(a), or Lp(a−), free apo(a), and the two main proteolytic fragments, F1 and F2. By circular dichroism criteria, the decorin preparations used had the same secondary structure as that previously reported for native decorin. Authentic low density lipoprotein from the same human donor was used as a control. In a solid phase system, Lp(a−)and low density lipoprotein bound to decorin in a comparable manner. This binding required Ca2+/Mg2+ ions, was lysine-mediated, and was markedly decreased in the presence of GAG-depleted decorin, suggesting the ionic nature of the interaction likely involving apoB100 and the GAG component of decorin. Free apo(a) also bound to decorin; however, the binding was neither cation-dependent nor lysine-mediated, unaffected by sialic acid depletion of apo(a), and markedly decreased when either reduced and alkylated apo(a) or reduced and alkylated decorin was used in the assay. Of note, the binding of apo(a) was unaffected when it was incubated with a spectrally native decorin that had been renatured from either 4 m guanidine hydrochloride by extensive dialysis or cooled from 65 to 25 °C. On the other hand, the binding significantly increased when decorin was depleted of GAGs, which by themselves had no affinity for apo(a). The binding of apo(a) to the decorin protein core was also elicited by the C-terminal domain of apo(a), and it was favored by high NaCl concentrations, 1 to 2m. No binding was exhibited by the N-terminal domain accounting for the lack of effect of apo(a) size polymorphism on the binding. In the case of whole Lp(a), the binding to immobilized decorin was mostly GAG-dependent and ionic in nature. A minor contribution by apo(a) was detected when GAG-depleted decorin was used in the assay. Our results indicate that the binding of Lp(a) to decorin involves interactions both electrostatic (apoB100-GAG) and hydrophobic (apo(a)-decorin protein core), and that the binding of apo(a) requires decorin protein core to be in its native state.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a))1is a highly atherogenic lipoprotein having as a protein moiety apoB100 disulfide linked to apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) (1Lawn R.M. Scanu A.M. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 151-161Google Scholar). Apo(a) comprises a multi-kringle structure and a protease domain both of which are highly homologous to the corresponding structures of plasminogen (2McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Based on this homology, the apo(a) kringles have been classified into two major classes, IV and V. There are 10 subclasses of kringle IV, numbered from 1 to 10, exhibiting some differences in amino acid composition (3Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All of these kringles occur as a single copy except for kringle IV-2 whose number varies among individuals and accounts for the size polymorphism of apo(a) (4Lackner C. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Van der Hoek Y.Y. Wittekoek M.E. Beisiegel U. Kastelein J.J. Koschinsky M.L. Hum. Mol.

Commun. 1993; 191: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In turn, only one copy of kringle V has been reported (2McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans (PGs) are important structural components of the extracellular matrix of the vessel wall. They consist of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain(s) covalently attached to a protein core (7Wight T.N. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 421-440Google Scholar). PGs are structurally diverse due to the differences in core proteins and the number, size, and monosaccaride sequence of the GAG chains (7Wight T.N. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 421-440Google Scholar). Lp(a) has been shown to bind in vitro to free GAGs (8Dahlén G. Ericson C. Berg K. Clin. Genet. 1978; 14: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Bihari-Varga M. Gruber E. Rotheneder M. Zechner R. Kostner G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mixed aortic PG (9Bihari-Varga M. Gruber E. Rotheneder M. Zechner R. Kostner G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism of this binding. It has been proposed that apoB100 of Lp(a) interacts ionically with the GAG component of PGs (8Dahlén G. Ericson C. Berg K. Clin. Genet. 1978; 14: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Bihari-Varga M. Gruber E. Rotheneder M. Zechner R. Kostner G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding of apo(a) to PG has been considered to be negligible based on the observation by Bihari-Varga et al. (9Bihari-Varga M. Gruber E. Rotheneder M. Zechner R. Kostner G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that apo(a) separated from parental Lp(a) under strong reductive conditions failed to form a visible complex when interacted with free GAGs. We have recently shown (10Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that a functional free apo(a) can be isolated from the parent Lp(a) under mild reductive conditions. This free apo(a) is functional based on its capacity to bind to LDL to form an authentic Lp(a) particle and to bind in vitro to the extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen (11Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we also have shown that enzymes of the elastase family cleave human apo(a) in vitro into two main fragments, F1 and F2, representing the C- and N-terminal domains, respectively, which can be easily separated from each other by lysine-Sepharose chromatography (12Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of free apo(a) and derivatives prompted us to investigate whether apo(a), either free or as a constitutive component of Lp(a), binds to PG and, if so, to attempt to define the basis for this interaction. For this purpose, as a model system, we studied the binding of Lp(a) and its derivatives, apo(a) and apo(a)-free Lp(a) (Lp(a−)), to decorin. Decorin represents a well characterized PG having a 36-kDa protein core of known structure and a single GAG chain, predominantly dermatan sulfate (DS) (13Kresse H. Hausser H. Schonherr E. Bittner K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 32: 259-264PubMed Google Scholar). This PG is synthesized by vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (14Asundi V.K. Dreher K.L. Eur. J.

Loushin C. Nikol S. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 962-974PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin and, particularly, the decorin protein core has a number of important functions including organization of collagen fibrillogenesis, regulation of cell-matrix interaction, and modulation of cell growth via binding to fibronectin, thrombospondin, and transforming growth factor-β (13Kresse H.

Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that the decorin protein core suppresses cell growth by activation of the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, p21 (19De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A.

In order to evaluate the role of the decorin protein core in the binding to Lp(a) and its derivatives, we utilized both untreated and GAG-depleted (GD) decorin prepared by treating the latter with chondroitinase ABC (cABC). The secondary structure of the decorin preparations was examined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. A preliminary account of this work has appeared (22Klezovitch, O., Edelstein, C., and Scanu, A. M. (1997)Circulation 96, (suppl.) I-112Google Scholar). Decorin, extracted from bovine articular cartilage with 4m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and purified essentially as described by Rosenberg et al. (23Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Tang L.-H.

We used decorin from cartilage source as a prototype of decorin since it has been previously shown that the protein structure of this PG is similar irrespective of tissue source as assessed by N-terminal sequencing (24Day A.A.

Kallikrein inactivator (KI) was purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-decorin protein core antibody and cABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were from Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan. Peptide:N-glycosidase F and N-acetylneuraminidase II were from Glyko Inc., Novato, CA. Rabbit affinity purified antibodies to Lp(a), apo(a), and LDL were prepared as described previously (28Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Lp(a) and anti-apo(a) did not react against LDL and plasminogen, and anti-LDL was unreactive to apo(a). The subjects used for the preparation of Lp(a) and LDL were 4 healthy donors with plasma Lp(a) protein levels in the range of 15–43 mg/dl with a known apo(a) phenotype and genotype. Their plasma was obtained by plasmapheresis performed in the Blood Bank at the University of Chicago. The steps for Lp(a) and LDL isolation were carried out immediately after blood drawing using the procedure outlined below. All of the subjects used in the study gave a written informed consent. Apo(a) phenotyping was performed on isolated apo(a) samples by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-Lp(a) (10Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mobility of the individual apo(a) bands was compared with isolated apo(a) isoforms of known molecular weights (29Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For apo(a) genotyping, DNA plugs were prepared from blood mononuclear cells, subsequently fractionated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and the blots developed with an apo(a)-specific probe essentially as described earlier (30Lackner C. Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Rahmig T. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The Lp(a) species used in this study had a single apo(a) isoform. The isoforms examined were between 289 and 488 kDa. To prevent lipoprotein degradation, the plasma obtained by plasmapheresis was adjusted with 0.15% EDTA, 0.01% NaN3,10,000 units/liter KI, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lp(a) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation and lysine-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (29Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The purity of the product was assessed by electrophoresis on precast 1% agarose gels (Ciba-Corning, Palo Alto, CA) and Western blots of SDS-PAGE, utilizing anti-Lp(a) and anti-apoB100. The LDL preparations used in this study were isolated at d = 1.030–1.050 g/ml by sequential flotation as described previously (31Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and were assessed to have no apo(a) by electrophoresis and Western blot criteria. Apo(a) was isolated from Lp(a) essentially as described by Edelstein et al. (10Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, Lp(a), 1 mg/ml protein, was incubated with DTE at a final concentration of 1.5–2 mm. EACA to a final concentration of 100 mm was then added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h under nitrogen gas. After dialysis against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm EACA, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide, an equal volume of 60% sucrose in the same buffer was added, and the resulting mixture was placed into a TLA 100.3 titanium rotor and spun in a table top TL100 ultracentrifuge at 10 °C, 412,160 × g for 18 h. After centrifugation, the top 0.5-ml fraction contained LDL free of apo(a), Lp(a−). The bottom 1.0-ml fraction contained free apo(a) in pure form. The latter was stored in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 125 mmtrehalose at −80 °C. Apo(a) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, KI (200 units/ml) was digested with porcine pancreatic elastase at a molar ratio of 25:1 (protein:enzyme) at 22 °C for 2 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate with further incubation for 20 min (12Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digest was applied to a lysine-Sepharose affinity column which was then washed with 3 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 500 mm NaCl, and 200 mm EACA (12Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragment F1 eluted with PBS and F2 with EACA. The PBS and EACA fractions containing these fragments were each pooled, dialyzed against 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide and concentrated using Centriprep membranes (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA). The purity of the products was monitored by immunoblot electrophoretic analysis on 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA) probed with anti-apo(a) (12Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized apo(a) (289-kDa isoform), 100-μg aliquot, was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 6 m GdnHCl. For the reduction, dithiothreitol was added to give a 10-fold molar excess over expected disulfides, and the solution was flushed with nitrogen and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For alkylation, iodoacetamide was added to give a 5-fold molar excess of reagent over total thiols. The solution was again flushed with nitrogen and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Following the incubation, a 10-fold excess of 2-mercaptoethanol relative to the alkylating agent was added, and the solution was desalted by exhaustive dialysis against 20,000 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl for 48 h at 4 °C. Apo(a), 20-μg aliquot, was treated with 10 milliunits of N-acetylneuraminidase II for 3 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. The change in mobility of apo(a) upon removal of sialic acid was monitored by electrophoresis on precast 1% agarose gels (Ciba-Corning, Palo Alto, CA) following by immunoblotting with an anti-apo(a) antibody as described (12Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). For this purpose, 100 μg of decorin protein were incubated with cABC in 100 μl of TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl) supplemented with 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 units/ml kallikrein inactivator as a function of enzyme concentration (0–10 milliunits), time (0–2 h), and temperature (22–37 °C). The reaction was terminated by adding 1 mm ZnCl2. The level of digestion was assessed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA). Treatment of decorin with cABC generated a product that migrated as a doublet with an estimated mass of 46 and 48 kDa (Fig. 2,lanes 4 and 5). The doublet represented two different N-glycosylated forms of decorin protein core, based on the fact that further digestion with 2.5 milliunits of peptide:N-glycosidase F for 3 h at 37 °C, using the manufacturer's instructions, reduced the protein size to 38 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 6). The cABC-modified doublet product is referred to as GAG-depleted decorin or GD decorin. Neither increase of the amount of cABC to 100 milliunits nor prolonged overnight incubation at 37 °C resulted in further changes in the mobility of GD decorin. There were no apparent changes in electrophoretic mobility of either Lp(a) or apo(a) when treated with cABC. As a result, the following conditions were chosen for the routine preparation of GD decorin: 100 μg of decorin/10 milliunits cABC for 2 h at 37 °C. GD decorin was dialyzed against 20,000 volumes of 1 mmNH4HCO3 for 48 h at 4 °C and subsequently lyophilized. The lyophilized product was kept at −20 °C until use. Lyophilized aliquots, 250 μg each, of decorin and GD decorin, were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 6 m GdnHCl. Each sample was reduced and alkylated following the conditions described above for apo(a), and the final products were then dialyzed against 20,000 volumes of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 48 h at 4 °C. Lyophilized samples of either decorin or GD decorin were dissolved in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 4 m GdnHCl, to reach a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml, incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, and used for CD spectroscopy as described below. Another aliquot was subjected to exhaustive dialysis against 20,000 volumes of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 48 h at 4 °C to remove GdnHCl, equilibrated for 1 h at 25 °C, and subsequently used for CD spectroscopy and binding studies. Lyophilized samples of either decorin or GD decorin were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of 0.11 mg/ml. Each sample was incubated at 65 °C for 1 h, and the CD spectra of the heated products were recorded at 65 °C. Thereafter, the samples were cooled to 25 °C, kept at that temperature for 1 h, and then analyzed by CD spectroscopy and apo(a) binding. The CD spectra of native and modified forms of decorin and GD decorin in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, were recorded in a 1-mm path length cell on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature control unit (Aviv Associates, Inc., Lakewood, NJ). The studies were carried out at 25 °C unless specified. All the recorded spectra were the average of 4 scans and were corrected for background. The mean residue ellipticity was calculated as described (32Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The percent secondary structure was calculated using a program provided by Aviv Inc. for Aviv CD data sets based on an algorithm of Chang et al. (33Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 12-31Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Microtiter plates (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) were coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml in TBS of decorin or GD decorin, either native or modified, for 2 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, the immobilized decorin was converted to GD decorin by treatment with 100 μl of cABC (40 units/ml in TBS) for 2 h at 37 °C. For the evaluation of the nonspecific binding some of the wells were coated with BSA. This protein was previously shown to have no binding capacity for Lp(a) and free apo(a) (11Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amount of decorin that bound to the microtiter well was 1.4 ± 0.3 pmol as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with an anti-decorin antibody. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.02% Tween 20), various concentrations of either of the following Lp(a), apo(a), apo(a) fragments, LDL, or Lp(a−) were added to the wells in the reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the wells were washed three times with TBST which contains 150 mmNaCl. This concentration of NaCl was previously reported not to dissociate the complexes of apoB100-containing lipoproteins with PG once they have formed (34Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The bound protein was detected by using either an anti-LDL or an anti-apo(a) antibody in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. At this time, the wells were washed three times with TBST, and the goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate in TBST was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8) was added and the color development followed at 405 nm on a microtiter reader, Biomek 100 (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Absorbance data were then transformed into moles by using standard curves established for each ligand. Scatchard analysis was carried out by plotting the amount of ligand bound (x axis)versus the ratio of bound to free ligand (yaxis). The B max was obtained from thex intercept, and K d was the ratio of theB max divided by the y intercept. In some experiments, a constant amount (10 nm) of either Lp(a), Lp(a−), LDL, or apo(a) was incubated with immobilized decorin or GD decorin in the presence of various concentrations of free GAGs, NaCl, l-lysine, EACA, CaCl2, or MgCl2. When studying the effect of either NaCl, CaCl2, or MgCl2, the corresponding components were omitted from the reaction buffer. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the bound protein was detected with either an anti-LDL or anti-apo(a) antibody depending on the protein under study. The amount of protein bound was expressed as percentage of that bound in the absence of the effector. Lp(a), Lp(a−), and LDL protein were quantitated by a sandwich ELISA as described previously (28Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of apo(a) was determined either by ELISA or using an extinction coefficient (ε278 = 1.31 ml mg−1 cm−1) established for apo(a) (35Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of decorin and GD decorin were determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. The results reported below refer to preparations of Lp(a) having a single apo(a) size isoform of 289 kDa and LDL isolated from the plasma of the same donor. Apo(a) isoforms of 358, 359, and 488 kDa were also studied, and the results were found to be similar to those obtained with the 289-kDa species. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the spectrum of decorin rehydrated from the lyophilized powder in 10 mm phosphate buffer exhibited a symmetrical negative trough with a minimum at 215 nm. The calculated secondary structure gave 45% β-sheet, 15% β-turn, 8% α-helix, and 31% random coil. This secondary structure was abrogated by 4 m GdnHCl and was fully restored after removal of this chaotropic agent by dialysis. The spectrum of reduced and alkylated decorin exhibited a blue shift of the minimum to around 208 nm indicative of an increase in random structure (Fig. 3 A). A marked shift of the minimum to 205 nm was also exhibited by decorin heated at 65 °C; the native spectrum was fully restored upon cooling the sample to 25 °C (Fig. 3 B). The spectrum of GD decorin was similar to that of decorin except for an approximate 20% decrease in the molar ellipticity at 215 nm (Fig. 3 C) representing 40% β-sheet, 7% β-turn, 20% α-helix, and 23% random coil. These data indicated that the removal of GAG, by itself optically inactive (data not shown), caused a structural change favoring an α-helix conformation. Changes in the spectral behavior of GD decorin in 4 m GdnHCl, after reduction and alkylation (Fig. 3 C) and at 65 °C (Fig. 3 D), resembled those of decorin. Apo(a) exhibited concentration-dependent saturable binding to both decorin and GD decorin (Fig. 4 A). By Scatchard plot analysis the apparent K d values were similar, 4.0 ± 0.9 nm for untreated and 4.7 ± 1.2 nm for GD decorin. However, the B ma"

We observe that the vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) from clathrin-coated vesicles is subject to two different types of inhibition by ADP. The first is competitive inhibition with respect to ATP, with aK i for ADP of 11 μm. The second type of inhibition occurs after preincubation of the V-ATPase in the presence of ADP and Mg2+, which results in inhibition of the initial rate of proton transport followed by reactivation over the course of several minutes. The second effect is observed at ADP concentrations as low as 0.1–0.2 μm, indicating that a high affinity inhibitory complex is formed between ADP and the V-ATPase and is only slowly dissociated after the addition of ATP.We have further investigated the effect of sodium azide, an inhibitor of the F-ATPases that has been shown to stabilize an inactive complex between ADP and the F1-F0-ATP synthase (F-ATPase). We observed that azide inhibited ATP-dependent proton transport by the purified, reconstituted V-ATPase with aK 0.5 of 0.2–0.4 mm but had no effect on ATP hydrolysis. Azide was shown not to increase the passive proton permeability of reconstituted vesicles and did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis by the reconstituted enzyme, in contrast with CCCP, which both abolished the proton gradient and stimulated hydrolysis. Thus, azide does not appear to act as a simple uncoupler of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis. Rather, azide may have some more direct effect on V-ATPase activity. Possible mechanisms by which azide could exert this effect on the V-ATPase and the contrasting effects of azide on the F- and V-ATPases are discussed.

V-ATPases are composed of two functional domains: the peripheral V1domain possesses the nucleotide binding sites, and the integral V0 domain is responsible for proton translocation across the membrane. The V-ATPases resemble the F-ATPases from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria (9Weber J. Senior A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg.

The A and B subunits of the V-ATPases and the α and β subunits of F1 are all derived from a common ancestral nucleotide-binding protein (16Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13994-14001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9102-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the c subunit of the V-ATPases appears to have arisen by a gene duplication and fusion of the gene encoding the corresponding c subunit of F0 (18Mandel M.

Also, V- and F-type ATPases may share some similarities in their catalytic cycle. For example, cooperative interaction between the nucleotide binding sites has been demonstrated for the V-ATPase (19Uchida E. Ohsumi J. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

The primary function of F-ATPases (more properly termed ATP synthases) is ATP synthesis using the energy of the proton electrochemical gradient generated by electron transport during respiration (9Weber J.

In contrast, the V-ATPases function principally as ATP-dependent proton pumps to acidify intracellular compartments or in proton transport across the plasma membrane (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu.

Biomembr. 1992; 21: 351-360Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro, the soluble F1 domain of the F-ATPase is able to hydrolyze ATP, whereas isolated V1is inactive in ATP hydrolysis (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Similarly, the isolated V0 domain, unlike the corresponding F0 domain, is not an open proton channel (23Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The difference between these two types of proton transport ATPase is also demonstrated by their inhibitor sensitivity: V-ATPases are specifically and potently inhibited by bafilomycin and the related compound concanamycin (24Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 25Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), whereas the F-ATPases are inhibited by oligomycin (15Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Sodium azide at concentrations below 1 mmhas also been shown to inhibit the F-ATPases, but only in the direction of ATP hydrolysis, not in the direction of ATP synthesis (26Robertson H.E. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 214: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kobayashi H. Maeda M. Anraku Y. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the V-ATPases are insensitive to azide, but this conclusion is based upon studies of ATP hydrolysis (28Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 544-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15238-15244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of azide on proton transport by the V-ATPases is controversial (31Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 258: 4059-4062Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 32Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 634-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33David P.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although there has been extensive kinetic characterization of the F-ATPases, there is relatively little information concerning the kinetics and regulation of the V-ATPases. There is considerable evidence that cells maintain different intracellular compartments at different pH values (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 2Bowman B.J. Vazquez-Laslop N. Bowman E.J. J. Bioenerg.

Biomembr. 1992; 21: 351-360Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms employed to accomplish this remain uncertain. A change in coupling efficiency between proton transport and ATP hydrolysis has been proposed as one potential regulatory mechanism (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 4Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Gluck S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 21: 351-360Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the intracellular signals that might control coupling remain uncertain.We report here the modulation of V-ATPase activity by ADP and azide. ADP is shown to form an inactive complex with the V-ATPase in the presence of Mg2+, which is only slowly reactivated upon addition of ATP. This effect is independent of its action as a competitive inhibitor. Unlike the case of the F-ATPases, azide does not stabilize the ADP-inactivated state of the V-ATPase. Instead, azide is shown to inhibit proton transport without affecting ATP hydrolysis. This effect does not appear to be due to azide acting as a proton ionophore. Rather, azide may be having a direct effect on the V-ATPase. The possible significance of these effects of ADP and azide on V-ATPase activity are discussed below.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we observed that the V-ATPase from clathrin-coated vesicles is subject to two different types of inhibition by ADP. The first is competitive inhibition with respect to ATP, with aK i for ADP of 11 μm. The other occurs after preincubation of the V-ATPase in the presence of ADP and Mg2+, which results in inhibition of the initial rate of proton transport followed by reactivation of the enzyme over the course of several minutes following addition of ATP. The second effect was observed at ADP concentrations as low as 0.1–0.2 μm, suggesting the involvement of a high affinity site distinct from that involved in competitive inhibition.Competitive inhibition of the V-ATPases of kidney and osteoclasts by ADP has previously been reported with K i values of 37 and 17 μm, respectively (33David P. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30158-30163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ADP was reported to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the yeast V-ATPase (5Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although in neither case were effects on proton transport evaluated. Allosteric inhibition by ADP of ATP hydrolysis was reported for the chromaffin granule V-ATPase (44Moriyama J. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14723-14729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this effect required much higher concentrations of ADP (100 μm). Similarly, ADP was shown to increase the cooperativity of ATP binding to the chromaffin granule V-ATPase, but the concentrations of ADP required were rather high (25–200 μm), and only steady state analysis was carried out, so that no effects of preincubation with ADP and Mg2+were investigated (45Webster L.C. Perez-Castineira J.R. Atkins G.L. Apps D.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]ADP to a high affinity site (K d = ∼70 nm) were observed for the chromaffin granule V-ATPase (46Webster L.C. Apps D.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but the effect of occupancy at this site on activity was not reported. Finally, sulfite has been suggested to activate the V-ATPase of yeast by causing release of inhibitory ADP that accumulates at high ATP concentrations during the initial phase of the reaction (47Kibak H. Van Eeckhout D. Cutler T. Taiz S.L. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23325-23333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no direct interaction of the V-ATPase with ADP was investigated in this study. Our study thus represents the first direct demonstration that ADP (at submicromolar concentrations) in the presence of Mg2+ is able to stabilize an inhibited state of the enzyme, which is only slowly activated on addition of ATP.The observed inhibitory effect of ADP on the V-ATPase is similar to that described for the F-ATPase. Thus, preincubation of the F-ATPase with ADP and Mg2+ results in a lag phase in ATP hydrolysis that has been interpreted as indicating the formation of an inhibited complex between the F-ATPase and ADP bound with high affinity at a catalytic site (42Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 48Feldman R.I. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13088-13094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Milgrom Y.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same complex is believed to be formed during ATP hydrolysis as a transient intermediate during turnover (42Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). ADP bound to the noncatalytic sites of the F-ATPase has also been reported to cause hysteretic inhibition of activity (50Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 319-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Azide has been shown to inhibit the F-ATPase by stabilization of the ADP-inactivated complex (43Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 51Murataliev M. Milgrom Y. Boyer P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8305-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 52Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ATP synthesis is much less sensitive to azide inhibition than ATPase activity (26Robertson H.E. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 214: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Kobayashi H. Maeda M. Anraku Y. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Because of the similar inhibitory effects of ADP on the V and F-ATPases, we decided to test the effects of azide on V-ATPase activity. Azide has previously been reported to not inhibit V-ATPase activity, but the principal assay used in these studies was ATP hydrolysis (28Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 544-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15238-15244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of azide on ATP-dependent proton transport by the V-ATPase. We observed that azide does inhibit proton transport by the V-ATPase, with 50% inhibition observed at 200–400 μm. In agreement with previous observations, however, azide does not have a measurable effect on ATP hydrolysis.These results suggest that azide acts to functionally uncouple ATP hydrolysis and proton transport by the V-ATPase. One possible mechanism by which this might occur is if azide can act as a proton ionophore. We therefore tested the ability of azide to act as a proton ionophore in the presence of both an interior positive and an interior negative membrane potential. In neither case did we observe any increase in passive proton conductance in the presence of azide. This suggests that azide does not inhibit proton transport by the V-ATPase by simply dissipating the proton gradient generated, although this possibility is difficult to rule out with certainty.A second possibility is that azide specifically uncouples proton transport from ATP hydrolysis by the V-ATPase. In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that the V-ATPase is poised to change the efficiency of coupling between hydrolysis and transport. Thus, mild proteolysis results in a complete loss of proton transport under conditions where only 50% of the ATP hydrolysis is lost (53Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High concentrations of ATP (54Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), high concentrations of sulfite (47Kibak H. Van Eeckhout D. Cutler T. Taiz S.L. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23325-23333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of detergent (55Arai H. Berne M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11006-11011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also been suggested to alter the efficiency of coupling between ATP hydrolysis and proton transport. In fact, a “slip” mechanism has been proposed as a means of regulating vacuolar acidification in vivo (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 4Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although the nature of the cellular factors controlling coupling efficiency remains uncertain. Azide is not simply causing a complete uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis from proton transport, however, because in this case, azide would be expected to increase ATP hydrolysis by the reconstituted V-ATPase (as is observed on addition of CCCP). No such increase in ATP hydrolysis is observed on addition of azide. Rather, azide appears to reduce the coupling efficiency in such a way that proton transport is decreased without stimulation or inhibition of ATP hydrolysis.An alternative possible explanation for the observed results is that azide inhibits only tightly coupled V-ATPase after formation of a pH gradient. In the case of proton transport, this would explain why azide did not inhibit the initial rate of proton transport but did inhibit total acidification, because no pH gradient would be present prior to the addition of ATP. In addition, the ATP hydrolysis observed in the absence of CCCP may represent V-ATPase that is not tightly coupled (and hence not susceptible to inhibition by azide), whereas the ATP hydrolysis observed in the presence of CCCP is obviously uncoupled (and hence not inhibited). Such a mechanism is intriguing because it suggests the possibility that the proton gradient itself may be feeding back on the V-ATPase cycle in such a way that the enzyme activity can be inhibited in response to the pH gradient generated.The connection between the effects of ADP and azide on V-ATPase activity is uncertain. Although the enzyme is still able to form an inactive complex with ADP and Mg2+ in the presence of azide, the kinetics of reactivation after addition of ATP are not greatly different in the presence or absence of azide, suggesting that azide is not stabilizing the ADP-inactivated state of the enzyme, as proposed for the F-ATPases.The nature of the high affinity ADP site responsible for inhibition (catalytic or regulatory), the role of Mg2+ and the molecular basis for the azide sensitivity of the V-ATPase remain to be determined. It has previously been shown that both rapidly and slowly exchangeable nucleotide binding sites can be detected on the V-ATPase (21Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12775-12782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it is possible that ADP causes this slowly reversible inactivation by binding to the slowly exchangeable site. Although the V-ATPase is unlikely to be exposed to ADP in the absence of ATP under intracellular conditions, the existence of such a slowly reversible inactive state of the enzyme may be of relevance to regulation of vacuolar acidification in vivo. In particular, additional information will be required concerning the possible cellular factors influencing the equilibrium between the active and ADP-inhibited states. The vacuolar (H+)-ATPases (or V-ATPases)1 acidify intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells and therefore play a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu.

V-ATPases are composed of two functional domains: the peripheral V1domain possesses the nucleotide binding sites, and the integral V0 domain is responsible for proton translocation across the membrane. The V-ATPases resemble the F-ATPases from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria (9Weber J. Senior A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg.

Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), both in overall structure and in sequence homology between individual subunits. The A and B subunits of the V-ATPases and the α and β subunits of F1 are all derived from a common ancestral nucleotide-binding protein (16Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13994-14001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9102-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the c subunit of the V-ATPases appears to have arisen by a gene duplication and fusion of the gene encoding the corresponding c subunit of F0 (18Mandel M.

Also, V- and F-type ATPases may share some similarities in their catalytic cycle. For example, cooperative interaction between the nucleotide binding sites has been demonstrated for the V-ATPase (19Uchida E. Ohsumi J. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kasho V.N. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8708-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Zhang J.

Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are many differences between the F- and V-type ATPases, including their normal physiological functions. The primary function of F-ATPases (more properly termed ATP synthases) is ATP synthesis using the energy of the proton electrochemical gradient generated by electron transport during respiration (9Weber J.

Saragovi, unpublished results.Small peptides and peptidomimetics overcome many of the drawbacks of proteins as pharmaceutical agents. Compared with proteins such as NGF, peptidomimetics are less antigenic, less subject to proteolytic degradation, and more able to cross blood tissue barriers. Small peptide mimetics of NGF have been produced based on sequences from the β-loops of NGF (37LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B.F. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The β-turn in the loops was induced by the introduction of cysteine residues and intramolecular disulfide cross-linking. These small NGF mimics bind TrkA and antagonize NGF binding and biological activity. A peptide derived from the C-D loop of NGF, termed C-(92–96), showed the highest activity, with an affinity for TrkA on the order of 10−7m (37LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B.F. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A linear peptide with the same primary sequence did not show any biological activity, which confirmed the importance of the peptide conformation. In this work, the cyclic NGF β-loop mimic peptide C-(92–96) was the subject of study by high resolution solution NMR with the aim of correlating the structure and dynamics of the peptide with its bioactivity.DISCUSSIONThe NGF mimetic, NAc-C-(92–96), was designed to reproduce the C-D loop of NGF that is known to interact with TrkA. Four lines of evidence confirmed the formation of β-turn in the mimetic. 1) There were strong sequential HN-HN(i, i + 1) NOEs for residues Glu5, Lys6, and Gln7. 2) There was an NOE cross-peak between Hα of Glu5 and HN of Gln7 as illustrated in Fig. 1. 3) A number of weak NOEs between side chains of Asp4 and Gln7 were present in the spectra. 4) Solvent H2O/D2O exchange showed that the amide proton of Gln7 was weakly protected against exchange. This protection is probably due to a hydrogen bond between the amide of Gln7 and backbone carbonyl of Asp4.The structure calculations from NMR distance and dihedral angle constraints generated two families of structures represented in Fig. 4. In both families, a β-turn is formed by residues Asp4, Glu5, Lys6, and Gln7. The major differences between families occur around residues Asp4 and Glu5. In the more populated family (Fig. 4 a), Asp4 makes a hydrogen bond with the amide of Gln7, and Glu5 forms a typical type I β-turn. In family 2, there is no hydrogen bond acceptor for Gln7, and Glu5 adopts an unusual left-handed α-helical conformation to form a γL-αR β-turn. Although Cys2 and Thr3 adopt similar backbone angles in the two families of structures, their orientations relative to the β-turn differ considerably. Generally, the largest differences between the families occur in the N-terminal half of the peptide (which is also less well defined), while the structures of the C-terminal half are very similar.Several groups have determined that residues Glu94, Lys95, and Gln96 of NGF are important for high affinity receptor binding and activation (17Ibanez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Kullander K. Ebendal T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Kullander K. Kaplan D. Ebendal T. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the NAc-C-(92–96) mimetic, these correspond to residues Glu5, Lys6, and Gln7. Since these residues (with the exception of the φ angle of Glu5) are similar in the two families, the differences observed in the N-terminal portion of the mimetic may not be very important for its bioactivity. In particular, our NMR data suggest that the side chain orientations of the amino acids in the β-turn are relatively fixed and similar in both families of structures. Analysis of3 J Hα-Hβcoupling constants enabled us to introduce dihedral χ1 angle restraints on the side chains of Glu5 and Gln7, and NOEs were detected between the side chains of Asp4-Gln7 and Glu5-Lys6. Together, these data restrict the orientation of these side chains to the conformations observed in the two families of structures. The β-turn formation by residues Asp4–Gln7 and the side chain orientations probably contribute to the ability of peptide to bind the TrkA receptor and antagonize NGF. Further, when linearized, the mimetic acquires a random coil conformation and loses all of its biological activity (37LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B.F. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Existing crystallographic structures of the NGF show considerable flexibility in the loop regions (10McDonald N.Q.

Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when we compared the solution NMR structures of NAc-C-(92–96) with the different x-ray structures of C-D loop in NGF, we found very strong similarities. Fig. 5 shows comparisons of the two peptide family structures with C-D loops from NGF. Four different C-D loop structures of β-NGF are currently available in the Protein Data Bank (Upton, NY). In the structure of McDonald et al. (10McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Marray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), there is one NGF monomer in the asymmetic unit and one C-D loop structure. Residues Asp93–Gln96 form a type I β-turn with strong structural similarity to the family 1 structures of NAc-C-(92–96). Both the peptide and the NGF β-turns are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between Gln7 and Asp4. These are present as either a backbone carbonyl-amide hydrogen bond (in NAc-C-(92–96)) or as a bifurcated carbonyl-amide and side chain carboxyl-amide hydrogen bond. We note that the β-turn type I conformation is the most common type of β-turn in proteins and that these structures probably represent the lowest energy conformations for the C-D loop.Figure 5Comparison of minimized average structure calculated for each family with the conformation of C-D loop in NGF available from crystallographic data. a, structures in family 1 adopt β-turn type I conformation and correlate with the conformation of C-D loop from McDonald et al.

Hydrogen bond distances between Asp4 (carbonyl or side chain carboxyl) are 2.7 Å in NAc-C-(92–96) and 3.45 and 2.75 Å in the NGF structure. b, structures in family 2 adopt a type γL-αR β-turn and are compared with the structure of subunit A reported by Holland et al. (11Holland D.R. Cousens L.S. Meng W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). No hydrogen bonding partner of Gln7 could be identified in the second family of NAc-C-(92–96) structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the NGF structure reported by Holland et al. (11Holland D.R. Cousens L.S. Meng W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), three different conformations of the C-D loop were observed (due to the presence of three NGF monomers in the asymmetric unit). While one of the loops adopted a type I β-turn similar to the McDonald structure, the two other C-D loops presented γL-αR β-turns that are strikingly similar to the second family of NAc-C-(92–96) structures (Fig. 5). In the terminology of Wilmot and Thornton, β-turn types are determined by the dihedral angles φ,ψ of the second and the third residues in the turn (63Wilmot C.M. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In the monomer A and B structures of Holland et al. (11Holland D.R. Cousens L.S. Meng W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Glu94 has a strained conformation of approximately φ = 85, ψ = −30. This is very similar to the γL conformation of Glu5 of φ = 50, ψ = +25 in the peptide structures. While in the Holland structures, a cross-turn side chain carboxyl-amide hydrogen bond was present, in our experiments, we did not detect this additional hydrogen bond, nor was it present in the calculated family of structures.NMR relaxation data indicate that the NAc-C-(92–96) peptide adopts a well defined conformation that is characterized by high order parameters, S 2, for the loop residues and increased mobility for the extracyclic tyrosine residues. For Tyr1, this mobility is reflected as disorder in the calculated structures. More unusual relaxation behavior was detected for residues Thr3, Asp4, Glu5, and Lys6. The methine carbons of these residues exhibited fastR2 relaxation rates, suggesting the presence of slow conformational exchange. As the differences between the calculated structures are largest for these residues, it seems likely that interconversion on a millisecond time scale is occurring between the different families or classes of calculated structures.In NGF, the C-D loop is flanked by two antiparallel β-strands so that the amino acid side chains are perpendicular to the plane of the sheet and alternate up and down. Thus, residues Thr91 and Ala97 in NGF have their side chains on opposite sides of the plane formed by the β-sheet. In the NAc-C-(92–96) mimetic, these residues were substituted by cysteine residues. Cyclization (oxidation) of the cysteines requires them to twist so that the two side chain sulfur atoms can come together. This leads to a rearrangement of the β-sheet in the vicinity of Thr3 in the NAc-C-(92–96) peptide. This distortion could cause the polymorphism and conformational exchange observed in the NAc-C-(92–96) structures.This hypothesis is supported by preliminary results from a derivative of NAc-C-(92–96), which contains an additional residue in the loop (corresponding to Ala97 in the NGF structure). Since the loop now contains an even number of residues, a backbone twist is not be necessary for cyclization. Our preliminary results indicate less conformational exchange and a single family of structures. Surprisingly, this longer peptide, C-(92–97) was somewhat less active in bioactivity tests then C-(92–96) (37LeSauteur L. Wei L. Gibbs B.F. Saragovi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6564-6569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Studies of chimeric NT-3/NGF molecules have found that Ala97 or Ala98 can supplant the requirement of Gln96 for TrkA activation (20Kullander K. Kaplan D. Ebendal T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9300-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Probably, the small alanine side chains allow NGF to form close contacts with the receptor. In the mimetic peptide, the cysteine following Gln7 has its side chain pointing inward to form the S–S bond. This avoids any unfavorable steric interactions and may mimic Ala97. Although Tyr9 in the peptide has a long side chain compared with Ala98 in NGF, our study of peptide dynamics in solution suggests that the last tyrosine residue is very mobile and, if necessary, could adjust its position upon receptor binding. It is also possible that the decreased activity of C-(92–97) is related to the absence of conformational exchange in the longer mimetic. These arguments point out the utility of NMR relaxation measurements for understanding dynamic factors that contribute to function. Further studies of the conformations of the peptidomimetics will help to elucidate the role of each residue in receptor binding and stimulate the rational design of higher affinity mimetics (72Saragovi H.U. Gehring K. Hori W. Peptidomimetics and Small Molecule Design. 1997: 3-25Google Scholar).The goal of this study was to elucidate the structure of NAc-C-(92–96) in solution with the aim of understanding its bioactivity. We find that the structure of the peptide is very similar to that of the corresponding region of NGF. The structure of the NAc-C-(92–96) peptide is dependent on the presence of the cyclizing disulfide bond formed and appears to be responsible for its high affinity binding to TrkA. Intriguingly, we find that the kinetics or structural mobility of NAc-C-(92–96) also match that of the NGF C-D loop. In the crystal structures of NGF, the C-D loop adopts a variety of structures and shows increased temperature factors. Similarly, we find two families of NAc-C-(92–96) structures with large conformational exchange terms from NMR relaxation measurements. This suggests that conformational flexibility may be an important component of induced-fit ligand recognition between the C-D loop of NGF and TrkA. Nerve growth factor (NGF)1 is a member of the neurotrophin family of polypeptide growth factors. NGF promotes the growth and survival of sympathetic, trigeminal, dorsal root ganglia neurons and cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. Two cell surface neurotrophin receptors have been characterized: the low affinity p75 receptor (K D ∼10−9m), which is common to all members of the neurotrophin family (1Radeke M.J. Misko T.P. Hsu C.

The switch complex is composed of three proteins, FliG, FliM, and FliN. Recent biochemical data suggest a direct interaction of CheY with FliM. In order to determine the FliM binding face of CheY, we isolated dominant suppressors of fliM mutations in cheYwith limited allele specificity. The protein products of suppressorcheY alleles were purified and assayed for FliM binding. Six out of nine CheY mutants were defective in FliM binding. Suppressor amino acid substitutions were mapped on the crystal structure of CheY showing clustering of reduced binding mutations on a solvent-accessible face of CheY, thus revealing a FliM binding face of CheY. To examine the basis of genetic suppression, we cloned, purified, and tested FliM mutants for CheY binding. Like the wild-type FliM, the mutants were also defective in binding to various CheY suppressor mutants. This was not expected if CheY suppressors were compensatory conformational suppressors. Furthermore, a comparison of flagellar rotation patterns indicated that the cheY suppressors had readjusted the clockwise bias of the fliM strains. However, a chemotaxis assay revealed that the readjustment of the clockwise bias was not sufficient to make cells chemotactic. Although the suppressors did not restore chemotaxis, they did increase swarming on motility plates by a process called “pseudotaxis.” Therefore, our genetic selection scheme generated suppressors of pseudotaxis or switch bias adjustment. The binding results suggest that the mechanism for this adjustment is the reduction in binding affinity of activated CheY. Therefore, these suppressors identified the switch-binding surface of CheY by loss-of-function defects rather than gain-of-function compensatory conformational changes.

Chemotaxis in flagellated bacteria like Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium occurs in response to environmental changes, when the cells swim toward chemical attractants and away from repellents (1Blair D.F.

A proper balance between tumbling and smooth swimming allows cells to move toward a more favorable and away from a less favorable environment (3Volz K.

Chemotaxis requires a complex signaling mechanism to regulate the frequencies of smooth swimming and tumbling. Tumbling and smooth swimming are both needed for taxis, and mutants that exclusively use one or the other mode fail to respond to environmental stimuli (5Macnab R. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J.

Smooth swimming is caused by a counterclockwise (CCW)1rotation of flagella, resulting in the formation of a flagellar bundle. Disruption of this bundle, caused by a clockwise (CW) rotation of flagella, results in tumbling.

CheY is a regulatory protein that couples flagellar rotation to the environment by transducing the chemotactic signals from the transmembrane chemoreceptors to the flagellar switch.

Three aspartate residues Asp-12, -13, and -57 form the active site of the molecule (3Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 19Lukat G.S. Lee B.

Similar to that of other response regulators, phosphorylated CheY appears to be the active form required for CW flagellar rotation (4Parkinson J.S.

With a well defined structure and function, CheY is a model for understanding the structure-function aspects of response regulators in other bacterial sensory transduction systems. A previous study from our laboratory employed genetic suppression as a tool for identifying a signaling face of CheY (27Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 176: 6247-6255Crossref Google Scholar). It was achieved by mapping the locations of the cheY suppressor mutations of fliG mutations on the crystal structure of CheY. We had further extended this work by using an ELISA-based binding assay to identify the CheA binding face of CheY (28Shukla D. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have combined the two approaches by using genetic suppression to identify mutations in cheY that suppress fliMmutations and by biochemically analyzing the binding abilities of the CheY suppressor mutants for FliM. Our results reveal the face of CheY that is involved in FliM binding, and also the results provide biochemical evidence for the mechanism by which cheYmutations act to suppress switch mutations.

Cells were grown in LB at 30 °C to mid-exponential phase, and then CheY expression was induced at 42 °C (29Matsumura P. Rydel J.J. Linzmeier R. Vacante D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 4 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, and stored at −70 °C until sonicated. Overexpressing lysates were obtained by thawing cells and sonicating them 3–5 times for 1 min and then centrifuging them at 30,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction was used as a source of the CheY protein for purification. The mutant CheY proteins were overproduced from similar plasmid constructs (Table I) in SG1 strain (devoid of wild-type CheY) which was used to eliminate wild-type CheY contamination. All CheY proteins (wild-type and mutants) were purified as previously published (29Matsumura P. Rydel J.J. Linzmeier R. Vacante D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FliM was overproduced using the T7 polymerase/promoter system (30Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) by temperature-sensitive induction of the fliM gene. Cells were initially grown at 30 °C to early mid-exponential phase, and then the temperature was shifted to 42 °C for 30 min to induce the expression of phage RNA polymerase. The temperature was immediately lowered back to 30 °C, and the culture was grown for an additional 2 h allowing sufficient transcription and hence overexpression of FliM. The purification of FliM to near homogeneity was achieved by using a previously published protocol (10Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The subcloning of the putative suppressor cheY alleles was performed by transferring the 900-base pair HindIII-PvuII fragment from the low copy number suppressor plasmids to theHindIII-PvuII site of the high copy number plasmid, pRL22ΔZ. For the cloning of chromosomal fliMmutations, 1-kilobase pair chromosomal DNA fragments containingfliM mutations were generated by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into polylinker sites of plasmid pT7-7 (30Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by complementation assays. Double-stranded pRL22ΔZ derivatives, bearing putative cheYmutations, were sequenced by a dideoxy chain termination method, using the protocol provided by the manufacturer of Sequenase, version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequencing was facilitated by three appropriately situated, non-coding strand oligonucleotide primers that were specific for cheY. Five different fliM strains were transformed with hydroxylamine-mutagenized low copy number plasmids bearing putative suppressor mutations. Transformants were tested for restoration of swarming on soft agar plates. Those transformants, recognized by rapid swarming away from the point of inoculation, were chosen for plasmid isolation and purification. The purified plasmids were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion. These plasmids were then used to retransform the original fliM strain (to confirm that suppression was plasmid-encoded) and for complementation assays in strains RP4079 (cheY 216) and RP4139 (cheZ 280). Only those plasmids that complemented cheZ, but notcheY, were used in subsequent studies. Analysis of allele specificity was made by measuring the final swarm diameter for eight isolates of each plasmid-strain combination, grown under identical conditions, to yield mean values relative to the wild-type controls (RP437 containing pMM1). The previously published (28Shukla D. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) ELISA binding assay was modified to assay CheY binding to FliG and FliM. Wells of a microtiter plate were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of 2-fold serially diluted protein solutions (starting with 300 ng of FliG or FliM in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9). On the 2nd day, wells were washed one time with blocking buffer (Buffer B, 1% dry skim milk and 0.1% sodium azide in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9) and incubated again overnight at 4 °C with Buffer B to block any unoccupied sites. On the 3rd day, the wells were washed two times with Buffer B and each of the following proteins was added sequentially in 100 μl of a buffer (10 mm Mg2+, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9): (i) purified CheY (2 μg/well), (ii) polyclonal anti-CheY antibody (50 ng/well), and (iii) IgG-specific antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 dilution). Each addition was followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min and subsequent washing of wells with Buffer B. Finally, the wells were washed three times with Buffer B, and 200 μl of substrate solution (37 mg of ortho-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 ml of a buffer from stock containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmZnCl2, and 0.1 m glycine adjusted to pH 10.0 with 1 m NaOH) was added to each well. After incubating for approximately 30 min at room temperature, absorbance reading was measured at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Biotek Instruments, EL311). The column assay for measuring binding of CheY to FliM was carried out as described previously (10Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), with some modification. CheY-coupled beads were suspended to homogeneity in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and dispensed in 50-μl aliquots into Eppendorf tubes. Forty microliters of stabilization buffer (consisting of 3.4 mglycerol and 12.5 mm MgCl2) was added. Purified FliM (150 μm) was added to each tube. Acetyl phosphate (AcP) was added, when needed, from a 1 m stock solution to the concentrations indicated. The final volume of each reaction mixture was adjusted to 250 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of cold Tris buffer containing 2 mmMgCl2. AcP was added to appropriate reactions. Sixty microliters of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer was added and mixed at room temperature for 5 min. The beads were boiled for 2 min in order to remove the bound FliM from the CheY beads. Five microliters of the supernatant was loaded for 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. FliM Bands were scanned by SigmaGel gel analysis software. Bovine serum albumin-coupled beads served as controls. Bacterial flagellar rotation patterns were analyzed by cell tethering with anti-flagellin antibody, using the protocol described by Amsler et al.(31Amsler C.D. Cho M. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in tryptone broth at 30 °C to 80 Klett units. Tethered cells, which were actively spinning, were video-taped with the aid of a light microscope. The direction of flagellar rotation was analyzed from the video images of 75 cells of each kind, and the ratio of CW to CCW rotations was determined. The chemotactic abilities of various strains were assayed by using a spectrophotometric assay as described by Zhu et al. (7Zhu X. Amsler C.D. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 176: 4208-4215Crossref Google Scholar), which is a modification of the assay originally developed by Zhulin et al. (41Zhulin I.B. Gibel I.B. Ignatov V.V. Curr. Microbiol. 1991; 22: 307-309Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the principle that optical density, which is used as the measure of cell density close to a piece of a gel containing an attractant (aspartate), increases with time if the cells perform chemotaxis (41Zhulin I.B. Gibel I.B. Ignatov V.V. Curr. Microbiol. 1991; 22: 307-309Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in TB to early postexponential phase. Three milliliters of the cell cultures were harvested by gentle centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mml-methionine. After incubation at 30 oC for 5 min, the cell suspension was transferred into a cuvette with a piece of agarose gel containing 5 mmserine, at the bottom of the cuvette. The cuvette was jacketed by 30 °C water to maintain a constant temperature. The cell density changes at the interface between the gel and the medium were determined over time, by using a spectrophotometer. ThefliM strain, RP4493, was transformed with randomly mutagenized tar operon plasmid, pMM1, that containscheY under its native promoter. The transformants were screened for restoration of swarming on swarm plates. The plasmid pMM1, which is a low copy number plasmid, was used to recover the dominantcheY suppressors of the fliM mutation in the presence of the wild-type copy of cheY on the chromosome. This procedure yielded 13 suppressor isolates as follows: 7 had mutations in cheY and 6 had mutations in cheZ. This result is consistent with some previous studies (32Parkinson J.S. Parker S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2390-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Parkinson J.S. Parker S.R. Talbot P.B. Houts S.E. J.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) that suggested genetic interactions between cheY, cheZ, and switch genes. The dominant effects in our system are not due to the overproduction of the CheY mutant proteins since cheYexpression is controlled by its native promoter on a vector that is maintained at one or two copies in the cell (35Koop A.H. Hartley M.E. Bourgeois M.E. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The suppressor cheY alleles were subcloned into a high copy number expression plasmid, pRL22ΔZ, and sequenced. AllcheY suppressor alleles were found to contain single point mutations. The following mutations, reported here with residue numbers and inferred amino acid changes, were found: D13N, D57N, A90V, I96S, T112I, and T115A. Interestingly, A90V and T112I were also isolated as suppressors to fliG mutations (27Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 176: 6247-6255Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the four other known fliG suppressor cheY mutations, E27K, V108M, F111V, and E117K, were also included for further characterization (27Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 176: 6247-6255Crossref Google Scholar). Genetic suppressors may arise due to a variety of reasons. We aimed to isolate the intergenic conformational suppressors (36Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In theory, these suppressors can occur if two proteins make stereospecific contact. The mutations in one protein that disrupt this interaction may be suppressed by compensatory mutations in the other protein that restores the interaction. True conformational suppressors should be highly allele-specific, since they reflect the precise stereospecific contact between the interacting proteins. Consequently, the locations of the allele-specific mutations should define the regions of physical contact between the proteins. In order to assess the allele specificity of our suppressors, we tested their ability to restore swarming in different fliM strains. The suppressor cheY allele showed variable degrees of suppression in a given fliM strain, but the order of suppression did not significantly change with a change in thefliM strain (Fig. 1). Ideally, highly allele-specific suppression would be expected if the suppressors were direct interactional suppressors. The lack of a high specificity for alleles of fliM does not disprove an altered interaction with FliM. Conformational suppressors might exhibit low specificity if the nature of the protein interaction is complex (e.g. multi-protein complexes), and/or the assay for suppression is indirect. On the other hand, a similarity in the order in which they suppress any given fliM mutation suggests a common mechanism for suppression. An alteration in the affinity of CheY mutants for FliM might play an important role in causing suppression. In order to test this possibility, eight CheY mutants were purified and assayed for FliM binding. Five showed significantly reduced binding to FliM (less than 50%), whereas the others were similar to the wild-type CheY in FliM binding (Fig. 2 A). In order to verify the reduced FliM binding to CheY mutants in the phosphorylated state, the assay described by Welch et al. (10Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) was used (Fig. 2 B). 2The ELISA assay could not be used because the anti-CheY antibody had reduced affinity for phosphorylated CheY (data not shown). AcP was used to phosphorylate the CheY mutants. Included in this assay were two non-suppressor random cheY mutants, A88T and E93K, along with a fliG suppressor mutant, E27K. Although A88T showed a modest reduction in FliM binding in the non-phosphorylated state, both A88T and E93K showed increased FliM binding when phosphorylated. Unlike random cheY mutation, suppressor cheY mutations including E27K demonstrated reduced levels of FliM binding when phosphorylated. This result, therefore is consistent with the phenomenon of conformational suppression. In order to test this theory further, two fliM mutations, fliM 1002 and fliM 1008 (Fig. 1), were cloned into a T7 system plasmid pT7-7 (30Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). The FliM mutants were purified and used in a CheY binding assay. If the suppressor mutant combinations were compensatory interacting proteins, then the CheY mutants should exhibit enhanced binding, and the wild-type CheY should exhibit lower binding to mutant FliM proteins. However, we did not observe this phenomenon. All of the defective FliM binding CheY mutants were still defective in mutant FliM binding, whereas wild-type CheY still showed the strongest binding. In other words, the pattern of wild-type FliM binding to CheY mutants was very similar to that of the mutant FliM proteins to CheY mutants (Fig. 2 A). However, these results did dem"

Nonhydrolyzable or poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogues, such as AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, and ATPγS, cannot replace ATP (13Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

These results imply that MRP may be a transport ATPase and use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport conjugates of natural products. Consistent with this interpretation glutathione conjugates were found to increase ATPase activity in membranes from MRP-overexpressing cells (24Hooijberg J.H. Broxterman H.J. Heijn M. Fles D.L.

We have now examined the substrate specificity of the purified enzyme as well as its response to different nucleotides. Like P-glycoprotein (25Urbatsch I.L. al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it appears to be able to hydrolyze several different nucleotides including GTP and dATP. However, it exhibits a novel biphasic response to ADP and other nucleoside diphosphates, i.e. a strong enhancement of hydrolysis at low concentrations and inhibition at higher concentrations. When maximally stimulated by a low concentration of NDP, no further activation could be elicited by substrates for transport. Tissue culture materials were from Life Technology, Inc. ATP, AMP, ADP, GDP, CTP, UTP, ITP, GTP, dADP, dGDP, UDP, CDP, dCDP, ATPγS, AMP-PNP, AMP-CP, GSH, doxorubicin, and sheep brain lipid (l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine) were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]GTP, wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 6MB, dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. His·Bind Resin was purchased from Novagen. Formic acid was purchased from Fisher. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was from Calbiochem. Polyethyleneimine cellulose plates were purchased from either J. T. Baker or Fisher.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was utilized for the purification of MRP. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 500 μmmethotrexate. MRP was purified by two affinity chromatography steps as described previously (3Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude membrane was prepared from the MRP-expressing cells and solubilized in 1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. MRP was then bound and eluted from His·Bind Resin column and further purified by a second step affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 6MB. ATPase activity was assayed employing a thin layer chromatography method to separate the substrates and products in the reaction mixture enabling the measurement of [α-32P]ADP production from the [α-32P]ATP. Unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends, the assay was carried out in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and 4 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, stopped by the addition of 30 μl of a solution containing 1 m formic acid and 0.5m LiCl and transferred to ice. One-μl aliquots were spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate and chromatographed with 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid as the solvent. The amounts of [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP in each reaction mixture were determined by electronic autoradiography using a Packard Instant Imager (Packard). The assay was performed in the same fashion using [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]GTP as the substrate. Initially the influence of pyrimidine nucleotides at increasing concentrations on ATP hydrolysis was examined. Neither the ribonucleotides, CTP and UTP, nor the deoxyribonucleotides, dCTP and dTTP, had a great influence on activity, except at the highest concentration of 16 mm,which exceeded the MgCl2 concentration (10 mm; Fig. 1 A). However, the mild inhibition by the deoxy compounds was stronger than that caused by the ribonucleotides. When purines were tested, dATP and dGTP inhibited more strongly (Fig. 1 B), further indicating that deoxyribonucleotides are recognized by MRP. When the purine ribonucleotides, ITP or GTP, were added, there was an unexpected enhancement of activity at intermediate concentrations and inhibition at higher concentrations. This inhibition may reflect substrate competition as these two purine triphosphates are reasonable substrates for many ATPases (25Urbatsch I.L. al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 26Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

A nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, AMP-PNP, appeared to cause strictly competitive inhibition (Fig. 1 C), exhibiting a K i of 1.64 mm ± 0.22. Since both these compounds had strong effects on ATP hydrolysis by MRP, their capacity to serve as substrates was also examined. The results expressed as Michaelis-Menten curves and compared with those with ATP are shown in Fig. 2. As these curves indicate, GTP and ATP behave very similarly as substrates (K m and V max values are given in Table I). dATP is hydrolyzed at a greatly reduced rate, but its affinity for the catalytic site would seem to be considerably higher than that of the purine ribonucleotides on the basis of the relative K m values determined from these data (Table I). This is consistent with the ability of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates to inhibit ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1,A and B).Table IInfluence of ADP on ATPase, dATPase, and GTPase activity of purified MRP proteinNucleotidesV maxK mHill constantμmol/mg MRP/minmmATP0.472.950.987 ± 0.076ATP + 250 μm ADP1.001.440.958 ± 0.099dATP0.090.871.036 ± 0.068dATP + 250 μm ADP1.163.770.984 ± 0.025GTP0.673.371.018 ± 0.046GTP + 250 μm ADP0.883.661.000 ± 0.049The enzyme assays were performed in the presence or absence of 250 μm ADP and the amounts of ATP, dATP, or GTP as substrate hydrolyzed were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The V max and K mvalues were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots.

The effects of NDP products of NTP hydrolysis on the process were investigated for two reasons. First, consistent with the proposed formation of a Mg-ADP-Pi enzyme transition state complex in ATP hydrolysis by P-glycoprotein (29Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Second, we wished to test whether the stimulatory influence of the hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphates (Fig. 1 B, ITP and GTP) was a consequence of their direct action or of their products. In view of the strong competitive inhibition of other ATPases by ADP (25Urbatsch I.L. al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the results shown in Fig. 3 A were surprising. While no influence was detected below 10 μm, both ADP and GDP at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 mmwere strongly stimulatory, with the maximal effect at approximately 250 μm ADP or GDP. At concentrations in the 2 mmrange, activity was not different from that with no added NDP. Only at 4 mm and higher is hydrolysis inhibited. It is notable that these biphasic curves relating activity to NDP concentration are qualitatively similar to those showing dependence on NTP concentration (Fig. 1 B), the former just left-shifted with respect to the latter. Combined with the fact that the nonhydrolyzable NTP analogue, AMP-PNP, was not stimulatory (Fig. 1 C), these observations suggest that the primary ability of the NDPs to promote hydrolysis might also be responsible for the apparently similar effects of the NTPs. In addition to the NDP formed during the reaction, its presence as a contaminant in NTP preparations might contribute. Fig. 3 B indeed indicates that NDP contamination was substantial in the NTP solutions that were most stimulatory (ITP and GTP), as it was in a weakly hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS. To further test the apparent correlation between the presence of NDP and stimulation, the effect of ATPγS on the hydrolysis of ATP was evaluated (Fig. 3 C). In contrast to AMP-PNP, which appeared free of NDP and acted strictly as a competitive inhibitor (Fig. 1C), the ADP-contaminated ATPγS had an effect quite similar to ITP or GTP. Hence, it would appear that NDPs either formed during hydrolysis of the purine NTPs that are substrates of MRP ATPase or present as contaminants are able to stimulate NTP hydrolysis. This strongly suggests the presence of regulatory site(s) with higher affinity for NDPs than for NTP substrates, separate from hydrolytic site(s) specific for NTPs. As these NTP substrates include deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, we wondered if dNDPs were active at the regulatory site. Fig. 3 D indicates that they apparently are as 250 μm or 1 mm dADP or dGDP are as stimulatory as ADP. CDP, dCDP, and the nonhydroylzable ADP analogue, AMP-CP, also exerted stimulatory effects (Fig. 3 D). Of all the nucleoside diphosphates examined, UDP was the only one that was not stimulatory (Fig. 3 D). In contrast to NTPs and NDPs, AMP neither stimulated nor inhibited the ATPase activity (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the nucleoside monophosphate was not recognized by the regulatory or hydrolytic site(s). Since GTP and dATP are also substrates, the response to the NDP products of their hydrolysis was assessed as well. The results summarized in Table I indicate that addition of 250 μmADP does increase hydrolysis of both of these NTPs, although its effect on kinetic parameters is not identical for each substrate. Whereas the enhancement of ATP hydrolysis was reflected as a 2-fold increase in V max and decrease in K m, theV max of dATP hydrolysis was elevated more than 10-fold, even though the apparent K m increased substantially as well. The influence of ADP on GTP hydrolysis is less pronounced, probably because of GDP present in the GTP and formed during hydrolysis. Nevertheless, the maximal rates of hydrolysis of all three substrates are similar at approximately 1 μmol/mg/min ± 20% in the presence of 250 μm added ADP. This suggests a very strong interaction between the NDP-specific regulatory site and the catalytic site, which in the absence of NDP recognizes dATP with high affinity (low K m), but hydrolyzes it less well (low V max) than the ribonucleotides. When ADP is added, the hydrolysis of dATP becomes as efficient as that of ATP. Thus, occupation of the NDP regulatory site seems to bring about an elevation in the rate of hydrolysis of different substrates to a similar ceiling level. However, no matter whether the 250 μm ADP is present or absent, the Hill constants are always approximately 1 (Table I), indicating that an apparent lack of any positive or negative cooperativity between the two nucleotide binding sites. We had previously shown that MRP ATPase is stimulated by compounds which it is believed to be able to transport (3Chang X.-B. Hou Y.-X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To assess how this stimulation relates to the unanticipated activation by NDPs, we tested the effect of an anthracycline and a Vincaalkaloid in the absence and presence of 250 μm ADP (Fig. 4). Strikingly, stimulation by either doxorubicin or vincristine did not occur in the presence of 250 μm ADP. This was the case even when glutathione, which enhances drug stimulation of MRP, was added together with the drugs. The lack of additivity of activation by NDPs and transported drugs may be just due to the fact that the NDP has caused maximal stimulation of hydrolysis or it may reflect some commonality in the mechanisms of stimulation by the different agents. The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of different nucleotides on the ATPase activity of purified MRP. As shown in Fig. 2, MRP can hydrolyze not only ATP, but also GTP and dATP. This is consistent with the fact that GTP can support transport by MRP (13Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar,14Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 26Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Experientia. 1992; 48: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Perlin D.S. Latchney L.R. Wise J.G. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), substrate specificity is not restricted to just nucleotides containing adenosine and ribose moieties. However, as shown in Fig. 1, A and B, dATP and dGTP are stronger inhibitors than are CTP, UTP, dCTP, or dTTP, indicating these two purine nucleotides have much higher affinity than the pyrimidine nucleotides and implying that the base structure of the nucleotide plays an important role in binding. The sugar also is a determinant of the nucleotide binding, since CTP, for example, did not have any inhibitory effect until concentrations of 4 mm and higher were used, while dCTP inhibited 20% of the ATPase activity at 4 mm. This indicates that the deoxyribonucleotide has higher affinity for the MRP than the ribonucleotide. The much lower K m for dATP than ATP (Table I) also confirmed that the deoxyribonucleotide has higher affinity for MRP than the ribonucleotide. The effect of different phosphate chain length on the nucleotide binding is not clear because of the unexpected NDP stimulatory effect. However, comparing the effects of adenosine monophosphate with the di- or triphosphates at 4 mm, AMP inhibited about 10%, ADP, 30%, and dATP or AMP-PNP, 40%. This suggests that at least the diphosphate is necessary in order to efficiently compete with ATP binding. The stimulation by ADP was surprising and suggests that there is an ADP binding site in the protein separate from the ATP binding and hydrolytic site. ATP, dATP, or GTP cannot prevent the stimulatory effect of 250 μm ADP. This lack of effect of up to a 32-fold excess of NTP suggests that this site must have a strong preference for NDP. Hence, we postulate that there are two different kinds of nucleotide binding sites in the MRP, one an ADP binding site (regulatory site) and the other an ATP binding site (ATP hydrolytic site). ADP at lower concentrations binds to this ADP binding site, perhaps causing a conformational change which stimulates the ATPase activity. ADP at higher concentrations not only binds to this ADP binding site, but also to the ATP binding site(s) and inhibits the ATPase activity. All those NDPs tested, except UDP, can stimulate ATPase activity (Fig. 3 D), further indicating that the length of the phosphate chain is extremely important to NDP binding. ADP and GDP are more stimulatory at the 250 μm concentration than at the 1 mm concentration, whereas dADP and dGDP stimulate more at the 1 mm concentration than at the 250 μmconcentration, presumably reflecting different affinities of those nucleotides for the ADP binding site. CDP and dCDP can also stimulate ATPase activity (Fig. 3 D), indicating that pyrimidine nucleotides, except UDP, can also bind to this regulatory site. Since the nonhydrolyzable ADP analogue, AMP-CP, can also stimulate the ATPase activity, ADP hydrolysis is not required for this stimulation. Although the relevance of these findings to the cellular function of MRP is unknown, the biphasic sensitivity to ADP may be an effective modulator of its enzymatic activity. ADP concentrations between 10 μm and 2 mm were stimulatory, whereas higher concentrations inhibited activity. Since the stimulatory range covers the concentrations in the cell during reasonable changes in energy charge, stimulation of MRP may enhance its efficiency. When the energy charge of the cell becomes unusually low, i.e. low ATP and high ADP, activity would be inhibited. Overall the turnover of substrate would be accelerated under most conditions but reduced if the level of product became unusually high. The suggestion of an NDP regulatory site separate from the catalytic site is of interest from several points of view. First, the relationship of these two sites to the two nucleotide binding domains of the protein is intriguing. In the case of P-glycoprotein both of these domains have been shown to hydrolyze ATP (31Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known if that is the case with MRP. Mutagenesis of crucial residues in these domains of MRP will help to address the location of both hydrolytic and regulatory sites. Occupation of the NDP regulatory site appeared to fully activate NTP hydrolysis by MRP so that substrates of transport had no further effect. To again draw on information from P-glycoprotein (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it may be reasonable to assume that the drug binding and transport sites in MRP are in membrane associated domains and very recent data confirm this (34Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus mediation of the stimulatory conformational change, which presumably occurs on drug binding, to the site(s) of hydrolysis may be similar to the allosteric signal from the NDP binding site(s). Precise mapping of this site(s) in relation to drug binding site(s) should provide additional insight into the mechanism of MRP ATPase stimulation by substrates for transport and conversely the ATP-driven transport step.

The function of this protein was reexamined. When streptococcal membranes were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and renatured, a 56-kDa protein was detected that had kinase activity for a casein substrate. When this recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and incubated in the presence of [32P]ATP, it was responsible for phosphorylation of two proteins with 30 and 56 kDa that were not present in the control lysate. The 56-kDa protein was specifically phosphorylated in an immunoprecipitate of a detergent extract of the recombinant E. coli lysate with antibodies against the 56-kDa protein, indicating that it was autophosphorylated. The E. coli lysate containing the recombinant protein could bind hyaluronan, and hyaluronan binding was abolished by the addition of ATP. Kinetic analysis of hyaluronan synthesis and release from isolated protoplast membranes indicated that phosphorylation by ATP stimulated hyaluronan release and synthesis. Incubation of membranes with antibodies to the 56-kDa protein increased hyaluronan release. The addition of [32P]ATP to intact streptococci led to rapid phosphorylation of two proteins, 56 and 75 kDa each at threonine residues. This phosphorylation was neither observed with [32P]phosphate nor in the presence of trypsin, indicating that the kinase was localized extracellularly. The addition of ATP to growing group C streptococci led to increased hyaluronan synthesis and release. However marked differences were found between group A and group C streptococci. Antibodies against the 56-kDa protein from group C streptococci did not recognize proteins from group A strains, and a homologous DNA sequence could not be detected by polymerase chain reaction or Southern blotting.

Group A and C streptococci are pathogens capable of causing a variety of infections. Group A streptococci are known to initiate postinfectious sequelae in humans such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. Group C streptococci are primarily animal pathogens. Many strains of both groups A and C streptococci are able to surround themselves with a hyaluronan capsule that has been implicated as a major virulence factor (1Kass E.H. Seastone C.V. J. Exp.

This protein was affinity-labeled with the periodate-oxidized nucleotide sugars UDP-GlcNac and UDP-glucuronic acid, and it bound to nascent hyaluronan. Binding of protoplast membrane proteins to nascent hyaluronan was used to develop a new method that extracted the enzyme activity together with two proteins of 42 and 56 kDa (8Prehm S. Nickel V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proved by genetic deletion analysis that the 42-kDa protein was the streptococcal hyaluronan synthase. Therefore the function of the 56-kDa proteins was reexamined. Its amino acid sequence contained an ATP binding domain and indicated homology to bacterial transport proteins and several hyaluronan binding sites (7Lansing M. Lellig S. Mausolf A. Martini I. Crescenzi F. O'Regan-M Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It had an N-terminal signal sequence that could integrate it into protoplast membranes. The 56-kDa protein was processed to a 54-kDa protein by endogenous proteases and shed into the culture medium (13Mausolf A. Jungmann J. Robenek H. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This protein also elicited antibodies in patients with rheumatic fever and cross-reacted with surface protein form eukaryotic cells (14Prehm S. Herrington C. Nickel V. Völker W. Briko N.I. Blinnikova E.A. Schmiedel A. Prehm P. J. Anat. 1995; 187: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-reacting eukaryotic protein had a molecular mass of 52 kDa and formed a complex with the hyaluronan receptor RHAMM (15Klewes L. Turley E.A. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this publication we showed that the 56-kDa protein from group C streptococci is an extracellular hyaluronan-binding protein that has a threonine kinase activity and regulates hyaluronan capsule formation. Group C Streptococcus equisimilis(strain D181) was obtained from the Rockefeller University collection; other streptococcal strains were received from the culture collection of Dr. Wagner, University of Jena, Germany. Radiochemicals were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and other reagents were from Sigma. The S. equisimilis strain D181 was grown in Hewitt-Todd medium, and protoplast membranes were prepared as described (7Lansing M. Lellig S. Mausolf A. Martini I. Crescenzi F. O'Regan-M Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide under reducing conditions. Phosphoamino acids were analyzed by the method of Cooper et al. (16Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 387-405Crossref Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The relative molecular weight of the kinase was determined on polyacrylamide gels by the method of Geahlen et al. (17Geahlen R.L. Anostario M. Low P.S. Harrison M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the phosphate carrier protein Hpr was performed as described previously (18Deutscher J. Saier M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6790-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Protoplast membranes were prepared as described by Prehm et al. (8Prehm S. Nickel V. Prehm P. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and suspended in 50 mm Tris-malonate, pH 7.0, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. In some experiments the 100 μg of membranes were dephosphorylated with 2 units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, pH 8.5, for 1 h at 37 °C and recovered by ultracentrifugation in an Airfuge (Beckman) at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. Controls were incubated similarly without alkaline phosphatase. Aliquots of 200 μl were mixed at 37 °C with 200 μl of a solution of 160 μm UDP-GlcNac and 8 μm UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid (specific activity, 320 mCi/mmol), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2 and incubated at 37 °C. At various time points, aliquots of 50 μl were withdrawn, and 5 μl of a solution of 0.1 m HgCl2 was added to stop hyaluronan synthesis. The solution was chilled in ice water and subjected to ultracentrifugation in an Airfuge (Beckman) for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 0 °C. The sediment was dissolved in 50 μl of 1% SDS. A solution of 10% SDS was added to the supernatant to inactivate any synthase activity. The dissolved sediment and the supernatant were applied to descending paper chromatography on Whatman MM paper for 18 h in 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, ethanol (13:7). The origin was cut out, and the radioactivity was determined. For determining the effect of antibodies against the 56-kDa protein, 1 ml of protoplast membranes in 50 mm Tris-malonate, pH 7.0, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml were incubated with 50 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the 56-kDa protein or with preimmune serum for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The sediment was suspended in 1 ml of 50 mmTris-malonate, pH 7.0, and the kinetics of hyaluronan synthesis were measured as described above. Streptococci were grown in 10 ml of Hewitt-Todd medium in the presence or absence of ATP, alkaline phosphatase (1 unit/ml), the cysteine protease inhibitor e64 (0.1 mg/ml) or proteinase E (Pronase) (0.1 mg/ml) to A 600 = 0.6 and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. To dissociate the hyaluronan capsule, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 and shaken for 1 h at room temperature. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. A solution of 10% cetylpyridinium chloride was added to the supernatant to give a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was sedimented at 3,000 × g for 30 min and dissolved in 3 ml of 0.5 m NaCl by ultra sonication. Hyaluronan was again precipitated from the solution by the addition of 9 ml of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 30 min and dissolved in 1 ml of water. Aliquots were used for glucuronic acid determination (19Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1960; 4: 330-334Crossref Scopus (5205) Google Scholar), and the amount of hyaluronan was calculated. The culture supernatant of the bacteria was diluted with 5 ml of water, and hyaluronan was precipitated by the addition of cetylpyridinium chloride and determined as described above. Protoplast membranes (100 μg) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-malonate, pH 7.0, with 10 μCi [32P]ATP (specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol), 10 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. The proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. Exponentially growing cultures of E. coli Y1090 were infected with λgt 11 or λgt 11/2LK that contained the recombinant 56-kDa gene. After cell lysis, the debris were sedimented at 3,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-malonate buffer, pH 7.0, at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. These suspensions (100 μg) were incubated with [32P]ATP for 15 min and analyzed as described above for phosphorylation of streptococcal membranes. For immunoprecipitation, the suspension of membranes (100 μl) was supplemented with 10 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h at 0 °C. The suspension was centrifuged in an Airfuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (20 μl) was incubated with 20 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the 56-kDa protein or preimmune serum and 20 μl of a 1:1 suspension of protein-A-Sepharose for 1 h. The protein-A-Sepharose beads were sedimented by centrifugation for 1 min at 10,000 × gand washed with 1 ml each of phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 m NaCl. The sediment was resuspended and incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-malonate, pH 7.0, with 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2for 10 min at room temperature. The proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. Streptococci were grown on Todd-Hewitt agar plates that contained 1 mg/ml of testis hyaluronidase (specific activity, 440 units/mg), and replicas on nitrocellulose filters were prepared. After blocking with a solution of 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, the filters were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of antiserum against the 56-kDa protein in blocking solution for 1 h. The filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and developed with anti-rabbit-IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate as described (20Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of group C streptococci (strain D181) in Todd-Hewitt medium (400 ml) was diluted with prewarmed Todd-Hewitt medium to a finalA 600 = 0.5 and incubated with 10 mg of testis hyaluronidase (specific activity, 440 units/mg) for 30 min at 37 °C. Bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 ×g and resuspended in 40 ml of prewarmed Todd-Hewitt medium containing 4 mm MgCl2. Aliquots of 4 ml were incubated with 200 μl of [32P]phosphate (specific activity 10 mCi/ml) or with 200 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 10 mCi/ml) in the absence and presence of 160 units of the extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphatase apyrase. Aliquots of 1 ml were withdrawn after 5 and 15 min and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 1 min. The bacterial sediments were frozen until further analysis. The samples were resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide. Radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography. Inhibition of phosphorylation by extracellular trypsin was determined by incubation of 3 ml of the above bacterial suspension with 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 0.005% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. Phosphorylation was visualized as described above. Phosphorylation of extracellular casein by growing streptococci was determined by incubating 3 ml of the above bacterial suspension with 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 0, 1, 10, and 100 μg of casein for 15 min at 37 °C. Bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g, proteins in the culture media were precipitated by the method of Wessel and Flügge (21Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal.

Radioactive hyaluronan was prepared by incubating 150 μg of streptococcal membranes at 37 °C with 500 μl of a solution of 160 μm UDP-GlcNac and 8 μmUDP-[14C]glucuronic acid (specific activity 320 mCi/mmol), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2 for 2 h. Proteins were denatured by heating for 5 min to 100 °C, and the solution was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed against water and used for adsorption with E. colilysates. After cell lysis of E. coli Y1090 lysed by growth of λgt 11 or λgt 11/2LK, the debris were sedimented at 3,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, at a concentration of 3 mg/ml, and 100 μl were mixed with 5 μl of radioactive hyaluronan and 10 μl of 10 mm ATP or 10 μl of water and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The particular fractions were sedimented by ultracentrifugation in an Airfuge (Beckman) for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatants were removed, the pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of 1% SDS, and the radioactive counts were determined. Streptococcal membranes were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel that contained casein as kinase substrate and tested for a kinase activity. After electrophoresis, proteins were reconstituted, and the gel was incubated with γ-(32P)ATP. The radioactive substrate was washed out, and the gel was autoradiographed. One band was visualized with a molecular mass of 56 kDa (Fig. 1). The recombinant 56-kDa protein was expressed also in E. coliand analyzed for kinase activity. Membranes isolated from E. coli λgt-11 and E. coli λgt-11/2LK lysates were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, and the amount of radioactivity incorpororated into proteins was determined to be 3916 cpm/μg for normal and 5781 cpm/μg for recombinant cells. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the pattern of phosphorylated proteins was compared. Fig. 2 shows that both lysates contained phosphorylated proteins. However, the E. coli λgt-11/2LK lysate containing the cloned 56-kDa protein showed at least two additional phosphorylated proteins with 56 and 30 kDa. Antibodies against the 56-kDa protein were used for immunoprecipitation of the 56-kDa protein from a detergent extract of the particular fraction from an E. coli λgt-11/2LK lysate. The antiserum has been shown to react specifically with the 56-kDa protein in Western blots from membranes of the streptococcal strain D181 and recombinant E. coli λgt-11/2LK lysates (7Lansing M. Lellig S. Mausolf A. Martini I. Crescenzi F. O'Regan-M Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylated proteins were analyzed. Fig. 2 (lane C) shows that the recombinant 56-kDa protein was phosphorylated in the immunoprecipitate. This protein was also immunoprecipitated from a detergent extract of 32P-labeled membranes (data not shown). An immunoprecipitate from a control lysate of E. coli lacking the recombinant 56-kDa protein with antiserum against the 56-kDa protein or an immunoprecipitate from the recombinantE. coli lysate with preimmune serum did not yield any phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). These results indicated that the 56-kDa protein could be autophosphorylated. Previously, a membrane-bound kinase of the Hpr system has been described in streptococci that was involved in sugar transport (18Deutscher J. Saier M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6790-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the 56-kDa protein was able to phosphorylate the phosphate carrier protein Hpr. An E. colilysate containing the active recombinant 56-kDa kinase did not phosphorylate the streptococcal Hpr protein (data not shown). The 56-kDa protein contains several hyaluronan binding motifs (7Lansing M. Lellig S. Mausolf A. Martini I. Crescenzi F. O'Regan-M Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that are characterized by BX 7 B ,where B is a basic amino acid, and X is any other amino acid (22Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It was also extracted together with the hyaluronan synthase from streptococcal membranes by a recently developed procedure that enriched only hyaluronan-binding membrane proteins (8Prehm S. Nickel V. Prehm P. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the hyaluronan binding activity was retained by the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. E. coli lysates were prepared from λgt-11/2LK and λgt-11-control phages. Membranes were prepared by sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge. The membranes were incubated in the absence and presence of 1 mm ATP with radioactive hyaluronan to analyze the possibility that hyaluronan binding was influenced by phosphorylation. The membranes were again sedimented by ultracentrifugation, and the radioactivity in the membrane pellet was determined. Fig. 3 shows that the lysate containing recombinant 56-kDa protein bound hyaluronan only in the absence of ATP. The kinetics of hyaluronan synthesis and release was measured in the presence and absence of ATP. Fig. 4 shows that hyaluronan is synthesized at membranes and then released into the soluble fraction. Hyaluronan release ceased after 60 min in the absence of ATP. In the presence of ATP, membranes continued to release hyaluronan into the soluble fraction. Attempts to delete the 56-kDa kinase by homologous recombination were not successful, suggesting that it plays a critical, nonredundant role in the cell. Therefore specific antibodies were utilized to verify its influence on hyaluronan synthesis. The kinetics of hyaluronan synthesis and release was measured before and after binding of antibodies to streptococcal membranes. Fig. 5 shows that antibodies to the 56-kDa protein increased the rate of hyaluronan release from membranes into the supernatant. The following experiments should clarify the cellular localization and strain specificity of the 56-kDa protein. Bacterial colonies on agar plates containing hyaluronidase were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters to produce replicates. The filters were developed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the 56-kDa protein and anti-rabbit peroxidase. Group C streptococci (15 strains) and group A streptococci (18 strains) were tested. Positive signals were obtained from all group C streptococci but not from group A streptococci (data not shown). When protoplast membranes were prepared from different strains and analyzed by Western blotting with antiserum against the 56-kDa protein, the 56-kDa protein could again be detected only in membranes from group C streptococci but not in protoplast membranes form group A streptococci. Furthermore it was impossible with polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridizations at low stringency to identify the homologous gene in group A streptococci. For extracellular localization of the kinase, intact group C streptococci were incubated with [32P]phosphate or [32P]ATP for various periods, and phosphorylation was followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 6) in the presence and absence of adenosine 5′-triphosphatase. Two proteins with molecular masses of 56 and 75 kDa were phosphorylated only by extracellular ATP after 5 and 15 min in the absence of adenosine 5′-triphosphatase. Longer incubation times did not yield labeled proteins, indicating that phosphorylation was transient and susceptible to endogenous surface phosphatases. Neither extracellular [32P]phosphate that could be taken up by bacteria nor [32P]ATP in the presence of adenosine 5′-triphosphatase led to phosphorylation, excluding the possibility that intracellular [32P]phosphate caused the phosphorylation. Low concentrations of extracellular trypsin eliminated phosphorylation. Extracellular casein was also a target of the kinase (Fig. 6). When membranes were labeled for 15 min and chased with unlabeled ATP for 15 min, the 56-kDa protein disappeared and gave rise to a 36-kDa protein (data not shown), suggesting that the 56-kDa protein was rapidly degraded. The radioactive proteins were eluted from the gel and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. The phosphorylated amino acid was threonine (Fig. 7). The influence of the ectoprotein kinase and extracellular ATP on the hyaluronan synthesis and shedding was investigated on growing cultures of group C and group A streptococci. Increasing concentrations of ATP were added to group C streptococcal strain D181. The bacteria were separated from the culture medium, and the amount of hyaluronan on bacteria and in the medium was determined (Fig. 8). ATP reduced the amount of hyaluronan on bacteria and increased the concentration in the culture medium. This led to an overall increase in hyaluronan synthesis. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase decreased the amount of hyaluronan in the medium (Table I). In comparison, group A streptococcal strain 36487 released most of its hyaluronan capsule into the medium also in the absence of ATP, and alkaline phosphatase reduced the amount of hyaluronan in the medium only slightly. Treatment of group C streptococci with proteinase E led to an increased shedding of hyaluronan into the culture medium, whereas a cysteine proteinase inhibitor showed only marginal effects. Despite the differences in hyaluronan capsule between group A and group C streptococci, the macroscopic appearance of colonies on agar plates were mucoid with both strains.Table IAmount of hyaluronan (μg/ml) in the capsule and in the culture supernatant of 10-ml cultures of selected streptococci at an A 600 = 0.6TreatmentStreptococcus group C (strain D181)Streptococcus group A (strain 36487)CapsuleCulture mediumCapsuleCulture mediumControl41868022576+ Phosphatase41648025500+ Proteinase E12672630517+ Proteinase inhibitor36061028515 Open table in a new tab Because an ectoprotein kinase was found to be involved in growth regulation of fibroblasts (23Friedberg I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20560-20567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we measured the effect of increasing ATP concentrations on the growth rate of group A and group C streptococci. Extracellular ATP concentrations above 10 mmhad only slight growth inhibitory effects. In previous publications we reported cloning of a 56-kDa protein from protoplast membranes of group C streptococci that was erroneously characterized as the hyaluronan synthase (6Prehm P. Mausolf A. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 887-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Lansing M. Lellig S. Mausolf A. Martini I. Crescenzi F. O'Regan-M Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we have reexamined the function of this protein that bound hyaluronan (8Prehm S. Nickel V. Prehm P. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and exhibited sequence similarity with ATP-binding transport proteins (7Lansing M. Lellig S. Mausolf A. Martini I. Crescenzi F. O'Regan-M Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We show that a protein from streptococcal membranes with a molecular mass of 56 kDa possessed a protein kinase activity that was also retained when the protein was expressed in E. coli. The recombinant 56-kDa protein could be autophosphorylated in an immunoprecipitate. The kinase was not identical to the previously identified streptococcal Hpr kinase of the sugar transport system (18Deutscher J. Saier M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6790-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The 56-kDa protein and its gene was only detected in group C streptococci but not in group A streptococci. In streptococcal membranes, the kinase activity was directed against a 75-kDa and the 56-kDa membrane proteins. The function of the 75-kDa protein phosphorylation remains elusive, but it is conceivable that it mediates transduction of other signals in response to extracellular ATP. The localization of the 56-kDa kinase was investigated by the kinetics of phosphorylation with exogenous [32P]phosphate and [32P]ATP of intact growing bacteria. Rapid phosphorylation was only observed with [32P]ATP and was abolished by extracellular trypsin. Extracellular casein could also serve as a substrate. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of an ectoprotein kinase in prokaryotes, although there are several examples of eukaryotic ectoprotein kinases that mediate signal transfer from extracellular ATP into the cell (23Friedberg I.

In addition to the kinase activity, a hyaluronan binding activity could be demonstrated in recombinant E. coli lysates that bound exogenous hyaluronan only in the absence of ATP, suggesting that hyaluronan binding could be influenced by autophosphorylation. Thus, extracellular ATP influenced the kinetics of hyaluronan synthesis and release from isolated streptococcal protoplast membranes. Membranes continued to release hyaluronan in the presence of ATP but stopped this process after 60 min in its absence. Antibodies against the 56-kDa protein also increased the shedding rate of hyaluronan from membranes. Extracellular ATP at low millimolar concentrations stimulated hyaluronan synthesis and shedding from growing group C streptococci but not in group A streptococci. In the infected host, extracellular ATP can be released from attacking neutrophils or degranulated platelets (30Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). The effective ATP concentrations seem to be physiological, because they were slightly below the intracellular concentration that has been measured to be about 6 mm (31Srivastava D.K. Bernhard S.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 175-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Extracellular phosphatase reduced and extracellular proteinase increased hyaluronan shedding rate. These processes were only slightly influenced by an inhibitor of the extracellular cysteine proteinase that was shown to contribute to the virulence of group A streptococci (32Lukomski S. Sreevatsan S. Amberg C. Reichardt W. Woischnik M. Podbielski A. Musser J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2574-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is possible that other proteases participate in regulation of capsule formation. Van de Rijn has shown that the hyaluronan capsule is lost during the stationary phase (33van de Rijn I. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition we demonstrated here that group C streptococci, but not group A streptococci, regulate their capsule in response to extracellular ATP during the growth phase. The differences in hyaluronan synthesis between group A and group C streptococci may be a reflection of different host specificity. Retention of a larger hyaluronan capsule by group C streptococci in skin surfaces may be more advantageous for their survival in preventing desiccation. Invasion into necrotic host tissue would expose them to host defense that calls for rapid shedding of surface hyaluronan together with adhered antibodies or host cells. Thus the 56-kDa ectoprotein kinase may contribute to the virulence of group C streptococci. Our results also showed that binding of nascent hyaluronan by a cell surface receptor did not only inhibit hyaluronan release but also hyaluronan synthase activity in isolated membranes and hyaluronan synthesis in whole cells. This finding may be a reflection of a novel mechanism for the regulation of polymer biosynthesis. It appears that chain initiation or elongation is suppressed if dissociation of nascent hyaluronan from the synthase into the medium is inhibited by cell surface receptors. This mechanism may also apply for hyaluronan synthesis in eukaryotic cells that could be influenced by cell surface receptors such as CD44 or RHAMM. We thank A. Blanke, G. Reinhold, and U. Rasmussen for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Wagner for group A and C streptococcal strains."
https://openalex.org/W1978968536,"The erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) is essential for the transcription of βmaj globin in erythroid cells. We show here that RNA for this transcription factor did not alter during erythropoietin-induced differentiation of J2E cells; however, EKLF protein content decreased and was inversely related to globin production. This unexpected result was also observed during chemically induced maturation of two murine erythroleukemia cell lines. To explore the role of EKLF in erythroid terminal differentiation, an antisense EKLF construct was introduced into J2E cells. As a consequence EKLF RNA and protein levels fell by approximately 80%, and the cells were unable to manufacture hemoglobin in response to erythropoietin. The failure to produce hemoglobin was due to reduced transcription of not only globin genes but also key heme enzyme genes. However, numerous other genes, including several erythroid transcription factors, were unaffected by the decrease in EKLF. Although hemoglobin synthesis was severely impaired with depleted EKLF levels, morphological maturation in response to erythropoietin continued normally. Moreover, erythropoietin-induced proliferation and viability were unaffected by the decrease in EKLF levels. We conclude that EKLF affects a specific set of genes, which regulates hemoglobin production and has no obvious effect on morphological changes, cell division, or viability in response to erythropoietin."

The two types of mutations lead to an impairment of transepithelial ion transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and have similar but not identical pathophysiological consequences. This renal disorder mimics long term furosemide treatment (24Seyberth H.W. Rascher W. Schweer H. Kühl P.G. Mehls O. Schärer K. J. Pediatr. 1985; 107: 694-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and is characterized in the fetus by excessive saluresis and polyuria leading to polyhydramnios and premature birth. After birth, affected infants also suffer from the typical patterns of impaired tubular reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (24Seyberth H.W. Rascher W. Schweer H. Kühl P.G.

Characteristically, the strong stimulation of prostaglandin E2 release results in further aggravation of saluretic polyuria, secretory diarrhea, vomiting, mediation of fever, osteolysis, and failure to thrive (24Seyberth H.W.

This renal disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and affects 1 in 50,000–100,000 newborns (26Seyberth H.W. Soergel M. Köckerling A. Davidson A.M. Cameron J.S. Grünfeld J.P.

Expression studies of several mutations in KCNJ1 revealed an almost complete loss of Kir1.1 channel function (23Derst C. Konrad M. Köckerling A. Károlyi L. Deschenes G. Daut J. Karschin A. Seyberth H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 203: 641-645Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the thick ascending loop, this defect prevents luminal potassium recycling with secondary inhibition of the furosemide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, thereby disrupting electrogenic chloride reabsorption (27Lang F. Rehwald W. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms leading to nonfunctional Kir1.1 channels have not been defined in detail but may include incorrect targeting, abnormal pH regulation, misfolding, or occlusions of the permeant pathway. In the present report, we describe the clinical and functional analysis of a novel HPS mutation, N124K, 3All numbering of amino acids and nucleotides in the Kir1.1 sequence refer to the Kir1.1a (ROMK1) isoform. that affects an extracellularly localized residue of Kir1.1. A positively charged lysine at the equivalent position is present in none of the known Kir subunits except Kir1.3. Like Kir1.1, Kir1.3 is expressed predominately in kidney but also in lung and pancreas (13Shuck M.E. Piser T.M. Bock J.H. Slightom J.L. Lee K.S. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 586-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After heterologous expression and functional characterization of Kir1.1a and Kir1.3 channels, we demonstrate that these lysine residues are responsible for impaired channel function in mutant Kir1.1a and for low macroscopic currents in Kir1.3 channels. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes. Aberrant band patterns for the KCNJ1gene were sought by means of single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (28Orita M. Suzuki Y.H. Sakiya T. Hayaski K. Genomics. 1989; 5: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar) using the same primers as in a previous study (21International Collaborative Study Group for Bartter-like Syndromes Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a 20-μl volume containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 pmol of each primer, and 1.0 units of Taq polymerase. After an initial step at 94 °C for 5 min, PCR was conducted for 30 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. The reaction was completed with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified products were separated using the CleanGel DNA analysis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the Multiphor II electrophoresis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Migration was performed at 18 watts constant power at 15 °C for 1 h. The band patterns were visualized by the silver-staining method. Direct sequencing was performed after reamplification of the remaining PCR product using 5′-Cy5-labeled primers on an automated laser flourescence express sequencing system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Total cellular RNA from human kidney was a kind gift of Dr. Martin Kömhoff (Marburg, Germany). 2 μg of the isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed with 30 units of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) and 80 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) using a random hexanucleotide mixture, as described by the manufacturer. After 45 min at 42 °C, reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 5 min. For the amplification of the entire coding region of Kir1.1a, two PCR primers were chosen. The sense-primer (5′-CTTTCTGCAGCCATGAATGCTTCCAGTCGGAA-3′) contained the Kir1.1a start codon and a PstI restriction site, and the antisense-primer (5′-GAAAGTCGACTGTTACATTTTGGTGTCATCTGTT-3′) contained the stop codon and a SalI restriction site. PCR reactions were performed with 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) for 30 cycles (1 min, 94 °C; 1 min, 52.5 °C; 2 min, 72 °C). The resulting 1.2 kilobase PCR product was digested with SalI and PstI and cloned in the COS-7 cell expression vector pSV Sport1. To verify the cloning procedure, DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI prism dye termination method and an ABI prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A guinea pig FIX II genomic library (Stratagene) was plated on the Escherichia coli strain XL1-blue MRA (P2). A 605-bp fragment from a human Expressed Sequence Tag clone (GenBank accession number T94781/T94029, IMAGp998J11108, kindly supplied by the Resource Center of the German Human Genome Project, Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin) was isolated after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI and labeled with digoxigenin-11 dUTP using a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Replicate nylon membrane filters representing about 5 × 106 independent clones were screened at reduced stringency (2 × SSC (1 × SSC, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 60 °C) using a standard protocol provided by Boehringer Mannheim. Pure λ clones were isolated after two rescreenings under the same conditions. λDNA preparations (Qiagen, Hilden) were analyzed by restriction digestion and Southern blotting. Subsequently a 2188-bpBamHI fragment showing a strong positive signal in the Southern analysis was subcloned in the pBluescript SK+ vector and sequenced using the ABI method as described above. For construction of expression vectors containing gpKir1.3, a PCR reaction was performed on the cloned gpKir1.3, amplifying only a 1179-bp fragment harboring the entire coding region. Sense (5′-CCCTAGGCGGCCGCAAGAATCGGGAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGCGCGGCCGCGAGACACCCTGGTGTCA-3′) primers were designed for amplification. Primer internal NotI restriction sites were used for subcloning (see below). A commercial kit (Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, CLONTECH) was used for site-directed mutagenesis as described by the manufacturer, using the Kir1.1a and gpKir1.3 genes cloned in pSV Sport1 as a template. Therefore, two mutagenic primers (Kir1.1a[N124K], 5′-TGTGTGGAGAAAATTAATGGC-3′; gpKir1.3[K110N], 5′-TGCATCATGAATGTGGACTCT-3′), and one selection primer (5′-CAAGCTTACGTAGGCCTGCATGCGACGT-3′) were employed (base changes are underlined). The selection primer mutates the unique pSV Sport1 MluI restriction site toStuI for selection of correct mutations. Both mutations were checked by DNA sequencing. Wild type (WT) and mutant Kir1.1a and Kir1.3 cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pSVSport1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for expression in COS-7 cells. For expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, cDNAs were subcloned into the polyadenylating transcription vector pSGEM (a gift from Dr. M. Hollmann, Göttingen). Capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts from linearized cDNA were synthesized, and ∼6 ng was injected in defolliculated oocytes. Oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in ND96 solution (96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and assayed 48 h post-injection. Two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed with a Turbo Tec-10 C amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany) and sampled through an EPC9 interface (Heka Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) using PULSE/PULSEFIT software (Heka) on a Macintosh computer, and data analysis was performed with IGOR software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, Oregon). For rapid exchange of external solutions, oocytes were placed in a small-volume perfusion chamber with a constant flow of low K+ or high K+ solution (96 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Confluent COS-7 cells (ATCC number CRL1650) were transfected with 0.4–1.0 μg/ml Kir cDNA using LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature 48–72 h post-transfection in a bath solution consisting of 135 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Kimble Products, Sussex, UK), Sylgard©-coated (Dow Corning, Corning, NY) and heat-polished to give input resistances of 4–6 megaohms. The pipette recording solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2ATP, 100 μm cyclic AMP, 100 μm GTP, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Currents were recorded with an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier (Heka) and low pass-filtered at 2.9 kHz. Stimulation and data acquisition were also controlled by PULSE/PULSEFIT software. Series resistance of cells was routinely compensated by >80%, resulting in a maximum voltage error of 1–2 mV. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. (number of cells). Replacement of an asparagine by a lysine at position 124 (N124K) in Kir1.1a (KCNJ1) was found in a heterozygous state in a sporadic case of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (HPS). The pregnancy of the affected infant's mother was complicated by polyhydramnios and premature birth after 28 weeks of gestation. The child developed hypokalemic alkalosis, hyposthenuria, and hypercalciuria with subsequent nephrocalcinosis. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis revealed two aberrant bands in the KCNJ1 gene of the patient. Direct sequencing demonstrated (i) a heterozygous base exchange of a thymine 232 adenine at base position 372 resulting in a missense mutation (N124K) and (ii) the insertion of an additional cytosine at base position 1055–58, causing a frameshift mutation with an altered C-terminal amino acid sequence (starting at His-354) and a premature stop codon at amino acid position 362 in the mutated protein. Cosegregation analysis identified N124K as the maternal, and the frameshift, as the paternal allele. Thus, the clinical diagnosis of hyperprostaglandin E syndrome was confirmed genetically. To investigate the functional consequences of the novel HPS mutation N124K, WT, and mutant Kir1.1a channels were heterologously expressed in both Xenopusoocytes and mammalian COS-7 cells. As demonstrated earlier (23Derst C. Konrad M. Köckerling A. Károlyi L. Deschenes G. Daut J. Karschin A. Seyberth H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 203: 641-645Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), WT Kir1.1a cRNA/cDNA in both systems gave rise to robust inwardly rectifying K+ currents with properties typical of weakly rectifying Kir channels (2Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). With the extracellular K+concentration ([K+]e) raised to 96 mm, Kir1.1a current amplitudes in oocytes averaged 50.6 ± 8.0 μA (n = 9) at −100 mV membrane potential (Fig. 1 A). When mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] channels were expressed in oocytes, the kinetics of the macroscopic current were indistinguishable from WT Kir1.1a, but amplitudes were dramatically reduced to ∼8% (3.9 ± 1.2 μA; n = 5) under the same recording conditions (Fig. 1 A). Expression of Kir1.1a[N124K] in COS-7 cells resulted in a similar reduction in amplitude as compared with WT Kir1.1a (135 ± 24 pA, n = 3 versus1.12 ± 1.1 nA, n = 33). To estimate possible effects in heterozygous individuals, oocytes were injected with equal cRNA amounts of Kir1.1a and Kir1.1a[N124K] (total amount equal to that used before). Surprisingly, coinjected oocytes averaged only 1.75 ± 0.6 μA (n = 5), i.e. current amplitudes were also only a fraction of WT currents. This indicated a dominant-negative effect of the mutant Kir1.1a[N124K] subunits, and in heterozygous individuals, renders a total rescue of channel function by a simple heteromerization of WT and mutant subunits quite unlikely (see “Discussion”). It is also conceivable that in analogy to other Kir channels, kidney Kir1.1 subunits coassemble with other subfamily members expressed in the same cells. A second subfamily member, Kir1.2 (KAB-2; Kir4.1), is also expressed in the kidney and is functionally similar to Kir1.1a (13Shuck M.E. Piser T.M. Bock J.H. Slightom J.L. Lee K.S. Bienkowski M.J. J.

In addition, using an uncharacterized Expressed Sequence Tag sequence (IMAGp998J11108), we isolated a novel full-length clone with strong homology to Kir1.1 and Kir1.2 subunits from a guinea pig genomic library. A sequence analysis of the 2.2-kilobase BamHI fragment from one λ-phage clone, transferred in pBluescript SK+, showed a complete intronless coding region of 1128 bp flanked by 357 bp of genomic sequence upstream and 703 bp downstream. The main open reading frame encoded a protein of 375 amino acids that shared 95% identity to a recently published human Kir channel sequence termed Kir1.3 (13Shuck M.E. Piser T.M. Bock J.H. Slightom J.L. Lee K.S. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 586-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Kir4.2 (29Gosset P. Ghezala G.A. Korn B. Yaspo M.-L. Poutska A. Lehrach H. Sinet P.-M. Créau N. Genomics. 1997; 44: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or IRKK (30Ohira M. Seki N. Nagase T. Suzuki E. Nomura N. Ohara O. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Eki T. Murakami Y. Saito T. Ichikawa H. Ohki M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 2). As phylogenetic analysis shows, both human and guinea pig sequences are more closely related to Kir1.1/Kir1.2 than to any other Kir subunit. Thus, we consider the novel sequence to represent a species ortholog of the human Kir1.3 (hKir1.3) and term it gpKir1.3 following a new emerging nomenclature for Kir channels. The main sequence variations between the two species were located in the first 20 amino acids in the N-terminal region, which were only ∼45% similar. Sequence comparison showed 62.7% identity to Kir1.2 and 47.0% identity to Kir1.1 subunits (Fig. 2). Identity scores to members of other Kir subfamilies were significantly lower (<40%). Further analysis of gpKir1.3 recognized a C-terminal SNV motif also found in Kir1.2 subunits, indicating a putative interaction site with PDZ-domain proteins (31Horio Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A.

An ATP binding site (Walker A motif), present in Kir1.1 and Kir1.2 (2Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C.

Northern analysis of tissue total RNA identified strong expression of gpKir1.3 transcripts primarily in guinea pig kidney (data not shown). Thus gpKir1.3 was a likely candidate to associate with Kir1.1 subunits in renal Kir channels. hKir1.3 subunits isolated from human kidney remained uncharacterized since individually they failed to express in Xenopus oocytes (13Shuck M.E.

We noticed that in contrast to any other known Kir subunit, both hKir1.3 and gpKir1.3 carried the equivalent of the Kir1.1a[N124K] mutation, a positively charged lysine residue at position 110 (Lys-110) in the less conserved extracellular M1-H5 linker. Therefore the contribution to channel function of this residue was investigated in WT and mutant gpKir1.3. Macroscopic current evaluation of expressed WT and mutant Kir1.3[K110N] channels revealed that this lysine residue in fact was crucially important for the integrity of Kir1.3 channel function. Contrary to a recent report on hKir1.3 (13Shuck M.E. Piser T.M. Bock J.H. Slightom J.L. Lee K.S. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 586-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), gpKir1.3 cRNA injections (equal amounts and same recording conditions as before) did not fail to express currents but gave rise to a moderate current amplitude of 4.5 ± 1.6 μA (n = 7) at a membrane potential of −100 mV. Moreover, exchange of the HPS lysine for an asparagine (K110N), as in WT Kir1.1a channels, potentiated macroscopic currents to an average 27 ± 6.7 μA (n = 7),i.e. by a factor of ∼6 (Fig. 1 B), without noticeably changing other biophysical properties of macroscopic currents (see below). Robust whole-cell currents were also obtained after transfection of COS-7 cells with mutant Kir1.3[K110N] cDNA (968 ± 405 pA, n = 12), but only minor currents (100–150 pA) were observed in few cells transfected with WT Kir1.3. As shown from ramp and voltage-jump responses in varying concentrations of [K+]o, both WT and mutant Kir1.3[K110N] channels were highly selective for K+ ions with large amplitudes negative to the K+ Nernst potentialE K. Measured Nernst (zero current) potentials were −83 mV for 5 mm, −67 mV for 10 mm, −43 mm for 25 mm, and −8 mV for 100 mm[K+]e (Fig. 3 A), which was in perfect agreement with E K as predicted from the Nernst equation and followed [K+]e with a slope of approximately 54 mV per decade (Fig. 3 B). These data indicated that the conductance was predominantly carried by K+ ions as expected for Kir channels. Other functional characteristics of gpKir1.3 were more similar to Kir1.2 channels. Unlike weakly rectifying Kir1.1, but not unexpected from the presence of a crucial negatively charged residue (E157) in the second transmembrane segment (Fig. 2) that is directly involved in the binding of Mg2+ or polyamines (32Wible B.A. Taglialatela M. Ficker E. Brown A.M. Nature. 1994; 371: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), Kir1.3 rectified more strongly and displayed only moderate outward currents (Fig. 3 C).

The transcriptional regulatory signals and the genes that orchestrate this switch from proliferation to differentiation can be studied through the keratin gene family. Given the localization of keratin 4 (K4) to the early differentiated suprabasal compartment and having previously demonstrated that targeted disruption of this gene in murine embryonic stem cells results in impairment of the normal differentiation program in esophageal and corneal epithelial cells, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the human K4 promoter. A panel of K4 promoter deletions were found in transient transfection assays to be predominantly active in esophageal and corneal cell lines. A critical cis-regulatory element resides between −163 and −140 bp and contains an inverted CACACCT motif. A site-directed mutated version of this motif within the K4 promoter renders it inactive, whereas the wild-type version is active in a heterologous promoter system. It specifically binds esophageal-specific zinc-dependent transcriptional factors.

The esophagus is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium that is composed of proliferating basal cells and differentiated suprabasal, intermediate, and superficial squamous cells. Other sites sharing the stratified squamous epithelium include the cornea, oropharynx, larynx, skin, and anogenital tract. Basal cells undergo an exquisite program of differentiation accompanied by a series of morphological, biochemical, and genetic changes as they migrate to the luminal surface with the eventual production of flattened superficial squamous cells. Squamous cells are sloughed from the surface, which may in part by governed by processes such as senescence and apoptosis. There is constant renewal of inner basal cells that differentiate in the suprabasal layer. Insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms can be gained through an appreciation of the genes, as exemplified by the keratins, that govern this process and their transcriptional regulation. For example, keratins 5 and 14 are present in proliferating basal cells. Early differentiation genes in suprabasal cells include keratins 1 and 10, whereas late differentiation genes in superficial squamous cells include loricrin, profillagrin, and transglutaminase (1Byrne C. Tainsky M. Fuchs E. Development. 1994; 120: 2369-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The keratins are classified as the type I and type II intermediate filaments (2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The type I keratins are acidic, range from 40 to 60 kDa and consist of at least 17 distinct proteins: 12 epithelial type I keratins (K91 through K20), and 5 hair keratins (3Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4528) Google Scholar). The type II keratins are neutral to basic, range from 50 to 70 kDa, and consist of at least 15 distinct proteins: 10 epithelial (K1 through K8; with multiple forms of several of these) and 5 hair keratins (3Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4528) Google Scholar). The type I keratins in humans are found in a cluster on chromosome 17, and the type II keratins are on chromosome 12. A similar situation exists in mouse with the type I keratins on chromosome 11 and the type II on chromosome 15. Keratins are obligate heterodimers of one type I molecule and one type II molecule (4Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In vivo specific pairing is apparently due to the tissue-specific expression patterns of the keratins (3Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4528) Google Scholar). For example, K5 and K14 heterodimerize in basal cells and K1 and K10 heterodimerize in differentiating suprabasal cells. Although keratins are critical for providing structural strength for epithelial cells, further clues about keratin function have been gained through the discovery of mutations associated with diseases transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion which have indicated that keratins are important in cellular organization and growth (5Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For example, epidermal bullosa simplex (EBS) is characterized by intraepidermal blistering due to cell lysis within the basal layer (6Bonifas J.M. Rothman A.I. Epstein E.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Mutations have been identified in K5 and K14 genes that act in a dominant-negative fashion to cause EBS (6Bonifas J.M. Rothman A.I. Epstein E.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EH) involves blistering of suprabasal layers of the skin due to cell lysis and degeneration, basal cell hyperplasia, and a thickened granular layer and stratum corneum (skin ridges or scales). Mutations in K1 and K10 are found in EH (7Cheng J. Syder A.J., Yu, Q.C. Letai A. Paller A.S. Fuchs E. Cell. 1992; 70: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Rothnagel J.A.

EBS and EH have been recapitulated with murine models in which the keratins are disrupted by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (9Chan Y. Anton-Lamprecht I., Yu, Q.C. Jackel A. Zabel B.

K4 and K13 are found in suprabasal cells of nonkeratinizing stratified squamous epithelia (14Takahashi T. Shikata N. Senzaki H. Shintaku M. Tsubura A. Histopathology. 1995; 26: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). K4 is a type II keratin (59 kDa) the type I partner of which is K13. K4 has highest expression in the esophagus and cornea, but to a lesser extent is also found in the tongue, pharynx, larynx, and the anus (15van Muijen G.N.P. Ruiter D.J. Franke W.W. Achtstatter T. Saasnoot W.H.B. Ponec M. Warnaar S.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 162: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It appears during fetal development while these tissues differentiate. White sponge nevus is a benign autosomal dominant disorder characterized by thickened, white opalescent spongy-fold mucosa, primarily in the mouth but also in the esophageal epithelium, and has been shown recently to be due to a mutation in K4 (16Rugg E.L. McLean W.H. Allison W.E. Lunny D.P. Macleod R.I. Felix D.H. Lane E.B. Mundro C.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recently, we have developed a model in which the mouse K4 gene has been disrupted by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (17Ness S. Edelmann W. Jenkins T. Liedtke W. Rustgi A.K. Kucherlapati R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23904-23911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). K4 homozygous null mice have a phenotype largely restricted to the esophagus and cornea. There are severe disturbances in esophageal epithelial differentiation manifest by loss of the maturation sequence from the basal to the superficial squamous layers (17Ness S. Edelmann W. Jenkins T. Liedtke W. Rustgi A.K. Kucherlapati R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23904-23911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There is also evidence of basal cell hyperplasia in the cornea (17Ness S. Edelmann W. Jenkins T. Liedtke W. Rustgi A.K. Kucherlapati R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23904-23911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, K4 appears important in maintaining the differentiation phenotype in a highly tissue-specific fashion, and these findings provide additional basis for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of the K4 promoter. It appears that a particular combination of nuclear factors in a tissue that leads to the transcription of specific keratins. Illustrative of the regulation of basal cell promoters, AP2 binds the KER1 element in the K14 promoter (18Leask A. Rosenberg M. Vassar R. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Leask A. Byrne C. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20489-20496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suprabasal cell promoters that have been studied include the K1 promoter, where a 3′ element is keratinocyte-specific and Ca+ dependent (21Lu B. Rothnagel J.A. Langley M.A. Tsai S. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7443-7449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the K3 promoter has two cis-regulatory elements within 300 bp of the transcription start site that are regulated by Sp-1-related and NF-κB-related factors (22Wu R.L. Galvin S. Wu S.K. Xu C. Blumenberg M. Sun T-T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 303-316PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wu R.L. Chen T.T. Sun T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28450-28459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the regulation of keratin cellular promoters, viral gene expression is mediated through overlapping mechanisms in the stratified squamous epithelium. The human papillomavirus-18 C-enhancer is regulated by an apparent tissue-restricted factor designated KRF-1 (24Mack D.H. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as well as the ubiquitous Oct-1 and AP1. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ED-L2 promoter is active in suprabasal cells of the tongue and esophagus in transgenic mice (25Nakagawa H. Wang T. Zukerberg L. Odze R. Togawa K. May G.W. H Wilson J. Rustgi A.K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the basal ED-L2 promoter activity is attributable to a 70-kDa keratinocyte-specific factor (KSF) that is zinc-dependent and binds a CACACCT motif (26Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ED-L2 promoter is also regulated by phorbol ester, a factor that activates the differentiation program in stratified squamous epithelial cells (27Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester induces ED-L2 promoter activity in part through USF and Gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF) (27Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Jenkins T.D. Opitz O.G. Okano J.-I Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10747-10754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have now characterized the human K4 promoter forcis-regulatory elements and key trans-acting factors. Importantly, there is a region from −163 to −140 bp that contains an inverted CACACCT motif that contributes significantly to K4 promoter activity. When mutated, endogenous K4 promoter activity is abrogated. This cis-regulatory element binds esophageal-specific transcriptional factors, indicating that the suprabasal K4 promoter is in part regulated in a highly tissue-restricted fashion. The human K4 promoter was cloned with a PCR-based method that allows for the identification of genomic sequence from cDNA sequence (CLONTECH promoter finder kit). The human keratin 4 mRNA sequence was obtained from GenBank accession no. X67683. Briefly, a special adapter is ligated to the ends of DNA fragments generated by digestion of human genomic DNA with EcoRV,ScaI, DraI, PvuII, and SspI separately. Following adapter ligation, a small amount of the DNA from each “library” is used as a template for a primary PCR reaction using an outer adapter primer (AP1) (CLONTECH) and an outer gene-specific primer (GSP1) (Table I, part A). The primary PCR reaction mixture is then diluted and used as a template for a secondary PCR reaction using the nested adapter primer (AP2) (CLONTECH) and a nested gene-specific primer (GSP2) (Table I, part A). GSP1 and GSP2 are designed to anneal at the 5′ end of the known keratin 4 cDNA. PCR amplifications were performed using Tth polymerase mix (CLONTECH), which includes the Tth-Start antibody for automatic hot start. Primary PCR reactions were performed in 50-μl volumes containing 1 μl of ligated and diluted DNA, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.3, 85 mm KOAc, 1.1 mm MgOAc, 10 μm adapter primer 1 (AP1) and GSP1, 10 mmdNTP, and 1 μl of Tth polymerase mix. The cycle parameters were as follows: 7 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 25 s and annealing/extension at 72 °C for 4 min, followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 25 s and annealing/extension at 67 °C for 4 min and a final annealing/extension time for 4 min. A secondary PCR reaction was performed with 1 μl of a 1:100 dilution of the primary PCR reaction using AP2 and GSP2. The same reaction composition and cycle parameters were used except 5 and 20 thermocycles were performed, respectively. PCR products were examined on 1% agarose gels. PCR products from each library were cloned into a TA type vector (Novagen). DNA sequencing of the 5′ and 3′ ends was by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), vector primers T7 sense and M13 antisense (Novagen), and sequence-specific primers. Sequence analysis was performed using GenBank.Table IOligonucleotide primer sequences for PCR-based cloning of the human K4 promoter (A), construction of K4 promoter 5′ deletion constructs (B), and K4–163 promoter mutant constructs (C)A.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar). ASalI site was introduced at position −163 bp to facilitate cloning. A 1.1-kilobase pair human K4 5′-UTR fragment was isolated by PCR amplification to remove its putative endogenous translation start site (+59) with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. After confirmatory DNA sequencing, the reaction product was digested with SalI and BglII, agarose gel-purified, and ligated into the luciferase reporter gene promoterless vector, pXP2 (29Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), to generate the keratin 4 full-length promoter construct, designated as K4 −1040. This plasmid contained 1100 bp (−1040 bp to +59 bp) of the human keratin 4 promoter. A subsequent series of K4 promoter 5′ deletion constructs (K4 −940, K4 −540, K4 −340, K4 −163, and K4 −140) were generated in a similar fashion using K4 −1040 as a template for PCR with sense primers designed at the different positions of the promoter 5′ to the putative transcription start site and the antisense primer at position +59 (Table IB). The K4 −740 and K4 −185 constructs were generated by digestion of K4 −1040 with KpnI and BglII orBamHI and BglII, respectively, deleting 300 or 855 bp, respectively. K4 −163 promoter constructs containing mutant nucleotides spanning region −163 to −140 bp, designated as region K, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension PCR as described by Ho et al. (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotide primers were used to generate two DNA fragments having overlapping ends. These fragments were combined in a subsequent “fusion” reaction, in which the overlapping ends anneal, allowing the 3′ overlap of each strand to serve as a primer for the 3′ extension of the complementary strand. The resulting fusion product was amplified further by PCR. Specific alterations in the nucleotide sequence were introduced by incorporating nucleotide changes into overlapping oligonucleotide primers. Primer sequences for overlapping mutant primers are shown in Table IC. Primers K4 −540 and K4 +59 were used to amplify the fusion product, which was finally digested using a SalI site introduced at position −163 and a BglII site at the 3′ end with subsequent subcloning. Two mutant versions of region K were introduced to obtain the promoter constructs K4 −163 KMT1 and K4 −163 KMT2. Minimal promoter DNA constructs containing wild-type or mutant nucleotides of region K were generated by ligation of kinased double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (Table II) into aBglII site of the pGL3-promoter vector containing the minimal SV40 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (Promega). All constructs were verified with DNA sequencing (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Plasmids were purified by a modified alkaline lysis method (Qiagen).Table IISense strand sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides of the human keratin 4 promoter used for EMSAs and minimal promoter constructsK4-K (wild-type)5′-GATCTCAGATGACTTCTGTAGGTGTGTTA-3′K4-KMT15′-GATCTCAGAGTTGAAAGGTAGGTGTGTTA-3′K4-KMT25′-GATCTCAGATGACTTCTGTCTAACATTTA-3′K4-B (wild-type)5′-AGCTTGTAGGTGTGTTC-3′K4-BMT15′-AGCTTGTAGGTGCGTTC-3′K4-BMT25′-AGCTTGTAGGTGTTTTC-3′K4-BMT35′-AGCTTGTATATGTGTTC-3′ED-L2-F (wild-type)5′-AGCCACACCTAA-3′ED-L2-FMT5′-AGCAACACCTAA-3′Nucleotide positions in the human keratin 4 promoter are −163 to −140 bp for probe K and −151 to −140 bp for probe B.

A rabbit normal corneal cell line SIRC (ATCC) was grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% serum and antibiotics, as indicated. Transient transfection of all DNA constructs was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/35-mm well and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 2 μg of pGreen Lantern-1, a reporter plasmid encoding a green fluorescent protein (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cotransfections were carried out, adding to the luciferase reporter plasmid 0.5 or 1 μg of expression plasmids pRC/RSV-empty, pCMV-12S.E.1A, pCMV-12SRG2, CMVβ-p300, or pRC/RSV-mCBP. The transfectant mixture consisted of a 250-μl solution of 125 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmKCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 6 mm glucose. After a 12-h incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh 10% serum containing medium was exchanged. Luciferin assays were performed using luciferin, ATP, and coenzyme A (Promega) with a Monolight luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) as described previously (26Nakagawa H. Inomoto T.

Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 200 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and 40 μl of the lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent consisting of 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mmMgCO3, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 530 μm ATP, and 470 μm luciferin. Incubations were performed in triplicate, and results were calculated as the mean ± S.E. values for luciferase activity. Values were then expressed as a -fold increase or decrease compared with the control for each set of experiments. Activities were expressed as the mean of at least three independent transfection experiments. In a subset of the transfection experiments, cells were examined under fluorescence microscopy (475 nm excitation peak, 490 nm emission peak) to assess green fluorescent protein production. The percentage of fluorescing cells was determined in each well and found not to vary within a given transfection experiment, indicating that transfection efficiency was uniform. Nuclear extracts from different cell lines were prepared as described previously (26Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol.

The protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric method (Bio-Rad protein assay). α-32P-Labeled oligonucleotide DNA probes were constructed with 5 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table II), synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Applied Biosystems), and purified by gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeling was done by a Klenow fill-in reaction in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dGTP, 33 μmdTTP, 0.33 μm [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products), 1 unit of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and followed by polyacrylamide gel-purification. EMSAs were carried out by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extract with 5 fmol of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe (20,000 cpm) in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 10 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.25× Tris borate gel and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-AR) at −80 °C for 12 h. For competition experiments, the nuclear extract was preincubated with 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table II) prior to the addition of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel electrophoresis. Immune supershift assays were performed using a polyclonal anti-AP2 antibody (AP2α (C-18)) and polyclonal anti-CBP antibodies (CBP1 (451), CBP2 (A-22)) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antibody was preincubated with the nuclear extract at 4 °C for 1–12 h prior to the addition of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe. Other conditions for EMSAs are described above. The B and BMT2 single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type and mutant sequences of the human keratin 4 promoter (Table II) were labeled by annealing corresponding 7-mers (oligonucleotides) followed by the Klenow fill-in reaction, as described above, except that 5-bromodeoxyuridine was substituted for dTTP. Binding reactions were performed in an identical fashion, except that the reaction was for 30 min at 4 °C to inhibit protein degradation. Samples were exposed to a medium wave (312 nm) UV transilluminator (UVP Inc.) for 30 min on ice at a distance of 3 cm. Samples were then mixed with 2× SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Electrophoresis was carried out on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-AR) at −80 °C for 12 h. To obtain the 5′-untr"

In this reaction, the phosphoryl of one response regulator is transferred to a histidine on the phosphotransferase before phosphorylating an aspartate of the second response regulator. The phosphorylated histidine on the Spo0B phosphotransferase was found to be His30. Site-directed mutation of His30 to alanine destroyed its phosphotransferase activity in vitroand strains constructed with this mutation were unable to sporulate. None of the other 10 histidines of Spo0B was implicated in the phosphotransferase reaction. A structurally vulnerable site, histidine 23, was also identified through the mutational study. The His30 of Spo0B resides in a domain with little sequence homology to functionally equivalent domains in the phosphorelays of other bacterial and yeast systems, suggesting that the two types of phosphotransfer domains evolved convergently.

Two-component signal transduction systems generally consist of a sensor kinase and a response regulator. The sensor kinase interprets specific signals resulting in an autophosphorylation reaction where a phosphate from ATP is transferred to a histidine residue on the kinase (1Ninfa A.J. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group is then donated to an aspartate residue on the response regulator to which the kinase is mated. The phosphorylation of the response regulator serves to modify another domain in the protein to be catalytically active or in the case of transcription factors, to bind to DNA and stimulate transcription from specific promoters. In micro-organisms, there are dozens of such two-component systems that are used to regulate many different processes of the cell (2Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). There exist more complex signal transduction systems based on this simple paradigm. The phosphorelay (Fig. 1) was named to describe the flow of phosphate between signaling molecules involved in the initiation of the developmental process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis (4Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In the phosphorelay, at least two sensor kinases, KinA and KinB, are used to feed phosphate into the system (5Perego M. Cole S.P. Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6187-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The primary response regulator target of these kinases is Spo0F, consisting solely of a response regulator domain of 124 amino acids that serves as an intermediate in the phosphotransfer scheme. The goal of the phosphorelay is to phosphorylate the Spo0A transcription factor to activate developmental transcription (7Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Hoch J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 441-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by transferring the phosphoryl group from Spo0F∼P to Spo0A by means of the Spo0B response regulator phosphotransferase, an enzyme first discovered in the phosphorelay and unique to it. The Spo0B response regulator phosphotransferase is a critical junction between the information processing portion of the phosphorelay and transcription activation. When the phosphorelay was discovered, it was speculated that the multitude of signals that a cell is required to process before choosing between vegetative growth and development requires a signal transduction system capable of recognizing many signals and the more components of the pathway, the more targets for regulation (4Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have revealed the prophetic nature of this conclusion. It is now clear that both Spo0F and Spo0A are subject to dephosphorylation reactions from protein aspartate phosphatases that process signals antithetical to sporulation (9Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10Ohlsen K.L. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, information conducive to development promotes the phosphorylation of the phosphorelay via the kinases while information counter to sporulation stimulates the loss of phosphate from the phosphorelay by phosphatases (9Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11Perego M. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Perego M. Hoch J.A. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 97-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The phosphorelay is actually the core of a signal integration mechanism capable of recognizing and dealing with a large variety of signals. The Spo0B response regulator phosphotransferase has not been found, as yet, to be the target of regulation by any signals. Thespo0B gene is co-transcribed with a gene for the essential GTPase, Obg, which is representative of a large family of related proteins found in other micro-organisms and higher organisms (13Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no interactions between Spo0B and Obg have been observed. In the course of the reaction catalyzed by Spo0B, the enzyme becomes phosphorylated and the phosphorylated residue has the properties of a phosphoramidate, assumed to be histidine-phosphate (4Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In this report, we establish the identity of the phosphorylated residue and, based on the motif in which it resides, speculate about the origin and role of such proteins. Spo0B was phosphorylated in 30 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). KinA was added to a final concentration of 1 μm and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 min, followed by addition of Spo0F and Spo0B at 10 μm each. After another incubation for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 volume of 5× protein loading buffer and separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE1 according to the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The gel was exposed to x-ray film at room temperature for 3 min, and the band corresponding to Spo0B∼P was localized and excised. The gel pieces were ground in an Eppendorf tube, and protein was extracted in 800 μl of freshly prepared 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. The gel debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was lyophilized; the resulting pellet was dissolved in water, and stored at −80 °C before use. Alternatively, Spo0B∼P was eluted from the gel by electrocution in 1× Tris-glycine running buffer, and dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Radiolabeled Spo0B∼P was hydrolyzed to a mixture of individual amino acids with 3 mKOH at 115 °C for 5 h, as described previously with minor modifications (15Smith R.A. Halpern R.M. Bruegger B.B. Dunlap A.K. Fricke O. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 19: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The phosphohistidine standard was prepared by a reaction of potassium phosphoramidate (20 mg) and histidine (2 mg) in water (200 μl) for 2 h at room temperature, as described (16Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1988; 336: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The hydrolysate was spotted onto a thin-layer chromatography plate along with the standards of unlabeled phosphoarginine (Sigma) and phosphohistidine. The plate was developed with 200 ml of a mixture containing three solvents: chloroform, methanol, and 17% (w/w) ammonia at a ratio of 2:2:1. After the plate was dried in air, the32P-labeled phosphoamino acid was detected by autoradiography and the standards were visualized by spraying the plate with freshly prepared 2% ninhydrin in ethanol. Spo0B protein was phosphorylated in a mixture containing KinA, Spo0F, and [γ-32P]ATP as described above and the reaction mixture was resolved on a 10% Tris-Tricine PAGE (17Schägger H. von Jagow G. Ann. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue 250 in 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 30 min, then destained in the same solution until the bands could be visualized. Bands corresponding to Spo0B∼P were excised, placed in an Eppendorf tube, and washed with 300 μl of 50% CH3CN, 200 mmNaHCO3 for 15 min at room temperature, followed by two additional washes with 150 μl of the same buffer. The shrunk gel was then cut into 1 × 2-mm pieces and dried down using a SpeedVac (Savant). 20 μl (2 μg) of sequencing-grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Promega) in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA was added as 5-μl aliquots. Each aliquot was allowed to soak in before adding the next aliquot. A 50-μl aliquot of 200 mm NaHCO3 solution was finally added to just cover the gel. The digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant was transferred to another tube and the gel pieces were extracted twice with 200 μl of 60% CH3CN, 200 mm NaHCO3 for 20 min with shaking at room temperature. The combined solution was dried down by SpeedVac, the pellet dissolved in sample buffer, and analyzed on a 4–10%/18% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. After staining and destaining to reveal the molecular weight markers, the gel was exposed to x-ray film. Mutagenesis was done by the PCR reaction using protocols with either (i) double sets of primers and Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) or (ii) a megaprimer method using Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar, 19Aiyar A. Xiang Y. Leis J. Methods on Molecular Biology: In Vitro Mutagenesis Protocol. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996Google Scholar). (i) The PCR conditions were: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, for 35 cycles, with a final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. The plasmid 0B-16 (20Zhou X.Z. Madhusudan Whiteley J.M. Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. Proteins. 1997; 27: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was used as template, and primers used were the following: two external primers, 0B5Nde 5′-GGA GAT ATC ATA TGA AGG ATG and 0B3Bam 5′-GCC GGA TCCACA AAC ATA ATG; the forward and reverse primers for H30A mutation, 5′-GCC ATT CCC GGG CTG ATT GGA TG and 5′-CAT CCA ATCAGC CCG GGA ATG GC; the forward and reverse primers for H64A mutation, 5′-GAC GCA AAG GCC GAA TCA AAG C and 5′-GCT TTG ATT CGG CCT TTG CGT C; and the forward and reverse primers for H88A mutation, 5′-GGA AAA CCG CTT ATA TGA CG and 5′-CGT CAT ATA AGC GGT TTT CC. PCR products were subcloned into pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) in the NdeI and BamHI sites, resulting in 0B/PET28, 0BH30A/PET28, 0BH64A/PET28, and 0BH88A/PET28. (ii) PCR reaction with a 5′ primer, 0BfERI, 5′-CAT AAA GAA TTC TGC CTG GCT GCA AAT CAA, and a 3′-mutagenic primer was used to generate a megaprimer containing the mutation. This PCR product was purified and used together with 0BfERI and a 3′ primer, which introduced a stop codon at residue 155 and aBamHI site, 5′-ATG GAG GAT CCT AGG CGC CGT GAA AAT CAA, in the second run of PCR reaction. H23Q and/or H27Q mutation(s) were generated by a degenerate mutagenic primer having an A/T mixture at the third codon of histidine, 5′-CAT GCC GGG A(A/T)T GGC CAA GCA G(A/T)T GAA TCA GTT C. The mutagenic primer for H75A was 5′-GAA AAT CAA ACG CCA AAG CCG GTG TTT TCA GG and for H23A mutation was 5′-GGA ATG GCC AAG CAG AGC AAT CAG TTC GTT TG. The final PCR products were digested with EcoRI-BamHI and subcloned into pJM103 (21Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1993: 615-624Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced using Sequenase II sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to confirm the authenticity of the spo0B gene and expected mutations. spo0B(H23Q), spo0B(H27Q), and spo0B(H23Q/H27Q) genes were PCR-amplified using Pwo polymerase with the chromosomal DNA of each corresponding B. subtilis strain as template, and 0B5Nde and 0B3Bam as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. These PCR fragments were subcloned into pET28a(+) vector to generate the N-terminal (His)6-tagged proteins. Each pET28a(+) construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The transformant cells were grown in 1 liter of Luria broth (LB) medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C toA 600 of 1.0 at which time the culture was induced for 6 h by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 10 min in the SS-34 rotor of a Sorvall centrifuge and sonicated in 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removing the cell debris by centrifuging at 17,000 rpm in the SS-34 rotor of a Sorvall centrifuge for 50 min, the supernatant was applied onto a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. Following extensive washing with the same buffer until A 280 was below 0.05, the His-tagged proteins were eluted with 100 ml of the lysis buffer containing a gradient of 0–100 mm imidazole in the lysis buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The integrative plasmids encoding the wild type Spo0B N-terminal fragment were constructed by EcoRI-BamHI digestion of the plasmid pJH4222–5 (22Kok J. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7155-7160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this fragment, which contains both the promoter region and N-terminal encoding portion of spo0B, was subcloned into the integrative vector, pJM103, resulting in Spo0B/pJM103. The fragments with individual H30A, H64A, and H88A mutations were obtained from the EcoRV-MscI digestion of the corresponding pET28a(+) constructs and used to replace the corresponding fragment in Spo0B/pJM103. The orientations were verified by restriction enzyme digestion, and the mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. All integrative constructs were transformed into the B. subtilis strain JH642 (trpC2 phe-1) according to the published procedure (23Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Cmr transformants were selected on Schaeffer sporulation plates (24Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 701-711Crossref Scopus (882) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Sporulation efficiency was determined by growing the strain in 3 ml of Schaeffer's medium containing 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol medium at 37 °C for 24 h. Serial dilutions were plated before and after treatment with 0.1 volume of chloroform, to determine the number of viable cells and spores, respectively. It had been shown previously that Spo0B is phosphorylated when it catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from Spo0F∼P to Spo0A. The phospho-Spo0B (Spo0B∼P) exhibited acid lability and alkali stability that were indicative of phosphoramidates, such as phosphohistidine, phospholysine, and/or phosphoarginine (4Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To determine which of these amino acid(s) was actually phosphorylated, Spo0B was phosphorylated using the KinA-Spo0F-Spo0B phosphorelay reactions and Spo0B∼P was purified by separation on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The isolated Spo0B∼P was alkaline-hydrolyzed into a mixture of individual amino acids and analyzed by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC), with the standards phosphohistidine and phosphoarginine (Fig. 2). The spot of 32P-labeled phosphoamino acid produced by Spo0B∼P hydrolysis co-migrated with the phosphohistidine standard. As a positive control, NtrB∼P, a histidine kinase in the nitrogen regulation system of E. coli, which is known to be phosphorylated on a histidine residue (25Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Weiss V. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), was analyzed in parallel with Spo0B∼P. The chromatographic migration patterns were identical for both proteins. A secondary radiolabeled spot, which migrated slightly slower than the histidine standard, was observed for both Spo0B and NtrB (Fig. 2). This species is not phospholysine, which has a mobility less than phosphoarginine (15Smith R.A. Halpern R.M. Bruegger B.B. Dunlap A.K. Fricke O. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 19: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As has been reported for the histidine kinase, VirA, of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (27Jin S. Roitsch T. Ankerbauer R.G. Gordon M.P. Nester E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another form of phosphohistidine where the phosphoryl group resides on a different nitrogen of the imidazole ring (28Hultquist D.E. Moyer R.W. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) might account for this. Spo0B, therefore, appears to be phosphorylated solely on a histidine residue. There are 11 histidine residues in Spo0B (Fig. 3 A). In order to identify which histidine was phosphorylated, an analytic protease digestion was performed. Endoproteinase Lys-C was chosen based on the distinct histidine-containing fragment sizes expected from a complete digestion (Fig. 3A). The last five histidine residues (His119, His132, His141, His153, and His183) reside on a minimal 8.8-kDa peptide, whereas the first three histidine residues (His23, His27, and His30) lie on a 3.4-kDa fragment. Spo0B∼32P protein was digested as described, and the results of autoradiography are presented in Fig. 3 B. Only one radiolabeled peptide was observed in the digestion mixture. The apparent size of this peptide is smaller than the 6-kDa molecular size marker, indicating it is not the 8.8-kDa fragment. These data, therefore, indicate that none of the last five histidines is the phosphorylation site, but do not definitively identify the phosphorylation site without additional data. The role of the remaining six histidine residues was subsequently examined by site-directed mutagenesis. Because the Spo0B-phosphorylated intermediate is likely to be critical in the phosphorelay, a complete elimination of sporulation would be expected if the phosphorylation site was altered. Histidine residues 23, 27, 30, 64, 75, and 88 were mutated individually as listed in Table I. Functional transcriptional units with C-terminal truncated spo0B genes carrying each individual mutation were constructed on an integration vector, pJM103. The resulting plasmids were introduced and integrated into the chromosomal spo0B locus by Campbell-type recombination in order to investigate the effect on sporulation of individual histidine mutations. After integration of the plasmids into the chromosome, the recombinants contained two copies of the spo0B gene; one copy encoded a C-terminal truncated and nonfunctional protein, as shown previously (22Kok J. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7155-7160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the other copy was a fully functional intactspo0B gene. Depending on where the recombination event takes place, the intact gene can be wild type, or contain the His mutation in the recombinants, as shown in Fig. 4. If the Spo0B mutant cannot support the initiation of sporulation, we expect to find both Spo− and Spo+ phenotypes among the transformant colonies on Schaeffer sporulation plates. As shown in Table I, only mutations at two of these histidine residues, 23 and 30, produced diminished sporulation phenotypes. Both Spo− and Spo+ colonies were observed in transformation with plasmid donors having either H23Q, H23Q/H27Q or H30A mutations, while the others gave only Spo+ colonies. Spore counts in liquid medium were performed with these mutants in order to obtain a more quantitative comparison. H30A completely eliminated spore formation (frequency less than 10−8). H23Q yielded ∼104-fold decreased sporulation frequency compared with that of wild type; however, H23Q/H27Q double mutations somehow rescued the defect of the H23Q single mutation to only a ∼10-fold decrease relative to that of wild type. The H23A mutant, however, behaves like wild type Spo0B. One explanation for the peculiar histidine 23 mutation is that H23Q disrupts interactions with one of the Spo0B relay partners, Spo0F or Spo0A, and by introducing an additional H27Q mutation, the interactions were re-established. Alternatively, the H23Q mutation may produce a less stable protein, while the second H27Q mutation complements the instability introduced by H23Q. In vitro phosphotransfer experiments were done to further characterize these mutants. Nevertheless, if Spo0B phosphorylation is essential for its phosphotransferase activity, this result indicates that the putative site of phosphorylation is either H23 or H30.Table IIn vivo sporulation phenotypes resulting from spo0B mutationsResidue no.SubstitutionSporulation phenotype23His → Gln−23His → Ala+27His → Gln+30His → Ala−64His → Ala+75His → Ala+88His → Ala+23, 27His/His → Gln/Gln±spo0B gene containing single and double mutation generated by in vitro mutagenesis using PCR, subcloned into vector pJM103, was integrated into B. subtilis strain JH642 via a Campbell-type recombination. The sporulation phenotypes of the transformants were observed on Schaeffer sporulation plates. Open table in a new tab spo0B gene containing single and double mutation generated by in vitro mutagenesis using PCR, subcloned into vector pJM103, was integrated into B. subtilis strain JH642 via a Campbell-type recombination. The sporulation phenotypes of the transformants were observed on Schaeffer sporulation plates. A total of seven Spo0B proteins were expressed and purified as N-(His)6-tagged proteins, including wild type, H23Q, H27Q, H23Q/H27Q, H30A, H64A, and H88A. Like the wild type protein, all mutants behave as dimers as indicated by native gel analysis. In addition, phosphorylation of the N-terminal His6-tagged wild type Spo0B was similar to the wild type protein, indicating that the N-terminal His tag does not significantly affect Spo0B catalytic activity (data not shown). Each protein was analyzed for its ability to be phosphorylated by Spo0F∼P. The autoradiography of the separated proteins of these reactions is presented in Fig. 5. It is clear that only H30A is unable to be phosphorylated by Spo0F∼P. Despite the defect seen in vivo, the H23Q mutant can accept the phosphoryl group from Spo0F∼P perfectly well. It is curious that the H23Q mutant protein migrated at a slightly different position even in the presence of SDS. The result shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the single alanine substitution at residue 30 can prevent Spo0B phosphorylation. It remained possible that phosphorylation of Spo0B arises from a side reaction and is not necessary for the phosphotransferase function of Spo0B. Such a situation was found in the phosphorylation of the GTPase, Obg, where the protein becomes phosphorylated during the GTPase reaction but histidine phosphorylation is not part of the catalytic mechanism (29Welsh K.M. Trach K.A. Folger C. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7161-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test this possibility, these Spo0B mutants were assayed for their phosphotransferase activity from Spo0F∼P to Spo0A. The H30A mutant neither receives the phosphate from the Spo0F∼P nor transfers the phosphoryl group to Spo0A (Fig. 6). The unrelated histidine mutants (H23Q, H64A, H88A, and H23Q/H27Q), however, resembled the wild type Spo0B: they were phosphorylated by Spo0F∼P and were able to phosphorylate Spo0A (Fig. 6). Thus, the phosphorylation of Spo0B on the His30 appears to be indispensable for its phosphotransferase activity. The abnormality of the H23Q mutant was clearly illustrated by native gel electrophoresis as well. As shown in Fig. 7, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Spo0F and Spo0B can be resolved on a 13% native PAGE. The position of Spo0F∼P comes from comparinglanes 1 and 2. In lanes 7–10, no phosphorylation occurred because KinA was not present in the reaction mixture. It is clear that H23Q (Fig. 7,lane 9) migrated at a different rate relative to those of the other Spo0B proteins. In addition, the H27Q mutation somehow corrected the abnormality of H23Q and therefore, the H23Q/H 27Q mutant migrated to the same position as the wild type protein (Fig. 7,lane 8). When KinA was added into the reaction, all Spo0B present in the reaction mixture was phosphorylated under this reaction condition, and the three Spo0B∼P proteins examined here migrated faster than did the unphosphorylated Spo0B. This is opposite to the behavior of Spo0F, which runs faster than Spo0F∼P. Additionally, no change in H30A migration was observed in the presence of KinA, Spo0F, and ATP, indicating no phosphorylation occurred (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 7). This is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, the position of unphosphorylatable H30A was identical to that of the wild type protein, implying that its global folding was not affected by its mutation (Fig. 7, lane 7 versus lane 10) and the inability to phosphorylate was not a result of protein misfolding. Although the phosphorelay signal transduction system was first discovered in the information processing pathway to the initiation of sporulation in B. subtilis, it is now clear that such pathways are found in other bacteria (30Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and yeast (32Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito J. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The key element in a phosphorelay is the Spo0B equivalent that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from one response regulator to another. In the B. subtilis phosphorelay, this enzymatic activity is found on an individual protein as are the kinase and Spo0F response regulator. Phosphorelays also exist in multi-domain enzymes such as BvgS or ArcB, where all the enzymatic activities, except the ultimate response regulator transcription factor, reside in a single protein (30Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is highly likely that all of the “unusual” histidine kinases that incorporate a response regulator domain function by means of a phosphorelay. Regardless of the domain structure of the proteins involved, the catalytic mechanism follows the original His-Asp-His-Asp paradigm described for the B. subtilisphosphorelay (4Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). There are several key properties of the His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay that are not universally appreciated. The phosphates on aspartate residues are in the form of a mixed anhydride and susceptible to hydrolysis spontaneously, by autophosphatase activity and by external phosphatases including the kinase that originally phosphorylated it. Phosphorelay signal transduction systems allow effectors other than those that regulate the kinase to influence the phosphorylation level of the system. The Spo0B phosphotransferase reaction is readily reversible, and the equilibrium of the reaction at similar response regulator concentrations is close to an equal distribution of phosphate on both the substrate and the product. 2J. A. Hoch, unpublished results. Thus, the level of Spo0F∼P and Spo0A∼P in the cell is likely to be roughly the same excluding other unknown factors that modify the phosphate distribution. The consequence of reversibility is that any influence on the stability of the phosphorylated state of one of the response regulators will immediately affect the phosphorylation level of the other. This was dramatically demonstrated by the Rap phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate Spo0F∼P and reverse the course of gene expression regulated by Spo0A∼P (4Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 9Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The Rap phosphatases and the Spo0E phosphatase that dephosphorylates Spo0A∼P, form part of the proof that the phosphorelay evolved as a mechanism by which many potential regulators could influence in both positive and negative ways the outcome of the signal transduction pathway (4Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Such a system provides a means to integrate all these signals into a single output, Spo0A∼P (10Ohlsen K.L. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This signal integration capacity is likely to be extremely important for the developmental process of sporulation, which is a cellular event and subject to environmental, metabolic, and cell cycle regulatory influences. Response regulators are ideally suited to serve as the targets for regulation in this system. The active phosphorylated state results from a phosphoryl-aspartate, which, because of its position in the molecule, may maximize conformational changes allowing a variety of regulatory interactions with other molecules (33Lowry D.F. Roth A.F. Rupert P.B. Dahlquist F.W. Moy F.J. Domaille P.J. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26358-26362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acyl-phosphates are subject to hydrolysis activities that limit the lifetime of the phosphorylated state. Protein-protein interactions may activate such inherent reactions (34Sanna M.G. Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and such interactions have been postulated to limit, for example, the transcriptional lifetime of the Spo0A∼P protein (12Perego M. Hoch J.A. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 97-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Spo0B phosphotransferase has not as yet been found to be subject to outside regulatory influences. Recently, however, a phosphatase specific for the phosphohistidine of the ArcB phosphotransferase domain has been identified (35Ogino T. Matsubara M. Kato N. Nakamura Y. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicating the possibility that some putative regulatory input(s) through Spo0B remains to be found. In this report, histidine 30 was identified to be essential for Spo0B's function. Its in vivo activity and phosphorylation activity were destroyed by a single alanine substitution at this residue, a result also demonstrated for the His64 mutation of the yeast phosphotransferase YPD1 and the His1172mutation of the BvgS phosphotransferase domain (31Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito J. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The YPD1 and BvgS phosphotransferase domain are the equivalent of Spo0B in yeast osmoregulation and Bordetella pertussis virulence induction, respectively. The result of Spo0B H23 mutational analysis is curious. Based on the native gel data and in vitro phosphorylation study, it seems likely that glutamine substitution at this position is detrimental to the overall structural integrity of Spo0B. Truncating the imidazole side chain of a histidine to the methyl group of an alanine yields wild type-like function, implying that the imidazole ring does not participate in any important hydrogen bond or hydrophobic packing interactions. Glutamine's side chain potentially provides capacities for both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor; thus, there may be putative new hydrogen bond(s) formed resulting in structural perturbation. On the other hand, an additional glutamine at position 27 may establish new interactions with Gln23, thus replacing any unfavorable constraints produced by Gln23. The origin, specificity, and relationship of the Spo0B phosphotransferase to two-component kinases are of some interest. The residues surrounding the active histidine of the yeast Spo0B equivalent, YPD1, suggest a relationship to the histidines of E. coli CheA kinase and to the phosphotransferase domains of the composite “unusual” kinases BarA, ArcB, and BvgS (32Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito J. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The latter two are known to be part of phosphorelays. Spo0B, on the other hand, has little homology to these proteins in the region around the active site histidine residue by directly comparing their primary sequence. The active site histidine of the CheA kinase (36Zhou H. Lowry D.F. Swanson R.V. Simon M.I. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13858-13870Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the ArcB phosphotransferase domain (30Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) are located in a contiguous region of one subunit known to form a four-helix bundle. The structure of Spo0B is now known, and the active histidine is similarly placed within a four-helix bundle made up of two helices from each subunit of the active dimer (20Zhou X.Z. Madhusudan Whiteley J.M. Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. Proteins. 1997; 27: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 3K. I. Varughese, and J. A. Hoch, unpublished results. These helices are amphipathic in nature, and only those residues spaced on the same helical side of the active histidine have potentially important functional consequences. These residues are located ati ± 1, i ± 3, and i± 4 positions with respect to the active histidine (i) and are listed in Table II. An invariant glycine is found at i + 4 position in all domains expect Spo0B, which has a glycine at i − 4 position instead. This glycine residue has been proposed to carve out an empty space for the active histidine (30Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, a positive charged residue is present at i + 1 position in most of the cases, which may neutralize the negatively charged phosphoryl group (30Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); yet Spo0B has an arginine at i − 1 position. It seems that Spo0B has an inverted orientation with respect to other phosphotransferase domains. These differences may arise from the different origins of the four-helix bundle in each case. Convergent evolution may account for the similar function of Spo0B and these kinase domains. It will be of interest to determine if the evolutionary origin of Spo0B portends other functions for this protein.Table IIResidues located in the proximity of the active histidine of the histidine phosphotransfer domain in multistep phosphorelay signal transduction systemsProtein−4−3−10+1+3+4Spo0BGHRHDMNArcBVEGHKKGBvgSSDAHRAGEvgSHQIHRHGBarAVDIHKHGLemAIEIHRHGRcaCQHAHKAGYPD1DNSHFKGCheAFRAHSKGMinus indicates the residue located on the N-terminal side of the helix; plus indicates the residue on the C terminus.E. coli.B. pertussis.P. syringae.Fremyella diplosiphon.Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

https://openalex.org/W2088860850,"The spectroscopic, conformational, and functional properties of mutant carbonmonoxy hemoglobins in which either the β-globin Val67(E11) or the α-globin Val62(E11) is replaced by threonine have been investigated. The thermal evolution of the Soret absorption band and the stretching frequency of the bound CO were used to probe the stereodynamic properties of the heme pocket. The functional properties were investigated by kinetic measurements. The spectroscopic and functional data were related to the conformational properties through molecular analysis. The effects of this nonpolar-to-polar isosteric mutation are: (i) increase of heme pocket anharmonic motions, (ii) stabilization of the A 0 conformer in the IR spectrum, (iii) increased CO dissociation rates. The spectroscopic data indicate that for the carbonmonoxy derivatives, the Val → Thr mutation has a larger conformational effect on the β-subunits than on the α-subunits. This is at variance with the deoxy derivatives where the conformational modification was larger in the heme pocket of the α-subunit (Cupane, A., Leone, M., Militello, V., Friedman, R. K., Koley, A. P., Vasquez, G. P., Brinigar, W. S., Karavitis, M., and Fronticelli, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26271–26278). These effects are attributed to a different electrostatic interaction between Oγ of Thr(E11) and the bound CO molecule. Molecular analysis indicates a more favorable interaction of the bound CO with Thr Oγ in the β-subunit heme pocket."
https://openalex.org/W2092548393,"Members of the Bcl-2 family can be grouped into three classes based upon their effects on cell death. The first class suppresses death and includes Bcl-2. A second group, which includes Bax, is lethal, whereas a third class, including Bcl-xS, potentiates killing, although the members are not lethal by themselves. The proteins in the last class are proposed to exert their activity by binding to anti-apoptotic family members, thereby making the cell more susceptible to killing by another agent. To test this hypothesis, an inducible yeast expression system is reported that permits the functional analysis of three Bcl-2 family members. In yeast, Bax is lethal, and this activity is suppressed by Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and A1. Co-expression of Bcl-xS did not diminish the ability of any of the anti-apoptotic members to antagonize Bax. Rather, co-expression of Bcl-xS potentiated the anti-death activity of all three proteins. This effect was not the result of changes in either the levels or integrity of Bax or anti-apoptotic proteins. Thus, Bcl-xS can bind to anti-apoptotic family members, but this association does not result in loss of biological activity. Therefore, Bcl-xS may act downstream of Bax and in a pathway that is conserved in yeast. Members of the Bcl-2 family can be grouped into three classes based upon their effects on cell death.

Regulated cell death is an essential and integral component of development, where it is used to eliminate transient structures, sculpt organs, and ablate supernumerary cells (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 2Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the adult, there is an exquisite balance between cell proliferation and cell elimination that maintains tissue homeostasis (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 2Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In addition, cell death in the adult serves to form certain tissues, as well as to eliminate self-reactive lymphocytes and virus-infected cells, and limit the life span of cells that may pose a threat to the organism through mutation or damage (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 4Williams G. J. Pathol. 1994; 173: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Abbas A.K.

Thus, perturbation of cell death can contribute to developmental defects, immune dysfunction, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer (6Thompson C. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Therefore, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that control cell death is central to our understanding of an array of significant pathological conditions in man. Cell death is a regulated process involving interactions among extracellular molecules, intracellular signal transduction pathways, and resident suicide/rescue programs (7Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 8Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E.A. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J.

Pioneering work in Caenorhabditis elegans provided the fundamental molecular framework upon which cell death signaling/effector pathways in vertebrates have been modeled (10Miura M. Yuan J. Curr. Topics Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 139-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). bcl-2, the vertebrate homolog of ced-9 in C. elegans, was the first mammalian gene shown to inhibit cell death in a variety of cell types and circumstances (11Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 12Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, subsequent investigations identified a number of genes in vertebrates whose products were structurally and functionally related to Bcl-2 (8Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E.A. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). These proteins constitute a family whose members share a number of regions of sequence homology (Bcl-2 homology domains, BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4), and all variously influence cell death (16Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 17Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Some of the Bcl-2-related proteins, such as Bcl-xL, also prevent cell death, whereas others, such as Bax, provoke cell elimination (19Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 20Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). In addition, some members of this family, such as Bcl-xS and Bad, neither kill nor rescue cells per se, although they are able to promote cell death induced by other signals (19Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 21Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms that confer the death regulatory properties on the Bcl-2 family of proteins remain elusive, although recent structural data suggest that they may be pore-forming proteins (22Muchmore S.M. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.P. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). However, these proteins can participate in homo- and heteromeric complexes, and it has been suggested that their biological activities are determined by their spectrum of intra-family protein-protein associations (23Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 24Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.-G.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). For example, Bcl-xL is suggested to suppress cell death by binding to the lethal family members, thereby neutralizing their activity. On the other hand, Bcl-xS is suggested to potentiate killing by selectively binding to the anti-apoptotic (but not lethal) members, effectively sequestering them and sensitizing the cell to the lethal effects of other agents (24Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, several studies have shown that some viral as well as mutated versions of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family fail to associate with lethal family members yet still suppress killing (26Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Moreover, although Bcl-xS can bind to Bcl-xL, it is unclear whether this binding is of sufficient avidity to effectively displace it from Bax (29Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, protein-protein association may not be the sole determinant of biological activity. In particular, these results led us to question whether family members such as Bcl-xS potentiate killing by binding to, and thereby neutralizing, anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In prior studies, it was established that Bax and Bak are lethal when expressed in yeast (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J., C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, co-expression of anti-apoptotic family members such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL suppressed killing induced by both Bax and Bak (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J., C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This provided the basis of an assay to determine whether death potentiating Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-xS and Bad, could antagonize the death suppressive effects of the anti-apoptotic members with Bax as the lethal agent. Using an inducible triple expression assay in yeast, it is shown here that rather than antagonize anti-apoptotic family members, Bcl-xS and Bad potentiate their ability to suppress Bax-mediated killing. As previously reported, the LexA fusions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bad, and A1 were made in the yeast expression plasmid Y.LexA (LexA), which carries the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TRP1 gene as a selectable marker (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These Bcl-2 family members are fused to the lexA operator-binding domain of the LexA protein. Fusion proteins with the transcriptional activation domain of the Herpes simplex virus protein VP16 were constructed in the plasmid pSD.10a (VP16), which harbors theURA3 gene as a selectable marker (34Dalton S. Triesman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 579-612Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Unfused Bad was generated in Y.LexA by deletion of the LexA codons. Other unfused constructs, such as pSD-Bcl-xL and pSD-Bcl-xS, were generated in pSD.10a after deletion of the VP16 codons (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Expression of all the constructs, in both pSD.10a and Y.LexA, was under the control of aGAL10-CYC1 hybrid promoter that is galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible (35Guarente L. Yocum R.R. Gifford P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The yeast strain, S50-bax, was constructed by inserting a full-length murinebax cDNA that was under the control of a hybridGAL10-CYC1 promoter (35Guarente L. Yocum R.R. Gifford P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) into the URA3 locus of the S. cerevisiae strain, S50 (34Dalton S. Triesman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 579-612Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This was achieved by excising bax, together with GAL10-CYC1 regulatory sequences, from a yeast expression construct in pSD.10a (33Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserting it into the URA3 coding region of aURA3 disruption plasmid as described previously (34Dalton S. Triesman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 579-612Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This disrupted URA3 construct was transformed into S50, and theura − yeast colonies were selected for resistance to 5-fluorotic acid (Sigma) as described (34Dalton S. Triesman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 579-612Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (534) Google Scholar). One of the colonies was named S50-bax and used in the experiments reported here. Yeast growth and maintenance was according to the standard protocols (36Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 12-18Google Scholar). Transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method as described (37Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeast S50-bax was (co)transformed with expression plasmids encoding Bcl-2 family members, or parental control vectors, VP16 (which carries the URA3selectable marker) or LexA (which carries the TRP1selectable marker). A yeast growth assay was performed as described previously (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Typically 10 ml of selective medium (with 2% galactose) was inoculated with 1.5 × 106 cells and then incubated at 30 °C. Samples were taken at different time points, and cell density was measured by determining the OD660. To compare results from different experiments, a growth index (GI) was used:GI=OD660/22 h−OD660/0 h (cells expressing Bax and the test proteins)OD660/22 h−OD660/0 h (cells expressing Bax and LexA or VP16)(Eq. 1) Yeast cells were lysed mechanically as described (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.13.4-13.13.5Google Scholar), and the protein content of the lysate was determined by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye method (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (50 μg/lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Preblocking and immunostaining of blots were performed in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk at room temperature. After preblocking for 1 h, membranes were incubated with a rabbit anti-murine Bax polyclonal antibody, 13686E (1:1000 dilution) (PharMingen), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antiserum (1:1000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), both for 2 h. Immunoblots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). For Bcl-2 and Bcl-x immunostaining, the membrane was stripped of bound antibody by incubating the strip in a buffer comprising 62 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 20 min and then reprobing with a monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody, 15021A (1:250) (PharMingen), or a monoclonal anti-Bcl-x antibody, B22620 (1:250) (Transduction Laboratories). To investigate the functional interactions among lethal, pro-apoptotic, and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, an inducible triple expression assay was developed in S. cerevisiae. Because Bax is lethal in yeast (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C.

A murinebax gene was stably integrated into the genome of the S50 yeast strain where it was under the control of theGAL10-CYC1 hybrid promoter, making it galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible. This yeast strain is referred to as S50-bax. When cultured in glucose, basal levels of Bax were undetectable by immunoblotting in S50-bax (Fig. 1 A), and the cells grew robustly (data not shown). However, upon switching from glucose to galactose, Bax expression was induced (Fig. 1 A), and the yeast died (Fig. 2). The plasmid pSD-Bcl-xL encodes full-length murine Bcl-xL and is galactose-inducible (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transformation of S50-bax with the pSD-Bcl-xL plasmid resulted in a nearly complete reversal of Bax lethality when the yeast were grown in galactose (Fig. 2 A). These data in S50-bax recapitulated results gained in S260 yeast when both Bax and Bcl-xL were co-expressed from plasmids (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This system offered the opportunity to co-express pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members with Bax and Bcl-xL.Figure 2Bcl-xS does not antagonize the death suppressing activity of Bcl-xL in Bax-expressing yeast.

The differential splicing in Bcl-xS eliminates the BH1 and BH2 domains present in Bcl-xL and results in the loss of Bax binding and the conversion from an anti- to a pro-apoptotic protein (19Boise L.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Three properties of Bcl-xS make it the best choice for the pro-apoptotic component in the present analysis. First, Bcl-xS has been shown to antagonize the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL in vertebrate cells (29Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Second, Bcl-xS binds to Bcl-xL but not Bax in yeast (24Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 25Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Third, expression of Bcl-xS alone does not affect yeast viability (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) avoiding complications in data interpretation. Therefore, Bcl-xS would be predicted to antagonize the death suppressing activity of Bcl-xL in yeast. The pSD-Bcl-xS plasmid encodes murine Bcl-xS under the control of aGAL10-CYC1 promoter. Co-expression of Bcl-xS with Bcl-xL and Bax did not reduce yeast growth or viability (Fig. 2). Rather, expression of Bcl-xS consistently conferred a slight growth advantage to both S50-bax and S50-bax co-expressing a LexA fusion of Bcl-xL (Fig. 2 B). Thus, despite the fact that Bcl-xS dimerizes with Bcl-xL in yeast (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), this interaction did not attenuate the anti-apoptotic activity of the latter. Indeed, the data suggest that Bcl-xS may potentiate the activity of Bcl-xL. However, because Bcl-xL almost completely reversed Bax lethality (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), it was difficult to assess whether Bcl-xS truly augmented anti-apoptotic activity. In addition, the data raise a number of concerns in interpretation. First, Bcl-xS may have some selectivity in which anti-apoptotic members it can suppress (although Bcl-xS can specifically antagonize Bcl-xL in vertebrate cells) (29Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Second, the present assay imposes an upper limit on rescue that could mask positive or negative effects of additional agents, particularly if Bcl-xL were especially potent and required only at low concentrations to suppress Bax. Therefore, further experiments were performed to clarify the biological properties of Bcl-xS in yeast. It was noted previously that both the lethal and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family have different potencies in yeast (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of additional amino acids in some Bcl-2 family members attenuates their activity (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For example, the LexA fusion of Bcl-xL is less potent than the unfused protein (Fig. 2). This situation provided the opportunity to analyze the functional interactions between Bcl-xS and other, less potent anti-apoptotic family members and their derivative fusion proteins in S50-bax. As shown in Table I, a number of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members all suppressed Bax lethality to varying degrees in S50-bax. The rank order of potency of these proteins against Bax lethality was Bcl-xL > LexA-Bcl-xL > LexA-A1 > Bcl-2 > LexA-Bcl-2 > VP16-A1 (Table I). In no case did Bcl-xS attenuate the anti-apoptotic activity of these proteins, despite the fact that it binds to all of them in the yeast two-hybrid assay (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no evidence for selective suppression of any anti-apoptotic family member by Bcl-xS. On the other hand, co-expression of Bcl-xS enhanced the suppression of Bax by all anti-apoptotic proteins (Table I). This augmentation was most pronounced for the less potent anti-apoptotic members such as VP16-A1 (Table I and Fig. 3). For example, when expressed in S50-bax, VP16-A1 produced a GI (an index of rescue, see “Experimental Procedures”) of 10.0 ± 1.3 (mean ± S.D., n = 6). However, when VP16-A1 was co-expressed with Bcl-xS the GI was 16.8 ± 1.6 (mean ± S.D., n = 6), a significant increase (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Thus, the presence of Bcl-xS produced a 68% increase in the growth index for VP16-A1 and made it as potent as Bcl-2 (Table I). These data establish that not only does Bcl-xS fail to suppress any of the anti-apoptotic family members tested but also that it leads to a potentiation of their activity.Table IThe effect of Bcl-xS on the death suppressing activity of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and A1 in Bax-expressing yeast (S50-bax)TransgenePlasmid 1Plasmid 2GIBaxVP16LexA1.0BaxBcl-xSLexA1.0BaxBcl-xLLexA20.9BaxBcl-xLLexA-Bcl-xS22.5BaxBcl-2LexA16.2BaxBcl-2LexA-Bcl-xS21.6BaxVP16-A1LexA10.0BaxVP16-A1LexA-Bcl-xS16.8BaxLexA-Bcl-xSVP161.0BaxLexA-Bcl-xLVP1617.2BaxLexA-Bcl-xLBcl-xS18.9BaxLexA-Bcl-2VP1612.2BaxLexA-Bcl-2Bcl-xS18.8BaxLexA-A1VP1616.3BaxLexA-A1Bcl-xS16.9The plasmids 1 and 2 (as indicated) were cotransformed into S50-bax.

Growth of transformants was assessed by the yeast growth assay. GIvalues are indicated. The data shown are representative of six independent experiments. Because Bcl-xS is invariably pro-apoptotic in vertebrate cells (19Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar,29Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), explanations for rescue effects of Bcl-xS are on the one hand that it reduces Bax expression or promotes its degradation or on the other hand that it promotes the expression or stability of the anti-apoptotic members. These possibilities were assessed by determining steady state protein levels by immunoblotting. Neither Bax levels nor its processing were overtly influenced by the presence of Bcl-xS or the other anti-apoptotic proteins tested (Fig. 1). Similarly, neither the levels nor processing of the anti-apoptotic members, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL (Fig. 1 A), LexA-Bcl-2, and LexA-Bcl-xL (Fig. 1 B) were detectably altered by co-expression of Bcl-xS. Therefore, it is concluded that Bcl-xS does not function by changing the expression or degradation of either Bax or the anti-apoptotic proteins. Finally, we addressed the issue of whether the action of Bcl-xS was unique to this member of the pro-apoptotic subclass of the Bcl-2 family. Bad, like Bcl-xS, binds to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family but not to Bax and potentiates killings (21Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). In yeast, Bad does not bind to Bax and is not lethal per se (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, Bad was used in place of Bcl-xS in the triple expression assay. Like Bcl-xS, Bad did not attenuate the activity of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or A1 (Table II). Rather, Bad potentiated all three anti-apoptotic family members (Table II). Thus, two structurally distinct members of the pro-apoptotic class inhibit Bax activity in yeast, although they do not associate with it.Table IIThe effect of Bad on the death suppressing activity of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and A1 in yeastTransgenePlasmid 1Plasmid 2GIBaxVP16LexA1.0BaxVP16Bad1.1BaxBcl-xLLexA15.6BaxBcl-xLBad24.7BaxBcl-2LexA9.3BaxBcl-2Bad17.2BaxVP16-A1LexA6.5BaxVP16-A1Bad9.2Yeast S50-bax were cotransformed with plasmid 1 and plasmid 2 as indicated.

Growth of transformants was assessed by the yeast growth assay. GIvalues are indicated. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. The finding that Bcl-xS and Bad antagonize the activity of Bax without binding to it provides additional evidence for the emerging view that the association of anti-apoptotic family members with lethal members is not essential for death suppression (26Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For example, in yeast, there is no requirement for Bcl-xL to bind to Bax to inhibit its lethality (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This indicates that Bcl-xL can act downstream of Bax, perhaps by competing for binding to a common target protein. Because Bcl-xS and Bad do not bind to Bax, they too may interact with this hypothetical target protein, either independently or in association with an anti-apoptotic member. To date, only the F0F1-ATPase has been implicated in the action of any Bcl-2 protein in yeast (39Matsuyama S. Xu Q. Velours J. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, in metazoans, downstream proteins include Ced-4 and Apaf-1, both putative ATP-binding proteins that variously interact with caspases and Bcl-2 family members to regulate cell death (40Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Because yeast do not exhibit programmed cell death and do not express classical caspases or Bcl-2 family members (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is probable that the hypothetical target protein serves another function in yeast. Also the absence of death effector molecules, such as caspases in yeast (27Tao W. Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15547-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), may account for the paradoxical properties of Bcl-xS in this organism. Nevertheless, the fact that mammalian proteins such as Bax, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-xS are active in yeast indicates that the downstream mechanisms through which they act are present in lower eukaryotes and may have been adapted for cell elimination with the evolution of the multicellular state. The ability to manipulate the genome of yeast makes it an ideal organism in which to identify these evolutionarily conserved pathways.

Studies using glucosidase inhibitors and mutant cell lines deficient in expression of glucosidase enzymes have established a strong correlation between Glc trimming, calnexin association, and the survival of newly synthesized T cell receptor (TCR) α molecules in the ER (13van Leeuwen J.E.M.

Indeed, persistence of Glc residues on N-glycans precludes formation of calnexin·TCRα complexes and results in the rapid degradation of TCRα proteins (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A.

These results are specific in that the stability of related TCRβ glycoproteins is unaffected by impaired glucosidase activity and the failure to assemble with calnexin (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol.

Thus, calnexin association appears to be uniquely important for the survival of nascent TCRα glycoproteins in the ER. Detailed investigation into the production of TCR complexes in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes showed that inefficient assembly of complete αβδεγεζζ TCR results from limited assembly of αδε intermediates, which, in turn, results from rapid degradation of TCRα proteins (16Kearse K.P.

Instability of TCRα proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes is independent of clonotypic specificities as even a matched pair of TCRα, β transgenes fails to associate efficiently in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (16Kearse K.P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is developmentally regulated as TCRα proteins synthesized in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes have a significantly shorter half-life than those made in progeny CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (16Kearse K.P.

Med. 1995; 181: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for TCRα instability in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes is unknown but has been postulated to involve abnormalities in N-glycan processing and calnexin assembly as perturbation of these pathways markedly destabilizes TCRα proteins in other T cell types (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A.

To enhance our understanding of the molecular basis for the limited survival of newly synthesized TCRα proteins in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, we undertook the present study to examine and compare the processing of TCRα glycoproteins and their assembly with lectin-like chaperones in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and splenic T cells. C57BL/6 (B6) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). T cell receptor Vα11+ AND transgenic mice (22Kaye J. Hsu M.L. Sauron M.E. Jameson S.C. Gascoigne N.R. Hedrick S.M. Nature. 1989; 341: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Stephen Hedrick. CD4+CD8+thymocytes were isolated by their adherence to plastic plates coated with anti-CD8 mAb (83-12-5) and were typically >95% CD4+CD8+ as described (16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Splenic T cells were purified by incubation of single cell suspensions of spleen cells on tissue culture plates coated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) (Organo-Technika-Cappel, Malvern, PA) for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by isolation of nonadherent cells. The resultant cell populations were typically 80–85% CD3+ as determined by flow cytometry analysis. Castanospermine (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Diamide (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1 mm;N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal (ALLN) (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml;N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml; lactacystin (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 20 μm. The following monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were used in this study: 145-2C11, specific for CD3ε proteins associated with CD3δ or CD3γ chains (23Leo O. Foo M. Sachs D.H. Samelson L.E. Bluestone J.A.

Immunol. 1989; 142: 2736-2742PubMed Google Scholar); and anti-Vα11 Ab (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The following antisera were used: SPA-860 anti-calnexin (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC); and PA3–900 anti-calreticulin (Affinity BioReagents, Neshanic Station, NJ). Metabolic pulse labeling with [35S]methionine was performed as described previously (16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pulse-labeled in methionine-deficient medium containing [35S]-methionine (Trans 35S-label; ICN, Irvine, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C and chased in medium containing excess nonradioactive methionine for various time periods at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by solubilization in 1% digitonin (Calbiochem) lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, plus protease inhibitors) at 1 × 108 cells/ml for 20 min at 4 °C; lysates were clarified by centrifugation to remove insoluble material and immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Sequential immunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitation/release/recapture procedures were performed as previously detailed (16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Digestion with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) was performed by resuspending precipitates in glycosidase digestion buffer (75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.1, 75 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 milliunits of Endo H (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) for 16 h at 37 °C; digestion with jack bean mannosidase (Oxford Glycosystems, Rosedal, NY) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments examining the effects of oligosaccharide release on calnexin association with TCRα proteins, lysates were precipitated with anti-calnexin Abs and precipitates either mock-treated (buffer only) or digested with Endo H as described above. Precipitates were then washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, boiled in 1% SDS, and TCRα proteins specifically recaptured with anti-TCRα mAbs as described (20Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was performed as previously detailed (16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the assembly of newly synthesized glycoproteins with calnexin in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. For these studies, CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min, solubilized in 1% digitonin, and lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin Ab; alternatively, lysates were sequentially immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3ε mAb followed by anti-TCRα mAb. Precipitates were digested with Endo H glycosidase to identify molecules containing (immature)N-linked glycan chains (26Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, numerous Endo H-sensitive proteins were associated with calnexin in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 1 A), including molecules that comigrated with TCRα and CD3δ glycoproteins (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of anti-calnexin precipitates on two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis SDS-PAGE gels showed that numerous radiolabeled proteins assembled with calnexin in CD4+CD8+thymocytes (Fig. 1 B), most of which were not associated at the conclusion of a 60-min chase period (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these data indicate that newly synthesized glycoproteins interact transiently with calnexin in CD4+CD8+thymocytes, similar to what has been reported regarding calnexin-protein associations in other cell types (5Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 10Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Previous studies in splenic T cells showed that Glc residues are removed from newly synthesized TCRα glycoproteins before their assembly with CD3 subunits and that calnexin associates exclusively with unassembled, free TCRα proteins containing incompletely trimmed glycan chains (17van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether TCRα proteins were equivalently processed in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, similar experiments were performed; because TCRα proteins are clonotypic and quite heterogeneous, as in previous studies using splenic T cells (17van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were obtained from AND transgenic mice expressing the rearranged TCRα gene product, Vα11 protein (22Kaye J. Hsu M.L. Sauron M.E. Jameson S.C. Gascoigne N.R. Hedrick S.M. Nature. 1989; 341: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min, solubilized in 1% digitonin, and lysates sequentially immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3ε mAb to isolate CD3ε-associated TCRα proteins, followed by anti-Vα11 mAb to capture unassembled TCRα chains. Alternatively, lysates were precipitated with anti-calnexin Ab. Precipitates were boiled in SDS to release bound material, TCRα proteins specifically recaptured by precipitation with anti-TCRα Ab, and recapture precipitates digested with jack bean mannosidase and Endo H glycosidases. Jack bean mannosidase digestion is useful for evaluating the Glc-trimming status of newly synthesized glycoproteins as it removes eight mannoses from fully trimmedN-glycan chains devoid of Glc residues (Man8–9GlcNAc2), but only five mannoses from incompletely trimmed N-glycans containing 1–3 Glc saccharides (Glc1–3Man8–9GlcNAc2) (5Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 17van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, Endo H removes all but a single GlcNAc fromN-glycan chains irrespective of their Glc content (26Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to what was previously observed in splenic T cells (17van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), two major glycoforms of Vα11 proteins were present in CD4+CD8+ thymocyte lysates, denoted A and B, that are indicative of TCRα proteins containing incompletely trimmed and fully trimmed glycan chains, respectively (Fig. 2). As demonstrated, Vα11 proteins that were assembled with CD3 subunits in CD4+CD8+thymocytes possessed fully trimmed oligosaccharide chains (Fig. 2,middle, B glycoform) unlike free, unassembled Vα11 proteins, which existed as both A and B glycoforms (Fig. 2,right-hand side). Newly synthesized Vα11 proteins bearing partially trimmed oligosaccharides (A glycoform) coprecipitated with calnexin in CD4+CD8+ thymocyte lysates, whereas those containing fully trimmed oligosaccharides (B glycoform) did not (Fig. 2, left-hand side). Thus, in agreement with previous studies on the processing of Vα11 proteins in splenic T lymphocytes (17van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), these data show that Glc residues were removed from TCRα glycoproteins prior to their assembly with CD3ε chains in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Moreover, these data demonstrate that newly synthesized TCRα molecules containing partially trimmed oligosaccharides were associated with the molecular chaperone calnexin in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Interaction of calnexin with most newly synthesized glycoproteins is proposed to occur by a two-step process involving initial recognition of monoglucosylated glycans, followed by protein-protein interactions, which stabilize these associations (3Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 17van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent studies show, however, that for certain glycoproteins, polypeptide contacts do not appear necessary for stable calnexin assembly (27Rodan A.R. Simmons J.E. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We reasoned therefore that TCRα proteins might precariously assemble with calnexin in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes via predominantly carbohydrate binding, such that TCRα polypeptide domains were particularly vulnerable to proteolytic degradation mechanisms. To investigate this issue, digitonin lysates of radiolabeled CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and splenic T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin Ab; precipitates were either mock-treated or digested with Endo H, and association of TCRα proteins with calnexin before and after deglycosylation was compared. Calnexin interaction with TCRα proteins was unaffected by removal of oligosaccharides in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and splenic T cells as similar amounts of TCRα molecules were associated with calnexin in mock and Endo H digested groups of both cell types (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that TCRα proteins are stably associated with calnexin in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and show that similar to splenic T cells, once formed, calnexin·TCRα protein complexes do not require oligosaccharide chains to maintain their association in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. To investigate the quantitative assembly of newly synthesized TCRα proteins with lectin-like chaperones in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and splenic T lymphocytes, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and digitonin lysates exhaustively immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin Ab, anti-calreticulin Ab, and anti-TCRα Abs; sufficient Ab was used in these experiments to capture >95% of the respective antigens (data not shown). CD4+CD8+ thymocyte and splenic T lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TCRα Ab, anti-calnexin Ab, or anti-calreticulin Ab; precipitates were boiled in SDS to release bound material and TCRα proteins specifically recaptured using anti-TCRα mAb. As demonstrated, TCRα assembly with calnexin was quantiatively similar in CD4+CD8+thymocytes and splenic T cells (Fig. 4 A). These results were confirmed in sequential immunoprecipitation experiments in which lysates were precipitated with anti-calnexin Ab, followed by anti-TCRα mAb to capture remaining TCRα molecules (Fig. 4 B). In agreement with previous studies on calreticulin-TCRα association in other T cell types (13van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), much fewer TCRα proteins coprecipitated with calreticulin relative to calnexin in splenic T cells (Fig. 4 A), presumably because of the transient nature of calreticulin-TCRα interactions compared with calnexin-TCRα interactions (13van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Suprisingly, few, if any TCRα proteins were present in anti-calreticulin precipitates of CD4+CD8+ thymocyte lysates (Figs. 4 A), even upon prolonged exposure of autoradiographs; calreticulin expression was comparable in both cell types (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that calnexin association with newly synthesized TCRα proteins is quantitatively similar in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and splenic T cells. In addition, these data contained the surprising finding that calreticulin association with TCRα proteins was specifically decreased in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes compared with splenic T cells. Recent studies in various nonlymphoid cell types expressing transfected TCRα gene products and murine BW thymoma cells have implicated proteasomes in the degradation of TCRα proteins (29Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Because TCRα proteins synthesized in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes are significantly less stable than TCRα proteins expressed in other cell types, including T lymphocytes (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we wished to determine the involvement of proteasome activity in TCRα degradation in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. For these studies we utilized ALLN, an inhibitor of various proteases including the proteasome and lactacystin, a highly specific proteasome inhibitor (32Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,33Wada I. Ou W.J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we examined the effects of TPCK, a cysteine protease inhibitor (29Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and diamide, a thiol-oxidizing agent previously reported to retard TCRα degradation in nonlymphoid cells (29Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to both induce and inhibit dissociation of calnexin with newly synthesized proteins (11Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 33Wada I. Ou W.J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies on TCRα degradation in other cell types (29Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Med. 1998; 187: 835-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the stability of unassembled TCRα proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes was significantly enhanced by these reagents (Fig. 5, A and B). As shown in Fig. 6, inhibition of TCRα degradation in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes was correlated with increased stabilization of calnexin-TCRα protein complexes (Fig. 6). These data document that proteasome activity is important for the degradation of unassembled TCRα proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and show that impairment of proteasome activity results in protracted association of TCRα proteins with calnexin.Figure 6Inhibition of TCRα degradation is associated with increased stabilization of calnexin·TCRα protein complexes in CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes. CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min, and chased in medium containing excess nonradioactive methionine and diamide (DIAM) (1 mm), TPCK (10 μg/ml), or ALLN (100 μg/ml) as indicated. Digitonin lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin Ab; precipitates were boiled in SDS, and TCRα proteins were recaptured by precipitation with anti-TCRα mAb. The position of TCRα proteins is indicated. These data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we wished to examine the effects of the persistence of Glc residues onN-glycans on the assembly and degradation of TCRα proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. For these studies, CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were radiolabeled in the presence or absence of the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine (cas), which blocks removal of Glc residues from N-glycan chains (34Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). As expected, TCR glycoproteins synthesized in cas-treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes migrated with decreased mobility compared with those made in untreated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 7 A), because of persistence of Glc residues on N-glycan chains. Most notably, these results demonstrate that TCRα proteins effectively assembled with CD3 components in cas-treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and that the stability of unassembled TCRα proteins was similar in media- and cas-treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 7 A); these findings were confirmed by immunoprecipitation/release/recapture experiments (Fig. 7 B). These studies show that TCRα assembly with CD3 proteins is not precluded by the failure to remove Glc residues fromN-glycans on TCRα proteins and that degradation of unassembled TCRα proteins is not influenced by glucosidase activity in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. ζ chain addition is the terminal stage of TCR assembly and depends on prior formation of αδε TCR intermediates (20Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because TCRα proteins are inherently unstable in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, few, if any, αδε TCR intermediates or unassembled TCRα proteins exist within the ER that are available for assembly with newly translated ζ proteins (16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the assembly of radiolabeled ζ chains with CD3 proteins approximates the rate of formation of complete TCR complexes in CD4+CD8+thymocytes (16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A, similar amounts of CD3-assembled ζ proteins were present in media- and cas-treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Thus, we further conclude that persistence of Glc residues on TCRα proteins does not significantly affect the formation of complete TCR complexes in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Glc-containing high mannose oligosaccharides that escape the ER can be processed by endomannosidase enzymes localized in the intermediate ER/cis-Golgi compartment that cleave 1–3 Glc saccharides in association with a single mannose residue (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 34Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), creating high mannose intermediates that are identical to those generated via conventional processing routes (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar); unlike ER glucosidase activity, endomannosidase action is insensitive to castanospermine treatment (35Moore S.E.H. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8443-8451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CD3-assembled TCRα proteins were ultimately transported from the ER to the Golgi in cas-treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, radiolabeled cells were chased for 150 min. As shown in Fig. 7 A, CD3-associated TCRα proteins in cas-treated CD4+CD8+thymocytes acquired Endo H resistance during longer chase times (Fig. 7 A), indicative of their transport from the ER to at least the media Golgi compartment (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 26Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, Endo H-resistant CD3δ,γ glycoproteins were also visible in anti-CD3 precipitates of chase groups of cas-treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 7 A, see * in figure legend). Note that glucosidase activity was effectively inhibited throughout the course of these experiments as unassembled TCRβ proteins in cas-treated CD4+CD8+thymocytes showed increased mobility relative to media-treated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes during the entire chase period (data not shown). These data demonstrate that TCR complexes formed under conditions of cas-induced glucosidase blockade in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes effectively transit to at least the medial Golgi compartment. The current study has examined and compared the processing of TCRα proteins and their association with the lectin-like chaperones calnexin and calreticulin in immature CD4+CD8+thymocytes and mature splenic T cells. Our data demonstrate that TCRα glycoproteins are processed in a similar manner in both cell types, with Glc residues being removed from TCRα proteins before their assembly with CD3 components in CD4+CD8+thymocytes, as previously reported for splenic T cells. TCRα molecules were stably associated with calnexin in both cell types, but interestingly, calreticulin·TCRα associations were decreased in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes relative to splenic T cells. Finally, these studies show that TCRα proteins effectively assemble with CD3 subunits and egress from the ER to the Golgi complex under conditions where Glc residues persist on N-glycans and demonstrate that proteasome activity is important for TCRα degradation in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Because perturbation of Glc-trimming and calnexin assembly pathways markedly destabilizes TCRα proteins in other T cell types (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9660-9665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that inefficient Glc removal fromN-glycan chains and impaired calnexin assembly might represent the molecular basis for rapid degradation of TCRα proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L Wiest D.L. Singer A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The data in the current report effectively rule out this postulate, however, as these studies show that TCRα proteins synthesized in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes are effective substrates for Glc-trimming enzymes and associate with calnexin in a manner that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that which is observed in splenic T cells. Importantly, these studies establish that rapid degradation of TCRα proteins is not invariably correlated with the failure to associate with calnexin, suggesting that additional components in the ER quality control system (calreticulin?) operate to ensure the proper folding of nascent TCRα glycoproteins. Consistent with this concept, recent studies by Hebert et al. (12Hebert D.N. Zhang J.X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) demonstrate that calnexin and calreticulin interact with distinct regions on newly synthesized influenza hemagglutinin molecules and associate with distinct hemagglutinin-folding intermediates. Calnexin and calreticulin have also been shown to associate with major histocompatibility complex class I proteins at different stages of their maturation and assembly (14van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13997-14001Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that calnexin and calreticulin may perform specialized functions in the folding and assembly of TCRα proteins and that interaction with both chaperones is requisite for TCRα stability. Alternatively, it is possible that calreticulin association may intrinsically confer stability on TCRα proteins, an interaction that was shown to be specifically decreased in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes in this report. Data from previous studies on TCRα instability are concordant with all of these ideas as TCRα interaction with both calnexin and calreticulin chaperones is precluded under conditions of impaired glucosidase activity (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4179-4186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined, however, why calreticulin association with newly synthesized TCRα proteins is specifically decreased in immature CD4+CD8+thymocytes. Because TCRα proteins are inherently unstable in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and their survival is unaffected by the persistence of Glc residues on N-glycan chains, we were able to significantly extend previous results onN-glycan processing and TCR assembly in other T cell types (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L Wiest D.L. Singer A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that were confounded by the differential stability of TCRα proteins under these conditions. Indeed, the data in the current report document that TCRα molecules effectively assemble with CD3 proteins and are transported to the Golgi complex when glucosidase activity is inhibited in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. These results were hitherto unrealized because blockade of Glc removal from N-glycan chains dramatically destabilizes TCRα proteins in other T cell types (15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Munitz T.I. Wiest D.L. Nakayama T. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4504-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L Wiest D.L. Singer A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), making it difficult to determine the efficacy of TCR assembly under these conditions. The current data suggests, therefore, that although persistence of Glc residues on N-glycans severely limits the survival of newly synthesized TCRα proteins, TCRα molecules that survive under these conditions can effectively assemble into TCR complexes that are capable of ER to Golgi transport. Recent data from numerous laboratories indicate that misfolded proteins localized in the ER are degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes, previously implicated only in the disposal of cytosolic proteins (37Kopito R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, studies in nonlymphoid cells expressing a transfected TCRα gene product and murine BW thymoma cells suggest a model in which unassembled TCRα proteins are dislocated from the ER and degraded by cytosolic proteasomes (30Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 31Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the current study we extend these findings to primary lymphocytes by showing that TCRα degradation in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes was markedly impaired by inhibitors of proteasome activity. Interestingly, inclusion of proteasome inhibitors stabilized calnexin·TCRα complexes in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, suggesting that TCRα proteins may be degraded when associated with calnexin, or alternatively, that feedback mechanisms exist that regulate the dislocation of TCRα proteins in relation to proteasome activity (30Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Calnexin association is not requisite for disposal of unasssembled TCRα proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, however, as TCRα degradation was similar in the presence or absence of the glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine, which effectively blocks the initial assembly of TCRα proteins with calnexin (Refs. 13van Leeuwen J.E.M. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25345-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 15Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; and data not shown). Finally, it is noteworthy to mention that instability of TCRα proteins and their interaction with lectin-like chaperones in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes shows several interesting parallels to recent observations on the biosynthesis of tyrosinase molecules in normal versus malignant melanocytes (38Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 94: 6210-6215Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Analogous to the differential survival of nascent TCRα proteins in immature and mature T cells, the stability of tyrosinase proteins is significantly decreased in melanoma cells compared with normal melanocytes. Moreover, tyrosinase stably associates with both calnexin and calreticulin in normal melanocytes but solely with calnexin in malignant melanocytes (38Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 94: 6210-6215Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential stability of TCRα proteins in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and splenic T cells represents the second example where rapid degradation of a newly synthesized protein is correlated with impaired calreticulin association but not calnexin association. Importantly, we would also note that similar to what has been reported regarding wild typeversus mutant proteins that contain defined singular amino acid changes, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator molecules and α1-antitrypsin (39Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Thomas P.J. Qu B.H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), calnexin assembly with newly synthesized TCRα proteins in immature and mature T cells does not distinguish between the dramatically different fates of TCRα proteins in these two cell types. Thus, undefined mechanisms must exist that regulate the assembly of TCRα proteins with CD3 components and TCRα survival in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and splenic T cells. Further identification of quality control components necessary for the proper folding and stability of nascent TCRα proteins should provide important information regarding the regulation of TCRα stability in these cell types.

Transcripts of both genes accumulate periodically during the cell cycle and attain their maximum levels just before S phase.

Ultraviolet cross-linking using a radiolabeled TOP25′-UTR probe identified proteins with apparent molecular masses of 74 and 37 kDa in the RNA-protein complex. Nuclear extracts prepared from synchronized cells show that the binding activity varies during the cell cycle in parallel with TOP2 and RPA1mRNA levels.

The trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata is a protozoan parasite containing a single mitochondrion with an unusual form of DNA called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA)1(1, 2). The kDNA consists of a single network of catenated minicircles and maxicircles. During replication of kDNA, the minicircles are released from the network and are reattached to the network periphery after replication, whereas maxicircles replicate while still attached to the network (3Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 117-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). An unusual feature of DNA replication in trypanosomes is that both kinetoplast and nuclear DNA replicate in approximate synchrony (4Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other eukaryotes, mitochondrial DNA replication occurs throughout the cell cycle (6Guttes E.W. Hanawalt P.C. Guttes S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 142: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1977; 11: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Since both the kinetoplast and nuclear DNA replication genes are encoded in the nucleus, their coordinated expression may play a role in synchronizing nuclear and kDNA replication. Expression of protein-coding genes in trypanosomatids involves mechanisms that are different from those in most other eukaryotes. All mRNAs in trypanosomatids contain two exons, a 39-nucleotide miniexon at the 5′ end of the mRNA and the main coding exon (8Bonen L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Genes are usually grouped in polycistronic transcription units, and the polycistronic pre-mRNAs are processed by 5′ trans-splicing and 3′ polyadenylation to yield monocistronic mRNAs. The differential expression of steady state mRNAs from a single polycistronic transcript involves post-transcriptional controls by mechanisms that are still unclear. Pre-mRNA turnover in combination with differential rates of trans-splicing and polyadenylation and of mRNA turnover may all play a role in regulating mRNA levels. So far, only two RNA polymerase II promoters for protein-coding genes have been described in trypanosomes, the Trypanosoma congolenseglutamic acid/alanine-rich protein promoter and the Trypanosoma brucei hsp70 promoter, and neither promoter appears to be transcriptionally regulated (10Graham S.V. Jefferies D. Barry J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The regulated expression of T. brucei hsp70 upon heat shock appears to be controlled entirely at a post-transcriptional level, since heat shock does not induce increased transcription of the hsp70 genes (11Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism of coordinate expression of nuclear and kinetoplast DNA replication genes, we have studied the cell cycle-regulated expression of RPA1 and TOP2genes. The TOP2 gene encodes a kinetoplast-associated type II topoisomerase (12Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Aebersold R. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the RPA1 gene encodes the large subunit of replication protein A, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein that has been immunolocalized to the nucleus (13Brown G.W. Hines J.C. Fisher P. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Brown G.W. Melendy T.E. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10227-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The steady state levels of the mRNAs for these two genes and that of dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene are cell cycle-regulated in a similar manner (4Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence elements required for periodic accumulation of RPA1 and TOP2 mRNAs are present in the 5′-untranslated region (15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Brown L.M. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Examination of the 5′-UTR of these genes reveals the presence of a consensus octamer sequence with a conserved hexameric core. Mutation analysis showed that these octamer sequences are necessary for periodic accumulation of TOP2 and RPA1 transcripts. We show here that specific proteins present in nuclear extracts bind to the 5′-UTR RNA of TOP2 and RPA1 genes and that the octamer sequences are necessary for binding to occur. C. fasciculata Cf-C1 cells were grown in brain heart infusion medium (Difco) supplemented with 20 μg/ml hemin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 28 °C with shaking. The cells were grown to a density of 6–7 × 107 cells/ml and then harvested by centrifugation (Sorvall GS-3 rotor, 15 min, 5000 rpm at 4 °C). All procedures for extract preparation were performed at 0–4 °C. Buffers B, C, and D also contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then once with Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl). The washed cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of Buffer B (Buffer A containing 0.5% nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min with vortexing every 2 min. The cell extract was then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor). The supernatant was removed and mixed with an equal volume of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) and represents the cytosolic extract. The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol) and passed five times through a 21-gauge needle to lyse the nuclei (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9163) Google Scholar). The extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor). The supernatant was removed and mixed with an equal volume of Buffer D to give the nuclear extract. The cytosolic and nuclear extracts were stored at −70 °C or in liquid nitrogen. Protein was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method using a micro BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. The plasmid pt2–1 has a 6-kilobase HindIII fragment containing the TOP2gene cloned into pGEM-7Zf(+) (12Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Aebersold R. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRM6 was constructed by cloning a 103-base pair HaeIII fragment of plasmid pUC19 (287–380) into the SmaI site of pGEM7Zf(+) (Promega). This fragment contains part of the lacZ gene. Construction of pΔ10Not has been described previously (15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The plasmids pRM9-pRM12 containing the −291 to −209 region of theTOP2 gene were constructed (the A residue of the initiating ATG codon is +1). These plasmids had both mutant octamers (pRM9), left octamer mutant only (pRM10), right octamer mutant (pRM11), or both wild type octamers (pRM12). These plasmids were constructed by amplifying the −291 to −209 region of the TOP2 gene by PCR with Vent DNA polymerase using primers containing wild type or mutant octamers and plasmid pt2–1 as template and then cloning the various PCR products into the SmaI site of pUC19. Oligonucleotides used in PCR were C46 (AGCAGTGCGGCCGCGTGCGAGGATATTGCGGGTAACACGCCGC) and C47 (CGGGAGTCGGCCGATTCCTCGCAGGCTTTCGACACCTCTCTGT) for pRM9, C46 and B93 (CGGGAGTCGGCCGATCTTCTATGGGCTTTCGAC) for pRM10, B92 (AGCAGTGCGGCCGCGCATAGAAGTATTGCGGG) and C47 for RM11, and B92 and B93 for pRM12. Mutant octamer sequences are underlined, and wild type octamer sequences are shown in bold face.

The sequences of primers B92, B93, and C47 are given under “Experimental Procedures.” The RPA1 gene sequences from −341 to −231 containing wild type or mutant hexamers were cloned into pΔ10Not to give plasmids pDS17 and pDS19, respectively (16Brown L.M. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The inserts in all plasmids were sequenced to confirm the DNA sequence. RNA probes were generated byin vitro transcription of PCR products as described (18Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). PCR was performed using one primer that had a T7 promoter sequence added at the 5′ end. Amplification of the target DNA yields a PCR product with the T7 promoter upstream of the sequence of interest. The PCR product then served as a template for run off in vitrotranscription by purified T7 RNA polymerase. The templates and primers used in PCR to generate various RNA probes are given in Table I. Labeled RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase using 5 μl of PCR product as template in the presence of [α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) using the Maxiscript kit from Ambion. After electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, full-length transcripts were eluted from gel slices by overnight incubation at 37 °C in 0.4 ml of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA buffer. The RNAs were phenol-chloroform extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The probes were heated to 70 °C for 15 min and slowly cooled to room temperature before use in gel retardation assays. Some purified RNA probes gave two bands on nondenaturing gels. These are probably due to formation of stable secondary structures, since electrophoresis of these RNAs in denaturing gels gave single bands. Binding assays were performed in a 15-μl volume and contained 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 6.7 g/l heparin, 7% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm32P-labeled RNA. Unless mentioned, reactions were started by adding 10–20 μg of cytosolic or nuclear extracts (or 5 μl of column fraction) and incubated at 28 °C for 15 min. Samples were then mixed with 2 μl of loading buffer (10% Ficoll, 1× Tris-borate-EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) and electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels (60:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide ratio) that had been pre-run for 45 min. Electrophoresis was carried out for 3–4 h at 4 °C in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (45 mm Tris, 45 mm borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens at −70°C. Nuclear extracts were thawed on ice and centrifuged for 60 min at 40,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor at 2 °C. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to give 40% saturation, and the mixture was stirred on ice for 60 min. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, and the pellet was dissolved in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol) and dialyzed against the same buffer for 60 min at 4 °C. After a 30-min centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor, the supernatant was applied on a 40 ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with 120 ml of Buffer A containing 50 mmKCl, and the binding activity was eluted with Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. The fractions containing binding activity were pooled, and the proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate as above and dissolved in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol. The partially purified proteins were also electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar), and the polypeptides present were visualized by staining the gels with Coomassie Blue. The TOP2 −291 to −209 RNA probe was incubated with 10 μg of protein partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. After 15 min at 28 °C, the RNA-protein complexes were resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis as above. The wet gel was exposed to x-ray film, and the gel slices containing the shifted complexes were excised, covered with Saran Wrap, and exposed to UV light for 1 min at a distance of 9 cm from the light source (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The gel slices were equilibrated with 180 μl of buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 2% glycerol) for 30 min at 37 °C and then heated to 95 °C for 5 min. The solution was transferred to a fresh tube, and the RNA was digested by adding a 10-μl solution containing a mixture of RNase A (5 μg) and RNase T1 (100 units) and incubating for 60 min at 37 °C. The sample was then mixed with 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and applied on an 8.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar). The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used as standards in the electrophoresis. The synchronization of C. fasciculata cultures by hydroxyurea was performed as described previously (4Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared from cultures 90 and 180 min after release from hydroxyurea arrest and assayed for binding activity. An 83-base pair DNA fragment from −291 to −209 of theTOP2 5′UTR has been shown to confer periodic expression to a reporter gene (15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since gene expression in trypanosomes is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level, we wanted to determine whether C. fasciculata cell extracts contained a factor(s) that would bind to RNA from this region. An electrophoretic method for detecting RNA-protein interactions was used for this purpose (20Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were incubated with32P-labeled RNA, and the protein-RNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Heparin, a polyanion, was used to displace proteins bound nonspecifically to the labeled RNA. Gel shift results show thatC. fasciculata nuclear extracts contain a factor(s) that binds to the −291 to −209 sense RNA of the TOP2 gene (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). A smaller amount of binding activity was present in cytosolic extract (lane 2) that could be due to some breakage of nuclei during cell lysis. Two gel-shifted bands were seen on the gel with nuclear extracts. At present the basis for the different mobilities of these complexes is unknown. The relative intensity of these two bands varies in different preparations of nuclear extracts. To investigate the specificity of RNA binding activity in nuclear extracts, we examined binding to an antisense transcript of the −291 to −209 region and to a lacZ transcript. No binding was observed when the antisense RNA was incubated with cytosolic or nuclear extracts (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7). ThelacZ sense RNA also showed no binding with cytosolic or nuclear extracts (lanes 9 and 10). The specificity of binding is also indicated by gel retardation assays carried out in the presence of unlabeled competitor RNA (Fig. 2 B). A 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled TOP2 −291 to −209 sense RNA greatly reduced binding to the labeled RNA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3). However unlabeled lacZ RNA did not compete for binding at a similar concentration (lane 4). Further experiments were done to characterize the nature and specificity of binding seen to −291 to −209 TOP2 RNA. No complex formation took place when the nuclear extract was pretreated with proteinase K, confirming the involvement of a protein factor(s) in the binding reaction (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). However, pretreatment of the nuclear extract with DNase I or inclusion of poly(dI-dC) had no effect on binding (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5), ruling out a role for DNA in the binding reaction. These results show that C. fasciculata nuclear extracts contain a protein factor(s) that binds specifically to an 83-nucleotide RNA from the TOP2 5′-UTR. The −291 to −209 region of TOP2 gene contains two copies of the consensus octamer sequence found in the 5′ or 3′-UTRs of several C. fasciculata mRNAs that vary as cells progress through the cell cycle (Table I). Deletion of either of the two octamer sequences resulted in reduced cycling of the mRNA of a reporter gene, whereas deletion of both octamers completely abolished cycling of the mRNA (15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate the requirement for the consensus octamer sequence in binding to the RNA, we performed gel retardation assays using labeled RNAs in which one or both octamers were mutated to a different sequence (CAUAGAAG to UGCGAGGC). Mutation of either the left or right octamer sequence greatly reduced binding as compared with wild type RNA (Fig. 3). Interestingly, mutation of the right octamer had a greater effect on binding activity than mutation of the left octamer. We do not know the significance of this observation, although deletion of either octamer sequence reduced reporter mRNA cycling to the same extent (15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). No binding was seen to an RNA in which both octamers had been mutated. These results suggest that the consensus octamer sequence is required for binding of RNA to a factor(s) in nuclear extracts. Moreover, the results from these binding assays complement those measuring cycling of mRNA levels in synchronized cells. Mutations that reduce or abolish mRNA cycling also affect the RNA binding in a similar manner. A 349-base pair fragment, from −523 to −174, of the RPA1 5′-UTR is required for periodic accumulation of the RPA1 transcript (16Brown L.M. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This region contains two copies of the consensus octamer sequence. Subcloning into a reporter plasmid has shown that a 113-base pair DNA fragment from −343 to −231 containing the two octamer sequences can confer periodic accumulation on a heterologous transcript. Mutation of both octamer sequences abolished cycling of the reporter gene transcript, suggesting that these sequences function in a manner similar to that seen with theTOP2 gene. We therefore wanted to determine whether C. fasciculatanuclear extracts contained a factor(s) that would also bind to the −343 to −231 RPA1 RNA. Fig. 4 shows that the wild typeRPA1 RNA binds to a factor(s) in the nuclear extracts. Two retarded bands are present, as seen earlier with TOP2 RNA. No binding activity is present in the cytosolic extracts. Again, as seen with TOP2 RNA, no binding was observed when an RNA in which both octamers had been mutated to a different sequence was used in the gel retardation assay. These results show that nuclear extracts have a factor(s) that binds to RNA from the 5′-UTR of RPA1, and that octamer sequences present in the RNA are required for binding to occur. The above results from gel retardation assays show that octamer sequences are required for binding of TOP2 orRPA1 5′-UTR RNA to a factor(s) present in nuclear extracts. To determine whether the same factor(s) is involved in binding to bothTOP2 and RPA1 RNA probes, a competition experiment was done in which nuclear extracts were incubated with wild type RPA1-labeled RNA in the presence of unlabeledTOP2 RNA. The presence of unlabeled TOP2 RNA prevents binding of a factor(s) in nuclear extracts to theRPA1 RNA probe (Fig. 5). This suggests that both RNAs bind to the same nuclear factor(s). The elution profile of the TOP2 and RPA1 RNA binding activity was also determined after column chromatography. The binding activity was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation of proteins in the nuclear extract followed by successive chromatography over DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and heparin-Sepharose columns. A similar elution profile was observed when the heparin-Sepharose column fractions were assayed with either TOP2 or RPA1RNA probes (data not shown). Results of the competition experiment and the column chromatographic profiles of the factor(s) that binds toRPA1 and TOP2 RNA strongly suggest that the same factor(s) is involved in binding to both RNA probes. We sought to identify proteins bound to the 5′-UTR of TOP2 RNA in gel-shifted complexes by cross-linking to a radiolabeled probe. The binding activity was partially purified and then incubated with the TOP2 −291 to −209 RNA probe. The RNA-protein complexes were separated from other proteins and free probe by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel slices containing the shifted bands were irradiated with UV light, and the complexes were eluted from the slices and treated with RNases A and T1. SDS-PAGE analysis of the RNase-treated complexes showed two bands with apparent molecular masses of 74 and 37 kDa (Fig. 6 A). These bands were absent when the eluted complexes were treated with protease K (data not shown). At present we do not know if these polypeptides represent two different subunits of the binding protein or if the 74-kDa polypeptide might represent a dimer of the 37-kDa protein held together by a short oligonucleotide resistant to nuclease digestion. The partially purified proteins used in the RNA gel shift were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie-stained gel showed that the 74- and 37-kDa polypeptides were not major proteins in the partially purified nuclear extract (Fig. 6 B). This result indicates that the RNA probe was not simply cross-linked to two abundant nuclear proteins. We have examined the relative level of binding activity in cells synchronized by the hydroxyurea arrest. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated at various time intervals after release from hydroxyurea arrest has shown that the steady state transcript levels of the genes encodingRPA1, RPA2 (the gene encoding the RPA middle subunit), TOP2, and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene accumulate periodically during the cell cycle (4Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with maximum transcript levels present at G1/S phase. To determine whether the TOP2 and RPA1 5′-UTR RNA binding activities also vary during the cell cycle, cultures of C. fasciculata were synchronized by treatment with hydroxyurea, and nuclear extracts were prepared from cells 90 and 180 min after release from the hydroxyurea block. These times represent minimum and maximum levels of the TOP2 and RPA1mRNAs in the synchronously growing cells (4Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brown L.M. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were assayed for binding activity using the wild type −291 to −209TOP2 RNA as probe. Fig. 7shows that nuclear extracts prepared from cells 180 min after release from hydroxyurea arrest had severalfold higher binding activity than extracts from cells 90 min after hydroxyurea arrest. Similar results were obtained when nuclear extracts were assayed with wild typeRPA1 RNA as probe (data not shown). These results show that the binding activity varies during the cell cycle and parallels the mRNA levels of at least four DNA replication genes. We have used a reporter plasmid previously to analyze deletion mutants of 5′-UTRs of TOP2 and RPA1 genes to identify cis elements involved in periodic expression of these genes (15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Brown L.M. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both TOP2 and RPA1 genes have 5′-UTR elements that can confer periodic expression on the mRNA of a reporter gene. Comparison of the TOP2, RPA1, RPA2, and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene 5′-UTR sequences showed the presence of a consensus octamer sequence CATAGAAG that was also shown to be required for cycling of the reporter gene transcript. Furthermore, deletion analysis involvingTOP2 5′-UTR showed that the essential sequence elements had to be present on the mature mRNA and not just within the flanking DNA sequence. These results indicated that the regulation of gene expression is primarily at the post-transcriptional level and involves sequences within the 5′-UTR of the TOP2 mRNA. This is in agreement with the general observation that in trypanosomes, the expression of protein-coding genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level (21Clayton C. Prog. Nucleic. Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 37-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Pays E. Broda P. Oliver S.G. Sims P.F.G. The Eukaryotic Genome: Organization and Regulation. Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK1993: 127-160Google Scholar). In the present work we have attempted to identify trans-acting factor(s) that interact with RNA encoded by the 5′-UTR elements shown to be required for periodic expression of TOP2 and RPA1 genes. Our results provide evidence that proteins present in nuclear extracts of C. fasciculata interact specifically with 5′-UTR of TOP2 and RPA1mRNA. The interaction was shown to be specific by three independent criteria. First, excess unlabeled 5′-UTR RNA of the TOP2gene prevents formation of complexes, whereas no reduction in binding is seen with an unlabeled nonspecific RNA as competitor. Second, mutation of both octamer sequences present in either TOP2 orRPA1 RNA probes abolished binding to the probes. Since deletion of these octamer sequences or mutation to a different sequence abolishes cycling of the reporter gene transcript, it appears that these elements function by virtue of being recognized by nuclear proteins at the RNA level. Third, ultraviolet cross-linking of the gel-shifted complexes identified two specific proteins cross-linked to the probe RNA. The proteins that bind to the 5′-UTR RNA of TOP2 and RPA1 genes appear to be the same for several reasons. First, binding activities to both RNAs are present in the nuclear extracts and not in cytosolic extracts. Second, the same sequence elements are required for binding of both RNAs; mutations in octamer sequences abolish binding to both RNA molecules. Third, both activities vary during the cell cycle in a similar manner. Fourth, the activities that bind to both RNA molecules show identical chromatographic elution profiles. Finally, the addition of unlabeled TOP2 RNA eliminates binding to labeled RPA1 RNA probe. Thus we suggest that the cell cycle regulation of genes involved in replication of nuclear DNA and kDNA is mediated at a post-transcriptional level by a common protein factor(s). It remains to be determined whether the coordinate regulation of DNA replication genes plays an important role in synchronizing nuclear DNA and kDNA replication in C. fasciculata. There are several examples of 5′- and 3′-UTR elements affecting gene expression in trypanosomes. In Leishmania the intergenic region of the tubulin gene was shown to be essential when placed on the 5′ side of the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The region contained signals that did not affect transcription rate and probably modulated RNA stability (23Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Laban A. Wirth D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The developmentally regulatedLeishmania donovani A2 genes are regulated by differential RNA stability that involves the 3′-UTR of A2 mRNA (24Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In T. brucei, the expression of procyclin mRNA is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by cis elements in the 3′-UTR (25Furger A. Schurch N. Kurath U. Roditi I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this case regulation occurs at the level of both mRNA stability and translation. Our results also indicate that the 5′-UTR of TOP2 and RPA1 regulates gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. An interesting observation in these studies is that the level of binding activity varies in nuclear extracts prepared from synchronized cells at different stages of the cell cycle. The binding activity is severalfold higher in nuclear extracts prepared from cells 180 min after release from a hydroxyurea block, the time at which DNA replication gene transcript levels are maximal, as compared with extracts from cells 90 min after release from hydroxyurea, the time at which these transcript levels are at a minimum (4Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As a working model we propose that the presence of the conserved hexamer sequence in an mRNA targets the RNA for destruction and that a binding activity expressed periodically during the cell cycle protects the RNA from destruction when bound to the RNA. The target mRNAs would therefore vary during the cell cycle in parallel with the level of the binding activity. Another feature of this model is the protection from degradation of mRNAs in which the hexamer sequence is mutated. In this case, the mRNA level would no longer cycle regardless of the variation of the level of the binding factor. Further studies are aimed at testing this model and elucidating the biochemical mechanism of the cell cycle regulation of DNA replication genes in trypanosomatids. We are grateful to Drs. Dave Weston and W. Van Voorhis for advice on preparation of cell extracts and on doing gel retardation assays.

EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase (EcoP15I DNA MTase)1 catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the second adenine nucleotide in the canonical site 5′-CAGCAG-3′ (1Meisel A.

The enzyme is part of the type III restriction-modification (R-M) system (2Bickle T.A. Linn S. Lloyd R. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 89-109Google Scholar). Type III R-M enzymes are multifunctional proteins that exert both methylation and restriction activities (2Bickle T.A. Linn S. Lloyd R. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 89-109Google Scholar). Type III R-M systems contain two subunits, the Res subunit encoded by the res gene and the Mod subunit encoded by the mod gene. Although the Mod subunit alone can catalyze the methylation reaction, both the Res and Mod subunits are necessary for DNA cleavage (2Bickle T.A. Linn S. Lloyd R. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 89-109Google Scholar). The enzymes have an absolute requirement for ATP for restriction, and recently we and others (3Saha S. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar, 4Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Bickle T.A. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that ATP hydrolysis was required for DNA cleavage. It has been shown that only the Mod subunit is involved in DNA sequence recognition in both the restriction and modification reactions (5Hadi S.M. Bächi B. Iida S. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We had earlier shown by gel mobility shift assays that EcoP15I DNA MTase binds about 3-fold more tightly to DNA containing its recognition sequence 5′-CAGCAG-3′ than to nonspecific sequences in the absence or presence of cofactors. Interestingly, in the presence of ATP, the discrimination between specific and nonspecific sequences increased significantly (6Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Ahmad I. Krishnamurthy V. Rao D.N. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 157: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Based on the type of methylation catalyzed and amino acid sequence analysis, DNA MTases are divided into three classes (8Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). m4C-MTases are enzymes that methylate the exocyclic amino group of cytosine to formN 4-methylcytosine, and m6A-MTases methylate the exocyclic amino group of adenine to formN 6-methyladenine. The third class contains the m5C-MTases, that methylate cytosine residues at the C-5 position to form C 5-methylcytosine. Comparative analyses have shown that m5C-MTases share an ordered set of sequence motifs that alternate with non-conserved regions (9Klimasauskas S. Timinskas A. Menkevicius S. Butkiene D. Butkus V.

Among the well conserved motifs, motif I (FXGXG) can be seen in all three classes of DNA MTases as well as in protein and RNA MTases. All methyltransferases utilize AdoMet as methyl donor, and it was proposed that motif I is involved in AdoMet binding (9Klimasauskas S. Timinskas A. Menkevicius S. Butkiene D. Butkus V. Janulaitis A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20131-20139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tertiary structures of the HhaI and HaeIII DNA MTases (belonging to m5C-MTases) and TaqI DNA MTase (member of the N6A-MTase) bound to AdoMet (15Cheng X. Kumar S. Posfai J. Pflugrath W.

A. 1994; 91: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) clearly indicate that motif I forms a part of the AdoMet binding pocket.Structural analysis has found striking similarity between DNA MTases of the two classes, namely the m5C- and m6A-MTases. This suggested that many AdoMet-dependent MTases may share a common catalytic domain structure. Guided by this common catalytic domain structure, a multiple sequence alignment of 33 m6A- and 9 m4C-MTases revealed that these two classes of MTases were more closely related to one another and to the 5mC-MTases than was expected (18Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Based on this analysis, m4C- and m6A-MTases do not group separately from one another. The amino MTases belong to three groups distinguished by differences in the linear orders of conserved motifs in their primary sequences. The three groups are named α, β, and γ (18Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To date only two DNA amino MTases have been structurally characterized, the group γ N6mA MTase M.TaqI (17Labahn J. Grazin J. Schlukebier G. Robinson D.P. Jack W.E. Schildkraut I. Saenger W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the group β N4mC MTase, M.PvuII (19Gong W. O'Gara M. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).EcoP15I DNA MTase as mentioned earlier, is anN 6-adenine MTase and belongs to the β group of amino MTases. We have recently demonstrated that altering amino acid residues in the motif I of EcoP15I DNA MTase resulted in loss of AdoMet binding but left DNA target recognition unaltered (20Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A second motif characteristic of m6A-MTases and m4C-MTases, (N/D/S) PP (Y/F) (motif IV) (21Hattman S. Wilkinson J. Switon D. Schlagman S. MacDonald P.M. Mosig G. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 932-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is well conserved in EcoP15I DNA MTase. Substituting tyrosine in motif IV of EcoP15I DNA MTase by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in loss of enzyme activity although we observed enhanced cross-linking of AdoMet and DNA. These results reinforce the importance of motif IV in catalysis (20Ahmad I. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Cysteine residues are particularly important for studying the structure and function of enzymes. In m5C-MTases, motif IV consisting of amino acids FPCQ has been shown to be the catalytic center. The invariant Pro-Cys dipeptide is known to be involved in methyl group transfer (22Chen L. MacMillan A.M. Chang W. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11018-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 23Mi S. Roberts R.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the catalytic mechanism of m5C-MTases, it has been shown that the cysteine residue of motif IV and C-6 of the target cytosine form a covalent intermediate during the methyl group transfer from AdoMet (22Chen L. MacMillan A.M. Chang W. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11018-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mutation of this cysteine in many C5-MTases abolishes the enzyme activity without affecting DNA recognition and cofactor binding (23Mi S. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4811-4816Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Wyszynski M.W. Gabbara S. Kurareva E.A. Romanova E.A. Oretskaya T.S. Gromova J.S. Shabarova Z.A. Bhagwat A.S.

Although it has been firmly established that the thiol in the only conserved cysteine among m5C-MTases that carries out the attack at C-6 of cytosine and is important for the methylation reaction (22Chen L. MacMillan A.M. Chang W. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11018-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), very little is known about the roles of cysteine residue(s) in any N6A-Mtase-catalyzed reaction. Rubin and Modrich (26Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7265-7272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated thatEcoRI MTase rapidly lost activity upon cysteine modification by exposure to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Everett et al. (27Everett E.A. Falick A.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that NEM modification of cysteine 223 in EcoRI MTase was responsible for the loss of enzyme activity.Initial experiments done in our laboratory suggested that the absence of reducing agents in buffers used during purification of EcoP15I DNA MTase resulted in loss of enzyme activity; when purified enzyme preparations were dialyzed against buffers not containing any reducing agent, the enzyme lost activity on storage. These results suggested that cysteine residues in the protein could have a role in stabilization or in catalysis. EcoP15I DNA MTase, a 645-amino acid protein, contains six cysteine residues at positions 30, 213, 344, 434, 553, and 577 as deduced from the DNA sequence of the mod gene (28Hümbelin M. Suri B. Rao D.N. Hornby D.P. Eberle H. Pripfl T. Kenel S. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). By using oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, each of the six cysteines were substituted with another amino acid, and the mutant enzymes were purified and characterized. As a part of an investigation to study structure-function relationships in this enzyme, we were interested in assessing the role(s) of cysteine residues, if any, in DNA recognition, cofactor binding, or in catalysis.In the present investigation we have used chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies to elucidate the role of the cysteines in the activity of EcoP15I DNA MTase. Our findings indicate that cysteine at position 344 is required for enzyme activity.DISCUSSIONCysteines can serve as specific points for covalent labeling by radioactive, fluorescent, and spin-labeled −SH-reacting compounds because of their reactivity. These can then be used to probe three-dimensional structures and to detect intramolecular conformational changes. With this aim in mind, the current study combines results from protein chemistry and mutagenesis in order to elucidate the role of cysteine residues in the EcoP15I DNA methyltransferase. Whereas preincubation of M. EcoP15I DNA MTase with DTNB resulted in the loss of enzymatic activity, addition of DTT to DTNB-labeled EcoP15I DNA MTase under native conditions removed about 90% of the attached probe with concomitant recovery of MTase activity. Treatment of the enzyme with DTT showed that no disulfides were essential to maintain its activity. These observations clearly demonstrated that covalent modification of a cysteine residue was directly responsible for the observed inactivation.In the present work, the involvement of cysteine residues in the catalytic function of EcoP15I DNA MTase was also indicated by the inactivation of the enzyme by the thiol-specific reagent NEM. Kinetic analysis of the reaction of NEM demonstrates that modification of only 1 cysteine/single subunit resulted in loss of activity (Fig. 2). This comprehensive inhibition with a range of thiol reagents of different size and complexity argues strongly in favor of a significant structural or functional role for cysteine residues in EcoP15I DNA MTase. Inactivation could be caused by the steric obstruction of the active site of the enzyme, conformational alterations of the enzyme, or modification of a cysteine residue essential for the catalytic process. It is possible that the introduction of the large relatively hydrophobicN-ethylsuccinimidyl group of NEM and not the loss of the sulfhydryl group was the cause of the inactivation that we observed. Our results clearly show that although the NEM-modified enzyme binds specifically to DNA (Fig. 3 B), AdoMet binding was significantly decreased (Fig. 3 A). There are a number of instances where it has been shown that the modification or oxidation of cysteine residues in DNA-binding proteins affects the ability of these proteins to bind DNA and therefore enzymatic activity. For instance, Aiken et al. (39Aiken C.R. Fisher E.W. Gumport R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19063-19069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that NEM inactivatedRsrI endonuclease by producing a modified enzyme that was unable to bind its recognition sequence. The sensitivity of T4 DNA-[N 6- adenine]methyltransferase (40Kossykh V. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), M. Eco Dam (41Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and M. EcoRI (27Everett E.A. Falick A.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to NEM indicated that one or more cysteine residues was important for activity. It was observed that M.BspRI, a C5-Mtase, was able to accept the methyl group from AdoMet in the absence of DNA. Self-methylation was, however, inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, and two cysteines were identified that bind the methyl group in form of S-methylcysteine (42Szilak L. Finta C. Patthy A. Venetainer P. Kiss A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2876-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Chemical modification studies on EcoP15I DNA MTase using thiol reagents suggest that cysteine(s) is the likely target of this reaction. Modification results in a fast inactivation process even though cysteine(s) may not be involved in the catalytic mechanism. Inactivation of an enzyme as a result of modification accompanied by protection against inactivation by competitive inhibitors or substrates for the enzyme is generally used as a criterion to assess whether modification is active site-directed. We were unable to do substrate protection experiments because at high concentrations of AdoMet, M.EcoP15I exhibits substrate inhibition (29Rao D.N. Page M.G. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out site-directed mutagenesis to define more precisely the role of the six cysteine residues in substrate binding and catalysis. It has been observed in some instances that replacement of cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis led to conclusions different from those reached by chemical modification studies, especially when a bulky thiol reagent such as NEM was used (43Profy A.T. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11547-15474Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This turned out to be true in our case (see below).Although cysteine and serine are chemically similar in the sense that they are both nucleophilic, they possess significant differences in nucleophilicity and polarity. The hydroxyl group of serine is highly polar, and the sulfhydryl group of cysteine is relatively non-polar. Assuming that cysteine occupies a position in a hydrophobic environment, the introduction of a polar residue like serine could significantly perturb the active enzyme structure. In order to address this possibility, a second mutation was generated that replaced cysteine at position 344 by the non-polar residue alanine. Mutation to alanine was chosen as this is the most conservative change in terms of size and charge, and any resulting functional change can be largely attributed to the loss of the thiol group. The six cysteine residues of EcoP15I DNA MTase located in positions 30, 213, 344, 434, 553, and 577 were each individually and in combination mutated to serine. All substitutions except at position 344 resulted in an active phenotype as assessed both by in vivo and in vitro assays (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Replacement of cysteine at position 344 either with serine or alanine resulted in an inactive enzyme. This therefore suggested that all other cysteines were relatively benign. As in the case of the C344S mutant, the C344A mutant enzyme was inactive clearly indicating the importance of cysteine at position 344 in maintaining the activity of EcoP15I DNA MTase. Replacing the thiol of Cys-344 by hydrogen (C344A) or substitution of a hydroxyl group for the thiol (C344S) had a drastic effect, resulting in loss of activity. These observations therefore suggest that EcoP15I DNA MTase appears to be sensitive to the change in polarity and/or differences in hydrogen bonding properties caused by the substitution of serine or alanine residue at position 344. Gabbara et al.(44Gabbara S. Sheluho D. Bhagwat A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8914-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have shown that replacement of the catalytic cysteine in EcoRII methyltransferase, a m5C-MTase, by serine resulted in a mutant enzyme with a catalytic efficiency about 10,000 times less than that of wild-type.NEM inhibited each of the purified mutant enzymes except the C344A enzyme in the same manner as the unaltered enzyme, demonstrating that these altered proteins contain a residue modifiable by NEM. The observation that the NEM-treated C344A mutant enzyme behaves identically to the NEM-modified wild-type enzyme in terms of AdoMet binding convincingly demonstrates that Cys-344 is modified by NEM. Although the activity of C344A mutant enzyme was almost negligible (Fig. 10 C), it can be argued that the insignificant amount of activity could be possible due to occasional misreading of serine codon by a cysteinyl tRNA or could be the result of contamination by the wild-type enzyme during purification. This possibility can be eliminated by the fact that the C344A mutant enzyme behaves almost identically to the wild-type when both are subjected to NEM modification followed by AdoMet cross-linking (Fig. 11 A). C344A mutant enzyme could be catalytically inactive for a variety of reasons, including those associated with conformational changes. If AdoMet or DNA did not bind, or if the dimeric nature was not maintained, an inactive enzyme would be formed. It is clear from Fig. 11 that the C344A mutant enzyme binds to AdoMet but not to DNA, and therefore the loss of activity is due to the inability of the enzyme to bind one of its substrates. The observation that the C344A mutant enzyme was unable to bind DNA (Fig. 11) is in contrast to the observation that the NEM-modified enzyme was able to bind DNA (Fig. 3). However, these two contrasting effects can be explained if we assume that cysteine at position 344 is crucial for DNA- MTase interaction. Modification of this residue did not alter this interaction, but replacement of this residue with alanine abolished the interaction. The hydrogen bonding capabilities of the side chains of cysteine and alanine are different, and therefore substitution of alanine in the presence of cysteine affects DNA-MTase interactions. The dimeric nature of the mutant enzyme was not altered as is evident from both limited proteolysis patterns as well as elution profile on gel filtration chromatography. There was, therefore, no evidence for a global change in the mutant enzyme. Thus, it appears that the activity of the enzyme is due to the functions of Cys-344 at or near the DNA-binding site.Both wild-type and mutant enzymes that were active exhibited comparable kinetic parameters in K m and k cat. The specificity constant (k cat/K m) which is a measure of enzyme efficiency was not drastically different for the wild-type and the mutant enzymes (Table II) except in the case of the C30S mutant enzyme. Although the C30S mutant enzyme was catalytically active, it is clear from Table II that the specificity constant for the enzyme was 5-fold less than the other mutant enzymes. This was mainly due to a 5-fold decrease in the turnover number of the enzyme. The kinetic data confirm the nonessential character of cysteines at positions 30, 213, 434, 553, and 577 in the catalytic mechanism. The striking loss of activity as measured by both in vivo and in vitroassays argues strongly for a specific role for cysteine 344. To confirm this conclusion further, double and triple mutants were generated, some of which had the cysteine at position 344 replaced with serine. Again, all double and triple mutants that had a serine at position 344 did not show wild-type activity, whereas all other combinations did not result in loss of methylation activity (Fig. 7). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that cysteine 344 plays a significant role in enzyme function. Substitution of a single amino acid residue can sometimes result in a decrease of enzyme activity, even if the residue is not involved in the active site. This could be due to changes in the higher order protein structure. Such critical residues play a basic role in protein folding and/or in supporting correct protein structure. Replacement of such residues could lead to decreased protein stability and also to a decreased level of expression due to higher accessibility of mutant proteins to proteases. Similar results obtained on the oligomeric nature of the wild-type and C344A mutant enzyme suggest that loss of methylation activity in the case of the latter was not due to changes in the higher order protein structure.The structural similarity among the active sites of M.PvuII, M.TaqI, and M.HhaI reveals that catalytic amino acids essential for cytosine N-4 and adenine N-6 methylation coincide spatially with those for cytosine C-5 methylation suggesting a mechanism for amino methylation. Based on the chemical and structural similarity of the DNA-adenosyl and AdoMet-adenosyl moieties and the structural similarity of the AdoMet binding and catalytic regions of the MTase, Malone et al. (18Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) have proposed analogous MTase-adenosine interactions in the two regions. Chemical model studies suggest that methyl transfer reactions with amine nucleophiles and methyl sulfonium compounds require significant activation (45Coward J.K. Sweet D. J. Org.

Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) have proposed a model that suggests that methylation of the exocyclic amino group results from a direct attack of the activated adenine N-6 on the AdoMet methyl group, in analogy with the previously proposed mechanism for DNA adenine methylation (47Pogolotti A.L. Ono A. Subramaniam R. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7461-7464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Ho D.K. Wu J, C. Santi D.V. Floss H.G. Arch. Biochem.

It has been suggested that the N-6 amino nitrogen of the target adenine is the donor in a hydrogen bond to the side chain of aspartic acid in motif IV and possibly to one of the main chain oxygens of the adjacent two proline residues. This would negatively polarize N-6, activating it for direct transfer of the CH3+ from AdoMet. The relative positions of the activating hydrogen bond acceptor, target amino group, and AdoMet methyl group must be precisely maintained. Although it has been suggested that increasing the nucleophilic nature of the exocyclic amines of adenine (N-6) with cysteine may be a common strategy for MTases, cysteine residues might, however, still have a role as general base in catalysis of the methylation. It was earlier observed that few adenine MTases contain a cysteine flanked by asparagine akin to a PC doublet seen in m5C- MTases (27Everett E.A. Falick A.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas it is firmly established that the PC motif is the catalytic center in m5C-MTases, no such role has been identified for the CN or NC motif seen in few m6- MTases. In any case, such dipeptide sequences are not present in the case of EcoP15I DNA MTase.The key finding of the present work is the identification of the single cysteine in M. EcoP15I involved in DNA binding and that Cys-344 is modified by NEM. Taken together, our experiments unambiguously show the consequences of replacing the cysteine residue at position 344 with alanine or serine. Whether this re"

To uncover the promoter function and to define positive and negative regulatory elements in TCR gene promoters, the promoter activities from 13 human TCR Vβ genes were determined by the transient transfection system and luciferase reporter assay. Although most of the TCR Vβ gene promoters that we tested are inactive by themselves, some promoters were found to be constitutively strong. Among them, Vβ6.7 is the strongest. 5′-Deletion and fragmentation experiments have narrowed the full promoter activity of Vβ6.7 to a fragment of 147 base pairs immediately 5′ to the transcription initiation site. A decanucleotide motif with the consensus sequence AGTGAYRTCA has been found to be conserved in most TCR Vβ gene promoters. There are three such decamer motifs in the promoter region of Vβ6.7, and the contribution of each such motif to the promoter activity has been examined. Further site-directed mutagenesis analyses showed that: 1) when two Ts in the decamer were mutated, the promoter activity was totally abolished; 2) when two additional nucleotides 3′ to the end of decamer were mutated, the promoter activity was decreased to two-thirds of the full level; and 3) when the element with the sequence AGTGATGTCACT was inserted into other promoters, the original weak promoters become very strong. Taken together, our data suggest that the positive regulatory element in Vβ6.7 should be considered a dodecamer rather than a decamer and that it confers strong basal transcriptional activity on TCR Vβ genes.

T-lymphocyte development is similar to that of B-cell maturation in that the germ line variable (V),1 diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) are somatically recombined to form a V-D-J (for β-chain) or V-J (for α-chain) exon encoding the variable domain portion of the receptor. Studies in B-cells support the idea that to achieve the recombination, the rearranging Ig gene segments must be transcriptionally activated (1Blackwell T.K. Moore M.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Suh H.

If this prerequisite also applies to TCR genes, then the promoter elements that control transcriptional activity of TCR V genes will play a pivotal role in rearrangement. Specific transcriptional factors may bind to distinct DNA sequence motifs in the promoter region and control transcription. These factors can also affect the accessibility of germ line loci to the recombinational machinery, thus regulating gene expression in a tissue- or developmental stage-specific way. A 10-base pair decamer sequence motif, AGTGAYRTCA, was found to be conserved in the promoter regions of most murine and human TCR Vβ genes (5Siu G. Strauss E.C. Lai E. Hood L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1600-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Anderson S.J. Chou H.S. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3551-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Li Y. Szabo P. Posnett D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Elimination of this decamer motif in the murine Vβ8.3 promoter reduced transcriptional activity (8Anderson S.J. Miyake S. Loh D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Binding of thymic factors to this decamer motif was found to be developmentally regulated, and no decamer binding activity was detected in nuclear extracts prepared from thymuses of severe combined immunodeficiency mice, suggesting that the decamer motif plays an important role in the connection between murine TCR V gene transcription and rearrangement (9Lanier E.R. Brown R.M. Kraig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8131-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The most highly conserved portion in the decamer motif is an inverted repeat with the sequence TGA–TCA. This palindromic feature links the decamer to other regulatory elements, such as the c-AMP response element, TGACGTCA, and the AP-1 binding site, TGACTCA (10Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 11Lee W. Haslinger A. Karin M. Tjian R. Nature. 1987; 325: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We have observed some discrete differences in the location and the consensus sequence of the decamer motif between different human TCR Vβ subfamilies (7Li Y. Szabo P. Posnett D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the role of the decamer motif in promoter function or whether differences in the decamer motif may affect promoter activity. In this study, we have characterized 14 promoters of human TCR Vβ genes, with a specific emphasis on Vβ6.7. By using a transient transfection system, we have shown that human TCR Vβ promoters vary in terms of their strength. Whereas most promoters tested are weak, the promoters of the Vβ6 subfamily, particularly Vβ6.7, are constitutively strong. Sequence analyses have revealed three decamer-like motifs in the promoter region of Vβ6.7, and each of them contributes differently to promoter activity. The one located most 5′ to the transcription initiation site has essentially no effect on promoter activity. In contrast, the one located proximal to the initiation site forms the major contribution to promoter strength. A 5′ deletion study has shown that a fragment of 147 bp immediately 5′ upstream of the transcription initiation site can constitutively drive the reporter luciferase gene expression. Further shortening of this fragment results in a decrease in reporter gene expression. Therefore, this fragment represents the minimal promoter element of Vβ6.7. Inside this fragment there are a CACCC motif, a TATA box, and two decamer-like motifs. Further site-directed mutagenesis analyses have shown that a 12-nucleotide sequence, AGTGATGTCACT, is responsible for the high promoter activity. Therefore, the regulatory element in the promoter of Vβ6.7 should be considered a dodecamer rather than a decamer. The possible contributions to Vβ6.7 promoter activity from additional transcription factor binding sites 3′ behind the dodecamer are also discussed. Human peripheral blood T-cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. CD8+ T-cells were depleted following treatment with an anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (OKT 8) and anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Great Neck, NY). CD4+T-cells were activated with anti-Vβ6.7-specific monoclonal antibody OT145 (12Posnett D.N. Wang C.-Y. Friedman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7888-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After a second retriggering, more than 80% of T-cells were Vβ6.7-positive. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was spun down. Total cellular RNA was isolated using an acidified guanidinium/phenol/chloroform isolation kit (RNazol, TEL-TEST, Friendswood, TX) and used to identify the transcription initiation sites by RNase protection and primer extension methods. To prepare an antisense RNA probe, a double-stranded DNA fragment spanning the first and the second exons plus the 5′-untranslated portion of Vβ6.7 was subcloned into a T/A vector that contains a T7 promoter. The template plasmid DNA was digested upstream at an unique XhoI site. The antisense RNA probe was synthesized with a Riboprobe-T7 system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP. The labeled RNA probe was hybridized with total cellular RNA isolated from Vβ6.7+ T-cells. The protected products were purified once with phenol/chloroform extraction, denatured, and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7m urea sequencing gel. The dideoxyl-terminate sequencing reaction product from a plasmid DNA with a known sequence was loaded alongside as a size marker. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C for 12–48 h. In primer extension experiments, an antisense oligonucleotide primer with the sequence 5′-TGTGATCTGCCCCCAGGA-3′ was synthesized. The primer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and polynucleotide kinase following the protocol in TaqTrack sequencing system (Promega). The end-labeled primer was annealed to 5 μg of total cellular RNA isolated from Vβ6.7+ cells at 65 °C for 10 min and then extended at 56 °C for 1 h in the presence of reverse transcriptase, dNTPs, and RNase inhibitor (cDNA Cycle Kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cellular RNA isolated from a mouse thymoma cell line BW5147, which contains no human TCR Vβ genes, was used in a parallel extension reaction as negative control. The extension products were denatured and loaded on sequencing gel with a size marker as described in the RNase protection assay. The 5′-flanking sequences were PCR-amplified from either genomic DNA or λ phage DNA clones. The sequences of 5′ sense and 3′ antisense oligonucleotide primers used for 14 human TCR Vβ genes were listed in Table I. These PCR amplified fragments were ∼500 bp and were inserted 5′ to the reporter luciferase gene segment in pGL-2/Basic vector (Promega). The sequences and orientations of these fragments inside pGL-2 were confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid DNAs used for transfection were purified by cesium chloride banding. The site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using the PCR-overlapping method (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Human Jurkat T-cell line cells were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and other supplements. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA containing promoter-reporter constructs (described above) by a modified DEAE-dextran electroporation method. Briefly, cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of 17 × 106/ml. 600 μl of cell suspension was placed in a 0.45-cm electroporation cuvette (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) followed by adding 180 μl of DEAE-dextran (100 μg/ml) and 10 μg of promoter-reporter plasmid DNA. To evaluate the transfection efficiency, 5 μg of plasmid DNA containing a β-galactosidase gene segment was co-transfected into the cells. The electroporation was carried out at a capacitance of 960 microfarads and 250 V. After electroporation, the cells remained at room temperature for 10 min and then were resuspended in 10 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium, placed in wells (3 ml/well) of a 12-well plate, and incubated for 48–72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 5× luc stock buffer, which contains 125 mm glycyl glycine, 75 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm EGTA, was premade and used later in preparation of lysis solution, assay solution, and luciferin substrate solution. The transfected cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and lysed with 500 μl of lysis solution (1× luc buffer, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm of dithiothreitol added immediately prior to use). 100 μl of cell lysate was added to a test tube that contained 500 μl of assay solution (1× luc buffer, 1 mmKHPO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm of ATP). The tube was loaded into the measurement chamber, and 100 μl of luciferin substrate solution (1× luc buffer, 0.4 mmd-luciferin-sodium salt, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) was injected automatically. The relative light units (RLUs) were measured on a Monolight 2001 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). The background RLUs from cells transfected with vector pGL-2 only were measured in each experiment. The luciferase assay data were calibrated with β-galactosidase activity and are presented as averages in triplicate measurements. The β-galactosidase activity was measured by using a Galacto-Light Plus Chemiluminescent Reporter assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Putative regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking region of human TCR Vβ genes were identified by searching the Genetics Computer Group (version 8.1, Madison, WI) transcription factor binding sites data base (TFSITE) through Rockefeller University Computer Services. The decamer-like motifs were screened by the FINDPATTERNS program. To determine the role of decamer sequence motifs in promoter activity, we have searched for this regulatory element in promoter regions among 54 functional TCR Vβ genes based on their genomic DNA sequences (Hoodet al., GenBank accession no. L36092). The consensus sequence for the decamer is AGTGARYTCA. However, we observed some discrete differences in different TCR V gene subfamilies, such as AGTGATGTCA in Vβ6, AGTGACATCA in Vβ5, andTGANNNNTCA in Vβ13 subfamilies (7Li Y. Szabo P. Posnett D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have screened two general patterns of the decamer motif, NNTGANNTCA and TGANNNNTCA, in the promoter regions ∼500 bp 5′ to the translation initiation codon ATG, using the FINDPATTERNS computer program. Among 54 functional human TCR Vβ gene families, 42 Vβ promoters contain these general patterns (Table II). 22 Vβs each contain one NNTGANNTCA element. 8 Vβs each contain two such elements, and the remaining 5 Vβs each contain three such elements. Of these 5 Vβs, 4 come from the Vβ6 subfamily. They are Vβ6.3, 6.7, 6.11, and 6.14. All Vβ13 subfamilies, except Vβ13.1, contain the TGANNNNTCA pattern.Table IIDecamer motifs in human TCR Vβ gene promotersVβsNNTGANNTCATGANNNNTCA1.1+2.1++3.1+4.1++5.1+++5.2+5.3+5.6+5.7+5.8−6.1++6.3+++6.5++6.7+++6.11+++6.14+++7.1+7.2+8.1++8.2++8.3++8.5++9.1+9.2+10.1−11.1−12.1−12.2+12.3++12.4+13.1−13.2+13.3+13.4+13.5+13.6+13.8+13.9+14.1−15.1++16.1++17.1+18.1+19.1−20.1−21.3+21.4+22.1−23.1++24.1−25.1−26.1++29.1−31.1+The nomenclature of human TCR Vβ genes used in this study is consistent with that of Hood et al.(GenBank™ accession number L36092).The number of plus signs indicates the number of decamer-like motifs identified in the promoter region. Open table in a new tab The nomenclature of human TCR Vβ genes used in this study is consistent with that of Hood et al.(GenBank™ accession number L36092). The number of plus signs indicates the number of decamer-like motifs identified in the promoter region. We randomly selected 13 TCR Vβ genes and compared their promoter activity using a transient transfection system. The 5′-flanking sequences of human TCR Vβ6.3 and 6.7 were PCR amplified from λ phage genomic DNA clones 4-1 and 5-2 (7Li Y. Szabo P. Posnett D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The promoter segments for other Vβ genes were PCR amplified from genomic DNA. The promoter fragments were ligated into a luciferase reporter vector pGL-2/Basic. These constructs were then used to transfect a human Jurkat T-cell line. The promoter activities were measured as luciferase activities in transfectants. To eliminate the influence of transfection efficiency, all data from luciferase assays were calibrated with β-galactosidase activities and are presented as averages of triplicate measurements. Fig. 1 shows the reporter luciferase activities, expressed as RLUs, for 13 human TCRVβ promoters. Human TCR Vβ promoters may be divided into three groups in terms of their constitutive activities. The weak promoter group includes Vβ3.1, 5.7, 9.1, 12.2, 14.1, and 21.4. The promoters with moderate constitutive activity are those from Vβ5.1, 5.2, 8.1, and 17.1. The strong promoters are those from Vβ6 subfamilies, Vβ6.1, 6.3, and 6.7. Of them, the promoter of Vβ6.7 is the strongest. We previously identified two alleles of the human TCR Vβ6.7 gene, Vβ6.7a and Vβ6.7b (14Li Y. Szabo P. Robinson M. Dong B. Posnett D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). They differ at two amino acid positions inside the coding region: Vβ6.7a encodes Ser38 and Gly72, whereas Vβ6.7b encodes Arg38 and Glu72. An allele-specific monoclonal antibody, OT145, can recognize the product of 6.7a but not 6.7b (15Prashar Y. Li Y. Kubinec J.S. Jones N. Posnett D.N. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3441-3444PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Vissingaet al. (16Vissinga C.V. Charmley P. Concannon P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar) found that the peripheral expression of these two alleles in heterozygous individuals was skewed, indicating that an allelic polymorphism in the coding region can have a significant impact on gene expression in the peripheral repertoire. However, other polymorphisms in the TCR β locus, such as those in the promoter region, may also affect gene expression. To address this possibility, we analyzed the 5′-flanking sequences of Vβ6.7 alleles a and b. First, a 463-bp sequence upstream of Vβ6.7a in phage λ DNA clone 5–2 (7Li Y. Szabo P. Posnett D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was obtained. The promoter segment of Vβ6.7 allele b was then PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of a b/b homozygous individual. Sequence analyses revealed three point mutations between alleles a and b within the 463-bp 5′-flanking region that were confirmed in a total of 24 plasmid clones derived from three Vβ6.7 a/a and three Vβ6.7 b/b homozygous individuals (Fig. 2). These mutations represent allelic variations in the promoter region of Vβ6.7. We expected that no significant difference in promoter activities would be detected between Vβ6.7 alleles a and b because no destruction of any major regulatory elements was caused by these mutations. Our expectation was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay (data not shown). To determine the transcription initiation site of Vβ6.7, primer extension analysis was performed. An antisense oligonucleotide primer, 5′-TGTGATCTGCCCCCAGGA-3′, was specifically designed. In this primer, 12 nucleotides match the 3′-end sequence of the first exon, and the remaining 6 nucleotides match the 5′-beginning of the second exon of Vβ6.7 (see the coding sequence of Vβ6.7 in Fig. 2). Only cDNA, but not the genomic DNA, can anneal to this primer. In Fig. 3, lanes C, T, A, and G were sequencing products of a plasmid DNA with known sequence, shown here as the size marker. Lane 1 was the primer extension product incubated with RNA isolated from Vβ6.7+ T-cells. Lane 2 was the primer extension product incubated with RNA isolated from mouse thymoma cell line BW5147, included here as negative control. Two intense bands were observed in lane 1. The higher one is 63 bp, and the lower one 60 bp. We assumed that the 63-bp band represents the full length extension product. This product aligns with an A 26 bp 5′ to the ATG codon. Given that adenine is a favored base for eukaryotic transcription initiation (17Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar), we defined it as the initiation site for human Vβ6.7; it is marked with an asterisk in Fig. 2. This transcription initiation site was further confirmed by RNase protection assay (data not shown) and is consistent with the findings in most murine TCR Vβ genes, in which the cap sites fall into a range of 19–40 bp 5′ to the ATG codon (6Anderson S.J. Chou H.S. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3551-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The lower band of 60 bp in Fig. 3,lane 1, may represent the partial extension product. Three decamer-like motifs were identified in the promoter region of Vβ6.7. They were located at positions −84, −111, and −352 and are designated D1, D2, and D3 (Fig. 2). To evaluate the contribution of each decamer or other transcription factor binding elements to the promoter activity, the 5′-flanking sequence of Vβ6.7 was fragmented. Each fragment was ligated into the luciferase reporter gene construct (Fig. 4, left panel), and then RLUs were measured (Fig. 4, right panel). Fragment I, from −1 to −463, representing the entire 5′-flanking sequence of Vβ6.7, can drive the luciferase activity to ∼700-fold higher than the background of pGL-2/Basic vector only. Fragment II, from −463 to −336, which contains one decamer-like motif D3, had essentially no effect on luciferase activity. The same result was obtained with fragment III (−336 to −127). In contrast, when fragment IV (−147 to −1) was used, the RLUs were even higher than the level induced by the entire 5′-sequence (fragment I). 5′-Deletion further created two small fragments: fragment V (−147 to −80), which contains D2 only, and fragment VI (−89 to −1), which contains D1 only. As shown in Fig. 4,right panel, the RLUs for fragment V were low, and the RLUs for fragment VI were high. However, fragment VI was unable to reach the same level of activity as that induced by fragment IV. Therefore, the 147-bp of fragment IV represents the basic promoter for Vβ6.7. To determine whether the constitutive activity of the promoter element in Vβ6.7 was specific to the T-cell lineage, several cell lines, including human T-cells (Jurkat), Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Ramos), fibroblast cells (cos 7), mouse thymoma cells (BW5147), and human embryonic kidney cells (293) were used. The luciferase reporter constructs containing TCR Vβ6.7 promoter segment and a nonspecific Rous sarcoma virus promoter were used to transfect these different cell lines. When compared with the nonspecific Rous sarcoma virus promoter, the RLUs were relatively high for Vβ6.7 promoter in lymphocyte cell lines (Jurkat, Ramos, and BW5147) but low in fibroblast cell cos 7 and embryonic kidney cell lines (data not shown). The effect of T-cell activation by stimuli that mimic TCR ligation, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, on the promoter activity was further examined. As shown in Fig. 5, there were no significant changes in promoter activity when cells were stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin for 2–12 h, whether the basic 147-bp or the entire 463-bp Vβ6.7 promoter fragments were tested. Our data indicate that Vβ6.7 promoter element is lymphocyte-specific but not T-cell lineage-specific. To further evaluate the role of decamer D1 and its surrounding nucleotides in promoter activity, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. When D1 (AGTGATGTCA) was mutated to D1 m1 (AGAGATGCCA), in which the two Ts that form the core element of TGA–TCA were substituted, one by an A and the other by a C, the luciferase activity was totally abolished (Fig. 6), suggesting that the palindromic TGA–TCA is critical. We further mutated two nucleotides immediately 3′ of D1, which changed AGTGATGTCACT to AGTGATGTCAAA (Fig. 6, D1 m2). This mutation destroys the reverse complementation between the first two nucleotides, AG, to the last two nucleotides, CT, in the original sequence. As shown in Fig. 6, the luciferase activity was decreased to two-thirds that of the original, nonmutated sequence, indicating that these two nucleotides are also important to promoter activity. Therefore, the regulatory motif in Vβ6.7 should be considered a dodecamer (12-bp) rather than a decamer. There is a dodecamer-like motif, AGTGACATCACA, with relatively the same location as the dodecamer in Vβ6.7, in the promoter of Vβ5.2. Although the luciferase assay showed that the original weak Vβ5.2 promoter became strong when this imperfect dodecamer was corrected (Fig. 7, pVb5.2/*), the transcription activity was still far below that of Vβ6.7. Only when a fragment from −85 to −1 of the Vβ6.7 promoter, which contains the dodecamer, was replaced at its 3′-end (Fig. 7, pVb5.2/dd) did the Vβ5.2 promoter became very strong and comparable in activity to Vβ6.7. This observation led us to speculate that additional regulatory elements may exist 3′ behind the dodecamer of Vβ6.7. To test this hypothesis, constructs containing the fragment from −85 to −1 of Vβ6.7, and corresponding fragments from Vβ6.1 and Vβ6.3, were prepared and used in transient transfection. As shown in Fig. 8, although Vβ6.1 and 6.3 also contain the same dodecamer motif as Vβ6.7, their activities were below that of Vβ6.7. Sequence alignment showed that the 3′-ends of the promoters among Vβ6.7, 6.1, and 6.3 are highly homologous to each other and that they all have the same dodecamer motif. The most distinct differences occur in the area from −67 to −43. We have screened for transcription factor sites and found at least three additional sites that are present in Vβ6.7 but absent in Vβ6.1 and 6.3. They are Sp1-U2snR.2 at −49, SIF_core_RS at −53, and BS15 at −66 (Fig. 9). Future site-directed mutagenesis experiments will be directed toward addressing the roles that these binding sites may play in promoter activity and function for Vβ6.7.Figure 8Promoter activity comparison between Vβ6 subfamily members. Constructs used in transient transfection and luciferase assays were pVb6.7d1, pVb6.1d1, and pVb6.3d1.

Transcriptional activation of rearranging Ag receptor gene segments has been hypothesized to regulate their accessibility to the recombinational machinery. Several pieces of evidence support this prerequisite in both B-cells and T-cells (1Blackwell T.K. Moore M.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Suh H. Lutzker S. Selsing E. Alt F.W. Nature. 1986; 324: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Schlissel M.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 3Fondell J.D.

Therefore, an understanding of transcriptional regulation may be important in elucidating the mechanisms controlling the lineage-specific patterns of rearrangement of the TCR genes during thymocyte differentiation. Human TCR Vβ gene promoters themselves, which control the transcription, were reported to be essentially inactive. It was the enhancer, located 3.5–5.0 kilobase pairs 3′ to the Cβ2 gene segment, that conferred the transcriptional activity and T-cell lineage specificity to Vβ promoters (18McDougall S. Peterson C.L. Calame K. Science (Wash. DC). 1988; 241: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Krimpenfort P. de Jong R. Uematsu Y. Dembic Z. Ryser S. von Boehmer H. Steinmetz M. Berns A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Gottschalk L.R. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this study, we found that Vβ promoters varied in terms of their activities. Although most of the Vβ promoters that we tested were very weak, some were constitutively strong, such as those from Vβ6 subfamilies. The promoter of Vβ6.7 was found to be the strongest when compared with others. The 5′-flanking sequence analyses revealed that there are three decamer-like sequence motifs in the promoter region of Vβ6.7. There seems to be a correlation between the promoter activity and decamer-like motifs. For example, the strong promoters, such as Vβ6.3 and 6.7, all contain three decamer-like sequences. The most highly conserved portion in the decamer is an inverted repeat with the core sequence TGA–TCA. We identified the decamer as AGTGATGTCA in Vβ6.7, AGTGACATCA in Vβ5.2, andTGANNNNTCA in Vβ13 subfamilies (7Li Y. Szabo P. Posnett D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The general idea is that the core regulatory element is composed of TGA–TCA. Those nucleotides in front of TGA, after TCA, or between TGA and TCA may be not so important. However, our results show that it is not so simple. Certainly, TGA–TCA is critical. When this element was destroyed by site-directed mutagenesis, the promoter activity was totally abolished (see Fig. 6, Construct 3). However, TGA–TCA alone is not sufficient to confer promoter activity. For instance, the decamer-like motif D3 in the 5′-distal segment of the Vβ6.7 promoter was found to have essentially no effect on promoter activity (Fig. 4, II). Motif D2 in Vβ6.7 also showed a very low contribution to the promoter activity (Fig. 4, V). The surrounding nucleotides 5′ and 3′ to TGA–TCA, AG and CT, were also important. When the CT at the 3′-end was mutated to AA, the promoter activity dropped to two-thirds of the original activity (see Fig. 6,Construct 4). These data support our hypothesis that the most critical regulatory element is a 12-nucleotide motif with a core sequence AGTGA–TCACT. Therefore, it is a dodecamer, rather than a decamer. Further evidence to support this idea comes from the study of promoter activities for Vβ5.1 and 5.2. Although these promoters also contain a dodecamer-like motif at relatively the same location as the dodecamer in the Vβ6.7 promoter, their activities were found to be relatively low (Fig. 1). Not surprisingly, the dodecamer-like motif in the promoters of Vβ5.1 and 5.2 has the sequence AGTGACATCACA, which is not a perfect dodecamer as in the Vβ6 genes. When this imperfect dodecamer in Vβ5.2 was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis, the promoter activity was found to be increased. However, only when its 3′-end was replaced by a fragment from −85 to −1 of Vβ6.7 did the Vβ5.2 promoter became very strong, with activity comparable to Vβ6.7 (see Fig. 7). The palindromic features lead us to propose that the dodecamer may form a stem and loop structure by reverse complementation. Such a stem-loop structure will exert the regulatory function by binding with homo- or heterodimers of transcription factors, such as members of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein or activating transcription factor families (21Lee M.-R.

To test this hypothesis, we simply compared the light outputs for constructs in which the 147 bp of fragment IV were inserted in sense or antisense orientations (Fig. 6, Constructs 1 and 2). No significant difference in luciferase activity was observed between the two constructs, suggesting that this stem-loop model may stand. Together, these results indicate that a perfect dodecamer motif, which can form a stem-loop structure, plays an important role in TCR Vβ promoter activity. In addition to the dodecamer motif, there are other elements, such as the TATA box (at −123) and CACCC box (at −140), that also contribute to the promoter activity of Vβ6.7. In murine TCR Vβ genes, the decamer motifs were identified in the promoter region 10–40 bp upstream of the TATA box (6Anderson S.J. Chou H.S. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3551-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In human TCR Vβ genes, the locations of the decamer motif are different. The decamer in the Vβ8 subfamily, similar to murine TCR Vβs, is located ∼20 bp upstream of the TATA box. Interestingly, the dodecamer in the promoters of Vβ6.1, 6.3 and 6.7 were located 36 bp downstream of the TATA box. It was unclear whether these different locations might affect the promoter activities. The CACCC box, identified in human Vβ8.1 and mouse TCR α gene silencer (24Winoto A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 649-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), was found to be another transcription factor binding site with T-cell lineage specificity (25Royer H.D. Reinherz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Wang Y. Kobori J.A. Hood L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found the CACCC box in the 150-bp basic promoter fragment from Vβ6.7. The fragment that contains the dodecamer only, without TATA and CACCC boxes, showed partial promoter activity (Fig. 4, VI), indicating that TATA and CACCC boxes may play a synergistic role with the dodecamer and contribute to the high constitutive promoter activity of Vβ6 genes. Other motifs identified 3′ behind the dodecamer of Vβ6.7, such as BS15, SIF_core_RS, and Sp1-U2snR.2, are also important but have not been characterized. Further analyses will help us to evaluate the contributions of these binding sites. We thank Drs. Peggy Crow and David Posnett for useful suggestions and editorial comments on the manuscript."
