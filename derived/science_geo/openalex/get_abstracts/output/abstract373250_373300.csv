https://openalex.org/W1995481385,"Background Local inflammation associated with solid tumors commonly results from factors released by tumor cells and the tumor stroma, and promotes tumor progression. Cancer associated fibroblasts comprise a majority of the cells found in tumor stroma and are appealing targets for cancer therapy. Here, our aim was to determine the efficacy of targeting cancer associated fibroblasts for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate that cancer associated fibroblasts are key modulators of immune polarization in the tumor microenvironment of a 4T1 murine model of metastatic breast cancer. Elimination of cancer associated fibroblasts in vivo by a DNA vaccine targeted to fibroblast activation protein results in a shift of the immune microenvironment from a Th2 to Th1 polarization. This shift is characterized by increased protein expression of IL-2 and IL-7, suppressed recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid derived suppressor cells, T regulatory cells, and decreased tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Additionally, the vaccine improved anti-metastatic effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy and enhanced suppression of IL-6 and IL-4 protein expression while increasing recruitment of dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells. Treatment with the combination therapy also reduced tumor-associated Vegf, Pdgfc, and GM-CSF mRNA and protein expression. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that cancer associated fibroblasts promote tumor growth and metastasis through their role as key modulators of immune polarization in the tumor microenvironment and are valid targets for therapy of metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2036906474,"The thioredoxin-interacting protein TXNIP is a ubiquitously expressed redox protein that promotes apoptosis. Recently, we found that TXNIP deficiency protects against type 1 and 2 diabetes by inhibiting beta cell apoptosis and maintaining pancreatic beta cell mass, indicating that TXNIP plays a key role in beta cell biology. However, very little is known about the intracellular localization and function of TXNIP, and although TXNIP has been thought to be a cytoplasmic protein, our immunohistochemistry studies in beta cells surprisingly revealed a nuclear TXNIP localization, suggesting that TXNIP may shuttle within the cell. Using immunohistochemistry/confocal imaging and cell fractionation/co-immunoprecipitation, we found that, under physiological conditions, TXNIP is localized primarily in the nucleus of pancreatic beta cells, whereas oxidative stress leads to TXNIP shuttling into the mitochondria. In mitochondria, TXNIP binds to and oxidizes Trx2, thereby reducing Trx2 binding to ASK1 and allowing for ASK1 phosphorylation/activation, resulting in induction of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with cytochrome c release and caspase-3 cleavage. TXNIP overexpression and Trx2 (but not cytosolic Trx1) silencing mimic these effects. Thus, we discovered that TXNIP shuttles between subcellular compartments in response to oxidative stress and identified a novel redox-sensitive mitochondrial TXNIP-Trx2-ASK1 signaling cascade."

Abnormal expression of defensins was shown in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it is not clear whether this is a primary defect. We investigated the impact of anti-inflammatory therapy with infliximab on the mucosal gene expression of AMPs in IBD.Mucosal gene expression of 81 AMPs was assessed in 61 IBD patients before and 4-6 weeks after their first infliximab infusion and in 12 control patients, using Affymetrix arrays. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm microarray data. The dysregulation of many AMPs in colonic IBD in comparison with control colons was widely restored by infliximab therapy, and only DEFB1 expression remained significantly decreased after therapy in the colonic mucosa of IBD responders to infliximab. In ileal Crohn's disease (CD), expression of two neuropeptides with antimicrobial activity, PYY and CHGB, was significantly decreased before therapy compared to control ileums, and ileal PYY expression remained significantly decreased after therapy in CD responders. Expression of the downregulated AMPs before and after treatment (DEFB1 and PYY) correlated with villin 1 expression, a gut epithelial cell marker, indicating that the decrease is a consequence of epithelial damage.Our study shows that the dysregulation of AMPs in IBD mucosa is the consequence of inflammation, but may be responsible for perpetuation of inflammation due to ineffective clearance of microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2095038217,"Recent 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) molecular profiling of the stomach mucosa revealed a surprising complexity of microbiota. Helicobacter pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use are two main contributors to gastritis and peptic ulcer. However, little is known about the association between other members of the stomach microbiota and gastric diseases. In this study, cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA was used to profile the stomach microbiota from normal and gastritis patients. One hundred and thirty three phylotypes from eight bacterial phyla were identified. The stomach microbiota was found to be closely adhered to the mucosa. Eleven Streptococcus phylotypes were successfully cultivated from the biopsies. One to two genera represented a majority of clones within any of the identified phyla. We further developed two real-time quantitative PCR assays to quantify the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and the Streptococcus genus. Significantly higher abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and the Streptococcus genus within the Firmicutes phylum was observed in patients with antral gastritis, compared with normal controls. This study suggests that the genus taxon level can largely represent much higher taxa such as the phylum. The clinical relevance and the mechanism underlying the altered microbiota composition in gastritis require further functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2036126384,"C. albicans triggers recurrent infections of the alimentary tract mucosa that result from biofilm growth. Although the ability of C. albicans to form a biofilm on abiotic surfaces has been well documented in recent years, no information exists on biofilms that form directly on mucosal surfaces. The objectives of this study were to characterize the structure and composition of Candida biofilms forming on the oral mucosa. We found that oral Candida biofilms consist of yeast, hyphae, and commensal bacteria, with keratin dispersed in the intercellular spaces. Neutrophils migrate through the oral mucosa and form nests within the biofilm mass. The cell wall polysaccharide β-glucan is exposed during mucosal biofilm growth and is more uniformly present on the surface of biofilm organisms invading the oral mucosa. We conclude that C. albicans forms complex mucosal biofilms consisting of both commensal bacterial flora and host components. These discoveries are important since they can prompt a shift of focus for current research in investigating the role of Candida-bacterial interactions in the pathogenesis of mucosal infections as well as the role of β-glucan mediated signaling in the host response."
https://openalex.org/W1964908460,"Background The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores for Unstable Angina/Non-ST–elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores for in-hospital and 6-month mortality are established tools for assessing risk in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients. The objective of our study was to compare the discriminative abilities of the TIMI and GRACE risk scores in a broad-spectrum, unselected ACS population and to assess the relative contributions of model simplicity and model composition to any observed differences between the two scoring systems. Methodology/Principal Findings ACS patients admitted to the University of Michigan between 1999 and 2005 were divided into UA/NSTEMI (n = 2753) and STEMI (n = 698) subpopulations. The predictive abilities of the TIMI and GRACE scores for in-hospital and 6-month mortality were assessed by calibration and discrimination. There were 137 in-hospital deaths (4%), and among the survivors, 234 (7.4%) died by 6 months post-discharge. In the UA/NSTEMI population, the GRACE risk scores demonstrated better discrimination than the TIMI UA/NSTEMI score for in-hospital (C = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.81–0.89, versus 0.54, 95% CI: 0.48–0.60; p<0.01) and 6-month (C = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.76–0.83, versus 0.56, 95% CI: 0.52–0.60; p<0.01) mortality. Among STEMI patients, the GRACE and TIMI STEMI scores demonstrated comparably excellent discrimination for in-hospital (C = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78–0.90 versus 0.83, 95% CI: 0.78–0.89; p = 0.83) and 6-month (C = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63–0.81, versus 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64–0.79; p = 0.79) mortality. An analysis of refitted multivariate models demonstrated a marked improvement in the discriminative power of the TIMI UA/NSTEMI model with the incorporation of heart failure and hemodynamic variables. Study limitations included unaccounted for confounders inherent to observational, single institution studies with moderate sample sizes. Conclusions/Significance The GRACE scores provided superior discrimination as compared with the TIMI UA/NSTEMI score in predicting in-hospital and 6-month mortality in UA/NSTEMI patients, although the GRACE and TIMI STEMI scores performed equally well in STEMI patients. The observed discriminative deficit of the TIMI UA/NSTEMI score likely results from the omission of key risk factors rather than from the relative simplicity of the scoring system."
https://openalex.org/W2121217846,"Background Postulating that serotonin (5-HT), released from smoking-activated platelets could be involved in smoking-induced vascular modifications, we studied its catabolism in a series of 115 men distributed as current smokers (S), never smokers (NS) and former smokers (FS) who had stopped smoking for a mean of 13 years. Methodology/Principal Findings 5-HT, monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) activities and amounts were measured in platelets, and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA)—the 5-HT/MAO catabolite—in plasma samples. Both platelet 5-HT and plasma 5-HIAA levels were correlated with the 10-year cardiovascular Framingham relative risk (P<0.01), but these correlations became non-significant after adjustment for smoking status, underlining that the determining risk factor among those taken into account in the Framingham risk calculation was smoking. Surprisingly, the platelet 5-HT content was similar in S and NS but lower in FS with a parallel higher plasma level of 5-HIAA in FS. This was unforeseen since MAO-B activity was inhibited during smoking (P<0.00001). It was, however, consistent with a higher enzyme protein concentration found in S and FS than in NS (P<0.001). It thus appears that MAO inhibition during smoking was compensated by a higher synthesis. To investigate the persistent increase in MAO-B protein concentration, a study of the methylation of its gene promoter was undertaken in a small supplementary cohort of similar subjects. We found that the methylation frequency of the MAOB gene promoter was markedly lower (P<0.0001) for S and FS vs. NS due to cigarette smoke-induced increase of nucleic acid demethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance This is one of the first reports that smoking induces an epigenetic modification. A better understanding of the epigenome may help to further elucidate the physiopathology and the development of new therapeutic approaches to tobacco addiction. The results could have a larger impact than cardiovascular damage, considering that MAO-dependent 5-HT catabolism is also involved in addiction, predisposition to cancer, behaviour and mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2155298520,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) of cervids is a prion disease distinguished by high levels of transmissibility, wherein bodily fluids and excretions are thought to play an important role. Using cervid bioassay and established CWD detection methods, we have previously identified infectious prions in saliva and blood but not urine or feces of CWD+ donors. More recently, we identified very low concentrations of CWD prions in urine of deer by cervid PrP transgenic (Tg[CerPrP]) mouse bioassay and serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA). This finding led us to examine further our initial cervid bioassay experiments using sPMCA.We sought to investigate whether conventional test-negative deer, previously exposed orally to urine and feces from CWD+ sources, may be harboring low level CWD infection not evident in the 19 month observation period. We further attempted to determine the peripheral PrP(CWD) distribution in these animals.Various neural and lymphoid tissues from conventional test-negative deer were reanalyzed for CWD prions by sPMCA and cervid transgenic mouse bioassay in parallel with appropriate tissue-matched positive and negative controls.PrP(CWD) was detected in the tissues of orally exposed deer by both sPMCA and Tg[CerPrP] mouse bioassay; each assay revealed very low levels of CWD prions previously undetectable by western blot, ELISA, or IHC. Serial PMCA analysis of individual tissues identified that obex alone was positive in 4 of 5 urine/feces exposed deer. PrP(CWD) was amplified from both lymphoid and neural tissues of positive control deer but not from identical tissues of negative control deer.Detection of subclinical infection in deer orally exposed to urine and feces (1) suggests that a prolonged subclinical state can exist, necessitating observation periods in excess of two years to detect CWD infection, and (2) illustrates the sensitive and specific application of sPMCA in the diagnosis of low-level prion infection. Based on these results, it is possible that low doses of prions, e.g. following oral exposure to urine and saliva of CWD-infected deer, bypass significant amplification in the LRS, perhaps utilizing a neural conduit between the alimentary tract and CNS, as has been demonstrated in some other prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1965151472,"Background Exposure to energy restriction during childhood and adolescence is associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Epigenetic dysregulation during this critical period of growth and development may be a mechanism to explain such observations. Within the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer, we investigated the association between early life energy restriction and risk of subsequent CRC characterized by the (promoter) CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP). Methodology/Principal Findings Information on diet and risk factors was collected by baseline questionnaire (n = 120,856). Three indicators of exposure were assessed: place of residence during the Hunger Winter (1944–45) and World War II years (1940–44), and father's employment status during the Economic Depression (1932–40). Methylation specific PCR (MSP) on DNA from paraffin embedded tumor tissue was performed to determine CIMP status according to the Weisenberger markers. After 7.3 years of follow-up, 603 cases and 4631 sub-cohort members were available for analysis. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for CIMP+ (27.7%) and CIMP- (72.3%) tumors according to the three time periods of energy restriction, adjusted for age and gender. Individuals exposed to severe famine during the Hunger Winter had a decreased risk of developing a tumor characterized by CIMP compared to those not exposed (HR 0.65, 95%CI: 0.45–0.92). Further categorizing individuals by an index of ‘0–1’ ‘2–3’ or ‘4–7’ genes methylated in the promoter region suggested that exposure to the Hunger Winter was associated with the degree of promoter hypermethylation (‘0–1 genes methylated’ HR = 1.01, 95%CI:0.74–1.37; ‘2–3 genes methylated’ HR = 0.83, 95% CI:0.61–1.15; ‘4–7 genes methylated’ HR = 0.72, 95% CI:0.49–1.04). No associations were observed with respect to the Economic Depression and WWII years. Conclusions This is the first study indicating that exposure to a severe, transient environmental condition during adolescence and young adulthood may result in persistent epigenetic changes that later influence CRC development."
https://openalex.org/W1969615032,"Neurofibrillary tangles, principally composed of bundles of filaments formed by the microtubule-associated protein Tau, are a hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Polyanionic cofactors such as heparin can induce Tau filament formation in vitro. Here we quantitatively characterize the interaction between recombinant human Tau fragment Tau(244-372) and heparin (average molecular mass = 7 kDa) as well as heparin-induced fibril formation by using static light scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, turbidity assays, and transmission electron microscopy. Our data clearly show that at physiological pH, heparin 7K, and human Tau(244-372) form a tight 1:1 complex with an equilibrium association constant exceeding 10(6) m(-1) under reducing conditions, triggering Tau fibrillization. In the absence of dithiothreitol, heparin shows a moderate binding affinity (10(5) m(-1)) to Tau(244-372), similarly triggering Tau fibrillization. Further fibrillization kinetics analyses show that the lag time appears to be approximately invariant up to a molar ratio of 2:1 and then increases at larger ratios of heparin/Tau. The maximum slope representing the apparent rate constant for fibril growth increases sharply with substoichiometric ratios of heparin/Tau and then decreases to some extent with ratios of >1:1. The retarding effect of heparin in excess is attributed to the large increase in ionic strength of the medium arising from free heparin. Together, these results suggest that the formation of the 1:1 complex of Tau monomer and heparin plays an important role in the inducer-mediated Tau filament formation, providing clues to understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1977822330,"Background Claudins are membrane proteins that play critical roles in tight junction (TJ) formation and function. Members of the claudin gene family have been demonstrated to be aberrantly regulated, and to participate in the pathogenesis of various human cancers. In the present study, we report that claudin-11 (CLDN11) is silenced in gastric cancer via hypermethylation of its promoter region. Methodology/Principal Findings Levels of CLDN11 methylation and mRNA expression were measured in primary gastric cancer tissues, noncancerous gastric mucosae, and cell lines of gastric origin using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. Analyses of paired gastric cancers and adjacent normal gastric tissues revealed hypermethylation of the CLDN11 promoter region in gastric cancers, and this hypermethylation was significantly correlated with downregulation of CLDN11 expression vs. normal tissues. The CLDN11 promoter region was also hypermethylated in all gastric cancer cell lines tested relative to immortalized normal gastric epithelial cells. Moreover, CLDN11 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with its methylation level. Treatment of CLDN11-nonexpressing gastric cancer cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine restored CLDN11 expression. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CLDN11 expression in normal gastric epithelial cells increased their motility and invasiveness. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that hypermethylation of CLDN11, leading to downregulated expression, contributes to gastric carcinogenesis by increasing cellular motility and invasiveness. A further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the role of claudin proteins in gastric carcinogenesis will likely help in the identification of novel approaches for diagnosis and therapy of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2040911489,"The amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) reverses dopamine and serotonin transporters to produce efflux of dopamine and serotonin, respectively, in regions of the brain that have been implicated in reward. However, the role of serotonin/dopamine interactions in the behavioral effects of MDMA remains unclear. We previously showed that MDMA-induced locomotion, serotonin and dopamine release are 5-HT2B receptor-dependent. The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of serotonin and 5-HT2B receptors to the reinforcing properties of MDMA. We show here that 5-HT2B−/− mice do not exhibit behavioral sensitization or conditioned place preference following MDMA (10 mg/kg) injections. In addition, MDMA-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference after extinction and locomotor sensitization development are each abolished by a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist (RS127445) in wild type mice. Accordingly, MDMA-induced dopamine D1 receptor-dependent phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase in nucleus accumbens is abolished in mice lacking functional 5-HT2B receptors. Nevertheless, high doses (30 mg/kg) of MDMA induce dopamine-dependent but serotonin and 5-HT2B receptor-independent behavioral effects. These results underpin the importance of 5-HT2B receptors in the reinforcing properties of MDMA and illustrate the importance of dose-dependent effects of MDMA on serotonin/dopamine interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2057392038,"Transforming growth factor-beta (Tgf-beta) signaling is crucial for regulating craniofacial development. Loss of Tgf-beta signaling results in defects in cranial neural crest cells (CNCC), but the mechanism by which Tgf-beta signaling regulates bone formation in CNCC-derived osteogenic cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we discovered that Tgf-beta regulates the basal transcriptional regulatory machinery to control intramembranous bone development. Specifically, basal transcription factor Taf4b is down-regulated in the CNCC-derived intramembranous bone in Tgfbr2(fl/fl);Wnt1-Cre mice. Tgf-beta specifically induces Taf4b expression. Moreover, small interfering RNA knockdown of Taf4b results in decreased cell proliferation and altered osteogenic differentiation in primary mouse embryonic maxillary mesenchymal cells, as seen in Tgfbr2 mutant cells. In addition, we show that Taf1 is decreased at the osteogenic initiation stage in the maxilla of Tgfbr2 mutant mice. Furthermore, small interfering RNA knockdown of Taf4b and Taf1 together in primary mouse embryonic maxillary mesenchymal cells results in up-regulated osteogenic initiator Runx2 expression, with decreased cell proliferation and altered osteogenic differentiation. Our results indicate a critical function of Tgf-beta-mediated basal transcriptional factors in regulating osteogenic cell proliferation and differentiation in CNCC-derived osteoprogenitor cells during intramembranous bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2116849165,"Cystatin C is believed to prevent tumor progression by inhibiting the activities of a family of lysosomal cysteine proteases. However, little is known about the precise mechanism of cystatin C function in prostate cancer. In the present study, we examined the expression of cystatin C and its association with matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and androgen receptor (AR) in a tissue microarray comparing benign and malignant specimens from 448 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. Cystatin C expression was significantly lower in cancer specimens than in benign tissues (p<0.001) and there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between expression of cystatin C and MMP2 (r(s) (2) = -0.056, p = 0.05). There was a clear trend that patients with decreased level of cystatin C had lower overall survival. Targeted inhibition of cystatin C using specific siRNA resulted in an increased invasiveness of PC3 cells, whereas induction of cystatin C overexpression greatly reduced invasion rate of PC3 in vitro. The effect of cystatin C on modulating the PC3 cell invasion was provoked by Erk2 inhibitor that specifically inhibited MAPK/Erk2 activity. This suggests that cystatin C may mediate tumor cell invasion by modulating the activity of MAPK/Erk cascades. Consistent with our immunohistochemical findings that patients with low expression of cystatin C and high expression of androgen receptor (AR) tend to have worse overall survival than patients with high expression of cystatin C and high AR expression, induced overexpression of AR in PC3 cells expressing cystatin C siRNA greatly enhanced the invasiveness of PC3 cells. This suggests that there may be a crosstalk between cystatin C and AR-mediated pathways. Our study uncovers a novel role for cystatin C and its associated cellular pathways in prostate cancer invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1969596581,"Background CD25, a component of the IL-2 receptor, is important in T cell proliferation, activation induced cell death, as well as the actions of both regulatory (Treg) and effector (Teff) T cells. Recent genome wide association studies have implicated the CD25 locus as an important region for genetic susceptibility to a number of autoimmune disorders, with serum levels of soluble CD25 receptor (sCD25) serving as a potential phenotypic marker for this association. However, the functional impact of CD25 cleavage, as well as the influence of sCD25 on immunoregulatory activities, remain largely unknown and form the basis of this effort. Methodology/Principal Findings The generation of sCD25 by Treg (CD4+CD25+) and Teff (CD4+CD25−) cells was examined during in vitro suppression assays, efforts that demonstrated constitutive and stable surface CD25 expression on Treg throughout the period of in vitro assessment. In contrast, Teff cells increased CD25 expression during the process of in vitro suppression, with supernatant sCD25 levels correlating to the amount of cellular proliferation. Interestingly, under serum-free conditions, Tregs partially lost their characteristic anergic and suppressive properties. sCD25 supplementation at physiological concentrations to serum free in vitro suppression assays reduced Teff proliferation without specifically influencing suppression. Indeed, sCD25 production within these cultures correlated with cell death. Conclusions/Significance These results support the notion that sCD25 functions as both a surrogate marker of T cell activation as well as an indicator of subsequent cellular death. In addition, the role of CD25 in immunomodulation is likely dependent on the local inflammatory milieu, with molecules capable of modulating surface CD25 expression playing a key role in defining immune responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2028172130,"Background Plant viruses such as Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) are increasingly being developed for applications in nanobiotechnology including vaccine development because of their potential for producing large quantities of antigenic material in plant hosts. In order to improve efficacy of viral nanoparticles in these types of roles, an investigation of the individual cell types that interact with the particles is critical. In particular, it is important to understand the interactions of a potential vaccine with antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the immune system. CPMV was previously shown to interact with vimentin displayed on cell surfaces to mediate cell entry, but the expression of surface vimentin on APCs has not been characterized. Methodology The binding and internalization of CPMV by several populations of APCs was investigated both in vitro and in vivo by flow cytometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The association of the particles with mouse gastrointestinal epithelium and Peyer's patches was also examined by confocal microscopy. The expression of surface vimentin on APCs was also measured. Conclusions We found that CPMV is bound and internalized by subsets of several populations of APCs both in vitro and in vivo following intravenous, intraperitoneal, and oral administration, and also by cells isolated from the Peyer's patch following gastrointestinal delivery. Surface vimentin was also expressed on APC populations that could internalize CPMV. These experiments demonstrate that APCs capture CPMV particles in vivo, and that further tuning the interaction with surface vimentin may facilitate increased uptake by APCs and priming of antibody responses. These studies also indicate that CPMV particles likely access the systemic circulation following oral delivery via the Peyer's patch."

Assembly of the heavy chain, light chain, and peptide components of MHC class I molecules occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Specific assembly factors and generic ER chaperones, collectively called the MHC class I peptide loading complex (PLC), are required for MHC class I assembly. Calreticulin has an important role within the PLC and induces MHC class I cell surface expression, but the interactions and mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. We show that interactions with the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 and substrate glycans are important for the recruitment of calreticulin into the PLC and for its functional activities in MHC class I assembly. The glycan and ERp57 binding sites of calreticulin contribute directly or indirectly to complexes between calreticulin and the MHC class I assembly factor tapasin and are important for maintaining steady-state levels of both tapasin and MHC class I heavy chains. A number of destabilizing conditions and mutations induce generic polypeptide binding sites on calreticulin and contribute to calreticulin-mediated suppression of misfolded protein aggregation in vitro. We show that generic polypeptide binding sites per se are insufficient for stable recruitment of calreticulin to PLC substrates in cells.

Calreticulin binds to monoglucoslyated N-linked oligosaccharides on newly synthesized glycoproteins and maintains quality control of glycoprotein folding in the ER. A structural model for calreticulin was derived (supplemental Fig. S1A), using the crystal structure of the closely related protein, calnexin (2Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M.

The first is a large globular domain comprising the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein that form a β-stranded sandwich and a C-terminal helix (supplemental Fig. S1A, orange, light blue, and green). The glycan binding site is located within this domain (supplemental Fig. S1B). A second hook-shaped P-domain forms a β-stranded hairpin structure inserted in the middle of the globular domain (supplemental Fig. S1A, dark blue). The tip of this domain forms a binding site for ERp57 (3Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These conditions also induce calreticulin oligomerization (6Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V.

Much remains to be understood about the one or more binding sites on calreticulin that are used to suppress substrate aggregation, as well as the relevance of this activity to calreticulin-mediated protein folding under physiological non-stress conditions. Calreticulin is a key player in the MHC class I assembly pathway (8Gao B. Adhikari R. Howarth M. Nakamura K. Gold M.C. Hill A.B. Knee R. Michalak M. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The MHC class I-dedicated assembly factors, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and tapasin, as well as the generic ER-folding factors ERp57 and calreticulin, form a large complex with MHC class I molecules, collectively called the PLC. TAP provides a major source of peptides for MHC class I molecules, whereas tapasin, ERp57, and calreticulin facilitate assembly of MHC class I molecules with peptides (reviewed in Ref. 9Raghavan M. Del Cid N. Rizvi S.M. Peters L.R. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Calreticulin is a component of the PLC, and calreticulin-deficient cells express reduced cell surface MHC class I molecules (8Gao B. Adhikari R. Howarth M. Nakamura K. Gold M.C. Hill A.B. Knee R. Michalak M. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which calreticulin contributes to enhanced MHC class I assembly are not well understood. Early studies with glycosylation inhibitors, MHC class I mutants, and in vitro binding analyses suggested that glycan-based interactions with MHC class I molecules recruit calreticulin into the PLC (10Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 11Harris M.R. Yu Y.Y. Kindle C.S. Hansen T.H. Solheim J.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25112-25121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recent studies with calreticulin mutants that are defective for glycan or ERp57 binding have suggested that calreticulin can be recruited into the PLC in the absence of interactions with both ERp57 and substrate glycans and that polypeptide-based interactions are important for calreticulin recruitment (13Ireland B.S. Brockmeier U. Howe C.M. Elliott T. Williams D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Y. Kozlov G. Pocanschi C.L. Brockmeier U. Ireland B.S. Maattanen P. Howe C. Elliott T. Gehring K. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10160-10173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, partial truncation of the P domain of calreticulin (including residues mediating ERp57 binding) impacted calreticulin recruitment to the PLC (14Zhang Y. Kozlov G. Pocanschi C.L. Brockmeier U. Ireland B.S. Maattanen P. Howe C. Elliott T. Gehring K. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10160-10173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and ERp57- and tapasin-deficient cells have impaired recruitment of calreticulin into the PLC (15Garbi N. Tanaka S. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L. Immunity. 2000; 13: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, although MHC class I molecules are one of the best characterized substrates of calreticulin, the precise mechanism by which calreticulin is recruited into the PLC remains unclear. Furthermore, whereas numerous studies involving glycosylation inhibitors and substrates lacking glycans have shown that the presence of monoglucosylated glycans on substrate glycoproteins are important for calreticulin binding and ER quality control, whether or not substrate glycans alone are sufficient for calreticulin recruitment is not well understood, and neither is the molecular basis for differences in substrate profiles between calnexin and calreticulin. Additionally the roles of ERp57, polypeptide-based, and other interactions in substrate recruitment to calreticulin have not been well studied. To address some of these questions, various truncation mutants targeting different domains of calreticulin and point mutants targeting glycan and ERp57 binding residues were generated. These constructs were used to understand the impacts of truncations and mutations on calreticulin structure and stability, to investigate modes of calreticulin binding to PLC components, and to examine reconstitution of MHC class I assembly in calreticulin-deficient cells. Truncation mutants of mouse calreticulin (mCRT) were amplified from the pCMV-SPORT6 (ATCC, MGC-6209) vector using primers that allowed for subsequent ligation-independent cloning (LIC) into the pMCSG7 vector (17Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide primers were used to terminate CRT at the indicated C-terminal amino acid positions: 399, 5′-TTA TCC ACT TCC AAT GTT ACA GCT CAT CCT TGG CTT-3′; 362, 5′-TTA TCC ACT TCC AAT GTT ATT CCT CTT TAC GCT TCT TGT-3′; 339, 5′-TTA TCC ACT TCC AAT GTT ACT GCT TCT CGG CAG CCT TGG TTA CAC CCC-3′; and 318, 5′-TTA TCC ACT TCC AAT GTT AAT CAT TAG TGA TGA GGA AAT TGT C-3′. The following oligonucleotide primers were used to generate constructs at the N-terminal start sites: 1, 5′-TAC TTC CAA TCC AAT GCT GCC GCA GAC CCT GCC ATC-3′; and 33, 5′-TAC TTC CAA TCC AAT GCT GTC CTC AGT TCT GGC AAG TTT TAC GGG-3′. Underlined bases represent those that are complementary to the sequence encoding mCRT, and additional 5′ sequences were introduced for LIC. Deletion of the P domain amino acids 187–283 and insertion of two glycine residues (mCRT(ΔP)) was achieved with the Finnzymes Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs). The following primers were used to generate mCRT(ΔP): forward, 5′-GGA CCC GAT GCA AAT ATC TAT GCC TAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCC CAG AAA GTC CCA ATC ATC CTC CAA-3′. DNA constructs were sequenced and transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. All bacterially expressed mCRT constructs lacked the signal sequence and contained an N-terminal MHHHHHHSSGVDLGTENLYFQSNA fusion sequence for nickel affinity chromatography. mCRT mutants were cloned into pMSCV-ires-GFP and pMSCV-puro retroviral vectors. pMSCV-puro constructs were created by ligation-dependent cloning, and LIC was used to generate pMSCV-ires-GFP vectors. The mCRT templates used were the corresponding mCRT in the pMSCV-ires-GFP vector (for ΔC × pMSCV-puro) or pCMV-SPORT6 (all other constructs). All constructs retained the mCRT signal sequence and KDEL ER retention motifs. The plasmid pMCSV-ires-GFP (18Van Parijs L. Refaeli Y. Lord J.D. Nelson B.H. Abbas A.K. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 11 (retracted in Immunity (2009) 30, 611): 281-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) was used as the parent vector for construction of a LIC-competent variant. This was accomplished by inserting a unique sequence with a PmeI restriction site. LIC overhangs were then generated by treatment of the linearized vector with T4 DNA polymerase exonuclease activity. The inserted sequence was constructed by annealing two oligonucleotides to generate a fragment with overhangs complimentary to an EcoRI restriction site. The oligonucleotide sequences used were 5′-AATTAGAGAGTTTAAACTTCCAC-3′ and 5′-AATTGTGGAAGTTTAAACTCTCT-3′. The lyophilized oligonucleotides were resuspended in distilled water at a concentration of 20 μm. Prior to annealing these were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The 20-μl reactions contained 2 μl of 10 mm ATP, 12.5 μl of 20 μm oligonucleotide, 2 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 1 μl of enzyme, and 2.5 μl of distilled water. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C then shifted to 95 °C for an additional 10 min. The two oligonucleotide reactions were then mixed together at 95 °C and slow cooled to 37 °C. A 2.5-μl aliquot was then added to a 20-μl ligation reaction composed of 1 μl of 45 ng/μl EcoRI-cut pMCSV-ires-GFP, previously treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, 2 μl of 10× reaction buffer, and 13.5 μl of distilled water. The reaction was slow cooled from 37 °C to 16 °C, and 1 μl of 1 unit/μl of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) was added. Incubation was continued at 16 °C for ∼16 h. A 2-μl aliquot of the ligation reaction was used to transform 20 μl of competent XL1-Blue cells. These were plated on Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar with ampicillin (Amp) selection and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colonies were picked and grown in 5 ml of LB-Amp, and plasmid DNA was isolated using Qiagen minispin columns. Positive clones were identified by restriction digestion with PmeI and ClaI and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The following primers were used: forward, 5′-GAA TTA GAG AGT TTC ACC ATG CTC CTT TCG GTG CCG CTC CTG CTT GGC-3′, reverse for WT and ΔP: 5′-GG AAT TGT GGA AGT TTC TTA CAG CTC ATC CTT GGC TTG GCC AGG GGA TTC-3′, and reverse for ΔC, 5′-GG AAT TGT GGA AGT TTC TTA CAG CTC ATC CTT CG CTT CTC TGC AGC CTT GGT A-3′. LIC was performed to introduce mCRT sequences into the pMCSG7 and pMSCV-ires-GFP vectors. Overhangs of 15 bp were generated in the insert DNA by processing 0.2 pmol of the PCR product with 0.5 unit of LIC-qualified T4 DNA polymerase (Novagen) in the presence of 4 mm dCTP (for ligation with pMCSG7) or 4 mm dGTP (for ligation with pMSCV-ires-GFP) and 5 mm dithiothreitol, at 20-μl final reaction volume. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C followed by 20 min at 75 °C. The pMCSG7 or pMSCV-ires-GFP vectors were linearized by restriction digestion with SspI (for pMCSG7) or PmeI (for pMSCV-ires-GFP) (New England Biolabs) at a concentration of 5 units/μg of DNA at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The protein was removed using a Qiagen PCR minispin kit. Linearized vector DNA was then processed by T4 DNA polymerase to yield single-stranded ends for annealing. Reactions, 60-μl total, were set up with 1.6–2.0 μg of linear DNA and 3.75 units of LIC-qualified T4 polymerase (Novagen) in the presence of 4 mm dGTP (for pMCSG7) or 4 mm dCTP (for pMSCV-ires-GFP) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were mixed on ice and incubated as described above for inserts. Insert and vector DNA were annealed in 96-well plates by combining 1 μl of processed vector and 2 μl of processed insert per well, followed by incubation in a PCR machine at 22 °C for 15 min with addition of 1 μl of 25 mm EDTA after 10 min of incubation. Annealed DNA was used to transform competent XL1-Blue cells. Positive clones were identified by PCR analysis. DNA sequences were verified at the University of Michigan DNA sequencing core. Purified plasmid DNA from positive clones was used to transform competent Rosetta cells (Novagen) or BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. The following primers were used to clone untagged mCRT into the pMSCV-puro vector: forward, 5′-GA CTC G AG ATG CTC CTT TCG GTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GA GTT AAC CTA CAG CTC ATC CTT-3′, which introduce 5′ XhoI and 3′ HpaI restriction sites. A FLAG-tagged CRT containing a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag was also generated in pMSCV-puro. The following primers were used: forward, 5′-GA CTC GAG ATG CTC CTT TCG GTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GA GTT AAC CTA CAG CTC ATC CTT CTT ATC ATC GTC ATC CTT ATA ATC GGC TTG GCC AGG GGA TTC TTC-3′. Underlined bases represent those that are complementary to the sequence encoding mCRT, with additional 5′ sequences added to insert an XhoI restriction site upstream of the protein sequence, and a FLAG epitope tag inserted before the KDEL ER retention motif, and finally an HpaI restriction site downstream of the protein sequence. Following amplifications from appropriate templates, PCR products were digested with XhoI and HpaI (New England Biolabs). PCR reactions were cleaned using MinElute 96 UF PCR purification kits by Qiagen. The digested products were ligated into the pMSCV-puro vector digested with the same enzymes. Both mCRT retroviral constructs retained the mCRT signal sequence and KDEL ER retention motif. mCRT(W244A) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of mCRT(WT) in pMSCV-puro (Finnzymes Phusion, New England Biolabs). mCRT(Y92A) and mCRT(Y92A/W244A) were obtained by site-directed ligation-independent mutagenesis (19Chiu J. March P.E. Lee R. Tillett D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) of mCRT(WT) and mCRT(W244A) constructs in pMSCV-puro. mCRT(W302A) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of mCRT in pCMV-SPORT6 (QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). mCRT(W302A) in pMSCV-puro was subsequently cloned using a 3′ primer that introduced a FLAG epitope tag as described above. A corresponding FLAG-tagged mCRT(WT) was also generated. mCRT(Y92A), mCRT(W244A), mCRT(Y92A/W244A), and mCRT(W302A) were inserted into pMCSG7 from pMSCV-puro or pCMV-SPORT6 templates by LIC using the primers for an N-terminal start site at residue 1, and C-terminal end site at residue 399. Procedures for site-directed ligation-independent mutagenesis were similar to those described in Ref. 19Chiu J. March P.E. Lee R. Tillett D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar. To create Y92A, full-length mCRT in the retroviral vector pMSCV-puro was used as a template for the following primers in two separate PCR reactions to create DNA fragments with complementary 5′ overhangs, which are underlined: forward tailed, 5′-GGG GGC GGC GCC GTG AAG CTG TTT CCG AGT GGC TTG-3′; reverse short, 5′-ACA GTC GAT ATT CTG CTC ATG CTT CAC CG-3′; reverse tailed, 5′-CTT CAC GGC GCC GCC CCC ACA GTC GAT ATT CTG CTC-3′; and forward short, 5′-CTG TTT CCG AGT GGC TTG GAC CAG AAG-3′. The PCR products were then incubated with DpnI (New England Biolabs) to digest template DNA, and this reaction was quenched with the addition of the following 2× site-directed ligation-independent mutagenesis buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA. The two products were then mixed and incubated for two cycles of 65 °C for 5 min and 30 °C for 15 min to hybridize the two fragments, and the product was transformed into competent XLI-Blue cells. Positive clones were identified through sequencing performed by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. The Y92A/W244A mutant was created with the same method as Y92A, except that the original template used was full-length mCRT containing the W244A mutation in pMSCV-puro. The following primers were used to generate mCRT(W244A): forward, 5′-GCT GAA CCA CCA GTG ATT CAA AAT CCT GAA TAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTC TCC ATC CAT CTC TTC ATC CCA GTC CTC-3′. The following primers were used to generate mCRT(W302A): forward, 5′-G GGC CTA GAT CTC GCG CAG GTC AAG TCC GG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CC GGA CTT GAC CTG CGC GAG ATC TAG GCC C-3′. ERp57 was PCR-amplified from the pVL1392 vector (20Silvennoinen L. Myllyharju J. Ruoppolo M. Orrùu S. Caterino M. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13607-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using primers that introduced 5′ NcoI and 3′ XhoI sites and deleted the signal sequence. The vector pET33b, which allows for insertion of a C-terminal His tag, and ERp57 inserts were both prepared by XhoI and NcoI digestion and ligated (Invitrogen). The following primers were used: forward, 5′-A TCC ATG GCC TCC GAC GTG CTA GAA CTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AT CTC GAG GAG ATC CTC CTG TGC CTT C-3′. A listeriolysin O (LLO) W492A mutant LLO, which is described to have reduced cytotoxic activity (21Michel E. Reich K.A. Favier R. Berche P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), was used as a non-glycosylated calreticulin substrate. Wild-type LLO with a C-terminal histidine tag was mutated by PCR using the primer 5′-GCG AGA ACG GTA ATT GAT GAC C-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) to change Trp-492 to Ala. The PCR product was ligated into the pET29b plasmid (Novagen, WI), sequenced, transformed into BL21 (DE3, Novagen), and purified as described below. Glycerol stocks of BL21 (DE3) cells expressing the calreticulin constructs were inoculated into a 25-ml terrific broth culture (with 50 μg/ml ampicillin) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The starter culture was added to 1 liter of terrific broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C until cell density measured by A600 was 0.8–0.9. Cultures were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h before inducing calreticulin protein expression with 200 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cultures were incubated at room temperature for 16–20 h before harvesting cells by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris with 0.33 mg/ml lysozyme and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication. Subsequently, 10 μg/ml DNase, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 were added, and the cell lysis suspension was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cell debris was removed from samples by centrifugation, followed by vacuum filtration of the supernatant with a Steriflip having a 0.22-μm pore membrane (Millipore). The filtrate was then incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 10 mm imidazole in wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5). Murine calreticulin was eluted from beads with 75 and 100 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Protein was concentrated to 0.5–4.0 ml, by centrifugation using Centriplus centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) with molecular weight cut-offs of 10 or 30 kDa, and analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography. Purified concentrated calreticulin constructs were analyzed by gel filtration at 4 °C using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column or Highload 16/60 Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences). Buffer used was 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Following gel filtration, fractions corresponding to the various monomeric and oligomeric calreticulin species for each construct were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation using Centricon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) with molecular weight cut-offs of 10 or 30 kDa. Protein concentration was determined measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Extinction coefficients were calculated from the protein amino acid sequence using ProtParam (www.expasy.ch) and are as follows (units are in m−1 cm−1): mCRT1–399, 82,975; mCRT1–362, 82,975; mCRT1–339(ΔC), 82,975; mCRT1–318, 75,985; mCRT33–362, 70485; and mCRT(ΔP), 44,015. BL21 E. coli cells expressing LLO were inoculated into LB broth with 60 μg/ml kanamycin. Cell cultures were expanded to log phase (A600 = 0.8–0.9), induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16–20 h at room temperature, and the recombinant LLO was purified from bacterial lysates by nickel affinity chromatography. Buffers used throughout the purification procedure were pH 8.0 and contained 10% glycerol to minimize LLO aggregation. LLO was eluted from the nickel beads with 250 mm imidazole in wash buffer, and then stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Relative purity was consistently >95% by SDS-PAGE and SYPRO Red gel staining (Invitrogen). Prior to aggregation assays (described below), small aliquots of LLO were further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column. Buffer used was 50 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0. LLO concentration and extinction coefficient (77,240 m−1 cm−1) were calculated as described above for mCRT. LB broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with BL21 E. coli cells expressing His-tagged ERp57. Cell cultures were expanded to log phase, induced with 250 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. ERp57 was purified by resuspending bacterial pellets in lysis buffer containing: 50 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.7 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0. Cells were disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed from samples by centrifugation, followed by vacuum filtration of the supernatant with a Steriflip having a 0.22-μm pore membrane (Millipore). The filtrate was then incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). ERp57 was eluted from beads with 10 and 20 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Protein was concentrated to ∼6.5 ml, by centrifugation using Centriplus centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) with molecular weight cut-offs of 10 or 30 kDa, and further purified by Mono Q ion-exchange chromatography. A linear gradient from 150 mm to 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) was used to elute ERp57 from the column. The fractions of eluted protein containing ERp57 were dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, 150, mm NaCl (pH 7.4), concentrated, and stored at −80 °C after adding 10% glycerol. These analyses were undertaken as previously described (22Lo M.C. Aulabaugh A. Jin G. Cowling R. Bard J. Malamas M. Ellestad G. Anal.

Proteins (16 μm) were incubated in buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) and 1× Sypro Orange Stain (Invitrogen) diluted from a 5000× stock solution in the presence or absence of 48 μm Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Man-OH (G1M3, Alberta Research Council) in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Thermal scans were performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System using temperature increments of 1 °C starting at 25 °C. Within an experiment, each condition was analyzed in triplicate wells. Fluorescence emission was measured across different wavelength bins, and the bin with maximum fluorescence was chosen for further analysis. Fluorescence was normalized within wells as percent maximum fluorescence ((Fobs − Fmin)/(Fmax − Fmin)*100) and plotted against the sample temperature. CRT-ERp57 binding was assayed by surface plasmon resonance-based assays using a Biacore 2000 instrument, as previously described (24Martin V. Groenendyk J. Steiner S.S. Guo L. Dabrowska M.

Briefly, mCRT(WT) or mutants or the control protein bovine serum albumin were coupled to a Biacore CM5 chip (Amersham Biosciences) using amine-based coupling chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1986555327,"Computational methods for determining the function of genes in newly sequenced genomes have been traditionally based on sequence similarity to genes whose function has been identified experimentally. Function prediction methods can be extended using gene context analysis approaches such as examining the conservation of chromosomal gene clusters, gene fusion events and co-occurrence profiles across genomes. Context analysis is based on the observation that functionally related genes are often having similar gene context and relies on the identification of such events across phylogenetically diverse collection of genomes. We have used the data management system of the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) as the framework to implement and explore the power of gene context analysis methods because it provides one of the largest available genome integrations. Visualization and search tools to facilitate gene context analysis have been developed and applied across all publicly available archaeal and bacterial genomes in IMG. These computations are now maintained as part of IMG's regular genome content update cycle. IMG is available at: http://img.jgi.doe.gov."
https://openalex.org/W2016000163,"PERK eIF2alpha kinase is required for the proliferation of the insulin-secreting beta- cells as well as insulin synthesis and secretion. In addition, PERK signaling has been found to be an important factor in determining growth and angiogenesis of specific types of tumors, and was attributed to PERK-dependent regulation of the hypoxic stress response. In this report we examine the role of PERK in regulating proliferation and angiogenesis of transformed beta-cells in the development of insulinomas.The SV40 Large T-antigen (Tag) was genetically introduced into the insulin secreting beta-cells of Perk KO mice under the control of an inducible promoter. Tumor growth and the related parameters of cell proliferation were measured. In late stage insulinomas the degree of vascularity was determined.The formation and growth of insulinomas in Perk-deficient mice was dramatically ablated with much fewer tumors, which averaged 38-fold smaller than seen in wild-type control mice. Beta-cell proliferation was ablated in Perk-deficient mice associated with reduced tumor growth. In the small number of large encapsulated insulinomas that developed in Perk-deficient mice, we found a dramatic reduction in tumor vascularity compared to similar sized insulinomas in wild-type mice. Although insulinoma growth in Perk-deficient mice was largely impaired, beta-cell mass was increased sufficiently by T-antigen induction to rescue the hypoinsulinemia and diabetes in these mice.We conclude that PERK has two roles in the development of beta-cell insulinomas, first to support rapid cell proliferation during the initial transition to islet hyperplasia and later to promote angiogenesis during the progression to late-stage encapsulated tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2075241883,"A number of different interferon-gamma ELISpot protocols are in use in laboratories studying antigen-specific immune responses. It is therefore unclear how results from different assays compare, and what factors most significantly influence assay outcome. One such difference is that some laboratories use a short in vitro stimulation period of cells before they are transferred to the ELISpot plate; this is commonly done in the case of frozen cells, in order to enhance assay sensitivity. Other differences that may be significant include antibody coating of plates, the use of media with or without serum, the serum source and the number of cells added to the wells. The aim of this paper was to identify which components of the different ELISpot protocols influenced assay sensitivity and inter-laboratory variation. Four laboratories provided protocols for quantifying numbers of interferon-gamma spot forming cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived antigens. The differences in the protocols were compared directly. We found that several sources of variation in assay protocols can be eliminated, for example by avoiding serum supplementation and using AIM-V serum free medium. In addition, the number of cells added to ELISpot wells should also be standardised. Importantly, delays in peripheral blood mononuclear cell processing before stimulation had a marked effect on the number of detectable spot forming cells; processing delay thus should be minimised as well as standardised. Finally, a pre-stimulation culture period improved the sensitivity of the assay, however this effect may be both antigen and donor dependent. In conclusion, small differences in ELISpot protocols in routine use can affect the results obtained and care should be given to conditions selected for use in a given study. A pre-stimulation step may improve the sensitivity of the assay, particularly when cells have been previously frozen."
https://openalex.org/W2073548261,"Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a component of both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Mutations of SDHD, the first protein of intermediary metabolism shown to be involved in tumorigenesis, lead to the human tumors paraganglioma (PGL) and pheochromocytoma (PC). SDHD is remarkable in showing an 'imprinted' tumor suppressor phenotype. Mutations of SDHD show a very high penetrance in man and we postulated that knockout of Sdhd would lead to the development of PGL/PC, probably in aged mice.We generated a conventional knockout of Sdhd in the mouse, removing the entire third exon. We also crossed this mouse with a knockout of H19, a postulated imprinted modifier gene of Sdhd tumorigenesis, to evaluate if loss of these genes together would lead to the initiation or enhancement of tumor development. Homozygous knockout of Sdhd results in embryonic lethality. No paraganglioma or other tumor development was seen in Sdhd KO mice followed for their entire lifespan, in sharp contrast to the highly penetrant phenotype in humans. Heterozygous Sdhd KO mice did not show hyperplasia of paraganglioma-related tissues such as the carotid body or of the adrenal medulla, or any genotype-related pathology, with similar body and organ weights to wildtype mice. A cohort of Sdhd/H19 KO mice developed several cases of profound cardiac hypertrophy, but showed no evidence of PGL/PC.Knockout of Sdhd in the mouse does not result in a disease phenotype. H19 may not be an initiator of PGL/PC tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1989554430,"Background Mutation of Wnt signal antagonists Apc or Axin activates β-catenin signaling in many cancers including the majority of human colorectal adenocarcinomas. The phenotype of apc or axin mutation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is strikingly similar to that caused by mutation in the segment-polarity gene, naked cuticle (nkd). Nkd inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to the Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) family of scaffold proteins that link Wnt receptor activation to β-catenin accumulation and TCF-dependent transcription, but human NKD genes have yet to be directly implicated in cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings We identify for the first time mutations in NKD1 - one of two human nkd homologs - in a subset of DNA mismatch repair-deficient colorectal tumors that are not known to harbor mutations in other Wnt-pathway genes. The mutant Nkd1 proteins are defective at inhibiting Wnt signaling; in addition, the mutant Nkd1 proteins stabilize β-catenin and promote cell proliferation, in part due to a reduced ability of each mutant Nkd1 protein to bind and destabilize Dvl proteins. Conclusions/Significance Our data raise the hypothesis that specific NKD1 mutations promote Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis in a subset of DNA mismatch-repair-deficient colorectal adenocarcinomas and possibly other Wnt-signal driven human cancers."

As an anticoagulant, heparin enhances inhibition of thrombin by the serpin antithrombin III, but a similar cofactor role has not been previously investigated for proteases linked to metastasis. The squamous cell carcinoma antigens (serpins B3 and B4) are tumor-associated proteins that can inhibit papain-like cysteine proteases, including cathepsins L, K, and S. In this study, we show that SCCA-1 (B3) and SCCA-2 (B4) can bind heparin as demonstrated by affinity chromatography, native PAGE gel shifts, and intrinsic fluorescence quenching. Binding was specific for heparin and heparan sulfate but not other glycosaminoglycans. The presence of heparin accelerated inhibition of cathepsin L by both serpins, and in the case of SCCA-1, heparin increased the second order inhibition rate constant from 5.4 × 105 to >108, indicating a rate enhancement of at least 180-fold. A templating mechanism was shown, consistent with ternary complex formation. Furthermore, SCCA-1 inhibition of cathepsin L-like proteolytic activity secreted from breast and melanoma cancer cell lines was significantly enhanced by heparin. This is the first example of glycosaminoglycan enhancement of B-clade serpin activity and the first report of heparin acting as a cofactor in serpin cross-class inhibition of cysteine proteases.

Serpin B3 was originally isolated as squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), 2The abbreviations used are: SCCAsquamous cell carcinoma antigenrSCCArecombinant SCCAZ-FR-AMCN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. a tumor marker antigen associated with cervical cancer that has served as a diagnostic serum marker for squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix, head, neck, and lung (1Kato H.

SCCA is an atypical serpin in that it exhibits cross-class activity, inhibiting papain-like cysteine proteases (cathepsins L, K, and S) rather than serine proteases as targeted by most family members (3Takeda A.

SCCA-2 shows some overlap in inhibitory profile with SCCA-1, but it can inhibit the serine proteases cathepsin G and mast cell chymase and shows significantly weaker inhibition of cysteine proteases in comparison with SCCA-1 (7Schick C.

However, the implied prosurvival role in cancer has not been clearly established, and in contrast, SCCA-1 overexpression in head and neck squamous carcinoma cells significantly inhibits in vitro migration in Matrigel assays and in vivo growth and tumor invasion in nude mice (14Nakashima T.

Similarly, the depletion of SCCA-1 using an antisense approach results in increased invasive activity of SiHa cervical carcinoma cells (15Iwasaki M. Nishikawa A. Akutagawa N. Fujimoto T. Teramoto M. Sakaguchi Y. Kato H. Ito M. Yoshida K. Kudo R. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 lack a recognizable secretory signal sequence, and they appear to be predominantly cytoplasmic in the normal epithelium (16Uemura Y. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Tsu C. Schick C. Kamachi Y. Pomeroy S.L. Perlmutter D.H. Silverman G.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the antigens are routinely found extracellularly in the plasma of patients with various malignant and nonmalignant diseases (17Molina R. Filella X. Torres M.D. Ballesta A.M. Mengual P. Cases A. Balaque A. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, SCCA-1 can be secreted upon treatment of keratinocytes and HEK293 cells with interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, and this appears to be independent of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway (8Kanaji S. Tanaka Y. Sakata Y. Takeshita K. Arima K. Ohta S. Hansell E.J. Caffrey C. Mottram J.C. Lowther J. Donnelly S. Stack C. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. McKerrow J.H. Dalton J.P. Coombs G.H. Izuhara K. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4260-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This may implicate the immune system in triggering SCCA-1 secretion in the allergic response and perhaps also during malignancy. Extracellular mammalian targets have not yet been characterized, but it is known that cysteine cathepsins are also up-regulated in many cancers, including malignant melanoma, where secreted cathepsins contribute to the breakdown of the extracellular matrix during metastasis (18Joyce J.A.

Serpin inhibition of proteases proceeds via a well characterized conformational switch mechanism, resulting in a stable complex containing a distorted inactivated protease (20Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). For a number of serpins, this activity can be enhanced by the presence of cofactors, most notably the effects of glycosaminoglycans on plasma serpin inhibition. Other ligands can also modulate serpin activity, and Ong et al. (21Ong P.C. McGowan S. Pearce M.C. Irving J.A. Kan W.T. Grigoryev S.A. Turk B. Silverman G.A. Brix K. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C.

In this study, we initially investigated the possibility that SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 could bind glycosaminoglycans despite the fact that they possess an overall negative isoelectic point. Using a combination of solid phase and solution phase techniques, we found that these serpins bind heparin and heparan sulfate but not other glycosaminoglycans. Kinetic analysis showed that heparin significantly enhanced inhibition of the cysteine protease cathepsin L but had no effect on SCCA-2 inhibition of the serine protease cathepsin G. We also found that proteolysis of a cathepsin L substrate by extracellular fractions from MDA-MB-231 and WM793 cancer cell lines was more potently inhibited by SCCA-1 when in the presence of heparin. The full-length open reading frame cDNAs for SCCA-1, SCCA-2, and ovalbumin were previously cloned into the pRSETC expression vector (22Barnes R.C. Coulter J. Worrall D.M. Gynecol. Oncol. 2000; 78: 62-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with plasmid were grown in 50 ml of Overnight Express autoinducing medium (Merck) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 16 h at 37 °C, and this was used to inoculate 0.5–1 liters of Overnight Express medium. Following growth at 37 °C for 24 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 30 min and lysed using BugBuster lysis reagent (Merck). Soluble material was clarified by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by 0.22 μm filtration. The recombinant serpin was purified from this extract using a His·Bind purification kit (Merck), routinely yielding >5 mg of protein from 500 ml of culture. Heparin HiTrap 1-ml columns (GE Healthcare) were equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris and 20 mm NaCl, pH 6.9). 0.5 mg of recombinant SCCA (rSCCA)-1, rSCCA-2, recombinant ovalbumin, and antithrombin III in buffer A were applied, followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted using a stepwise NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in buffer A at 1.5 column volumes/fraction. 20 μg of rSCCA-1 or rSCCA-2 was added to 50 μl of a 50% slurry of heparin-agarose beads in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl in a final volume of 200 μl, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with buffer A to remove unbound protein. Heparin, heparan sulfate, acetyl heparin, de-N-sulfated heparin, or chondroitin sulfate A or B (all from Sigma) in buffer A (50 or 500 μg/ml) was added to the beads and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The tryptophan fluorescence of rSCCA-1 and rSCCA-2 was monitored in both the presence and absence of heparin to investigate if heparin binding induces a conformational change. 1 μm rSCCA was incubated with 1, 2, and 5 μm heparin in cathepsin assay buffer (200 mm sodium acetate, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Brij-35, pH 5.5) in a final volume of 600 μl. Using a Hitachi F4500 fluorometer, each sample was excited at 295 nm, and the emission was scanned over a wavelength range of 320–400 nm at a rate of 60 nm/min using excitation/emission slit widths of 10 nm. The buffer fluorescence spectra (with or without heparin) were subtracted from each sample. Each sample was scanned five times, and the mean of these values is displayed. For titration analysis, SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 (1 μm) in cathepsin assay buffer were titrated with heparin (0.5–10 μm), and fluorescence measurements (using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission wavelength of 340 nm) were recorded. The change in fluorescence (ΔF) divided by the initial fluorescence value (F0) was plotted against heparin concentration, and binding constants were estimated using nonlinear regression analysis. Biotin was covalently linked to rSCCA-1 or rSCCA-2 using Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-biotin; Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 0.5 mg of recombinant protein in phosphate-buffered saline was added to 250 μl of 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was dialyzed to remove any free biotinylation reagent. Both biotinylated and unmodified proteins were subjected to heparin affinity chromatography as described above, and eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The association constants for inhibition of cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) were determined using the discontinuous method at pH 5.5 in cathepsin assay buffer at room temperature with excitation/emission wavelengths of 370/460 nm (Hitachi F4500 fluorometer). For assays in the absence of heparin, the concentration of cathepsin L (Athens Research) was held at 10 nm, and the concentration of rSCCA-1 was at least 3-fold higher, ranging from 30 to 80 nm. In the presence of heparin, the enzyme concentration was lowered to 2.5 nm with rSCCA-1 concentrations of 7.5 nm. The unfractionated heparin concentration of 0.32 μg/ml used in these assays represents a concentration of ∼30 nm (taking an average molecular mass of 11,000) or 4-fold higher than the concentration of serpin. Following the addition of serpin (in the presence or absence of heparin), the residual cathepsin L activity was calculated at various time points in a final volume of 600 μl containing 40 μm N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-FR-AMC) in assay buffer. Substrate cleavage was measured for 2 min, and the natural logarithm of the residual activity was plotted against the time elapsed. Data were analyzed using linear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism software. The slope of this line represents the observed rate of inhibition (−kobs), and the association rate constant was determined from the slope of a plot of kobs versus inhibitor concentration. For cathepsin G assays, the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Calbiochem) was used, and residual activity was followed at 405 nm. The stoichiometry for cathepsin L inhibition by SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 was determined in the absence and presence of heparin. Briefly, 25 nm cathepsin L was incubated with a range of serpin concentrations (5–25 nm) with or without 50 nm heparin. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in cathepsin assay buffer, and fractional residual activity was plotted against the serpin/cathepsin L ratio ([I]0/[E]0). The stoichiometry of inhibition value was determined as the x intercept value, calculated by linear regression analysis using Prism. The cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (breast carcinoma) and WM793 (melanoma-derived) were grown in 100-mm dishes to 80–90% confluence, and conditioned media from these cells were collected. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and EDTA (1 mm) were added, and the cathepsin L-like activity was determined. Briefly, 50 μl of conditioned medium was incubated with SCCA-1 (200 nm), heparin (1 mg/ml), or both in combination for 30 min, in addition to a control buffer-only incubation. Subsequently, 50 μl of cathepsin assay buffer was added, and samples were assayed for cathepsin L-like activity over 10–20 min using the fluorogenic substrate Z-FR-AMC (40 μm). The sensitivity of activity to E-64 (10 μm) and resistance to CA-074 (10 μm) were determined to verify that activity was not due to cathepsin B. The control assay was taken as 100% activity. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Although many serpins are known to bind and be modulated by glycosaminoglycans, most notably heparin, this has not previously been investigated for SCCA-1 and SCCA-2. As members of the B-clade subfamily, they are generally regarded as intracellular proteins, but along with other members such as PAI-2 and ovalbumin, an extracellular presence is evident despite the lack of a classical secretion signal sequence (23Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We initially examined if the recombinant proteins could bind heparin using heparin-agarose affinity chromatography. Although both proteins are acidic overall, with a predicted and determined pI of <6.5 (20Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), we found that they bound relatively tightly to heparin-agarose at pH 6.9 (Fig. 1). Elution required 0.3 m NaCl for SCCA-2 and 0.4–0.5 m NaCl for SCCA-1. In comparison, a similarly tagged and purified recombinant ovalbumin did not bind heparin-agarose, and antithrombin III was eluted at 1 m NaCl. Binding was also investigated using mobility shift analysis on native PAGE gels. As shown in Fig. 1b, both proteins showed a mobility shift toward the positive electrode following incubation with heparin. We also examined the ability to bind DNA using agarose gel mobility shift analysis but found no binding for either serpin (data not shown), in agreement with the findings of Ong et al. (21Ong P.C. McGowan S. Pearce M.C. Irving J.A. Kan W.T. Grigoryev S.A. Turk B. Silverman G.A. Brix K. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) for SCCA-1. To determine the specificity of SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 for various glycosaminoglycans, we used recombinant serpin immobilized by pulldown on heparin-agarose beads. The ability of heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A and B, acetyl heparin, and de-N-sulfated heparin to elute the protein was examined (Fig. 2a). Heparin and heparan sulfate eluted the protein, but as expected, the modified heparin molecules acetyl heparin and de-N-sulfated heparin were unable to elute rSCCA-1 or rSCCA-2, as they lack the negatively charged sulfide groups that mediate the ionic interaction. However, we also noted that chondroitin sulfates A and B were similarly unable to elute rSCCA-1 or rSCCA-2 even at a 10-fold higher concentration than that required for heparin and heparan sulfate, indicating a high degree of specificity for heparin. Further evidence for an ionic interaction was obtained from modification of lysine residues by biotinylation (Fig. 2b). This significantly reduced binding of SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 to heparin-agarose, indicating that surface lysines are important for the interaction and consistent with the lack of binding of desulfated heparin seen in Fig. 2a. Cofactor-induced conformational change is a common occurrence in serpin activity, and we examined this by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence. SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 contain 4 and 5 tryptophan residues, respectively (Trp150, Trp186, Trp201, and Trp269, with Trp319 in SCCA-2 alone). The tryptophan fluorescence spectra showed a substantial shift in the presence of 1–5 μm heparin for both proteins. A titration curve of change in fluorescence against heparin concentration yielded dissociation constants of 4.20 ± 0.46 μm for SCCA-1 and 2.03 ± 0.15 μm for SCCA-2 (Fig. 3). Heparin is known to enhance the inhibitory activity of plasma serpins toward their target proteases, with antithrombin III activity toward thrombin increased by >1000-fold in the presence of heparin. However, heparin enhancement of a serpin in the context of cysteine protease inhibition has not previously been reported. We initially investigated if heparin had functional relevance on the ability of SCCA-1 to inhibit lysosomal cathepsin L. We found that, in the presence of heparin, this inhibition was remarkably rapid and complete (Fig. 4a) to the extent that second order inhibition rate constants could not be determined and were estimated at >108 m−1 s−1. In the absence of heparin, the ka was determined as 5.4 × 105 m−1 s−1, which is in close agreement with a previous estimate of 3.0 × 105 m−1 s−1 (4Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Brömme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of heparin, the rate of inhibition appears to be increased by at least 180-fold. SCCA-2 shows greater specificity toward serine proteases cathepsin G and mast cell chymase, and we examined effects on cathepsin G activity using the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. Interestingly, no increase in inhibitory activity was observed in the presence of heparin in this case (Fig. 4b). SCCA-2 could inhibit cathepsin L but less efficiently than SCCA-1. We found that heparin could also enhance this inhibition but with only a 4.1-fold increase in rate of inhibition (Fig. 4c). For both serpins, the stoichiometry of inhibition was closer to 1:1 in the presence of heparin, indicating that less of the protein is partitioned to the substrate pathway (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of cathepsin L inhibition by SCCA-1 and SCCA-2kaIncreaseS.I.aS.I., stoichiometry of inhibition.m−1 s−1-foldSCCA-1(5.4 ± 0.3) × 10511.38 ± 0.06SCCA-1 + heparin>108≥1851.19 ± 0.05SCCA-2(1.0 ± 0.06) × 10411.40 ± 0.07SCCA-2 + heparin(4.1 ± 0.28) × 1044.11.17 ± 0.06a S.I., stoichiometry of inhibition.

Using a range of heparin concentrations (Fig. 5), we found that a saturating effect did not occur and that the curve obtained was consistent with the formation of a ternary complex, i.e. at high heparin concentrations, the protease and serpin are more likely to bind different heparin molecules, thus decreasing the template effect and rate of inhibition. Furthermore, we found that cathepsin L was able to bind heparin-agarose (eluting at ∼0.4 m NaCl under the same conditions used for serpin analysis) but that the intrinsic fluorescence of cathepsin L was not altered, suggesting that conformational change in the protease is not induced following heparin binding (data not shown). Overexpression of cathepsin L has been identified in many human malignancies, including melanomas and colorectal cancers (19Yang Z. Cox J.L. Cancer Cell Int. 2007; 7: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Stabuc B. Mrevlje Z. Markovic J. Stabuc-Silih M. Neoplasma. 2006; 53: 259-262PubMed Google Scholar, 25Troy A.M. Sheahan K.

Cancer. 2004; 40: 1610-1616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and there is also previous evidence that SCCA-1 and heparin can independently inhibit metastasis (14Nakashima T. Yasumatsu R. Kuratomi Y. Masuda M. Kuwano T. Toh S. Umezaki T. Cataltepe S. Silverman G.A. Komune S. Head Neck. 2006; 28: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We investigated if SCCA-1 can inhibit secreted cathepsin L-like activity from two invasive human cancer cell lines and if heparin can enhance this inhibition. We found that conditioned media from the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the melanoma-derived cell line WM793 possessed substantial ability to cleave the cathepsin L substrate over a 20-min incubation. This cleavage could be largely abolished by the addition of the broad-specificity cysteine protease inhibitor E-64. However, the addition of the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-079 reduced activity by just 15%, and this may account for most of the remaining activity following heparin and SCCA-1 treatment. (Fig. 6). The addition of SCCA-1 alone could partially inhibit the activity, but in the presence of heparin, activity was further reduced to ∼22% of the original. Several serpin family members can bind heparin, including antithrombin, protease nexin I, heparin cofactor II, plasminogen activator inhibitor I, and protein C inhibitor. The ionic interaction involves positively charged residues of serpins, but the region of the serpin binding to heparin is not highly conserved, i.e. for antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, binding largely involves helix D (26Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Zuo Y. Picard V. Bock S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19393-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), α1-antitrypsin binds via helix F (27Gupta V.K. Gowda L.R. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the protein C inhibitor-binding site is associated with helix H (28Shirk R.A. Elisen M.G. Meijers J.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28690-28695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardin and Weintraub (29Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified the motifs xBBBxxBx and xBBxBx as heparin-binding sequences, where B = basic and x = non-basic residues. We examined the SCCAs for such motifs and noted an xBBxBx motif at residues 19–24 (FRKSKE) in helix A. We carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the motif basic residues (20RKSK23 to AASA) in SCCA-1 using the QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene). However, the resulting mutant recombinant protein displayed similar affinity for heparin binding and a similar degree of heparin enhancement toward cathepsin L inhibition compared with the wild-type protein (data not shown). The x-ray crystal structure of SCCA-1 has recently been determined (Protein Data Bank code 2ZV6) (30Zheng B. Matoba Y. Kumagai T. Katagiri C. Hibino T. Sugiyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 380: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One exposed residue is the helix D Lys87, which is equivalent to Lys125 in antithrombin III, previously shown by Schedin-Weiss et al. (31Schedin-Weiss S. Desai U.R. Bock S.C. Gettins P.G. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4779-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to be important for heparin binding and activation. The anticancer properties of heparin have been known for many years, but this has not translated to the clinic, and the underlying mechanism is still a subject of some debate (32Ornstein D.L. Zacharski L.R. Haemostasis. 1999; S1: 48-60Google Scholar). Experiments with modified heparins lacking anticoagulant activity suggest that other factors are important, and among those proposed are prevention of platelet interactions with cancer cells by P-selectin binding (33Borsig L. Wong R. Feramisco J. Nadeau D.R. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3352-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) and competition with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans for binding proangiogenic growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-β (34Jayson G.C. Gallagher J.T. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A comprehensive review of the preclinical data has led Niers et al. (35Niers T.M. Klerk C.P. DiNisio M. Van Noorden C.J. Büller H.R. Reitsma P.H. Richel D.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2007; 61: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) to conclude that inhibition of metastasis rather than primary tumor growth is the predominant means by which heparin exerts its anticancer effects. Evidence for prometastatic activity of heparanase also supports this hypothesis (36Vlodavsky I. Elkin M. Abboud-Jarrous G. Levi-Adam F. Fuks L. Shafat I. Ilan N. Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In acting as an anticoagulant, heparin binds and induces a conformational change in the serpin antithrombin III, greatly accelerating its ability to inhibit thrombin and other coagulation factors via a ternary complex, for which the structure has now been solved (37Li W. Johnson D.J. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Heparin also enhances heparin cofactor II and protease nexin I inhibition of thrombin and protein C inhibitor inhibition of activated protein C (38Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Richard B. Bouton M.C. Loyau S. Lavigne D. Letourneur D. Jandrot-Perrus M. Arocas V. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 229-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of serpins can also inhibit angiogenesis, and in the case of latent antithrombin and kallistatin, heparin is found to be important for antiangiogenic activity (40Zhang W. Swanson R. Izaguirre G. Xiong Y. Lau L.F. Olson S.T. Blood. 2005; 106: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Miao R.Q. Chen V. Chao L. Chao J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C1604-C1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which could represent an indirect mechanism for inhibiting metastasis. However, a more rapid and direct role for heparin in the inhibition of metastatic proteases has not previously been suggested, and our data now underpin this novel mechanism in relation to cathepsin L inhibition. Cathepsin L is a widely expressed cysteine protease with a major role in lysosomal proteolysis, protein processing, matrix degradation, and tissue remodeling, and it has been linked to the invasive phenotype in many cancers (24Stabuc B. Mrevlje Z. Markovic J. Stabuc-Silih M. Neoplasma. 2006; 53: 259-262PubMed Google Scholar, 25Troy A.M. Sheahan K. Mulcahy H.E. Duffy M.J. Hyland J.M. O'Donoghue D.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 2004; 40: 1610-1616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cathepsin L activity by synthetic inhibitors and by the cathepsin S propeptide can reduce invasiveness of a number of human cancer cell lines (42Burden R.E. Snoddy P. Buick R.J. Johnston J.A. Walker B. Scott C.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and prevention of cathepsin L secretion by introducing an overexpressed intracellular anti-cathepsin single chain variable antibody fragment dramatically reduced melanoma cell metastasis (43Rousselet N. Mills L. Jean D. Tellez C. Bar-Eli M. Frade R. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We propose that SCCA-1 and heparin may combine to facilitate an endogenous mechanism for regulation of extracellular cathepsin activity and cathepsin-mediated metastasis. SCCA-1 is expressed in many epithelial tissues prone to carcinoma development, including skin, cervix, lung, and esophagus. It appears to be predominantly intracellular in normal epithelial cells but is secreted in certain malignancies, in benign disorders such as psoriasis, and following stimulation with specific cytokines. Interestingly, intracellular cathepsin L appears to have a role in processing of proheparanase to the active heparanase (44Abboud-Jarrous G. Atzmon R. Peretz T. Palermo C. Gadea B.B. Joyce J.A. Vlodavsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18167-18176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), facilitating a possible synergistic regulatory role for intracellular SCCA-1. Elucidation of physiologically relevant target proteases for individual serpins can be difficult, and in general, a ka of >103 is considered potentially relevant in vivo. The increase to >108 in the presence of heparin generates an extremely potent and rapid mechanism for cathepsin L inhibition by SCCA-1. To our knowledge, this degree of heparin enhancement (>180-fold) for cathepsin L activity is the second most significant after thrombin with regard to the protease targeted. -Fold increases with heparin range from 45 to >2000 for thrombin inhibition by various serpins, but for other proteases, reports range from 4-fold for inhibition of factor XIa to 52-fold for inhibition of activated protein C (28Shirk R.A. Elisen M.G. Meijers J.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28690-28695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SCCA-2 is a substantially poorer inhibitor of cathepsin L both alone and in the presence of heparin; we found just a 4-fold heparin-induced increase. Another B-clade serpin, headpin or hurpin (serpin B13), can also inhibit cathepsin L (45Welss T. Sun J. Irving J.A. Blum R. Smith A.I. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. von Mikecz A. Ruzicka T. Bird P.I. Abts H.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7381-7389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen if heparin enhances this activity. The inhibition of parasitic and allergen proteases may be a primary function of SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 (8Kanaji S. Tanaka Y. Sakata Y. Takeshita K. Arima K. Ohta S. Hansell E.J. Caffrey C. Mottram J.C.

Page C. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2004; 3: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heparin treatment has not shown antimetastatic effects in all preclinical and clinical studies, but successful outcomes do include malignancies where cathepsin L is overexpressed (e.g. B16 melanomas) and tissues in which SCCA-1 has been detected extracellularly (31Schedin-Weiss S. Desai U.R. Bock S.C. Gettins P.G. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4779-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A re-examination of heparin preclinical data in terms of serpin and cathepsin expression, secretion, and activity may prove valuable in predicting which cancers will respond positively to heparin treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2127367800,"Background Pneumolysin (PLN) is an intracellular toxin of Streptococcus pneumoniae that has been implicated as a major virulence factor in infections caused by this pathogen. Conserved bacterial motifs are recognized by the immune system by pattern recognition receptors among which the family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) prominently features. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in lung inflammation induced by intrapulmonary delivery of PLN. Methodology/Results First, we confirmed that purified PLN activates cells via TLR4 (not via TLR2) in vitro, using human embryonic kidney cells transfected with either TLR2 or TLR4. Intranasal administration of PLN induced an inflammatory response in the pulmonary compartment of mice in vivo, as reflected by influx of neutrophils, release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and a rise in total protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These PLN-induced responses were dependent in part, not only on TLR4, but also on TLR2, as indicated by studies using TLR deficient mice. Conclusion These data suggest that although purified PLN is recognized by TLR4 in vitro, PLN elicits lung inflammation in vivo by mechanisms that may involve multiple TLRs."

As cerebellar Purkinje cells express the major regulatory elements of calcium control and represent the sole integrative output of the cerebellar cortex, changes in neural activity- and calcium-mediated membrane properties of these cells are expected to provide important insights into both intrinsic and network physiology of the cerebellum. We studied the electrophysiological behavior of Purkinje cells in genetically engineered alert mice that do not express BK calcium-activated potassium channels and in wild-type mice with pharmacological BK inactivation. We confirmed BK expression in Purkinje cells and also demonstrated it in Golgi cells. We demonstrated that either genetic or pharmacological BK inactivation leads to ataxia and to the emergence of a beta oscillatory field potential in the cerebellar cortex. This oscillation is correlated with enhanced rhythmicity and synchronicity of both Purkinje and Golgi cells. We hypothesize that the temporal coding modification of the spike firing of both Purkinje and Golgi cells leads to the pharmacologically or genetically induced ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2061647812,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK, Nm23), a housekeeping enzyme, is known to be a multifunctional protein, acting as a metastasis suppressor, transactivation activity on c-myc, and regulating endocytosis. The cellular mechanisms regulating Nm23 functions are poorly understood. In this study, we identified the modifications and interacting proteins of Nm23-H1 in response to oxidative stress. We found that Cys109 in Nm23-H1 is oxidized to various oxidation states including intra- and inter-disulfide crosslinks, glutathionylation, and sulfonic acid formation in response to H2O2 treatment both in vivo and in vitro. The cross-linking sites and modifications of oxidized Nm23-H1 were identified by peptide sequencing using UPLC-ESI-q-TOF tandem MS. Glutathionylation and oxidation of Cys109 inhibited the NDPK enzymatic activity of Nm23-H1. We also found that thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) is an interacting protein of Nm23-H1, and it binds specifically to oxidized Nm23-H1. Oxidized Nm23 is a substrate of NADPH-TrxR1-thioredoxin shuttle system, and the disulfide crosslinking is reversibly reduced and the enzymatic activity is recovered by this system. Oxidation of Cys109 in Nm23-H1 inhibited its metastatic suppressor activity as well as the enzymatic activities. The mutant, Nm23-H1 C109A, retained both the enzymatic and metastasis suppressor activities under oxidative stress. This suggests that key enzymatic and metastasis suppressor functions of Nm23-H1 are regulated by oxido-reduction of its Cys109."

Although the post-translational regulation of p27(Kip1) is well established, its transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. Here, we report that mitogenic stimulation of quiescent HEK293 and Huh7 cells showed a rapid decline in the levels of p27(Kip1) transcript by 2.4 +/- 0.1-fold. Inhibition of the p27(Kip1) gene in response to mitogens involved transcriptional down-regulation and required newly synthesized protein(s). Mutation of the AP-1 element at position -469 in the human p27(Kip1) promoter abrogated the effect of mitogens. The recruitment of the AP-1 complex to the p27(Kip1) promoter was confirmed by in vitro DNA binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. Reporter gene analysis combined with enforced expression of Jun/Fos proteins suggested the involvement of Jun/Fos heterodimer in the transrepression process. Both MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways appeared to mediate p27(Kip1) transcription. Furthermore, hepatitis B virus X protein-mediated down-regulation of p27(Kip1) in a transgenic environment correlated with an increase in c-Fos levels, reiterating the physiological relevance of AP-1 in the transcriptional regulation of p27(Kip1). Collectively, our studies present the first evidence demonstrating the role of the AP-1 complex in transcriptional down-regulation of the p27(Kip1) gene following mitogenic stimulation."

However, in settings with high drug resistance, first line standard regimens are linked with high treatment failure. We evaluated treatment outcomes after standardized chemotherapy with the WHO recommended category II retreatment regimen in a prison with a high prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). A cohort of 233 culture positive TB patients was followed through smear microscopy, culture, drug susceptibility testing and DNA fingerprinting at baseline, after 3 months and at the end of treatment. Overall 172 patients (74%) became culture negative, while 43 (18%) remained positive at the end of treatment. Among those 43 cases, 58% of failures were determined to be due to treatment with an inadequate drug regimen and 42% to either an initial mixed infection or re-infection while under treatment. Overall, drug resistance amplification during treatment occurred in 3.4% of the patient cohort. This study demonstrates that treatment failure is linked to initial drug resistance, that amplification of drug resistance occurs, and that mixed infection and re-infection during standard treatment contribute to treatment failure in confined settings with high prevalence of drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2047704995,"Vertebrate segmentation is regulated by the ""segmentation clock"", which drives cyclic expression of several genes in the caudal presomitic mesoderm (PSM). One such gene is Lunatic fringe (Lfng), which encodes a modifier of Notch signalling, and which is also expressed in a stripe at the cranial end of the PSM, adjacent to the newly forming somite border. We have investigated the functional requirements for these modes of Lfng expression during somitogenesis by generating mice in which Lfng is expressed in the cranial stripe but strongly reduced in the caudal PSM, and find that requirements for Lfng activity alter during axial growth. Formation of cervical, thoracic and lumbar somites/vertebrae, but not sacral and adjacent tail somites/vertebrae, depends on caudal, cyclic Lfng expression. Indeed, the sacral region segments normally in the complete absence of Lfng and shows a reduced requirement for another oscillating gene, Hes7, indicating that the architecture of the clock alters as segmentation progresses. We present evidence that Lfng controls dorsal-ventral axis specification in the tail, and also suggest that Lfng controls the expression or activity of a long-range signal that regulates axial extension."

However, the manner in which STAT5 responds to early-acting and lineage-restricted cytokines, particularly in leukemic stem/progenitor cells, is largely unknown.We optimized a multiparametric flow cytometry protocol to analyze STAT5 phosphorylation upon cytokine stimulation in stem and progenitor cell compartments at a single-cell level. In normal cord blood (CB) cells, STAT5 phosphorylation was efficiently induced by TPO, IL-3 and GM-CSF within CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). EPO- and SCF-induced STAT5 phosphorylation was largely restricted to the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP) compartment, while G-CSF as well IL-3 and GM-CSF were most efficient in inducing STAT5 phosphorylation in the myeloid progenitor compartments. Strikingly, mobilized adult peripheral blood (PB) CD34(+) cells responded much less efficiently to cytokine-induced STAT5 activation, with the exception of TPO. In leukemic stem and progenitor cells, highly distinct cytokine responses were observed, differing significantly from their normal counterparts. These responses could not be predicted by the expression level of cytokine receptors. Also, heterogeneity existed in cytokine requirements for long-term expansion of AML CD34(+) cells on stroma.In conclusion, our optimized multiparametric flow cytometry protocols allow the analysis of signal transduction at the single cell level in normal and leukemic stem and progenitor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2018948517,"Background The PGC-1 related coactivator (PRC), which shares structural and functional features with PGC-1α, is believed to regulate several metabolic pathways as well as mitochondrial biogenesis. Its involvement in the early programming of cell proliferation suggests the existence of finely regulated crosstalk between mitochondrial functions and the cell cycle status. Methodology/Principal Findings PRC-regulated pathways were explored in a cell-line model derived from mitochondrial-rich tumours with an essentially oxidative metabolism and specifically high PRC expression. The functional status of mitochondria was compared to the results of microarray analysis under conditions of temporal PRC inhibition. To specify the fine PRC regulation, the expression levels of the genes and proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process were studied by real time quantitative PCR and western blotting. As in earlier studies on PGC-1α, we investigated the role of nitric oxide in PRC-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis and determined its action in the control of the phosphorylation status of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Conclusion/Significance We found that nitric oxide rapidly influences PRC expression at the transcriptional level. Focusing on mitochondrial energetic metabolism, we observed that PRC differentially controls respiratory chain complexes and coupling efficiency in a time-dependent manner to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. Our results highlight the key role of PRC in the rapid modulation of metabolic functions in response to the status of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2036715964,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Previous studies have explored miRNA evolutionary trend, but evolutionary history and pattern in the miRNA world are still not fully clear. In the paper, we intended to analyze miRNA haplotype distribution and evolutionary network by analyzing miRNA sequences of miR-17 and miR-124 families across animal species as special populations. Principal Findings 31 haplotypes were detected in miR-17 family while only 9 haplotypes were defined in miR-124 family. The complex miR-17 family was mainly distributed in vertebrates, but miR-124 was shared by more animal species from Caenorhabditis to Homo and had a wide distribution spectrum. Some haplotypes of the two miRNA families appeared discontinuous distributions across animals. Compared with a simple phylogenetic network in miR-124 family, miR-17 family indicated a complex network with some median vectors that might be lost ancestral or potential miRNA haplotypes. By analyzing different miRNAs across 12 animal species, we found these small RNAs showed different haplotype diversities, haplotype distributions and phylogenetic networks. Conclusions Different miRNAs had quite different haplotype distributions and evolutionary patterns. Discontinuous distributions of miRNAs and median vectors in phylogenetic networks implied more members in the miRNA world. miRNA may be an excellent phylogenetic marker to discover its evolutionary history and pattern across the animal kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2031982021,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans may be killed by certain pathogenic bacteria and thus is a model organism for studying interactions between bacteria and animal hosts. However, growing nematodes on prey bacteria may influence their susceptibility to potential pathogens. A method of axenic nematode culture was developed to isolate and quantify interactions between C. elegans and potentially pathogenic strains of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. Studying these dynamics in liquid solution rather than on agar surfaces minimized nematode avoidance behavior and resolved more differences among isolates. Most isolates of B. cenocepacia, B. ambifaria and B. cepacia caused 60-80% mortality of nematodes after 7 days, whereas isolates of B. multivorans caused less mortality (<25%) and supported nematode reproduction. However, some B. cenocepacia isolates recovered from chronic infections were much less virulent (5-28% mortality). As predicted, prior diet altered the outcome of interactions between nematodes and bacteria. When given the choice between Burkholderia and E. coli as prey on agar, axenically raised nematodes initially preferred most lethal Burkholderia isolates to E. coli as a food source, but this was not the case for nematodes fed E. coli, which avoided toxic Burkholderia. This food preference was associated with the cell-free supernatant and thus secreted compounds likely mediated bacterial-nematode interactions. This model, which isolates interactions between bacteria and nematodes from the effects of prior feeding, demonstrates that bacteria can influence nematode behavior and their susceptibility to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2056341520,"Background To initiate infection, Bacillus anthracis needs to overcome the host innate immune system. Anthrax toxin, a major virulence factor of B. anthracis, impairs both the innate and adaptive immune systems and is important in the establishment of anthrax infections. Methodology/Principal Findings To measure the ability of anthrax toxin to target immune cells, studies were performed using a fusion of the anthrax toxin lethal factor (LF) N-terminal domain (LFn, aa 1–254) with β-lactamase (LFnBLA). This protein reports on the ability of the anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) to mediate LF delivery into cells. Primary immune cells prepared from mouse spleens were used in conjunction with flow cytometry to assess cleavage and resulting FRET disruption of a fluorescent β-lactamase substrate, CCF2/AM. In spleen cell suspensions, the macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells showed about 75% FRET disruption of CCF2/AM due to cleavage by the PA–delivered LFnBLA. LFnBLA delivery into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was lower, with 40% FRET disruption. When the analyses were done on purified samples of individual cell types, similar results were obtained, with T cells again having lower LFnBLA delivery than macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Relative expression levels of the toxin receptors CMG2 and TEM8 on these cells were determined by real-time PCR. Expression of CMG2 was about 1.5-fold higher in CD8+ cells than in CD4+ and B cells, and 2.5-fold higher than in macrophages. Conclusions/Significance Anthrax toxin entry and activity differs among immune cells. Macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells displayed higher LFnBLA activity than CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in both spleen cell suspension and the purified samples of individual cell types. Expression of anthrax toxin receptor CMG2 is higher in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which is not correlated to the intracellular LFnBLA activity."
https://openalex.org/W2010126921,"Background In September 2007, an outbreak of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) occurred in Keelung City and spread to Taipei City. In response to the epidemic, a new crisis management program was implemented and tested in Taipei. Methodology and Principal Findings Having noticed that transmission surged on weekends during the Keelung epidemic, Taipei City launched a multi-channel mass risk communications program that included short message service (SMS) messages sent directly to approximately 2.2 million Taipei residents on Friday, October 12th, 2007. The public was told to keep symptomatic students from schools and was provided guidelines for preventing the spread of the disease at home. Epidemiological characteristics of Taipei's outbreak were analyzed from 461 sampled AHC cases. Median time from exposure to onset of the disease was 1 day. This was significantly shorter for cases occurring in family clusters than in class clusters (mean±SD: 2.6±3.2 vs. 4.39±4.82 days, p = 0.03), as well as for cases occurring in larger family clusters as opposed to smaller ones (1.2±1.7 days vs. 3.9±4.0 days, p<0.01). Taipei's program had a significant impact on patient compliance. Home confinement of symptomatic children increased from 10% to 60% (p<0.05) and helped curb the spread of AHC. Taipei experienced a rapid decrease in AHC cases between the Friday of the SMS announcement and the following Monday, October 15, (0.70% vs. 0.36%). By October 26, AHC cases reduced to 0.01%. The success of this risk communication program in Taipei (as compared to Keelung) is further reflected through rapid improvements in three epidemic indicators: (1) significantly lower crude attack rates (1.95% vs. 14.92%, p<0.001), (2) a short epidemic period of AHC (13 vs. 34 days), and (3) a quick drop in risk level (1∼2 weeks) in Taipei districts that border Keelung (the original domestic epicenter). Conclusions and Significance The timely launch of this systematic, communication-based intervention proved effective at preventing a dangerous spike in AHC and was able to bring this high-risk disease under control. We recommend that public health officials incorporate similar methods into existing guidelines for preventing pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2062858581,"Background Donor-specific blood transfusion (DST) prior to solid organ transplantation has been shown to induce long-term allograft survival in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. Although the mechanisms underlying DST-induced allograft tolerance are not well defined, there is evidence to suggest DST induces one or more populations of antigen-specific regulatory cells that suppress allograft rejection. However, neither the identity nor the regulatory properties of these tolerogenic lymphocytes have been reported. Therefore, the objective of this study was to define the kinetics, phenotype and suppressive function of the regulatory cells induced by DST alone or in combination with liver allograft transplantation (LTx). Methodology/Principal Findings Tolerance to Dark Agouti (DA; RT1a) rat liver allografts was induced by injection (iv) of 1 ml of heparinized DA blood to naïve Lewis (LEW; RT1l) rats once per week for 4 weeks prior to LTx. We found that preoperative DST alone generates CD4+ T-cells that when transferred into naïve LEW recipients are capable of suppressing DA liver allograft rejection and promoting long-term survival of the graft and recipient. However, these DST-generated T-cells did not express the regulatory T-cell (Treg) transcription factor Foxp3 nor did they suppress alloantigen (DA)-induced activation of LEW T-cells in vitro suggesting that these lymphocytes are not fully functional regulatory Tregs. We did observe that DST+LTx (but not DST alone) induced the time-dependent formation of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs that potently suppressed alloantigen-induced activation of naïve LEW T-cells in vitro and liver allograft rejection in vivo. Finally, we present data demonstrating that virtually all of the Foxp3-expressing Tregs reside within the CD4+CD45RC− population whereas in which approximately 50% of these Tregs express CD25. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that preoperative DST, in the absence of liver allograft transplantation, induces the formation of CD4+ T-cells that are not themselves Tregs but give rise directly or indirectly to fully functional CD4+CD45RC−Foxp3+Tregs when transferred into MHC mismatched recipients prior to LTx. These Tregs possess potent suppressive activity and are capable of suppressing acute liver allograft rejection. Understanding the mechanisms by which preoperative DST induces the generation of tolerogenic Tregs in the presence of alloantigens may lead to the development of novel antigen-specific immunological therapies for the treatment of solid organ rejection."

This sequence is most likely produced by putative α1,4- and β1,4-galactosyltransferases (GalTs), which are responsible for the biosynthesis of the Galα1–4Gal and Galβ1–4Gal sequences on the N-glycans, respectively. Because no such glycan structures have been found in mammalian glycoproteins, the biosynthetic enzymes that produce these glycans are likely to have distinct substrate specificities from the known mammalian GalTs. To study these enzymes, we cloned the pigeon liver cDNAs encoding α4GalT and β4GalT by expression cloning and characterized these enzymes using the recombinant proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence of pigeon α4GalT has 58.2% identity to human α4GalT and 68.0 and 66.6% identity to putative α4GalTs from chicken and zebra finch, respectively. Unlike human and putative chicken α4GalTs, which possess globotriosylceramide synthase activity, pigeon α4GalT preferred to catalyze formation of the Galα1–4Gal sequence on glycoproteins. In contrast, the sequence of pigeon β4GalT revealed a type II transmembrane protein consisting of 438 amino acid residues, with no significant homology to the glycosyltransferases so far identified from mammals and chicken. However, hypothetical proteins from zebra finch (78.8% identity), frogs (58.9–60.4%), zebrafish (37.1–43.0%), and spotted green pufferfish (43.3%) were similar to pigeon β4GalT, suggesting that the pigeon β4GalT gene was inherited from the common ancestors of these vertebrates.

https://openalex.org/W1975755825,"Comparing patterns of divergence among separate lineages or groups has posed an especially difficult challenge for biologists. Recently a new, conceptually simple methodology called the ""ordered-axis plot"" approach was introduced for the purpose of comparing patterns of diversity in a common morphospace. This technique involves a combination of principal components analysis (PCA) and linear regression. Given the common use of these statistics the potential for the widespread use of the ordered axis approach is high. However, there are a number of drawbacks to this approach, most notably that lineages with the greatest amount of variance will largely bias interpretations from analyses involving a common morphospace. Therefore, without meeting a set of a priori requirements regarding data structure the ordered-axis plot approach will likely produce misleading results.Morphological data sets from cichlid fishes endemic to Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi, and Victoria were used to statistically demonstrate how separate groups can have differing contributions to a common morphospace produced by a PCA. Through a matrix superimposition of eigenvectors (scale-free trajectories of variation identified by PCA) we show that some groups contribute more to the trajectories of variation identified in a common morphospace. Furthermore, through a set of randomization tests we show that a common morphospace model partitions variation differently than group-specific models. Finally, we demonstrate how these limitations may influence an ordered-axis plot approach by performing a comparison on data sets with known alterations in covariance structure. Using these results we provide a set of criteria that must be met before a common morphospace can be reliably used.Our results suggest that a common morphospace produced by PCA would not be useful for producing biologically meaningful results unless a restrictive set of criteria are met. We therefore suggest biologists be aware of the limitations of the ordered-axis plot approach before employing it on their own data, and possibly consider other, less restrictive methods for addressing the same question."

Native insulin-related growth factor (IGF)-I has canonical cystines (A6—A11, A7–B7, and A20—B19) maintained by IGF-binding proteins; IGF-swap has alternative pairing (A7–A11, A6—B7, and A20—B19) and impaired activity. Studies of mini-domain models suggest that residue B5 (His in insulin and Thr in IGFs) governs the ambiguity or uniqueness of disulfide pairing. Residue B5, a site of mutation in proinsulin causing neonatal diabetes, is thus of broad biophysical interest. Here, we characterize reciprocal B5 substitutions in the two proteins. In insulin, HisB5 → Thr markedly destabilizes the hormone (ΔΔGu 2.0 ± 0.2 kcal/mol), impairs chain combination, and blocks cellular secretion of proinsulin. The reciprocal IGF-I substitution ThrB5 → His (residue 4) specifies a unique structure with native 1H NMR signature. Chemical shifts and nuclear Overhauser effects are similar to those of native IGF-I.

https://openalex.org/W1979123965,"Protein aggregation in vivo has been extensively associated with a large spectrum of human diseases. On the other hand, mechanistic insights into protein aggregation in vitro were incomplete due to the inability in solubilizing insoluble proteins for high-resolution biophysical investigations. However, a new avenue may be opened up by our recent discovery that previously-thought insoluble proteins can in fact be solubilized in salt-free water. Here we use this approach to study the NMR structural and dynamic properties of an insoluble SH3 mutant with a naturally-occurring insertion of Val22 at the tip of the diverging turn. The obtained results reveal: 1) regardless of whether the residue is Val, Ala, Asp or Arg, the insertion will render the first hNck2 SH3 domain to be insoluble in buffers. Nevertheless, all four mutants could be solubilized in salt-free water and appear to be largely unfolded as evident from their CD and NMR HSQC spectra. 2) Comparison of the chemical shift deviations reveals that while in V22-SH3 the second helical region is similarly populated as in the wild-type SH3 at pH 2.0, the first helical region is largely unformed. 3) In V22-SH3, many non-native medium-range NOEs manifest to define non-native helical conformations. In the meanwhile a small group of native-like long-range NOEs still persists, indicating the existence of a rudimentary native-like tertiary topology. 4) Although overall, V22-SH3 has significantly increased backbone motions on the ps-ns time scale, some regions still own restricted backbone motions as revealed by analyzing 15N relaxation data. Our study not only leads to the establishment of the first high-resolution structural and dynamic picture for an insoluble protein, but also shed more light on the molecular events for the nonhierarchical folding mechanism. Furthermore, a general mechanism is also proposed for in vivo protein aggregation triggered by the genetic mutation and posttranslational modification."

Neurite outgrowth is accomplished by continuous reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins, of which, microtubules (MTs) 4The abbreviations used are: MTmicrotubuleJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseCTDC-terminal domainsiRNAsmall interference RNANGFnerve growth factorHAhemagglutinin. play a critical role. Neuronal MTs exist in a highly dynamic state in growth cones of neurons. There, MTs form dense parallel arrays in the axon shaft and are oriented with their plus ends toward the growth cone (1Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar, 2Dent E.W. Gertler F.B.

Although the minus ends of MTs are relatively stable, the plus ends of MTs undergo variable phases of polymerization and depolymerization, thereby affecting neurite extension. Thus, the rates of neurite elongation and growth cone advance are dependent on proper regulation of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization reactions (1Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev.

During neuronal development, SCG10 expression is highly up-regulated as neurons become differentiated (5Mori N. Morii H. J. Neurosci.

It has been shown that SCG10 contains several serine residues that can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (5Mori N. Morii H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that JNK-mediated phosphorylation controls the ability of SCG10 to mediate depolymerization of MTs. The microtubule-destabilizing activity of SCG10 is dependent on the phosphorylation status of the protein (7Grenningloh G. Soehrman S. Bondallaz P. Ruchti E. Cadas H. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and inhibition of JNK activity by small molecule inhibitors was found to abrogate the ability of SCG10 to mediate tubulin depolymerization. These observations suggest that SCG10 phosphorylation is a critical step in microtubule homeostasis and axondendritic growth during brain development (8Tararuk T. Ostman N. Li W. Björkblom B.

JNKs participate in multiprotein cascades with upstream activators and downstream effectors. This kinase cascade is regulated spatiotemporally by scaffolding proteins such as the JIP/JSAP/JLP family (9Whitmarsh A.J. Biochem. Soc.

The kinase activity of JNK is modulated by additional upstream kinases such as MKK4 and MKK7, and this signaling module appears to function as a complex that involves the participation of scaffolding proteins such as JIP1, JIP2, JIP3/JSAP1, JLP, SPAG9, JIP4, and POSH (10Dhanasekaran D.N. Kashef K. Lee C.M. Xu H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3185-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Of these, JLP is highly expressed in the brain tissue and has been shown to bind to a number of signaling molecules, including JNK and to modulate their activity. JLP contains two leucine zipper domains (LZI and LZII), and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which are highly conserved as evidenced by their presence in the UNC-16 protein of Caenorhabditis elegans (11Lee C.M.

The JLP LZII domain associates with kinesin light chain and mediates the subcellular localization of JLP (11Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the nature of proteins that bind to the CTD of JLP remains unknown, despite the fact that it is the most highly conserved domain. To search for novel JLP-interacting protein(s), we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the CTD of JLP as the bait using a cDNA library derived from mouse brain. Here we report identification of SCG10 as a JLP-CTD interacting protein. To understand the biological significance of the interaction between JLP and SCG10, we specifically inhibited the endogenous expression of JLP using siRNA methodology in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. Our studies indicate that JLP negatively regulates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by inhibiting JNK-dependent phosphorylation of SCG10. This is the first indication that JLP mediates neurite outgrowth through the specific interaction with microtubule dynamics regulators, suggesting a novel role for the JIP/JLP family of scaffolding protein in neuronal differentiation and development. H1299 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured on 100-mm Falcon tissue culture plates precoated with collagen and polylysine in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum and 8% horse serum. The pSG5 plasmids expressing S-tagged WT-JLP, JLP deletion mutants, and JLP domain mutants have been described previously (11Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Wild-type stathmin, SCG10, and SCLIP cDNAs were cloned into the pSG5 vector that contained a HA tag via EcoRI and MluI restriction sites. To make the SCG10 domain mutants, the following primers were used: for domain A, 5′-ATG GCT AAA ACA GCA ATG GCC and antisense, 5′-CGC CAA CGC GTT CTT TGG AGA AGC TAG AGT TCG; for domain B, sense 5′-CGC GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG AAG AAA GAC CTG TCT CTG GAG and antisense, 5′-CGC CAA CGC GTT GCC AGA CAG TTC AAC CTG CAG; and for domain C, sense 5′-CGC GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG ACC TAC GAC GAC ATG GAG GTG and antisense, 5′-CGC CAA CGC GTT GCC AGA CAG TTC AAC CTG CAG. All PCR products were cloned into the pSG5 vector that contained a HA tag via EcoRI and MluI restriction sites. All the constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. Because the N-terminal region of SCG10 is insoluble, a truncated form that is devoid of the first 35 amino acids was used as an antigen to raise a rabbit polyclonal anti-SCG10 antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals). The antibody was tested and immunoaffinity-purified for the immunoprecipitation studies. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitors (apostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). For S-agarose precipitation, the cell lysates were incubated with S-protein agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. For anti-SCG10 or anti-JLP immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were incubated with the anti-JLP or anti-SCG10 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. JLP siRNAs were chemically synthesized (Dharmacon). The sequences were as follows: for PC12 cell transfection, 5′-AACACTTGGAAAGAACCAAAC-3′; for H1299 cell transfection, 5′-AACACTTAGAAAGAACCAAAC-3′. For PC12 cells, 10 μl of the JLP siRNA (100 μm stock) was mixed with 25 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen); for H1299 cells, 6 μl of the JLP siRNA (100 μm) was mixed with 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The mixtures were applied according to the manufacture's protocol. Two days after transfection, 100 ng/ml NGF was added to the transfected PC12 cells. Analyses of neurite extension were performed on digitized images of live cells taken under phase contrast illumination with an Olympus IMT2 inverted microscope linked to a digital camera. Images of random fields were taken. The number of differentiated cells was determined by visual examination of the field and counting cells that had at least one neurite with a length longer than the cell body diameter. More than 200 cells were examined in each sample. Neurite length was determined by manually tracing the length of the longest neurite of differentiated cells using the NIH ImageJ program. Experiments were repeated at least three times using cultures prepared on separate days. The p value was calculated using the student t test. PC12 cells were transfected with JLP siRNA and treated with NGF as described above. After 2 days, the culture medium was replaced with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. 3 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate was then added into each plate. Following a 2-h incubation, the radiolabeled cells were harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with an anti-SCG10 antibody as described above. All results were quantitated using the Fuji Image Gauge program. PC12 cells (3 × 106/100-mm plate) were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 μm of the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Invitrogen) for 2 h before the NGF treatment. 10 μm of the inhibitor was applied based on a dose titration assay that showed that the inhibitor at 10 μm effectively inhibited JNK activity without reducing cell viability (supplemental Fig. 1). Our studies, described earlier, have shown that JLP is a scaffolding protein that regulates JNK/p38MAPK signaling (11Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). JLP contains two leucine zipper domains (LZI and LZII). JLP also contains a CTD that is highly conserved through evolution (11Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The identity of cellular factors that bind to the CTD of JLP remains unknown, despite the fact that it is the most highly conserved domain. To search for proteins that interact with CTD of JLP, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the CTD (amino acids 956–1161) as the bait using a mouse brain cDNA library. This screen identified SCG10 as one of the proteins that specifically interacted with the CTD of JLP (data not shown). Because SCG10 shares extensive homology with stathmin and SCLIP, we examined whether JLP interacts with these proteins in vivo. An immunoprecipitation assay using cell extracts derived from COS-7 cells expressing JLP and the indicated stathmin family member demonstrated that JLP interacts with SCG10 and SCLIP, but not stathmin (Fig. 1A). To map the SCG10 binding region(s) of JLP, we performed a number of immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells using a set of deletion mutants (Fig. 1B) and a set of internal fragments of JLP (Fig. 1C). These studies showed that deletion mutant JLP-1000 was able to precipitate SCG10, whereas mutant JLP-463 failed to do so. This suggested to us that the region of JLP spanning amino acids 463–1000 is sufficient for SCG10 binding (Fig. 1D). In a similar assay, using internal fragments of JLP, we observed that JLP contained three individual domains that can mediate SCG10 binding: Domain III (amino acids 465–1008), C-domain core (amino acids 997–1170), and Domain IV (amino acids 1165–1307) (Fig. 1E), suggesting the presence of three different binding sites for this protein. Conversely, to map the one or more regions of SCG10 that interact with JLP, immunoprecipitation assays were performed in COS-7 cells using a set of domain mutants of SCG10 (Fig. 2A). These results revealed that none of the domain mutants of SCG10 were able to interact with JLP, whereas the full length of SCG10 was able to do so (Fig. 2B). This fact, to some extent, explained why stathmin was unable to interact with JLP. The additional N-terminal domain of SCG10 seems to contribute to the interaction with JLP, although it has been shown to be a membrane association domain (13Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). During NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells, the expression levels of SCG10 were shown to increase dramatically as a function of the differentiated phenotype (14Curmi P.A. Gavet O. Charbaut E. Ozon S. Lachkar-Colmerauer S. Manceau V. Siavoshian S. Maucuer A. Sobel A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas the levels of JLP remain constant (data not shown). To determine whether JLP interacts with SCG10 during differentiation, we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay using NGF-treated PC12 cells. As predicted by our results obtained with COS-7 cells, these studies showed that immunoprecipitates of SCG10 contained detectable levels of JLP, suggesting that endogenous JLP interacted with endogenous SCG10 during NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (Fig. 2C). A reciprocal experiment using anti-JLP antibodies for immunoprecipitation assay, followed by immunoblotting using anti-SCG10 antibodies, also shows interaction between JLP and SCG10. To determine the kinetics of the interaction during differentiation of PC12, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using anti-SCG10 antibodies on lysates from PC12 cells treated with NGF for various periods of time. The results presented in Fig. 2D show that SCG10 was induced in Day 1 after treatment of NGF and reached a maximum level on Day2, followed by subsequent decline in expression levels. Immunoprecipitation of SCG10 could co-precipitate JLP before NGF stimulation and during the whole course of differentiation induced by NGF. This suggests that SCG10 interacts with JLP before and after the treatment of NGF. The amount of JLP co-immunoprecipitated with SCG10 was similar during the course of differentiation, although higher amounts of SCG10 could be immunoprecipitated by the anti-SCG10 antibodies early in the differentiation course (Days 1 and 2). This suggests that the JLP-SCG10 interaction persists consistently throughout differentiation. However, we did not observe higher levels of JLP in immunoprecipitates derived from Day 1 and Day 2 lysates, which contained increased amounts of SCG10. This suggests that, during the course of differentiation, on Days 1 and 2, certain levels of SCG10 exist in an unbound state to mediate tubulin depolymerization. The biological function of JLP remains largely unknown in the neuronal tissue despite its high level of expression in the brain. Because SCG10 expression is up-regulated during neural development and regeneration, and because it has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth in NGF-treated PC12 cells, the interaction between JLP and SCG10 indicates that JLP may play a role in regulating neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down the endogenous expression of JLP mRNA in PC12 cells using a specific siRNA against JLP. Treatment of PC12 cells with this siRNA resulted in ∼70% reduction in JLP levels when compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Following treatment with NGF for 2–3 days, we examined the morphology of cells and found that treatment of PC12 cells with a JLP siRNA results in enhanced neurite growth. This suggests that loss of JLP expression promotes differentiation in these cells (Fig. 3B). By Day 2, >60% of the cells were differentiated in the JLP siRNA-transfected plates compared with ∼8% of those seen in the control plates (Fig. 3C). By Day 3, ∼95% of the JLP siRNA-transfected cells underwent differentiation, whereas only 35% of the control cells were differentiated at this time (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, measurement of the neurite length of the differentiated cells revealed that roughly 65% of the differentiated cells transfected with JLP siRNA contained neurites with a length ranging between 100 and 200 μm, whereas 93% of the differentiated cells in the control plates contained neurites shorter than 100 μm after 2 days of NGF treatment (Fig. 3D). On Day 3, 69% of the differentiated cells in the JLP siRNA-transfected plates contained neurites that were longer than 200 μm, whereas 15% of the control cells contained neurites with a length longer than 200 μm (Fig. 3D). Based on these observations, we conclude that loss of JLP strongly enhances neurite outgrowth in the NGF-treated PC12 cells. It has been reported that SCG10 can specifically regulate microtubule dynamics that are critical for neuronal differentiation and that this process is dependent on the phosphorylation status of SCG10 (7Grenningloh G. Soehrman S. Bondallaz P. Ruchti E. Cadas H. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stable overexpression of SCG10 has been found to promote neurite outgrowth in NGF-treated PC12 cells (15Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lütjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To define the mechanism by which loss of JLP enhances neurite outgrowth, we examined whether JLP regulates SCG10 phosphorylation during NGF-induced differentiation. To that end, we incubated control and JLP siRNA-transfected cells with [32P]orthophosphate and determined the phosphorylation status of SCG10. Results presented in Fig. 4 show that, in JLP siRNA-expressing NGF-treated PC12 cells, SCG10 phosphorylation was increased ∼2.5-fold compared with the control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In the absence of NGF stimulation, although the cells did not undergo differentiation, the phosphorylation of SCG10 in the JLP siRNA-transfected cells was also increased by >3-fold to that of the control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that inhibition of JLP expression results in an increase in phosphorylated SCG10, suggesting that JLP negatively regulates the phosphorylation status of this protein. Our results also showed that JNK activity induced by NGF stimulation was unaffected in JLP siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the change in SCG10 phosphorylation is not due to the alteration of JNK activity. Mitogen-activated protein kinases have been shown to be involved in the NGF-signaling pathway regulating neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth (16Vaudry D. Stork P.J. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Our results show that JNK is activated during NGF-induced neuronal differentiation (Fig. 4A). To understand the role of JNK in the NGF-signaling pathway, we treated NGF-induced PC12 cultures with a small molecule inhibitor, SP600125, that can inhibit all three isoforms of JNK. Our results showed that the inhibition of JNK activity blocked NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5A), indicating that JNK is required for NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Because previous studies have shown that SCG10 can be phosphorylated by JNK in vitro (7Grenningloh G. Soehrman S. Bondallaz P. Ruchti E. Cadas H. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that JNK may regulate NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by phosphorylating SCG10. To address this question, we incubated control and JNK inhibitor-treated PC12 cells with [32P]orthophosphate and determined the phosphorylation status of SCG10. The results shown in Fig. 5B demonstrate that inhibition of JNK activity resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylation of SCG10 by 60%. These studies suggest that JNK-dependent phosphorylation of SCG10 is required for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Scaffolding proteins regulate signal transduction through specific protein-protein interactions. In the present study, we identified a microtubule-dynamics regulator SCG10 as a novel JLP-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid system as well as immunoprecipitation studies. This is the first indication of a JIP/JSAP/JLP scaffolding protein family member playing a role in regulating neuronal differentiation through interactions with neuronal growth-associated proteins. Results presented in this study also show that the C-terminal domain of JLP interacts with SCG10 and SCLIP proteins but not with stathmin. Although there is extensive homology between stathmin and SCG10/SCLIP, stathmin does not contain the N-terminal region present in the SCG10 and SCLIP proteins. The N-terminal region of SCG10 is critical for directing it to Golgi membrane and transporting it to growth cones (13Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18Lutjens R. Igarashi M. Pellier V. Blasey H. Di Paolo G. Ruchti E. Pfulg C. Staple J.K. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Removal of this region completely abolished the interaction of SCG10 with JLP. Because SCG10 is an important regulator of microtubule dynamics involved in neuronal differentiation and development, we explored the functional consequences that result from the interaction between JLP and SCG10. Surprisingly, our results from studies using siRNA to JLP have indicated that JLP attenuates NGF-induced neurite extension and SCG10 phosphorylation. It is well established that JNK is activated in response to NGF stimulation (16Vaudry D. Stork P.J. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Our studies with the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 indicate that JNK activation is critical for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, which is consistent with an earlier observation that transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of JNK into PC12 cells results in an inhibition of neurite outgrowth in response to NGF treatment (19Gelderblom M. Eminel S. Herdegen T. Waetzig V. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2004; 22: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we show that JNK phosphorylates SCG10 during NGF stimulation, suggesting that JNK-dependent phosphorylation of SCG10 is a key event in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Thus, it appears that, in PC12 cells, JLP acts as a negative regulator of SCG10 phosphorylation. It is interesting to note that this regulation affects the rate of neurite outgrowth in NGF-treated PC12 cells. This is the first indication that a JIP family member regulates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by interacting with microtubule dynamics regulators. The conclusion that JLP negatively regulates NGF-induced SCG10-mediated and JNK-dependent neurite extension is strikingly different from our previous findings that JLP stimulates JNK activity in other cell types. In this context it is interesting to note that JLP did not alter NGF-induced activation of JNK. It appears that JLP modulates JNK-dependent phosphorylation of SCG10 and thereby NGF-induced neurite extension by sequestering JNK and/or SCG10 into a non-productive signaling complex. In fact, recent studies have shown that JLP can modulate physiological responses by sequestering active signaling components in different subcellular regions (20Gantulga D. Tuvshintugs B. Endo Y. Takino T. Sato H. Murakami S. Yoshioka K. J. Biochem. 2008; 144: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). SCG10 is a neuronal-specific protein induced by NGF during differentiation of PC12 cells (21Hannan A.J. Henke R.C. Weinberger R.P. Sentry J.W. Jeffrey P.L. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Stein R. Orit S. Anderson D.J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Its mRNA is highly induced in the early phase of differentiation induced by NGF, followed by subsequent decline in expression. Its protein expression also follows a similar pattern (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, SCG10 has been shown to accumulate in the growth cones of neurons (17Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18Lutjens R. Igarashi M. Pellier V. Blasey H. Di Paolo G. Ruchti E. Pfulg C. Staple J.K. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SCG10 in PC12 cells strongly enhances neurite outgrowth in response to NGF, with an increase of the number of differentiated cells and with a more rapid kinetics of the neurite extension (15Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lütjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). JLP appears to negatively regulate the tubulin-depolymerizing activity of SCG10 by regulating the phosphorylation events mediated by JNK. These opposite effects of JLP and SCG10 on neurite outgrowth suggest that rapid synthesis and accumulation of SCG10 in the growth cones during early stages of differentiation (Days 1–3) may overcome the inhibitory effects of JLP, thereby stimulating the initiation of neurite outgrowth in the early phase of differentiation. When the levels of SCG10 decrease in the late phase of neuronal differentiation, JLP will reassert its inhibitory effects and stop further neurite outgrowth. Previous studies have suggested that SCG10 expression is severely altered in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome (5Mori N. Morii H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies implicate a modulatory role for JLP in SCG10-mediated neural growth and development. Our findings described here shed a new light on a novel mode of SCG10 regulation, providing a clue that could help identify novel therapeutic agents that could be used to treat human neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease. Because JLP is highly expressed in the brain, including subcompartments such as the hippocampus (data not shown), our studies have provided a clue to understanding the biological function of JLP associated with the nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W2117665515,"Background Early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma with highly sensitive diagnostic imaging methods could save lives of many thousands of patients, because early detection increases resectability and survival rates. Current non-invasive diagnostic imaging techniques have inadequate resolution and sensitivity for detection of small size (∼2–3 mm) early pancreatic carcinoma lesions. Therefore, we have assessed the efficacy of positron emission tomography and computer tomography (PET/CT) imaging with β-O-D-galactopyranosyl-(1,4′)-2′-deoxy-2′-[18F]fluoroethyl-D-glucopyranose ([18F]FEDL) for detection of less than 3 mm orthotopic xenografts of L3.6pl pancreatic carcinomas in mice. [18F]FEDL is a novel radioligand of hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/pancreatitis-associated protein (HIP/PAP), which is overexpressed in peritumoral pancreatic acinar cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Dynamic PET/CT imaging demonstrated rapid accumulation of [18F]FEDL in peritumoral pancreatic tissue (4.04±2.06%ID/g), bi-exponential blood clearance with half-lives of 1.65±0.50 min and 14.14±3.60 min, and rapid elimination from other organs and tissues, predominantly by renal clearance. Using model-independent graphical analysis of dynamic PET data, the average distribution volume ratio (DVR) for [18F]FEDL in peritumoral pancreatic tissue was estimated as 3.57±0.60 and 0.94±0.72 in sham-operated control pancreas. Comparative analysis of quantitative autoradiographic images and densitometry of immunohistochemically stained and co-registered adjacent tissue sections demonstrated a strong linear correlation between the magnitude of [18F]FEDL binding and HIP/PAP expression in corresponding regions (r = 0.88). The in situ analysis demonstrated that at least a 2–4 fold apparent lesion size amplification was achieved for submillimeter tumors and to nearly half a murine pancreas for tumors larger than 3 mm. Conclusion/Significance We have demonstrated the feasibility of detection of early pancreatic tumors by non-invasive imaging with [18F]FEDL PET/CT of tumor biomarker HIP/PAP over-expressed in peritumoral pancreatic tissue. Non-invasive non-invasive detection of early pancreatic carcinomas with [18F]FEDL PET/CT imaging should aid the guidance of biopsies and additional imaging procedures, facilitate the resectability and improve the overall prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W1967066043,"Background Sulfur metabolism is required for initiation of cell division, but whether or not it can actively promote cell division remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that yeast cells with more mtDNA have an expanded reductive phase of their metabolic cycle and an increased sulfur metabolic flux. We also show that in wild type cells manipulations of sulfur metabolic flux phenocopy the enhanced growth rate of cells with more mtDNA. Furthermore, introduction of a hyperactive cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) allele in wild type cells accelerates initiation of DNA replication. Conclusions/Significance Our results reveal a novel connection between a key sulfur metabolic enzyme, CBS, and the cell cycle. Since the analogous hyperactive CBS allele in human CBS suppresses other disease-causing CBS mutations, our findings may be relevant for human pathology. Taken together, our results demonstrate the importance of sulfur metabolism in actively promoting initiation of cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2024994069,"CcdB(Vfi) from Vibrio fischeri is a member of the CcdB family of toxins that poison covalent gyrase-DNA complexes. In solution CcdB(Vfi) is a dimer that unfolds to the corresponding monomeric components in a two-state fashion. In the unfolded state, the monomer retains a partial secondary structure. This observation correlates well with the crystal and NMR structures of the protein, which show a dimer with a hydrophobic core crossing the dimer interface. In contrast to its F plasmid homologue, CcdB(Vfi) possesses a rigid dimer interface, and the apparent relative rotations of the two subunits are due to structural plasticity of the monomer. CcdB(Vfi) shows a number of non-conservative substitutions compared with the F plasmid protein in both the CcdA and the gyrase binding sites. Although variation in the CcdA interaction site likely determines toxin-antitoxin specificity, substitutions in the gyrase-interacting region may have more profound functional implications."
https://openalex.org/W2040084658,"Background Epidemiological studies suggest that allogeneic immunity may inhibit HIV-1 transmission from mother to baby and is less frequent in multiparous than uniparous women. Alloimmune responses may also be elicited during unprotected heterosexual intercourse, which is associated ex vivo with resistance to HIV infection. Methodology/Principal Findings The investigation was carried out in well-defined heterosexual and homosexual monogamous partners, practising unprotected sex and a heterosexual cohort practising protected sex. Allogeneic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferative responses were elicited by stimulating PBMC with the partners' irradiated monocytes and compared with 3rd party unrelated monocytes, using the CFSE method. Significant increase in allogeneic proliferative responses was found in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the partners' irradiated monocytes, as compared with 3rd party unrelated monocytes (p≤0.001). However, a significant decrease in proliferative responses, especially of CD8+ T cells to the partners' compared with 3rd party monocytes was consistent with tolerization, in both the heterosexual and homosexual partners (p<0.01). Examination of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells by flow cytometry revealed a significantly greater proportion of these cells in the homosexual than heterosexual partners practising unprotected sex (p<0.05). Ex vivo studies of infectivity of PBMC with HIV-1 showed significantly greater inhibition of infectivity of PBMC from heterosexual subjects practising unprotected compared with those practising protected sex (p = 0.02). Conclusions/Significance Both heterosexual and homosexual monogamous partners practising unprotected sex develop allogeneic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferative responses to the partners' unmatched cells and a minority may be tolerized. However, a greater proportion of homosexual rather than heterosexual partners developed CD4+CD25FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. These results, in addition to finding greater inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity in PBMC ex vivo in heterosexual partners practising unprotected, compared with those practising protected sex, suggest that allogeneic immunity may play a significant role in the immuno-pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection."

IntroductionSp/XKLF proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that share a highly conserved, carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain featuring three “zinc fingers” of the Cys2-His2 class (1Suske G. Bruford E. Philipsen S. Genomics. 2005; 85: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Chu S. Ferro T.J. Gene. 2005; 348: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Zhao C. Meng A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Four conserved nucleotides within each zinc finger specify the interaction of the DNA binding domain with a nonameric GC-rich sequence that is often located proximal to sites of transcriptional initiation. Sp proteins comprise one subfamily of Sp/XKLF proteins for which nine members (Sp1–Sp9) have been described in mammals. Each family member carries an amino-terminal trans-activation domain that is comprised of three subdomains, termed A, B, and C (4Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The A and B subdomains feature alternating regions enriched in glutamine or serine/threonine residues, whereas the C subdomain carries an abundance of charged amino acids (5Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 6Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Each subdomain is sufficient to drive transcription when tethered individually to a DNA binding domain, albeit to levels that are less significant than elicited when multiple subdomains are examined together. trans-Activation of target genes by Sp proteins is dependent on post-translational modifications as well as their physical interaction with each other, additional sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, and components of the basal transcription complex.The biochemical and functional properties of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 have been characterized most thoroughly, and each has been shown to regulate the expression of a constellation of genes involved in fundamental biological processes, including cell cycle control, differentiation, development, and oncogenesis (1Suske G. Bruford E. Philipsen S. Genomics. 2005; 85: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 7Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 8Philipsen S. Suske G.

Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 are expressed in many, if not all, mammalian tissues, whereas the expression of Sp4–9 is considerably more restricted. Sp-related proteins have been identified in a wide variety of species, including zebrafish and invertebrates, and mechanisms governing Sp-dependent transcription are evolutionarily conserved. For example, mammalian family members can at least partially supplant the functions of invertebrate orthologues (3Zhao C. Meng A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Wimmer E.A. Jäckle H. Pfeifle C. Cohen S.M.

Nature. 1994; 369: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The creation of animals that lack individual Sp family members has yielded valuable insights into their requirement for metazoan development. Sp1 nullizygous mice perish in mid-gestation and exhibit a broad range of severe developmental abnormalities (12Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). When analyzed in chimeric animals, loss of Sp1 function leads to a cell autonomous defect that prevents the contribution of Sp1 nullizygous cells to tissues (12Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, Sp1 appears to be superfluous for the growth and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells in vitro, and thus, at least some Sp1 functions can be provided by other transcription factors (12Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Sp3 nullizygotes exhibit post-natal lethality due to respiratory failure as well as profound deficiencies in tooth, bone, and hematopoietic development (13Bouwman P. Göllner H. Elsässer H.P.

Thus, although the functions of Sp proteins may partially overlap, it is clear that each performs duties that cannot be provided by other Sp family members or unrelated transcription factors.Sp2 is an enigmatic member of the Sp family that has yielded few insights into its role(s) in cell or organismal physiology (30Phan D.

Studies examining Sp2 function(s) in vivo have not as yet been reported, nor has Sp2 been determined to be required for vertebrate development. The Sp2 DNA-binding domain is the least conserved (75%) among Sp family members. Utilizing a PCR-based protocol and recombinant human Sp2 protein, we identified a consensus Sp2 DNA-binding site (5′-GGGCGGGAC-3′) that is bound with high affinity (Kd = 225 pm) in vitro and is distinct from a consensus site developed for Sp1 (31Moorefield K.S. Fry S.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13911-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Shi Y. Berg J.M. Chem.

Yet, in transient transfection assays, Sp2 only weakly trans-activates promoters carrying consensus Sp2-binding sites or well characterized Sp-dependent promoters that are readily induced by Sp1 and Sp3 (31Moorefield K.S. Fry S.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13911-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4, little or no soluble Sp2 DNA binding activity has been detected in many human and mouse cell lines despite its widespread expression (31Moorefield K.S. Fry S.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13911-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To identify domains of Sp2 that limit its capacity to stimulate transcription and/or bind DNA, we prepared and characterized the activities of chimeric molecules in which portions of Sp1 and Sp2 were exchanged. Studies using Sp1/Sp2 chimeras revealed that the Sp2 trans-activation and DNA binding domains are each negatively regulated in vitro, and further analyzes have shown that each of these domains carries amino acid sequences that independently target Sp2 to the nuclear matrix (32Moorefield K.S. Yin H. Nichols T.D. Cathcart C. Simmons S.O. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains uncertain whether the tethering of Sp2 to the nuclear matrix accounts for the limited capacities of Sp2 to bind DNA and stimulate transcription.As a first step toward identifying Sp2 functions in vivo, we wished to determine whether Sp2 is an essential gene. One adopted strategy was to isolate the zebrafish Sp2 orthologue, determine its pattern of expression, and then eliminate Sp2 function via microinjection of gene-specific morpholinos. As a consequence of these studies we report that 1) the structures and functions of zebrafish and mammalian Sp2 are closely conserved, 2) zebrafish Sp2 is a maternally inherited transcript, is transcribed in embryos as well as adult tissues, and is required for the completion of gastrulation, and 3) a transgene governed by the zebrafish Sp2 promoter faithfully recapitulates patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression.DISCUSSIONThe Sp family of transcription factors has been shown to regulate the expression of a diverse set of genes required for cell-cycle progression, differentiation, apoptosis, and general “housekeeping” functions. A subset of Sp family members has been shown to be essential for development, whereas others have been shown to be required for the specification and maturation of specific tissues. Before the work reported here, little was known about the expression of Sp2 in vivo or its requirement for metazoan development. As part of an ongoing effort to study Sp2, we identified a zebrafish Sp2 orthologue and analyzed its functional properties, patterns of expression, and requirement for zebrafish development. These efforts have led to a number of interesting findings. First, consistent with its conserved amino acid sequence, zebrafish Sp2 was shown to be functionally analogous to its mammalian orthologues with respect to subnuclear localization and trans-activation. Second, zebrafish Sp2 is a maternally inherited message, and Sp2 transcription can be detected within blastula stage embryos as well as subsequent stages of development and in adult tissues. Third, a genomic fragment with Sp2 promoter activity was identified, and transgenic animals carrying an Sp2 promoter-dependent reporter gene recapitulated patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression. Finally, one- to two-cell stage zebrafish embryos microinjected with Sp2-specific morpholinos led to the arrest of embryonic developmental in gastrulation (50–75% epiboly).Despite intensive investigations into the biochemical and functional properties of Sp2, its role in cell or organismal physiology has remained uncertain. Widely expressed in human and mouse cell lines, little or no soluble Sp2 DNA binding activity has been detected in these settings (31Moorefield K.S. Fry S.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13911-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The vast majority of human Sp2 is associated with the nuclear matrix in foci (nuclear speckles) that are distinct from promyelocytic oncogenic domains and are largely invariant in size and distribution as a function of cell-cycle progression (32Moorefield K.S. Yin H. Nichols T.D. Cathcart C. Simmons S.O. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A high affinity, consensus Sp2 DNA-binding site (5′-GGGCGGGAC-3′) has been identified for recombinant human Sp2 protein using a PCR-assisted cloning strategy, yet Sp2 has shown little or no capacity to trans-activate promoters carrying consensus DNA-binding sites in transient-transfection experiments (31Moorefield K.S. Fry S.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13911-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Careful analyses of Sp1/Sp2 chimeras have shown that this is due to the negative regulation of the Sp2 trans-activation and DNA binding domains in vivo. Moreover, each of these domains carries sequences (nuclear matrix targeting sequences) that function to tether Sp2 to the nuclear matrix (32Moorefield K.S. Yin H. Nichols T.D. Cathcart C. Simmons S.O. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these biochemical and functional properties distinguishes Sp2 from other Sp family members, and as a consequence we have argued that Sp2 is likely to play a unique role in cell and/or organismal physiology. Given its structural and sequence homology with mammalian Sp2, it is perhaps not surprising that zebrafish Sp2 shares these biochemical and functional hallmarks. Yet, the work reported herein extends these findings significantly by revealing that Sp2 is a maternally inherited message that is required for the completion of gastrulation.RT-PCR results indicate that unfertilized zebrafish oocytes are enriched for Sp2 mRNA. Sp2 message levels appear to diminish after fertilization, eventually stabilizing and remaining at constant levels throughout development and in adult tissues. To begin to define sequences required for Sp2 expression, a genomic fragment adjacent to the zebrafish Sp2 transcriptional start site was isolated and analyzed for promoter activity in transient transfection assays. This 1175-bp fragment stimulated transcription in zebrafish Zf4 cells, and in vitro promoter activity was delimited to a 315-bp fragment proximal to the Sp2 transcriptional start site. This proximal region carries putative CAAT-boxes, lacks an obvious TATA box, and possessed limited sequence homology with analogous genomic sequences upstream of the major transcriptional start sites for human and mouse Sp2. To determine whether sequences necessary to recapitulate patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression were carried by the 1175-bp genomic fragment, transgenic zebrafish lines were prepared in which the expression of an mCherry reporter gene was directed by the Sp2 promoter. Consistent with patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression, mCherry was detected uniformly throughout early embryos and became concentrated in the head region by 24 h post-fertilization. Overall mCherry expression diminished to a low level by 4 days post-fertilization, except within the developing kidney, where robust Sp2 expression was detected in the glomerulus, pronephric tubules, and ducts. Indeed, expression of Sp2 in these regions of the kidney was indistinguishable from CDH17, a well characterized zebrafish kidney marker (48Horsfield J. Ramachandran A. Reuter K. LaVallie E. Collins-Racie L. Crosier K. Crosier P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sp2-directed mCherry expression in adults was quite low with the exception of the ovary, where mCherry was expressed strongly in developing oocytes. This concentration of mCherry expression in the adult ovary is consistent with the observation that Sp2 message is maternally inherited. Using mCherry-specific primers and RNAs prepared from embryos fertilized by transgenic males, transcription directed by the Sp2 promoter can be detected as early as the blastula (256–1000 cells) stage. Thus, we conclude that the Sp2 genomic fragment employed to generate these transgenic animals carries all sequences necessary to promote embryonic as well as tissue-specific expression in adult animals.Given their ease of observation and manipulation, zebrafish embryos have provided valuable insights into expression patterns and functions of a variety of transcription factors, including Sp family members. Two orthologues of Sp5, sp5 (also known as bts1) and sp5l (also known as spr2), have been studied in zebrafish. Each is expressed in late blastula stage embryos and is responsible for mediating the induction of mesoderm and neuroectoderm by the Wnt/β-catenin and fibroblast growth factor signaling pathways (20Tallafuss A. Wilm T.P. Crozatier M. Pfeffer P. Wassef M. Bally-Cuif L. Development. 2001; 128: 4021-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Thorpe C.J. Weidinger G. Moon R.T.

Elimination of sp5 causes modest patterning defects of the mesoderm, whereas loss of sp5l does not result in embryos carrying obvious developmental defects. Consistent with the conclusion that the functions of sp5 and sp5l may partially overlap, their simultaneous elimination leads to mesodermal defects that are significantly more severe. Sp8 and Sp9 are expressed during zebrafish somitogenesis within the developing central nervous system and fin buds. Elimination of Sp9 expression in early embryos results in major defects in neurogenesis and brain segmentation, whereas loss of Sp8 and Sp9 expression in 2-day-old embryos is correlated with defects in fin outgrowth (49Kawakami Y.

Yang Z. Bricaud O. Collazo A. Meng A. Lin S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As for sp5 and sp5l, Sp8 and Sp9 are regulated by Wnt/β-catenin and fibroblast growth factor signals released by the mesenchyme to induce fin development (49Kawakami Y. Esteban C.R. Matsui T. Rodríguez-León J. Kato S. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C.I. Development. 2004; 131: 4763-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast to these Sp family members, the requirement for Sp2 function appears earlier in development and more absolute. More than 95% of embryos microinjected with three independent Sp2 morpholinos arrested development before the completion of gastrulation (50–75% epiboly). These results indicate in dramatic fashion that Sp2 is required for one or more functions in early embryonic development that cannot be supplanted by other Sp family members or unrelated transcription factors. These critical functions remain to be discovered; however, they are likely to be evolutionarily conserved. In parallel with studies reported here, we have generated a mouse line that is conditionally nullizygous for Sp2 function and have shown that Sp2 is also required for early mammalian development. 3H. Yin and J. M. Horowitz, personal communication. Taken together, results from distinct species indicate that Sp2 may be unique among Sp family members in its absolute requirement at the earliest stages of metazoan development. It will be of interest to identify key embryonic targets of Sp2 function as well as determine whether Sp2 is required later in life for the development and/or maintenance of adult tissues. IntroductionSp/XKLF proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that share a highly conserved, carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain featuring three “zinc fingers” of the Cys2-His2 class (1Suske G. Bruford E. Philipsen S. Genomics. 2005; 85: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Chu S. Ferro T.J. Gene. 2005; 348: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Zhao C. Meng A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Four conserved nucleotides within each zinc finger specify the interaction of the DNA binding domain with a nonameric GC-rich sequence that is often located proximal to sites of transcriptional initiation. Sp proteins comprise one subfamily of Sp/XKLF proteins for which nine members (Sp1–Sp9) have been described in mammals. Each family member carries an amino-terminal trans-activation domain that is comprised of three subdomains, termed A, B, and C (4Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The A and B subdomains feature alternating regions enriched in glutamine or serine/threonine residues, whereas the C subdomain carries an abundance of charged amino acids (5Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 6Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Each subdomain is sufficient to drive transcription when tethered individually to a DNA binding domain, albeit to levels that are less significant than elicited when multiple subdomains are examined together. trans-Activation of target genes by Sp proteins is dependent on post-translational modifications as well as their physical interaction with each other, additional sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, and components of the basal transcription complex.The biochemical and functional properties of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 have been characterized most thoroughly, and each has been shown to regulate the expression of a constellation of genes involved in fundamental biological processes, including cell cycle control, differentiation, development, and oncogenesis (1Suske G. Bruford E. Philipsen S. Genomics. 2005; 85: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 7Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 8Philipsen S. Suske G.

Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 are expressed in many, if not all, mammalian tissues, whereas the expression of Sp4–9 is considerably more restricted. Sp-related proteins have been identified in a wide variety of species, including zebrafish and invertebrates, and mechanisms governing Sp-dependent transcription are evolutionarily conserved. For example, mammalian family members can at least partially supplant the functions of invertebrate orthologues (3Zhao C. Meng A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Wimmer E.A. Jäckle H. Pfeifle C. Cohen S.M.

Nature. 1994; 369: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The creation of animals that lack individual Sp family members has yielded valuable insights into their requirement for metazoan development. Sp1 nullizygous mice perish in mid-gestation and exhibit a broad range of severe developmental abnormalities (12Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). When analyzed in chimeric animals, loss of Sp1 function leads to a cell autonomous defect that prevents the contribution of Sp1 nullizygous cells to tissues (12Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, Sp1 appears to be superfluous for the growth and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells in vitro, and thus, at least some Sp1 functions can be provided by other transcription factors (12Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Sp3 nullizygotes exhibit post-natal lethality due to respiratory failure as well as profound deficiencies in tooth, bone, and hematopoietic development (13Bouwman P. Göllner H. Elsässer H.P.

Studies examining Sp2 function(s) in vivo have not as yet been reported, nor has Sp2 been determined to be required for vertebrate development. The Sp2 DNA-binding domain is the least conserved (75%) among Sp family members. Utilizing a PCR-based protocol and recombinant human Sp2 protein, we identified a consensus Sp2 DNA-binding site (5′-GGGCGGGAC-3′) that is bound with high affinity (Kd = 225 pm) in vitro and is distinct from a consensus site developed for Sp1 (31Moorefield K.S.

Yet, in transient transfection assays, Sp2 only weakly trans-activates promoters carrying consensus Sp2-binding sites or well characterized Sp-dependent promoters that are readily induced by Sp1 and Sp3 (31Moorefield K.S. Fry S.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13911-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4, little or no soluble Sp2 DNA binding activity has been detected in many human and mouse cell lines despite its widespread expression (31Moorefield K.S. Fry S.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13911-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To identify domains of Sp2 that limit its capacity to stimulate transcription and/or bind DNA, we prepared and characterized the activities of chimeric molecules in which portions of Sp1 and Sp2 were exchanged. Studies using Sp1/Sp2 chimeras revealed that the Sp2 trans-activation and DNA binding domains are each negatively regulated in vitro, and further analyzes have shown that each of these domains carries amino acid sequences that independently target Sp2 to the nuclear matrix (32Moorefield K.S. Yin H. Nichols T.D. Cathcart C. Simmons S.O. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains uncertain whether the tethering of Sp2 to the nuclear matrix accounts for the limited capacities of Sp2 to bind DNA and stimulate transcription.As a first step toward identifying Sp2 functions in vivo, we wished to determine whether Sp2 is an essential gene. One adopted strategy was to isolate the zebrafish Sp2 orthologue, determine its pattern of expression, and then eliminate Sp2 function via microinjection of gene-specific morpholinos. As a consequence of these studies we report that 1) the structures and functions of zebrafish and mammalian Sp2 are closely conserved, 2) zebrafish Sp2 is a maternally inherited transcript, is transcribed in embryos as well as adult tissues, and is required for the completion of gastrulation, and 3) a transgene governed by the zebrafish Sp2 promoter faithfully recapitulates patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2122979648,"Understanding the behavior of birds in agricultural habitats can be the first step in evaluating the conservation implications of birds' use of landscapes shaped by modern agriculture. The existence and magnitude of risk from agricultural practices and the quality of resources agricultural lands provide will be determined largely by how birds use these habitats. Buff-breasted Sandpipers (Tryngites subruficollis) are a species of conservation concern. During spring migration large numbers of Buff-breasted Sandpipers stopover in row crop fields in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska. We used behavioral observations as a first step in evaluating how Buff-breasted Sandpipers use crop fields during migratory stopover.We measured behavior during migratory stopover using scan and focal individual sampling to determine how birds were using crop fields. Foraging was the most frequent behavior observed, but the intensity of foraging changed over the course of the day with a distinct mid-day low point. Relative to other migrating shorebirds, Buff-breasted Sandpipers spent a significant proportion of their time in social interactions including courtship displays.Our results show that the primary use of upland agricultural fields by migrating Buff-breasted Sandpipers is foraging while wetlands are used for maintenance and resting. The importance of foraging in row crop fields suggests that both the quality of food resources available in fields and the possible risks from dietary exposure to agricultural chemicals will be important to consider when developing conservation plans for Buff-breasted Sandpipers migrating through the Great Plains."
https://openalex.org/W2097036766,"Existing mathematical models for scrapie dynamics in sheep populations assume that the PrP gene is only associated with scrapie susceptibility and with no other fitness related traits. This assumption contrasts recent findings of PrP gene associations with post-natal lamb survival in scrapie free Scottish Blackface populations. Lambs with scrapie resistant genotypes were found to have significantly lower survival rates than those with susceptible genotypes. The present study aimed to investigate how these conflicting PrP gene associations may affect the dynamic patterns of PrP haplotype frequencies and disease prevalence.A deterministic mathematical model was developed to explore how the associations between PrP genotype and both scrapie susceptibility and postnatal lamb mortality affect the prevalence of scrapie and the associated change in PrP gene frequencies in a closed flock of sheep. The model incorporates empirical evidence on epidemiological and biological characteristics of scrapie and on mortality rates induced by causes other than scrapie. The model results indicate that unfavorable associations of the scrapie resistant PrP haplotypes with post-natal lamb mortality, if sufficiently strong, can increase scrapie prevalence during an epidemic, and result in scrapie persisting in the population. The range of model parameters, for which such effects were observed, is realistic but relatively narrow.The results of the present model suggest that for most parameter combinations an unfavourable association between PrP genotype and post-natal lamb mortality does not greatly alter the dynamics of scrapie and, hence, would not have an adverse impact on a breeding programme. There were, however, a range of scenarios, narrow, but realistic, in which such an unfavourable association resulted in an increased prevalence and in the persistence of infection. Consequently, associations between PrP genotypes and fitness traits should be taken into account when designing future models and breeding programmes."
