Bilateral injections of puromycin involving the hippocampi and adjacent temporal cortices caused loss of short-term memory; consistent loss of longer-term memory required injections involving, in addition, most of the remaining cortices. Spread of the effective memory trace from the temporal-hippocampal areas to wide areas of the cortices appears to require 3 to 6 days, depending upon the individual animal. Recent reversal learning was lost while longer-term initial learning was retained after bilateral injections into the hippocampal-temporal areas."

We postulate that a generalized Papez circuit mediates the thirst drive, that the circuit is specifically and functionally sensitive to cholinergic action, and that other primary drives depend on closely parallel neural circuits partitioned both structurally and biochemically."

https://openalex.org/W2070216083,Electroencephalographic recordings made from chronically implanted cortical electrodes indicate that ionizing radiation has an immediate effect upon brain wave patterns. X-rays delivered at the rate of 0.2 roentgen per second produce an arousal effect resembling that which occurs as a result of stimulation through peripheral receptor systems.

https://openalex.org/W1966306846,"Repeated administration of the phenothiazine derivatives chlorpromazine and promazine increased the toxicity of a single dose of parathion in male rats. In female rats, a single dose of 5 mg/kg of promazine increased the toxicity of a single dose of parathion, but had no apparent effect on the toxicity of a single dose of Phosdrin. Repeated dosage with chlorpromazine and atropine, or promazine and atropine, after administration of parathion at the same rate, resulted in a slightly higher mortality in female rats than did atropine or no treatment."

It is found that glycine and some other amino acids penetrate mitochondria freely at very low concentrations, and that this penetration decreases when the external concentration of amino acids is increased, or in the presence of anesthetics. Possible mechanisms of this behavior and its significance as a homeostatic mechanism are discussed. REFERENCES 1. GARFINKEL, D., AND LAJTHA, A., J. Biol. Chem., 238, 2429 (1963). 2.

The mean value for females heterozygous for the Christmas gene was about half the mean values for normal males and for normal homozygous females; means for the latter two groups were about equal. This dosage compensation is interpreted as evidence in support of Lyon's hypothesis, according to which one X chromosome is inactive in mammalian females."

Non-pregnant hamsters are refractory both to colchicine and endotoxin. The superiority of colchicine, as opposed to foreign endotoxin, in the pregnant subject, may be attributed to the action of native endotoxin which is allowed parenteral access as a result of colchicine-induced injury to the intestinal mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W1992514377,"Responses from motor cortex evoked by cerebellar stimulation have been recorded with chronically implanted electrodes from cats in different states of arousal. The response, which in the waking cat consists of a short latency biphasic component followed by one or more slower waves, was attenuated, or abolished completely, in association with electroencephalographic and behavioral signs of decreased arousal. In contrast, responses in primary somatosensory cortex evoked by stimulating the bulbar trigeminal nucleus were enhanced during periods of decreased alertness."

https://openalex.org/W2026907911,"INVESTIGATIONS of acid hydrolysates of wool labelled with sulphur-35, and of non-radioactive wool hydrolysed with 35S-cystine, have shown the presence of unidentified sulphur compounds derived from cystine1,2. The most abundant of these (I) increased in amount with increasing time of hydrolysis up to 100 hr., when about one-tenth of the original sulphur in wool was present as (I). Somewhat smaller amounts of (I), representing about one-fiftieth of the protein sulphur, were found in acid hydrolysates of insulin, ribonuclease and bovine serum albumin, but none could be detected in hydrolysates of lysozyme and β-lactoglobulin."

For radioactive components of such ink, non-volatile compounds of carbon-14 or sulphur-35 have been suggested, but suitable materials are expensive so that a cheaper alternative was sought."

For a number of glycosides the mechanism of the acidic and/or enzymatic hydrolysis has been investigated1–8. Since it became possible to prepare highly purified glucamylase it was interesting to investigate the cleavage point when this enzyme acts on maltose."

https://openalex.org/W1986100151,"IN an earlier communication we reported that rats fed a diet containing 2 per cent of DL-α-guanidinopropionic acid (alacreatine) develop weakness during a 6-week period1. In subsequent work we have been unable to demonstrate either a defect in creatine metabolism in these animals or improvement of the weakness by creatine administration. Because of an odour which suggested the presence of a sulphur-containing compound in the alacreatine preparation further experiments were done with highly purified odourless alacreatine. None of the animals receiving the purified alacreatine became weak. It thus appears that the weakness was not caused by alacreatine, but by an impurity. The impurity has not been identified. However, various isothiourea and guanidine derivatives are known to be toxic in acute dose2 and such compounds could have been present in the original preparations of alacreatine."

Some evidence supports this assumption: the titres of certain antibodies or of rheumatoid factor, for example, remain unaltered after even several years in a deep freeze. This communication shows that most human sera, from both healthy and sick people, contain an α-2 globulin which loses its antigenic (precipitin) characteristics after prolonged storage at −20° C."
