https://openalex.org/W2067107606,"Although p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis serve as critical barriers to cancer development, emerging evidence suggests that the metabolic activities of p53 are also important. Here we show that p53 inhibits cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death, by repressing expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter. Notably, p533KR, an acetylation-defective mutant that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, fully retains the ability to regulate SLC7A11 expression and induce ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Analysis of mutant mice shows that these non-canonical p53 activities contribute to embryonic development and the lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Moreover, SLC7A11 is highly expressed in human tumours, and its overexpression inhibits ROS-induced ferroptosis and abrogates p533KR-mediated tumour growth suppression in xenograft models. Our findings uncover a new mode of tumour suppression based on p53 regulation of cystine metabolism, ROS responses and ferroptosis. p53 suppresses expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate amino acid transport machinery, leading to inhibition of cystine uptake and promoting ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. The tumour suppressor activity of the transcription factor p53 is typically thought to reflect its ability to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence in response to cellular stress, but there is emerging evidence for other activities of p53. Here Wei Gu and colleagues show that a metabolic target of p53 can also contribute to its tumour suppressor activity. In particular, they find that p53 suppresses expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate amino acid transport machinery. This leads to inhibition of cystine uptake and promotes ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. This previously unrecognized function of p53 seems to be important in tumour suppression, particularly when other pathways are inoperative."
https://openalex.org/W2041328373,"The addition of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mark to primary microRNAs by METTL3 in mammalian cells is found to promote the recognition of these microRNA precursors by DGCR8, a component of the microprocessor complex. While N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) modification of RNA has been known since the 1970s, it was only recently, with the transcriptome-wide characterization of its pervasiveness, that much attention turned to its role in regulating cellular events. Sohail Tavazoie and colleagues have found that the addition of an m6A mark to primary microRNAs (miRNAs) by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is required for their recognition by DGCR8, the hairpin-binding component of the microprocessor complex. Consequently, in the absence of METTL3, the biogenesis of mature miRNAs is impeded globally in a cell-type-independent manner. One possible role of such a nuclear m6A mark is to distinguish genuine precursors from random RNAs with secondary structure. Altered METTL3 expression has been reported in various human cancers, suggesting a possible link to aberrant expression of miRNAs in cancerous cells. The first step in the biogenesis of microRNAs is the processing of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by the microprocessor complex, composed of the RNA-binding protein DGCR8 and the type III RNase DROSHA1,2,3,4. This initial event requires recognition of the junction between the stem and the flanking single-stranded RNA of the pri-miRNA hairpin by DGCR8 followed by recruitment of DROSHA, which cleaves the RNA duplex to yield the pre-miRNA product5. While the mechanisms underlying pri-miRNA processing have been determined, the mechanism by which DGCR8 recognizes and binds pri-miRNAs, as opposed to other secondary structures present in transcripts, is not understood. Here we find in mammalian cells that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) methylates pri-miRNAs, marking them for recognition and processing by DGCR8. Consistent with this, METTL3 depletion reduced the binding of DGCR8 to pri-miRNAs and resulted in the global reduction of mature miRNAs and concomitant accumulation of unprocessed pri-miRNAs. In vitro processing reactions confirmed the sufficiency of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mark in promoting pri-miRNA processing. Finally, gain-of-function experiments revealed that METTL3 is sufficient to enhance miRNA maturation in a global and non-cell-type-specific manner. Our findings reveal that the m6A mark acts as a key post-transcriptional modification that promotes the initiation of miRNA biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1974454061,"The single-stranded nature of RNAs synthesized in the cell gives them great scope to form different structures, but current methods to measure RNA structure in vivo are limited; now, a new methodology allows researchers to examine all four nucleotides in mouse embryonic stem cells. The single-stranded nature of cellular RNAs allows them flexibility to adopt different secondary structures that can affect their function. However, current methods of measuring RNA structure in vivo are limited. Two papers published in this week's issue of Nature present new techniques to address this gap. Howard Chang and colleagues have exploited a click methodology that enables the first global view of RNA secondary structures in living cells for all four bases. While some structures are stable and seem to be programmed by sequence, others are dynamic, reflecting the binding of proteins or modification of the bases. This method may allow RNA to be analysed in vivo from a structural genomics perspective. In the second study, Jernej Ule and colleagues have developed a method, hiCLIP, to specifically measure RNA structures bound by proteins. Various features are observed, such as a preference for intramolecular interactions and an under-representation of structures in coding regions. The results confirm that RNA structure is able to regulate gene expression. While the functional significance is not known, it is notable that SNPs are not present at the expected frequency in coding regions. Visualizing the physical basis for molecular behaviour inside living cells is a great challenge for biology. RNAs are central to biological regulation, and the ability of RNA to adopt specific structures intimately controls every step of the gene expression program1. However, our understanding of physiological RNA structures is limited; current in vivo RNA structure profiles include only two of the four nucleotides that make up RNA2,3. Here we present a novel biochemical approach, in vivo click selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiment (icSHAPE), which enables the first global view, to our knowledge, of RNA secondary structures in living cells for all four bases. icSHAPE of the mouse embryonic stem cell transcriptome versus purified RNA folded in vitro shows that the structural dynamics of RNA in the cellular environment distinguish different classes of RNAs and regulatory elements. Structural signatures at translational start sites and ribosome pause sites are conserved from in vitro conditions, suggesting that these RNA elements are programmed by sequence. In contrast, focal structural rearrangements in vivo reveal precise interfaces of RNA with RNA-binding proteins or RNA-modification sites that are consistent with atomic-resolution structural data. Such dynamic structural footprints enable accurate prediction of RNA–protein interactions and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification genome wide. These results open the door for structural genomics of RNA in living cells and reveal key physiological structures controlling gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2058957446,"Error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is achieved by homologous recombination (HR), and BRCA1 is an important factor for this repair pathway. In the absence of BRCA1-mediated HR, the administration of PARP inhibitors induces synthetic lethality of tumour cells of patients with breast or ovarian cancers. Despite the benefit of this tailored therapy, drug resistance can occur by HR restoration. Genetic reversion of BRCA1-inactivating mutations can be the underlying mechanism of drug resistance, but this does not explain resistance in all cases. In particular, little is known about BRCA1-independent restoration of HR. Here we show that loss of REV7 (also known as MAD2L2) in mouse and human cell lines re-establishes CTIP-dependent end resection of DSBs in BRCA1-deficient cells, leading to HR restoration and PARP inhibitor resistance, which is reversed by ATM kinase inhibition. REV7 is recruited to DSBs in a manner dependent on the H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-RNF168-53BP1 chromatin pathway, and seems to block HR and promote end joining in addition to its regulatory role in DNA damage tolerance. Finally, we establish that REV7 blocks DSB resection to promote non-homologous end-joining during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Our results reveal an unexpected crucial function of REV7 downstream of 53BP1 in coordinating pathological DSB repair pathway choices in BRCA1-deficient cells."

https://openalex.org/W2072153595,"Adult stem cells occur in niches that balance self-renewal with lineage selection and progression during tissue homeostasis. Following injury, culture or transplantation, stem cells outside their niche often display fate flexibility. Here we show that super-enhancers underlie the identity, lineage commitment and plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo. Using hair follicle as a model, we map the global chromatin domains of hair follicle stem cells and their committed progenitors in their native microenvironments. We show that super-enhancers and their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo remodelling upon lineage progression. New fate is acquired by decommissioning old and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another. We further show that when outside their niche, either in vitro or in wound-repair, hair follicle stem cells dynamically remodel super-enhancers in response to changes in their microenvironment. Intriguingly, some key super-enhancers shift epicentres, enabling their genes to remain active and maintain a transitional state in an ever-changing transcriptional landscape. Finally, we identify SOX9 as a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1981435333,"While thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, few lncRNAs that control neural stem cell (NSC) behavior are known. Here, we identify Pinky (Pnky) as a neural-specific lncRNA that regulates neurogenesis from NSCs in the embryonic and postnatal brain. In postnatal NSCs, Pnky knockdown potentiates neuronal lineage commitment and expands the transit-amplifying cell population, increasing neuron production several-fold. Pnky is evolutionarily conserved and expressed in NSCs of the developing human brain. In the embryonic mouse cortex, Pnky knockdown increases neuronal differentiation and depletes the NSC population. Pnky interacts with the splicing regulator PTBP1, and PTBP1 knockdown also enhances neurogenesis. In NSCs, Pnky and PTBP1 regulate the expression and alternative splicing of a core set of transcripts that relates to the cellular phenotype. These data thus unveil Pnky as a conserved lncRNA that interacts with a key RNA processing factor and regulates neurogenesis from embryonic and postnatal NSC populations."
https://openalex.org/W2020159180,"The inhibition, in mice, of the phosphodiesterase PDE9A, which specifically regulates natriuretic-peptide-coupled cGMP signalling, is independent of nitric oxide and is upregulated in failing human hearts, and can reverse pre-established stress-induced heart disease. Work in animals has shown that inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) with, for example, Viagra, can protect the heart from pathological stress by preventing the degradation of nitric-oxide-generated cGMP. However, nitric oxide signalling is often depressed in cardiovascular disease, potentially explaining the disappointing results of PDE5A inhibition in clinical trials. David Kass and colleagues now identify an alternative target, PDE9A, which specifically regulates natriuretic-peptide-coupled cGMP signalling, and is independent of nitric oxide. They show that PDE9A is upregulated in failing human hearts and that its inhibition in mice can reverse pre-established stress-induced heart disease. PDE9A inhibitors seem to be well tolerated in humans and are being investigated in clinical trials for neurocognitive disease. The new results suggest that these inhibitors may also find an application in heart disease. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a second messenger molecule that transduces nitric-oxide- and natriuretic-peptide-coupled signalling, stimulating phosphorylation changes by protein kinase G. Enhancing cGMP synthesis or blocking its degradation by phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) protects against cardiovascular disease1,2. However, cGMP stimulation alone is limited by counter-adaptions including PDE upregulation3. Furthermore, although PDE5A regulates nitric-oxide-generated cGMP4,5, nitric oxide signalling is often depressed by heart disease6. PDEs controlling natriuretic-peptide-coupled cGMP remain uncertain. Here we show that cGMP-selective PDE9A (refs 7, 8) is expressed in the mammalian heart, including humans, and is upregulated by hypertrophy and cardiac failure. PDE9A regulates natriuretic-peptide- rather than nitric-oxide-stimulated cGMP in heart myocytes and muscle, and its genetic or selective pharmacological inhibition protects against pathological responses to neurohormones, and sustained pressure-overload stress. PDE9A inhibition reverses pre-established heart disease independent of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, whereas PDE5A inhibition requires active NOS. Transcription factor activation and phosphoproteome analyses of myocytes with each PDE selectively inhibited reveals substantial differential targeting, with phosphorylation changes from PDE5A inhibition being more sensitive to NOS activation. Thus, unlike PDE5A, PDE9A can regulate cGMP signalling independent of the nitric oxide pathway, and its role in stress-induced heart disease suggests potential as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2106380482,"Protein sequences preserved in two Quaternary taxa, Macrauchenia and Toxodon, resolve the evolutionary history of South American native ungulates. When Charles Darwin first unearthed the remains of the South American native ungulates — herbivorous mammals that evolved in isolation on the South American continent for tens of millions of years — he declared them “the strangest animals ever discovered”. Their origins are obscured by rampant convergence of morphology, and work with ancient DNA has been similarly frustrating. Ian Barnes and colleagues have circumvented these problems by screening protein sequences preserved in two Quaternary taxa, Macrauchenia and Toxodon, to show that their closest relatives among other mammals are the Perissodactyls (odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinos) rather than among the Afrotheres (elephants, sirenians and allies). No large group of recently extinct placental mammals remains as evolutionarily cryptic as the approximately 280 genera grouped as ‘South American native ungulates’. To Charles Darwin1,2, who first collected their remains, they included perhaps the ‘strangest animal[s] ever discovered’. Today, much like 180 years ago, it is no clearer whether they had one origin or several, arose before or after the Cretaceous/Palaeogene transition 66.2 million years ago3, or are more likely to belong with the elephants and sirenians of superorder Afrotheria than with the euungulates (cattle, horses, and allies) of superorder Laurasiatheria4,5,6. Morphology-based analyses have proved unconvincing because convergences are pervasive among unrelated ungulate-like placentals. Approaches using ancient DNA have also been unsuccessful, probably because of rapid DNA degradation in semitropical and temperate deposits. Here we apply proteomic analysis to screen bone samples of the Late Quaternary South American native ungulate taxa Toxodon (Notoungulata) and Macrauchenia (Litopterna) for phylogenetically informative protein sequences. For each ungulate, we obtain approximately 90% direct sequence coverage of type I collagen α1- and α2-chains, representing approximately 900 of 1,140 amino-acid residues for each subunit. A phylogeny is estimated from an alignment of these fossil sequences with collagen (I) gene transcripts from available mammalian genomes or mass spectrometrically derived sequence data obtained for this study. The resulting consensus tree agrees well with recent higher-level mammalian phylogenies7,8,9. Toxodon and Macrauchenia form a monophyletic group whose sister taxon is not Afrotheria or any of its constituent clades as recently claimed5,6, but instead crown Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, and rhinoceroses). These results are consistent with the origin of at least some South American native ungulates4,6 from ‘condylarths’, a paraphyletic assembly of archaic placentals. With ongoing improvements in instrumentation and analytical procedures, proteomics may produce a revolution in systematics such as that achieved by genomics, but with the possibility of reaching much further back in time."
https://openalex.org/W2077715915,"MAD2L2 regulates DNA repair at deprotected telomeres and at ionizing-radiation-induced double-stranded DNA breaks by inhibiting resection of the 5′ ends; the ends are thus shunted into the non-homologous end-joining pathway. DNA polymerase ζ, composed of REV3, REV7 and an associated factor, REV1, mediates a type of DNA repair involving translesion synthesis, and hence its activity is highly mutagenic. Two studies exploring the DNA damage response have converged on REV7 (also known as MAD2L2) as a factor that, by itself, can promote maintenance of genome integrity. Several protective mechanisms that prevent telomere ends being recognized as a double-strand breaks (DSBs) and triggering an inappropriate DNA damage response were known. Jacqueline Jacobs and colleagues now show that REV7/MAD2L2 suppresses homology-dependent repair at deprotected telomeres and at irradiation-induced DSBs by inhibiting resection of the 5′ end. As a consequence, the ends are shunted into the non-homologous end-joining pathway. Sven Rottenberg and colleagues came to a similar conclusion by studying the development of resistance to PARP inhibitors. They found that REV7/MAD2L2 dictates pathway choice in BRCA-deficient cells and during immunoglobulin class switching. Appropriate repair of DNA lesions and the inhibition of DNA repair activities at telomeres are crucial to prevent genomic instability. By fuelling the generation of genetic alterations and by compromising cell viability, genomic instability is a driving force in cancer and ageing1,2. Here we identify MAD2L2 (also known as MAD2B or REV7) through functional genetic screening as a novel factor controlling DNA repair activities at mammalian telomeres. We show that MAD2L2 accumulates at uncapped telomeres and promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated fusion of deprotected chromosome ends and genomic instability. MAD2L2 depletion causes elongated 3′ telomeric overhangs, indicating that MAD2L2 inhibits 5′ end resection. End resection blocks NHEJ while committing to homology-directed repair, and is under the control of 53BP1, RIF1 and PTIP3. Consistent with MAD2L2 promoting NHEJ-mediated telomere fusion by inhibiting 5′ end resection, knockdown of the nucleases CTIP or EXO1 partially restores telomere-driven genomic instability in MAD2L2-depleted cells. Control of DNA repair by MAD2L2 is not limited to telomeres. MAD2L2 also accumulates and inhibits end resection at irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and promotes end-joining of DNA double-strand breaks in several settings, including during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. These activities of MAD2L2 depend on ATM kinase activity, RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1 and RIF1, but not on PTIP, REV1 and REV3, the latter two acting with MAD2L2 in translesion synthesis4. Together, our data establish MAD2L2 as a crucial contributor to the control of DNA repair activity by 53BP1 that promotes NHEJ by inhibiting 5′ end resection downstream of RIF1."

The structure of messenger RNA is important for post-transcriptional regulation, mainly because it affects binding of trans-acting factors1. However, little is known about the in vivo structure of full-length mRNAs. Here we present hiCLIP, a biochemical technique for transcriptome-wide identification of RNA secondary structures interacting with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Using this technique to investigate RNA structures bound by Staufen 1 (STAU1) in human cells, we uncover a dominance of intra-molecular RNA duplexes, a depletion of duplexes from coding regions of highly translated mRNAs, an unexpected prevalence of long-range duplexes in 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), and a decreased incidence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in duplex-forming regions. We also discover a duplex spanning 858 nucleotides in the 3′ UTR of the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA that regulates its cytoplasmic splicing and stability. Our study reveals the fundamental role of mRNA secondary structures in gene expression and introduces hiCLIP as a widely applicable method for discovering new, especially long-range, RNA duplexes."
https://openalex.org/W2036390749,"An environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis method has been recently developed to estimate the distribution of aquatic animals by quantifying the number of target DNA copies with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). A new quantitative PCR technology, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), partitions PCR reactions into thousands of droplets and detects the amplification in each droplet, thereby allowing direct quantification of target DNA. We evaluated the quantification accuracy of qPCR and ddPCR to estimate species abundance and biomass by using eDNA in mesocosm experiments involving different numbers of common carp. We found that ddPCR quantified the concentration of carp eDNA along with carp abundance and biomass more accurately than qPCR, especially at low eDNA concentrations. In addition, errors in the analysis were smaller in ddPCR than in qPCR. Thus, ddPCR is better suited to measure eDNA concentration in water, and it provides more accurate results for the abundance and biomass of the target species than qPCR. We also found that the relationship between carp abundance and eDNA concentration was stronger than that between biomass and eDNA by using both ddPCR and qPCR; this suggests that abundance can be better estimated by the analysis of eDNA for species with fewer variations in body mass."
https://openalex.org/W2018304908,"Germ cell specification is accompanied by epigenetic remodeling, the scale and specificity of which are unclear. Here, we quantitatively delineate chromatin dynamics during induction of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and from there into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), revealing large-scale reorganization of chromatin signatures including H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 patterns. EpiLCs contain abundant bivalent gene promoters characterized by low H3K27me3, indicating a state primed for differentiation. PGCLCs initially lose H3K4me3 from many bivalent genes but subsequently regain this mark with concomitant upregulation of H3K27me3, particularly at developmental regulatory genes. PGCLCs progressively lose H3K9me2, including at lamina-associated perinuclear heterochromatin, resulting in changes in nuclear architecture. T recruits H3K27ac to activate BLIMP1 and early mesodermal programs during PGCLC specification, which is followed by BLIMP1-mediated repression of a broad range of targets, possibly through recruitment and spreading of H3K27me3. These findings provide a foundation for reconstructing regulatory networks of the germline epigenome."
https://openalex.org/W1980698168,"This study combined high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), advanced chemometrics and pathway enrichment analysis to analyse the blood metabolome of patients attending the memory clinic: cases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 16), cases of MCI who upon subsequent follow-up developed Alzheimer’s disease (MCI_AD; n = 19), and healthy age-matched controls (Ctrl; n = 37). Plasma was extracted in acetonitrile and applied to an Acquity UPLC HILIC (1.7μm x 2.1 x 100 mm) column coupled to a Xevo G2 QTof mass spectrometer using a previously optimised method. Data comprising 6751 spectral features were used to build an OPLS-DA statistical model capable of accurately distinguishing Ctrl, MCI and MCI_AD. The model accurately distinguished (R2 = 99.1%; Q2 = 97%) those MCI patients who later went on to develop AD. S-plots were used to shortlist ions of interest which were responsible for explaining the maximum amount of variation between patient groups. Metabolite database searching and pathway enrichment analysis indicated disturbances in 22 biochemical pathways, and excitingly it discovered two interlinked areas of metabolism (polyamine metabolism and L-Arginine metabolism) were differentially disrupted in this well-defined clinical cohort. The optimised untargeted HRMS methods described herein not only demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish these pathologies in human blood but also that MCI patients ‘at risk’ from AD could be predicted up to 2 years earlier than conventional clinical diagnosis. Blood-based metabolite profiling of plasma from memory clinic patients is a novel and feasible approach in improving MCI and AD diagnosis and, refining clinical trials through better patient stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2074677800,"B cells are selected for an intermediate level of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signalling strength: attenuation below minimum (for example, non-functional BCR) or hyperactivation above maximum (for example, self-reactive BCR) thresholds of signalling strength causes negative selection. In ∼25% of cases, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells carry the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase (Philadelphia chromosome positive), which mimics constitutively active pre-BCR signalling. Current therapeutic approaches are largely focused on the development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to suppress oncogenic signalling below a minimum threshold for survival. We tested the hypothesis that targeted hyperactivation--above a maximum threshold--will engage a deletional checkpoint for removal of self-reactive B cells and selectively kill ALL cells. Here we find, by testing various components of proximal pre-BCR signalling in mouse BCR-ABL1 cells, that an incremental increase of Syk tyrosine kinase activity was required and sufficient to induce cell death. Hyperactive Syk was functionally equivalent to acute activation of a self-reactive BCR on ALL cells. Despite oncogenic transformation, this basic mechanism of negative selection was still functional in ALL cells. Unlike normal pre-B cells, patient-derived ALL cells express the inhibitory receptors PECAM1, CD300A and LAIR1 at high levels. Genetic studies revealed that Pecam1, Cd300a and Lair1 are critical to calibrate oncogenic signalling strength through recruitment of the inhibitory phosphatases Ptpn6 (ref. 7) and Inpp5d (ref. 8). Using a novel small-molecule inhibitor of INPP5D (also known as SHIP1), we demonstrated that pharmacological hyperactivation of SYK and engagement of negative B-cell selection represents a promising new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL."

https://openalex.org/W2034312395,"Circadian rhythms control a variety of physiological processes, but whether they may also time brain development remains largely unknown. Here, we show that circadian clock genes control the onset of critical period plasticity in the neocortex. Within visual cortex of Clock-deficient mice, the emergence of circadian gene expression was dampened, and the maturation of inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) cell networks slowed. Loss of visual acuity in response to brief monocular deprivation was concomitantly delayed and rescued by direct enhancement of GABAergic transmission. Conditional deletion of Clock or Bmal1 only within PV cells recapitulated the results of total Clock-deficient mice. Unique downstream gene sets controlling synaptic events and cellular homeostasis for proper maturation and maintenance were found to be mis-regulated by Clock deletion specifically within PV cells. These data demonstrate a developmental role for circadian clock genes outside the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which may contribute mis-timed brain plasticity in associated mental disorders."

Using inhibition of misfolded SOD1 deposition onto mitochondria as an assay, a chaperone activity abundant in nonneuronal tissues is now purified and identified to be the multifunctional macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), whose activities include an ATP-independent protein folding chaperone. Purified MIF is shown to directly inhibit mutant SOD1 misfolding. Elevating MIF in neuronal cells suppresses accumulation of misfolded SOD1 and its association with mitochondria and the ER and extends survival of mutant SOD1-expressing motor neurons. Accumulated MIF protein is identified to be low in motor neurons, implicating correspondingly low chaperone activity as a component of vulnerability to mutant SOD1 misfolding and supporting therapies to enhance intracellular MIF chaperone activity."

Two important components for tissue engineering of the spinal cord include a suitable cell source and scaffold. In our study, we investigated induced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) directly reprogrammed into neural stem cells (iNSCs), as a cell source. Three-dimensional (3D) electrospun poly (lactide-co-glycolide)/polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) nanofiber scaffolds were used for iNSCs adhesion and growth. Cell growth, survival and proliferation on the scaffolds were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nuclei staining were used to assess cell growth on the scaffolds. Scaffolds with iNSCs were then transplanted into transected rat spinal cords. Two or 8 weeks following transplantation, immunofluorescence was performed to determine iNSC survival and differentiation within the scaffolds. Functional recovery was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) Scale. Results indicated that iNSCs showed similar morphological features with wild-type neural stem cells (wt-NSCs), and expressed a variety of neural stem cell marker genes. Furthermore, iNSCs were shown to survive, with the ability to self-renew and undergo neural differentiation into neurons and glial cells within the 3D scaffolds in vivo. The iNSC-seeded scaffolds restored the continuity of the spinal cord and reduced cavity formation. Additionally, iNSC-seeded scaffolds contributed to functional recovery of the spinal cord. Therefore, PLGA-PEG scaffolds seeded with iNSCs may serve as promising supporting transplants for repairing spinal cord injury (SCI)."
https://openalex.org/W2092997109,"Organismal development requires the precise coordination of genetic programs to regulate cell fate and function. MEF2 transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in this process but how these broadly expressed factors contribute to the generation of specific cell types during development is poorly understood. Here we show that despite being expressed in virtually all mammalian tissues, in the retina MEF2D binds to retina-specific enhancers and controls photoreceptor cell development. MEF2D achieves specificity by cooperating with a retina-specific factor CRX, which recruits MEF2D away from canonical MEF2 binding sites and redirects it to retina-specific enhancers that lack the consensus MEF2-binding sequence. Once bound to retina-specific enhancers, MEF2D and CRX co-activate the expression of photoreceptor-specific genes that are critical for retinal function. These findings demonstrate that broadly expressed TFs acquire specific functions through competitive recruitment to enhancers by tissue-specific TFs and through selective activation of these enhancers to regulate tissue-specific genes."

Throughout the CNS, inhibitory GABAergic neurons play a crucial role in controlling neuronal output. Inhibitory control usually relies on diverse neuronal types, which exhibit distinct morphological and physiological properties as well as specific intricate wiring patterns (Briggman et al., 2011Briggman K.L.

Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). In the inner retina, laterally extending inhibitory amacrine cell networks made from diverse cell types (>35 types) control the vertical flow of visual information through the dozen or so types of excitatory bipolar cells that feed into output ganglion cells (MacNeil and Masland, 1998MacNeil M.A. Masland R.H. Extreme diversity among amacrine cells: implications for function.Neuron. 1998; 20: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Consequently, an average of ∼2–3 amacrine cells likely participate in a given ganglion cell microcircuit (Masland, 2012Masland R.H. The tasks of amacrine cells.Vis. Neurosci. 2012; 29: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). How the activity of multiple amacrine cells is coordinated to accomplish specific computations is only beginning to be understood (Roska et al., 2000Roska B. Nemeth E. Orzo L. Werblin F.S.

Here, we sought to define the functional and anatomical connectivity of multiple known types of amacrine cells controlling the directional selective (DS) circuit in the retina. It is now well established that directional tuning of ON and ON-OFF types of directionally selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) is shaped by local, asymmetric GABAergic inhibition mediated by starburst amacrine cells (SACs; Yoshida et al., 2001Yoshida K.

Less understood are sources of wide-field inhibition that control the DSGC’s response from considerable distances away from their receptive fields (Barlow and Levick, 1965Barlow H.B. Levick W.R.

While initial studies suggested that long range inhibition in the DS circuit is inextricably linked with DS inhibition itself (Wyatt and Daw, 1975Wyatt H.J. Daw N.W.

Neurophysiol. 1975; 38: 613-626PubMed Google Scholar), a number of more recent studies have provided indirect evidence that non-SACs participate in the DS circuit (Chiao and Masland, 2003Chiao C.C.

In other types of ganglion cells, a class of wide-field amacrine cells (WACs) has been implicated in mediating the surround (Farrow et al., 2013Farrow K. Teixeira M. Szikra T. Viney T.J. Balint K. Yonehara K. Roska B.

Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 4327-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, as WAC-mediated inhibition was found to be highly dependent on ambient light levels (Farrow et al., 2013Farrow K. Teixeira M. Szikra T. Viney T.J. Balint K. Yonehara K. Roska B. Ambient illumination toggles a neuronal circuit switch in the retina and visual perception at cone threshold.Neuron. 2013; 78: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it seemed unlikely they would participate in the DS circuit, as changes in WAC activity levels would be expected to alter the balance between excitation and inhibition and undermine directional selectivity. Alternatively, horizontal cells, which have been shown to control DSGC responses (Mangel, 1991Mangel S.C. Analysis of the horizontal cell contribution to the receptive field surround of ganglion cells in the rabbit retina.J. Physiol. 1991; 442: 211-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), could potentially mediate wide-field inhibition by modulating photoreceptor-to-bipolar cell synapses in the outer retina. In this study, we aim to identify the sources and possible functions for inhibition in the DS circuit of the mouse retina. We present several lines of physiological, pharmacological, and anatomical evidence to implicate a role for spiking GABAergic WACs in modulating the DS circuit. We show that through specific wiring to presynaptic elements of the DS circuit, WACs are able to control spatial selectivity in a manner that strongly depends on ambient illumination, without compromising the balance between inhibition and excitation required for direction coding. We found the relative amplitudes of spiking responses in DSGCs evoked by spots moving in eight directions (velocity 1,000 μm/s) remained constant regardless of the level of ambient illumination (Figures 1A and 1B ), resulting in a stable directionally selective index (DSi; where values near 1 indicate strong direction selectivity; Figure 1C). In contrast, we found wide-field inhibition evoked by large stationary spots to be strongly modulated by ambient illumination. Under dim ambient light levels (0.26–1.5 rod isomerizations s−1, [R∗/s]), spiking responses increased to an optimal size of 436 ± 59 μm (n = 11) and remained relatively constant thereafter (Figures 1D and 1E), indicating weak wide-field inhibition and poor spatial selectivity. The average spatial selectivity index (SSi; which is derived from responses to the optimal and largest size spots, where 0 indicates poor spatial selectivity and values near 1 indicate a strong selectivity; see Experimental Procedures) under dim light conditions was 0.19 ± 0.03 (n = 11). When ambient illumination was raised above ∼13 R∗/s (13–10,700 R∗/s; henceforth referred to as the “bright” condition), however, response amplitude increased more sharply with size up to an optimal spot diameter of 182 ± 20 μm (which was less than half of the optimal size measured under dim light conditions; n = 20; p < 0.005). Under these conditions, the optimal size closely matched the dendritic field size (Trenholm et al., 2011Trenholm S. Johnson K. Li X. Smith R.G. Awatramani G.B. Parallel mechanisms encode direction in the retina.Neuron. 2011; 71: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More strikingly, when the size of the spot was increased beyond an optimal size, the response amplitudes declined sharply, indicating the engagement of a wide-field suppressive surround mechanism (Figure 1E). The SSi under bright conditions was 0.68 ± 0.06 (n = 21), significantly higher than observed under dim light conditions (Figures 1E and 1F; p < 0.05). When SSi was plotted against ambient intensity, an abrupt transition was observed such that SSi increased from 0.18 ± 0.05 to 0.81 ± 0.08, over a 10-fold increase in ambient illumination (Figure 1F). The “switch” like behavior of was also observed in ON alpha-like ganglion cells at the same light level (SSi 0.23 ± 0.02 in 1.5 R∗/s and 0.58 ± 0.09 in 13 R∗/s; n = 3; consistent with Farrow et al., 2013Farrow K. Teixeira M. Szikra T. Viney T.J. Balint K. Yonehara K. Roska B. Ambient illumination toggles a neuronal circuit switch in the retina and visual perception at cone threshold.Neuron. 2013; 78: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicated that local and wide-field forms of inhibition are differentially regulated by ambient light, suggesting that they arise from separate sources. To investigate synaptic mechanisms underlying DS and wide-field inhibition under different ambient light conditions, we next measured inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs and EPSCs, respectively) in voltage-clamped DSGCs. Measurement of EPSCs evoked by moving spots along the preferred null axis indicated that output from bipolar cells, on average, was not DS (Figures 2B and 2E ). On the other hand, IPSCs measured in DSGCs were always larger in the null direction, compared to those evoked in the preferred direction (Taylor and Vaney, 2002Taylor W.R. Vaney D.I. Diverse synaptic mechanisms generate direction selectivity in the rabbit retina.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7712-7720PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitory currents remained strongly directional across all ambient light conditions (Figures 2B and 2E; p > 0.1). Thus, conventional directional inhibitory signals, likely mediated by SACs, appear to be operational at all ambient light levels. When we examined the impact of wide-field inhibition on the local synaptic inputs to DSGCs, not only did we find it changed with ambient light, but wide-field inhibition also appeared to be expressed exclusively at a presynaptic locus. In dim light conditions, the peak amplitude of both the inhibitory and excitatory responses to spots larger than an optimal size remained approximately constant (Figure 2C), indicating weak surround inhibition. In contrast, under bright ambient illumination, both inhibitory and excitatory responses decreased as the spot size was increased beyond the optimal size (Figure 2C). This resulted in an increase in SSi values for both excitation and inhibition under bright conditions compared to values measured under dim conditions (Figure 2E). As the release of acetylcholine from SACs could contribute to the EPSC, we also measured surround inhibition in the presence of nicotinic receptor antagonist (100 μM D-tubocurarine) and found it to be unchanged compared to light adapted control (EPSCs SSi was 0.4 ± 0.1, n = 5; p = 0.4; IPSCs SSi was 0.5 ± 0.1, n = 5; p = 0.2). Furthermore, such response profiles (and estimates of SSi) were similar whether the peak amplitude or integrated current was used to quantify the responses (Figure S1). The parallel decrease in synaptic inputs evoked by large spots suggests a presynaptic locus for wide-field inhibition (Figure 2A). It is worth noting that the peak amplitude of excitatory currents evoked with optimal-sized stimuli were not significantly larger in bright versus dim light conditions (ON EPSCs peak amplitude was 283 ± 32 picoamperes [pA] in dim light, n = 8; 305 ± 27 pA in bright light, n = 11; p = 0.6), indicating that it was not simply changes in the magnitude of the responses that triggered surround inhibition. Moreover, when contrast was lowered to reduce the magnitude of the response to ∼50% of the maximal response, surround inhibition was not significantly altered (Figure S2). Together, these data suggest a fundamental change in the relationship between excitation and wide-field inhibition, which is triggered by changes in background illumination. To test whether presynaptic modulation was mediated by spiking WACs in the inner retina, we next examined the effect of blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels on DS and wide-field inhibition (Figures 2C–2E). In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), moving spots evoked inhibitory and excitatory currents that were indistinguishable from those measured under control conditions (Figure 2B). These results confirm the finding that TTX-sensitive Na+ channels do not play a strong role in mediating local inhibitory and excitatory inputs to DSGCs (Figures 2B and 2E; Oesch et al., 2005Oesch N. Euler T. Taylor W.R. Direction-selective dendritic action potentials in rabbit retina.Neuron. 2005; 47: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Oesch and Taylor, 2010Oesch N.W. Taylor W.R. Tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels contribute to directional responses in starburst amacrine cells.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the presence of TTX, synaptic responses evoked by large stationary stimuli were increased relative to control (Figure 2C), indicating that wide-field inhibition relies on voltage-gated Na+ channels. As TTX did not significantly affect responses to the optimum sized spot, the net effect of TTX was a strong reduction in SSi (Figure 2E; n = 14). The reduction of wide-field inhibition observed in the presence of TTX implicates WACs as the principal regulator of size selectivity in the DS circuit. Consistent with the idea that WACs mediate size selectivity via a GABAergic mechanism, the SSi was significantly reduced in the presence of GABA receptor antagonists (Figures 2C–2E). In summary, we have shown that local and wide-field inhibition to DSGCs, stimulated in a biased manner using either small moving or large stationary spots, differ in several respects including: (1) the range over which they operate (local versus wide-field); (2) their sites of action (on DSGC dendrites versus bipolar axonal terminals); (3) their sensitivity to ambient light; and (4) their sensitivity to TTX. While wide-field inhibition clearly modulates the synaptic inputs to DSGCs, the population data indicated that in some conditions ON IPSCs were more strongly modulated than ON EPSCs, while for OFF responses the opposite trend was observed (Figure 2E). To investigate whether wide-field inhibition disrupts the balance between inhibition and excitation at the level of individual cells, or even during individual trials, we next measured EPSCs and IPSCs in DSCGs near simultaneously. To do so, the holding potential of the voltage-clamped DSGC was oscillated between the excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials (0 mV and −60 mV, respectively) at a frequency of 100 Hz, and light-evoked postsynaptic currents were measured following brief capacitive transients (Cafaro and Rieke, 2010Cafaro J. Rieke F. Noise correlations improve response fidelity and stimulus encoding.Nature. 2010; 468: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since the time course of the synaptic responses were relatively slow, the lower sampling of the currents did not strongly distort the overall magnitude of the responses (Figure 3A). We found that changes in the average peak amplitude of the IPSC and EPSC within a given DSGC were strongly correlated as the size of the spot of light was increased (to recruit WACs), for both ON and OFF responses (Figures 3B and 3C). This indicated that inhibitory and excitatory inputs remain balanced in individual DSGCs, under different levels of presynaptic WAC modulation. Interestingly, the peak amplitude of the ON responses were also correlated with OFF responses (ON EPSC-OFF IPSC or OFF EPSC-ON IPSC; Figure 3D), although more weakly when compared to ON-ON and OFF-OFF correlations, suggesting parallel sources of wide-field inhibition acting at ON and OFF bipolar cell terminals (also see Figure 8). Furthermore, we estimated the variability of the synaptic responses by subtracting the mean response (computed over ∼40 trials) from individual trials. The correlation strength of the residuals for the optimal spot size was ∼0.4 (Figure 3E). Importantly, noise correlations remained constant across spot size (Figures 3E and 3F), as the mean response decreased with the recruitment of surround inhibition by larger stimuli (Figure 3C). The above analysis was only performed on recordings in which correlations were significantly reduced when trials were shuffled (offset by one trial), to ensure that they did not arise from systematic slow drifts in response amplitudes. While a common bipolar cell driving direct excitation and feedforward inhibition to DSGCs could be the source of correlations, the contribution of co-release of acetylcholine and GABA from SACs onto DSGCs cannot be excluded. Regardless of the precise origin of the correlations, the recruitment of wide-field inhibition does not perturb the inhibition/excitation balance at the level of individual cells or even on an individual trial basis, which is important for high-fidelity stimulus encoding (Cafaro and Rieke, 2010Cafaro J. Rieke F. Noise correlations improve response fidelity and stimulus encoding.Nature. 2010; 468: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). WACs could modulate excitatory and inhibitory responses in DSGCs in parallel by acting on presynaptic inputs that drive both SACs and DSCGs (Figure 2A). To test whether WACs mediate inputs to SACs, we directly recorded EPSCs in SACs (held at −60 mV). Indeed, these measurements revealed response profiles to increasing spot stimuli that were similar to those measured in DSGCs (Figures 4B and 4C ). The spatial selectivity of excitation was significantly reduced in the presence of TTX and under dim light conditions (Figures 4B and 4E). The qualitative effects of TTX/dim light did not change whether the response was quantified as the EPSC peak or the integrated current (Figure S1D). Similar to EPSCs, IPSCs measured in SACs also exhibited a TTX-sensitive surround (Figures 4B, 4D, and 4E). However, these data should be interpreted with caution, as putative direct WAC input to SACs could be masked by increases in reciprocal inhibition (Lee and Zhou, 2006Lee S. Zhou Z.J. The synaptic mechanism of direction selectivity in distal processes of starburst amacrine cells.Neuron. 2006; 51: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that are expected to be augmented in the presence of TTX. Our finding that the input properties of SACs matched their output properties (measured as IPSCs in DSGCs) suggests that WACs act at sites upstream to the SAC; i.e., at the bipolar cell axonal terminals providing excitation to SACs and DSGCs. To better understand the impact of wide-field inhibition on DS processing, we designed three stimulus paradigms to differentially activate WACs in the periphery, while measuring DS responses to center gratings (0.05 cycles per degree [cyc/deg], 2 Hz, moving in eight directions; Figure 5A). First, we stimulated peripheral WACs using an annulus (inner diameter 500 μm, outer diameter 2,000 μm). The spatial frequency of the surround grating was adjusted to strongly (0.1 cyc/deg) or weakly stimulate WACs (0.4 cyc/deg, see Figure S7). To exclude possible edge effects of the stimuli, the outer grating was separated from the inner grating with a 100 μm thick gray ring and the outer grating was moved orthogonally to the cell’s preferred null axis. In a second paradigm, we compared responses to large gratings (0.0125 cyc/deg) presented through different sized apertures (full field, 2,000 μm; or center alone, 500 μm). Full field gratings would stimulate both global and local inhibition, while the stimuli presented through the aperture would be biased toward stimulating only local inputs. In the third paradigm, we compared spiking responses to gratings drifting in eight directions under dim versus bright conditions, where we have shown global inhibition to be stronger in the latter condition (Figure 1F). In all three conditions, recruiting wide-field inhibition decreased the overall strength of the center response (Figures 5A and 5B), validating the experimental design. The decrease in response amplitude was associated with a mild sharpening of the directional tuning curve (Figure 5C), which is consistent with the role of postsynaptic processing (Oesch et al., 2005Oesch N. Euler T. Taylor W.R. Direction-selective dendritic action potentials in rabbit retina.Neuron. 2005; 47: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Priebe and Ferster, 2008Priebe N.J. Ferster D. Inhibition, spike threshold, and stimulus selectivity in primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 57: 482-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, all three manipulations failed to cause any statistically significant improvements in the DSi (Figure 5D). In addition, regardless of the absolute magnitude of the response, increasing global inhibition did not significantly alter the DSGC’s preferred direction (Figure 5E). Taken together, these data indicated that the direction coding properties of the DSGC are not strongly affected by wide-field inhibition, consistent with the notion that local excitation/inhibition remains balanced under different ambient light conditions (Figure 3). While our data so far clearly indicate a role for wide-field inhibition in shaping the spatial selectivity of DSGCs, it does not address whether such preferences depend on the temporal frequency of the stimulus, as often is the case for other types of ganglion cells (Frishman et al., 1987Frishman L.J. Freeman A.W. Troy J.B. Schweitzer-Tong D.E. Enroth-Cugell C. Spatiotemporal frequency responses of cat retinal ganglion cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 599-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, optomotor behaviors that rely on directional signals from the retina exhibit distinct transitions in their spatiotemporal tuning properties during changes in ambient light conditions (Umino et al., 2008Umino Y. Solessio E. Barlow R.B. Speed, spatial, and temporal tuning of rod and cone vision in mouse.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar; Figures S3A and S3B). Thus, we next examined the spatial tuning of DSGCs at various temporal frequencies in both dim and bright light conditions. Under dim light conditions (0.26–1.5 R∗/s), we found that the DSGC’s spiking responses remained poorly spatially tuned at all temporal frequencies tested (Figure 6A). Thus, spatiotemporal frequencies that evoked maximal responses were orientated along the temporal frequency axis. Under brighter ambient illumination (>13 R∗/s), DSGCs showed a shift in spatial tuning (Figure 6B) consistent with the idea that WACs become functional at these ambient light levels. However, only a marginal change in temporal frequency preference was observed, suggesting that WACs do not modulate temporal tuning of the DS circuit (Figures 6C and 6D). Moreover, the bandpass temporal tuning (with peak ∼1–2 Hz; Figure 6D) suggests that responses were primarily mediated by rod photoreceptors in both dim and bright experimental conditions (Wang et al., 2011Wang Y.V. Weick M. Demb J.B. Spectral and temporal sensitivity of cone-mediated responses in mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7670-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, over a small range of ambient light levels (1.5–13 R∗/s), the DSGCs spatiotemporal profile switches from being temporally tuned, to being tuned to both the spatial and temporal frequency components of the stimulus (Figures 6A and 6B). Further statistical analysis of the data confirmed the lack of dependence between spatial and temporal tuning (Figure S3) giving rise to a velocity tuning index (VTi; see Experimental Procedures) that was near zero for both dim and light conditions (Figure 6E). The separable spatiotemporal tuning described here for mouse DSGCs is comparable to tuning of rabbit DSGCs (Grzywacz and Amthor, 2007Grzywacz N.M. Amthor F.R. Robust directional computation in on-off directionally selective ganglion cells of rabbit retina.Vis. Neurosci. 2007; 24: 647-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, He and Levick, 2000He S. Levick W.R. Spatial-temporal response characteristics of the ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells in the rabbit retina.Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and along with the separability of other stimulus dimensions (e.g., contrast; Nowak et al., 2011Nowak P. Dobbins A.C. Gawne T.J. Grzywacz N.M. Amthor F.R. Separability of stimulus parameter encoding by on-off directionally selective rabbit retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 2083-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), is likely to facilitate the decoding of directional and nondirectional signals by higher visual centers (van Hateren, 1990van Hateren J.H. Directional tuning curves, elementary movement detectors, and the estimation of the direction of visual movement.Vision Res. 1990; 30: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To understand the biophysical basis of the spatiotemporal tuning in DSGCs, we next examined the EPSCs (evoked by preferred direction stimuli) and IPSCs (evoked by null direction stimuli; Figure 7A) under different ambient light and pharmacological conditions (Figure 7; also see Figure S4). Under dim light conditions, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses exhibited a weak spatial selectivity (Figure S5) and responses aligned along the temporal frequency axis (Figure 7B). On the other hand, in bright light, synaptic responses became strongly spatially tuned (Figures 7A and 7B), but did not exhibit significant alterations of their temporal frequency preferences (Figures 7B and 7E).

https://openalex.org/W1978360369,"A core comprises of a group of central and densely connected nodes which governs the overall behaviour of a network. It is recognised as one of the key meso-scale structures in complex networks. Profiling this meso-scale structure currently relies on a limited number of methods which are often complex and parameter dependent or require a null model. As a result, scalability issues are likely to arise when dealing with very large networks together with the need for subjective adjustment of parameters. The notion of a rich-club describes nodes which are essentially the hub of a network, as they play a dominating role in structural and functional properties. The definition of a rich-club naturally emphasises high degree nodes and divides a network into two subgroups. Here, we develop a method to characterise a rich-core in networks by theoretically coupling the underlying principle of a rich-club with the escape time of a random walker. The method is fast, scalable to large networks and completely parameter free. In particular, we show that the evolution of the core in World Trade and C. elegans networks correspond to responses to historical events and key stages in their physical development, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2092385448,"Despite recent advances in the therapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the chemotherapy efficacy against NSCLC is still unsatisfactory. Previous studies show the herbal antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) displays cytotoxic to multiple human tumors. Here, we showed that DHA decreased cell viability and colony formation, induced apoptosis in A549 and PC-9 cells. Additionally, we first revealed DHA inhibited glucose uptake in NSCLC cells. Moreover, glycolytic metabolism was attenuated by DHA, including inhibition of ATP and lactate production. Consequently, we demonstrated that the phosphorylated forms of both S6 ribosomal protein and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and GLUT1 levels were abrogated by DHA treatment in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the upregulation of mTOR activation by high expressed Rheb increased the level of glycolytic metabolism and cell viability inhibited by DHA. These results suggested that DHA-suppressed glycolytic metabolism might be associated with mTOR activation and GLUT1 expression. Besides, we showed GLUT1 overexpression significantly attenuated DHA-triggered NSCLC cells apoptosis. Notably, DHA synergized with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor) to reduce cell viability and increase cell apoptosis in A549 and PC-9 cells. However, the combination of the two compounds displayed minimal toxicity to WI-38 cells, a normal lung fibroblast cell line. More importantly, 2DG synergistically potentiated DHA-induced activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3, as well as the levels of both cytochrome c and AIF of cytoplasm. However, 2DG failed to increase the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels elicited by DHA. Overall, the data shown above indicated DHA plus 2DG induced apoptosis was involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways in NSCLC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980929279,"CK Vulpeculae was observed in outburst in 1670-1672 (ref. 1), but no counterpart was seen until 1982, when a bipolar nebula was found at its location. Historically, CK Vul has been considered to be a nova (Nova Vul 1670), but its similarity to 'red transients', which are more luminous than classical novae and thought to be the results of stellar collisions, has re-opened the question of CK Vul's status. Red transients cool to resemble late M-type stars, surrounded by circumstellar material rich in molecules and dust. No stellar source has been seen in CK Vul, though a radio continuum source was identified at the expansion centre of the nebula. Here we report that CK Vul is surrounded by chemically rich molecular gas in the form of an outflow, as well as dust. The gas has peculiar isotopic ratios, revealing that CK Vul's composition was strongly enhanced by the nuclear ashes of hydrogen burning. The chemical composition cannot be reconciled with a nova or indeed any other known explosion. In addition, the mass of the surrounding gas is too large for a nova, though the conversion from observations of CO to a total mass is uncertain. We conclude that CK Vul is best explained as the remnant of a merger of two stars."
https://openalex.org/W1985859400,"Adult females of Aedes aegypti are facultative blood sucking insects and vectors of Dengue and yellow fever viruses. Insect dispersal plays a central role in disease transmission and the extremely high energy demand posed by flight is accomplished by a very efficient oxidative phosphorylation process, which take place within flight muscle mitochondria. These organelles play a central role in energy metabolism, interconnecting nutrient oxidation to ATP synthesis, but also represent an important site of cellular superoxide production. Given the importance of mitochondria to cell physiology, and the potential contributions of this organelle for A. aegypti biology and vectorial capacity, here, we conducted a systematic assessment of mitochondrial physiology in flight muscle of young adult A. aegypti fed exclusively with sugar. This was carried out by determining the activities of mitochondrial enzymes, the substrate preferences to sustain respiration, the mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency and capacity, in both mitochondria-enriched preparations and mechanically permeabilized flight muscle in both sexes. We also determined the substrates preferences to promote mitochondrial superoxide generation and the main sites where it is produced within this organelle. We observed that respiration in A. aegypti mitochondria was essentially driven by complex I and glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase substrates, which promoted distinct mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities, but with preserved efficiencies. Respiration mediated by proline oxidation in female mitochondria was strikingly higher than in males. Mitochondrial superoxide production was essentially mediated through proline and glycerol 3 phosphate oxidation, which took place at sites other than complex I. Finally, differences in mitochondrial superoxide production among sexes were only observed in male oxidizing glycerol 3 phosphate, exhibiting higher rates than in female. Together, these data represent a significant step towards the understanding of fundamental mitochondrial processes in A. aegypti, with potential implications for its physiology and vectorial capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2068575066,"Objectives To describe alcohol drinking patterns among participants in Katutura, Namibia, and to evaluate brief versions of the AUDIT against the full AUDIT to determine their effectiveness in detecting harmful drinking. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in four constituencies and 639 participants, 18 years or older, completed a sociodemographic survey and the AUDIT. The effectiveness of the AUDIT-C (first three questions) and the AUDIT-3 (third question) was compared to the full AUDIT. Results Approximately 40% were identified as harmful, hazardous or likely dependent drinkers, with men having a higher likelihood than women (57.2% vs. 31.0%, p<.0001). Approximately 32% reported making and/or selling alcohol from home. The AUDIT-C performed best at a cutoff ≥ 3, better in men (sensitivity: 99.3%, specificity: 77.8%) than women (sensitivity: 91.7%, specificity: 77.4%). The AUDIT-3 performed poorly (maximum sensitivity: < 90%, maximum specificity: <51%). According to AUROC, the AUDIT-C performed better than the AUDIT-3. Conclusions A large proportion of participants met criteria for alcohol misuse, indicating a need for screening and referral for further evaluation and intervention. The AUDIT-C was almost as effective as the full AUDIT and may be easier to implement in clinical settings as a routine screening tool in resource-limited settings because of its brevity."

These flavoenzymes catalyze the NADPH- and oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of amines such as those found on the side chains of lysine and ornithine. In this work we report the biochemical and structural characterization of Nocardia farcinica Lys monooxygenase (NbtG), which has similar biochemical properties to mycobacterial homologs. NbtG is also active on d-Lys, although it binds l-Lys with a higher affinity. Differently from the ornithine monooxygenases PvdA, SidA, and KtzI, NbtG can use both NADH and NADPH and is highly uncoupled, producing more superoxide and hydrogen peroxide than hydroxylated Lys. The crystal structure of NbtG solved at 2.4 Å resolution revealed an unexpected protein conformation with a 30° rotation of the NAD(P)H domain with respect to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domain that precludes binding of the nicotinamide cofactor. This “occluded” structure may explain the biochemical properties of NbtG, specifically with regard to the substantial uncoupling and limited stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate.

A different strategy for oxygen consumption regulation was found in KtzI where flavin movement from an “out” to “in” conformation controls the oxidized/reduced state of the cofactor, similarly to what happens in Class A monooxygenases such as p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. Despite this difference, the structures of SidA, PvdA and KtzI all share a similar overall fold to other Class B flavin monooxygenases and a similar binding conformation for NADP+, which is important for stabilization of the FADOOH (6Olucha J.

Comparison of the structures of SidA in complex with l-Orn and l-Lys revealed the mechanism of substrate selectivity where the Nϵ of l-Orn is in a favorable position for hydroxylation by the distal oxygen of the FADOOH. In contrast, l-Lys protrudes farther into the active site in a suboptimal position, which causes breakdown of the FADOOH resulting in production of high levels of hydrogen peroxide and low levels of hydroxylated l-Lys (10Franceschini S. Fedkenheuer M. Vogelaar N.J. Robinson H.H. Sobrado P. Mattevi A. Structural insight into the mechanism of oxygen activation and substrate selectivity of flavin-dependent N-hydroxylating monooxygenases.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 7043-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to the significant mechanistic and structural data of l-Orn monooxygenases, relatively little is known about l-Lys monooxygenases. IucD from Escherichia coli was the first l-Lys monooxygenase characterized. IucD shares similar mechanistic features to SidA and PvdA, as this enzyme has been shown to be highly coupled and specific for NADPH and l-Lys (3Macheroux P. Plattner H.J. Romaguera A. Diekmann H.

Recently, characterization of the l-Lys monooxygenase MbsG from M. smegmatis showed that this enzyme can use both NADH and NADPH and is highly uncoupled, making more superoxide and hydrogen peroxide than hydroxylated Lys (20Robinson R. Sobrado P.

Also, unlike other NMOs where substrate binding accelerates turnover, l-Lys binding decreases the activity of MbsG ∼2-fold by regulating the reaction with NAD(P)H (21Robinson R.M. Rodriguez P.J.

Biophys. 2014; 550: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there is a higher degree of mechanistic variability among NMOs than previously thought. The biosynthesis of the siderophore nocobactin in Nocardia farcinica requires functioning of NbtG, a l-Lys monooxygenase that shares >50% of sequence identity with MbsG (Scheme 1) (22Hoshino Y. Chiba K. Ishino K. Fukai T. Igarashi Y. Yazawa K. Mikami Y. Ishikawa J. Identification of nocobactin NA biosynthetic gene clusters in Nocardia farcinica.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Nocardia genus is comprised of parasitic bacteria, which can infect both plants and animals, including humans, and has a high mortality rate due to antibiotic resistance (22Hoshino Y. Chiba K. Ishino K. Fukai T. Igarashi Y. Yazawa K. Mikami Y. Ishikawa J. Identification of nocobactin NA biosynthetic gene clusters in Nocardia farcinica.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we present a thorough biochemical and structural characterization of NbtG. The enzyme is an effective l-Lys monooxygenase that is also able to hydroxylate d-Lys. NbtG is unable to stabilize the FADOOH intermediate, which results in production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. The structure of NbtG was solved by x-ray crystallography and the results show an unexpected and unprecedented protein conformation that can rationalize the biochemical properties of NbtG, specifically with regard to the substantial uncoupling and limited stabilization of the FADOOH. The synthetic gene encoding for NbtG from N. farcinica IFM 10152 was obtained from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). PmeI and SgfI were from Promega (Madison, WI). E. coli TOP10 and BL21-T1R chemically competent cells were from Invitrogen. pVP56K was obtained from the Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). DNA sequencing was performed at the DNA sequencing facility of the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (Blacksburg, VA). Protein purification was performed on an ÄKTA Prime Plus FPLC (GE Healthcare). l-Lys, d-Lys, NADPH, NADP+, buffers, and salts were from Fisher. Amino acid analysis was performed using an Acquity Ultraperformance Liquid Chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA). Oxygen consumption studies were performed on a Hansatech Oxygraph (Norfolk, UK). WST-1, used for superoxide quantification, was from Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobium brockii was obtained from Sigma. Glucose oxidase was from MP Biomedical (Solon, OH). Rapid-reaction studies were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX20 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, UK) housed in a Coy Glove Box (Grass Lake, MI). To subclone the NbtG gene into the expression vector pVP56K, the pUC57:nbtG plasmid was incubated with PmeI and SgfI restriction endonucleases at 37 °C for 2 h. After digestion, the restriction endonucleases were inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min. The digested gene was then ligated into pVP56K, which was previously treated with PmeI and SgfI. The ligation reaction was then transformed into E. coli TOP10 cells. Five colonies were grown for plasmid purification and sequenced to determine proper ligation of nbtG into pVP56K. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange (Agilent Technologies) method following the manufacturer's instructions. The wild-type NbtG gene, subcloned into the pVP56K plasmid, was used as the template. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Virginia Bioinformatics Core Sequencing Facility. A single colony of E. coli BL21-T1R transformed with pVP56K:nbtG was used to inoculate a 50-ml overnight LB culture flask (supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, 6 flasks containing 1 liter each of autoinduction media (23Fox B.G. Blommel P.G. Autoinduction of protein expression.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2009Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin) were each inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight culture and grown at 37 °C with agitation at 250 rpm. When the optical density at 600 nm reached a value of ∼3, the temperature was lowered to 18 °C. After overnight incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell paste (50 g) was resuspended in 150 ml of buffer A (25 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm FAD, and 25 μg/ml each of DNase, RNase, and lysozyme. This solution was stirred for 30 min. Cells were lysed by sonication using a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 500 at 70% amplitude for 10 min (5 s pulses with 15 s delays). Next, the lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was loaded at 5 ml/min onto 3 in-tandem 5-ml HisTrap FF crude columns (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with buffer A. After loading, the column was washed with buffer A followed by 100 ml of buffer A containing 75 mm imidazole. Bound His8-MBP-NbtG was eluted with 150 ml of buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and those containing His8-MBP-NbtG were combined. To liberate NbtG from the His8-MBP, 10 mg of tobacco etch virus protease was added, and the solution was then transferred to a 4,000 molecular weight cutoff dialysis bag and dialyzed in 2 liters of buffer A. The next day, the solution was loaded at 3 ml/min onto 3 in-tandem 5-ml HisTrap FF crude columns previously equilibrated with buffer A. In this step His8-MBP, His8-tobacco etch virus, and any uncleaved His8-MBP-NbtG remain bound to the column, whereas NbtG elutes in the flow-through. SDS-PAGE analysis of the flow-through showed highly pure NbtG; however, small amounts of His8-MBP-NbtG were still present. To remove the fusion from free NbtG, the sample was loaded at 3 ml/min onto 2 in-tandem 5-ml MBPTrap HP columns equilibrated in buffer B (25 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The flow-through contained NbtG and was determined to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. The sample (∼20 ml) was dialyzed for 3 h in 1 liter of storage buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) then dialyzed in 1 liter of fresh storage buffer overnight. Dialyzed NbtG was concentrated to ∼300 μm, aliquoted (in ∼60 μl drops), and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80 °C. NbtG K184A seleno-l-methionine was produced using the metabolic inhibition method (24Doublié S. Preparation of selenomethionyl proteins for phase determination.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Both seleno-l-methionine-labeled NbtG K184A and unlabeled enzymes were purified as described above. A solution of NbtG (25 μm) was heated at 95 °C for 10 min. After incubation on ice for 5 min, the denatured protein was precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the flavin cofactor was used for mass spectroscopy analysis as previously described (20Robinson R. Sobrado P.

Biophys. 2014; 550: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of the bound FAD to NbtG was determined by the addition of 5% SDS and incubation at room temperature for 5 min. The spectrum of the liberated FAD was recorded, and an extinction coefficient at 452 nm of 12,600 m−1 cm−1 was calculated using the extinction coefficient for free FAD of 11,300 m−1 cm−1 . The binding of NADP+ to oxidized NbtG was monitored by recording the change in the flavin spectra at increasing concentrations of NADP+. Each solution consisted of 100 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, NbtG (60 μm) and NADP+ (0–10 mm). The solutions were incubated on ice for 10 min before data collection. The spectra of NADP+ alone were subtracted from spectra of NADP+/NbtG at each NADP+ concentration. The absorbance differences showed the largest decrease at 395 nm. An extinction coefficient of 1,300 m−1cm−1 for this change in absorbance at 395 nm was determined and used to calculate the concentrations of NbtG-NADP+ complex. Oxygen consumption was monitored in 1-ml reactions of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. NAD(P)H was varied between 0.1 and 5 mm, l-Lys was varied between 0 and 5 mm, and d-Lys was varied between 0 and 100 mm. For assays where NAD(P)H was varied, no Lys, 2 mm l-Lys, or 10 mm d-Lys were present. In assays where Lys was varied, NAD(P)H was held constant at 2 mm. Assays were initiated with 1 μm NbtG and monitored on a Hansatech Oxygraph system at 25 °C under constant stirring. To determine if l-Lys was hydroxylated, NbtG (8 μm) was mixed with 5 mm NADPH and 1 mm l-Lys in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. At 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 min, the reaction was quenched with 200 μl of 100% acetonitrile and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was withdrawn and combined with 25 μl of 200 mm borate, pH 8.0. l-Lys was derivatized by adding 3.4 μl of FMOC-Cl, (150 mm) to 130 μl of the quenched reaction. This was allowed to incubate for 5 min at 25 °C. To remove any remaining derivatizing reagent, 158 μl of 1-aminoadamantane (53 mm) was added and incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 min. The sample was analyzed by reverse phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography by loading 2 μl onto a C18 AcQuity column (2.1 × 100 mm) equilibrated in 70% eluent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) at 0.5 min/ml. The samples were eluted with a linear gradient from 30 to 100% eluent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at 0.5 min/ml, and samples were monitored at 263 nm. The elution profiles of derivatized l-Lys and l-Lys-OH were consistent with previously published data (25Heemstra Jr., J.R. Walsh C.T. Sattely E.S.

Hydroxylated Lys was quantified by a variation of the Csaky iodine oxidation assay as previously described (20Robinson R. Sobrado P.

On the estimation of bound hydroxylamine in biological materials.Acta Chem. Scand. 1948: 450-454Crossref Google Scholar). Each reaction consisted of 104 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. NAD(P)H was varied between 0.1 and 10 mm, l-Lys was varied between 0.1 and 5 mm, and d-Lys was varied between 0 and 10 mm. In assays where NAD(P)H was varied, 2 mm l-Lys, or 10 mm d-Lys were used. For reactions with varying concentrations of d/l-Lys, 2 mm NAD(P)H was used. Reactions were initiated with 2 μm NbtG and allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 10 min while shaking at 750 rpm. Hydrogen peroxide formed during the reaction was measured using the Pierce hydrogen peroxide detection kit as described previously (20Robinson R. Sobrado P.

Flavin reduction was monitored at 25 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer in single mixing mode. The stopped-flow spectrophotometer system and buffers were made anaerobic as described previously (21Robinson R.M. Rodriguez P.J. Sobrado P.

Oxidized NbtG (15 μm after mixing) was mixed with various concentrations of NADPH (0.025–5 mm after mixing). The reaction was monitored with a photodiode array spectrophotometer until flavin reduction was complete. This was repeated with l-Lys or d-Lys at 2 mm and 10 mm (after mixing), respectively. Flavin oxidation was monitored at 25 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer in double mixing mode. In the first mixing step, 30 μm NbtG (after mixing) was allowed to react with a stoichiometric concentration of NADPH (30 μm after mixing) for 500 s. In the second mixing step, reduced NbtG was reacted with various concentrations of molecular oxygen (100–600 μm after mixing). The reaction was monitored using a photodiode array spectrophotometer until flavin oxidation was complete. Oxygen saturated buffer (1.2 mm) was obtained by bubbling 100% oxygen for 30 min at 25 °C. Various oxygen concentrations were obtained by mixing with appropriate volumes of anaerobic buffer. Experiments with l-Lys or d-Lys contained 2 and 10 mm, respectively. To determine if excess NADP+ was required to stabilized the FADOOH intermediate, NADP+ was added to the second mix (0–10 mm after mixing) during oxidation.

Briefly, 25 mg of NADP+ (5.6 mm final concentration), 480 μl of 2-propanol-d8 (1 m final concentration), and 50 units of alcohol dehydrogenase (T. brockii) were added to 6 ml of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 40 °C with light agitation until the A260/A340 ratio reached a value of ∼2.5. The kinetic data were fit using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Steady-state kinetic data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Data that exhibited substrate inhibition were fit to Equation 1 to obtain the turnover number (kcat), the Michaelis constant (Km), and the substrate inhibition constant (Kis). The decrease in absorbance at 452 nm was fit to a double exponential decay equation (Equation 2), and the resulting kobs values were plotted as a function of NADPH concentration. These data were fit using Equation 3 to determine the maximum rate of flavin reduction (kred) and KD values. The rate of flavin oxidation was determined by fitting the increase in absorbance at 452 nm to a single exponential rise equation (Equation 4).

After treatment with the specific NHE1 inhibitor cariporide to decrease intracellular pH (pHi), the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels of the K562R cell line and cells from IM-insensitive CML patients decreased.

Using AFM we imaged morphology of glial cells before and after cold atmospheric plasma treatment. To look more closely at the effect of plasma on cell membrane, high resolution imaging was used. We report the differences between normal human astrocytes and human glioblastoma cells by considering the membrane surface details. Our data, obtained for the first time on these cells using atomic force microscopy, argue for an architectural feature on the cell membrane, i.e. brush layers, different in normal human astrocytes as compared to glioblastoma cells.

Myosin A (MyoA), the other class XIV myosin in Plasmodium, has been established as a component of the glideosome complex important in motility and cell invasion, but MyoB is not well characterized. We analyzed the properties of MyoB using three parasite species as follows: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium berghei, and Plasmodium knowlesi. MyoB is expressed in all invasive stages (merozoites, ookinetes, and sporozoites) of the life cycle, and the protein is found in a discrete apical location in these polarized cells.

Two of these genes code for short class XIV myosins, which are restricted to Apicomplexan parasites and other members of the Alveolata. These myosins differ from most others in that, although they have the highly conserved “head” region that binds actin and hydrolyzes ATP, and the “neck” region that acts as the lever arm and contains IQ motifs to which myosin light chains bind, they have no “tail” region. The tail normally allows oligomerization, cargo binding, and determines the subcellular location of the myosin (3.Farrow R.E. Green J. Katsimitsoulia Z. Taylor W.R. Holder A.A. Molloy J.E.

In this study, we have tagged MyoB with GFP and HA and examined its expression and cellular localization both within the asexual blood stage development of P. falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi and throughout the life cycle of Plasmodium berghei. We identify a new and unusual myosin light chain that binds to a region at the C terminus of MyoB through a calmodulin-like domain. The myosin light chain contains an extended N terminus when compared with other more typical light chains, and we propose this may be acting as a tail domain for MyoB. We also identify a unique apical localization for this complex in invasive stages of the parasite. All animal work passed an ethical review process and was approved by the United Kingdom Home Office.

The correct sequence of the plasmid was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Beckman Genomics). After transfection of ring stage parasites with 100 μg of plasmid DNA, 2.5 nm WR99210 was added, and the parasites were cultured continuously under drug selection for ∼3 weeks (designated cycle 0). The transfected parasites were then grown for 3 weeks without drug selection, to allow loss of episomal DNA followed by a further week of growth under WR99210 selection (cycle 1). The cycling was repeated one more time.

A region of homology corresponding to the final 1057 bp of the P. falciparum myoA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using primers 15 and 16 and cloned into the pHH4-GFP plasmid exactly as described for Pfmyob. A scheme for integration and its analysis by Southern blot and diagnostic PCR using primer pairs 17 and 5 to detect integration and 17 and 18 to detect the unmodified locus is shown in Fig. 1, together with the pattern of GFP fluorescence in the parasite. A 1316-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the 3′ end of the PkmyoB gene was amplified using primers 6 and 7 and cloned via XmaI/AvrII sites into the pHH4PK vector by having replaced the sequence coding for GFP with a sequence coding for a triple HA epitope tag. The vector was linearized using SwaI, and 10 μg of DNA was transfected as described previously (16.Moon R.W. Hall J. Rangkuti F. Ho Y.S. Almond N. Mitchell G.H. Pain A. Holder A.A. Blackman M.J.

A scheme for construct integration and diagnostic PCR screening with primer pairs 8 and 10 to detect integration and 8 and 9 to detect the unmodified locus are shown in Fig. 2. P. berghei myoB was modified by single homologous recombination to insert a sequence coding for a C-terminal GFP tag, using the p277 vector that contains a human dhfr selection cassette (Fig. 2E) (17.Guttery D.S. Poulin B. Ferguson D.J. Szöőr B. Wickstead B. Carroll P.L. Ramakrishnan C. Brady D. Patzewitz E.M. Straschil U. Solyakov L. Green J.L. Sinden R.E. Tobin A.B. Holder A.A. Tewari R.

A 978-bp sequence of myoB starting 2.4 kb downstream of the ATG initiator codon and omitting the stop codon was amplified using primers 11 and 12 and inserted into the vector using KpnI and ApaI restriction sites. The construct was linearized using HincII and then used to transfect the P. berghei ANKA 2.34 line by electroporation (18.Janse C.J. Franke-Fayard B. Mair G.R. Ramesar J. Thiel C. Engelmann S. Matuschewski K. van Gemert G.-J. Sauerwein R.W. Waters A.P. High efficiency transfection of Plasmodium berghei facilitates novel selection procedures.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 145: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The electroporated parasites were mixed immediately with 150 μl of reticulocyte-rich blood, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then injected intraperitoneally into naive mice. Pyrimethamine (Sigma) at 7 mg/ml was administered to the drinking water for 4 days to select resistant parasites. Mice were monitored for 10 days to detect parasites, and the drug selection was repeated after parasite passage to a second mouse. Pyrimethamine-resistant parasites were then analyzed with a diagnostic PCR using primers 13 and 14 to determine correct integration of the gfp sequence at the targeted locus (Fig. 2F), and a Western blot was performed to confirm the size of the GFP-tagged protein (Fig. 2G). A 1034-bp fragment of homology targeting the mlc-b locus (PF3D7_1118700) was amplified from 3D7 genomic DNA using the primer pair 19 and 20. The PCR fragment was inserted into pHH4-GFP between the XmaI and AvrII sites, verified by sequencing, and transfected into 3D7 parasites as above. WR99210-resistant parasites were cloned by limiting dilution. Parasites were screened for integration into the mlc-b locus by diagnostic PCR using primer pairs 21 and 5 to detect integration and 21 and 22 to detect the unmodified locus, as shown in Fig. 3A. A 1198-bp region of homology representing 3739–4933 bp from pkmlc-b was cloned into the XmaI/AvrII sites of pHH4PK-HA vector using a two-step approach. A region of pkmlc-b from 3739 to 4308 bp was amplified from genomic DNA using the primer pair 23 and 24, where underlining denotes the introduced unique KpnI site. After cloning into pGEM-T Easy and sequence verification, this region was excised and cloned into the XmaI/AvrII sites of the pHH4PK-HA vector. A second region of pkmlc-b from 4309 to 4933 bp was amplified using the primer pair 25 and 26, where nonhomologous sequences were introduced to generate the KpnI site. After cloning into pGEM-T Easy and sequence verification, this region was excised and cloned into the KpnI/AvrII sites of the pHH4PK-mlc-b-HA vector generated in the previous step. This plasmid was linearized with AleI prior to transfection into P. knowlesi (Fig. 3B) (16.Moon R.W. Hall J. Rangkuti F. Ho Y.S. Almond N. Mitchell G.H. Pain A. Holder A.A. Blackman M.J.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Blood stage P. berghei parasites from infected mice (day 4 post-infection) were cultured in vitro (40 ml of RPMI 1640 medium, 8 ml of fetal bovine serum, 0.5 ml of penicillin and streptomycin per 0.5 ml of blood) for 24 h at 37 °C (with rotation at 100 rpm). The following day, schizont-infected cells were purified on a 60% v/v NycoDenz/PBS gradient (NycoDenz stock solution: 27.6% w/v NycoDenz in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). The purification of gametocytes was based on a modified protocol described in Beetsma et al. (19.Beetsma A.L. van de Wiel T.J. Sauerwein R.W. Eling W.M. Plasmodium berghei ANKA: purification of large numbers of infectious gametocytes.Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On day 4 post-infection, parasites were harvested, kept on ice to avoid premature activation, and separated from uninfected erythrocytes on a 48% (v/v) NycoDenz in coelenterazine loading buffer (CLB) gradient (CLB: PBS containing 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm glucose, 4 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin, pH 7.25). Gametocytes were harvested from the interface and washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium before activation of gamete formation in ookinete medium (20.Patzewitz E.-M. Guttery D.S. Poulin B. Ramakrishnan C.

For ookinete preparation, parasites from day 5 post-infected mice were placed in ookinete medium for 24 h at 20 °C; the parasites were then lysed in red blood cell lysis buffer for 30 min and purified on a 63% NycoDenz gradient (v/v in PBS). On day 14 post-feeding, guts were dissected and crushed in a loosely fitting homogenizer to release sporozoites, which were then quantified using a hemocytometer (20.Patzewitz E.-M. Guttery D.S.

Total RNA was isolated from purified parasites using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using an RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems) allowing quantification from 250 ng of total RNA. Each quantitative PCR consisted of 2 μl of cDNA, 5 μl of SYBR Green fast master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 μl (500 nm) each of the forward and reverse primers, and 2 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Where possible, one of the primer pairs was placed over an intron and together they amplified a region 70–200 bp long. Analysis was conducted using an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast machine with the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 20 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s; 60 °C for 30 s. Wild-type expression was determined using the Pfaffl method (21.Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25511) Google Scholar). The method used hsp70 (PBANKA_081890) and arginyl-tRNA synthetase (PBANKA_143420) as reference genes. All primers used are listed in Table 1 (primers 29–34). Polyclonal rat anti-PfMyosin B antibodies were raised to a peptide of the sequence MVNKINELNNYFRINSTFINKSENE by Pepceuticals Ltd. according to their standard protocol. Rabbit anti-EBA175 and mouse anti-RAP1 (7H8/54) were obtained from the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Centre. Mouse anti-RON4 was a gift from Dr. J-F Dubremetz (University of Montpellier). Anti-α-tubulin mAb clone DM 1A (T9026, Sigma) was used to detect P. falciparum α-tubulin. Rabbit anti-GFP6 and rat anti-HA (monoclonal 3F10, Roche Applied Science) antibodies were used to detect tagged proteins. Species-specific AlexaFluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Life Technologies, Inc.). P. falciparum and P. knowlesi parasite-infected red blood cells were prepared for live imaging as described in Ridzuan et al. (22.Ridzuan M.A. Moon R.W. Knuepfer E. Black S. Holder A.A. Green J.L.

P. berghei asexual blood stage infections in mice were initiated by intraperitoneal injection of parasite-infected blood. The asexual, gametocyte, and ookinete stages were observed using Hoechst 33342 dye in ookinete medium. To examine mosquito mid-gut infection, guts were dissected 14 days after feeding on infected blood and mounted under Vaseline-rimmed coverslips after staining with Hoechst dye for 10–15 min. On day 21 post-feeding, guts and salivary glands were dissected and crushed separately in a loosely fitted homogenizer to release sporozoites, which were then quantified using a hemocytometer and used for imaging (20.Patzewitz E.-M.

Microscopy analysis was performed using a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc) fitted with an AxioCam ICc1 digital camera. For P. berghei liver stage parasites, 60,000 HepG2 cells were seeded in glass-bottomed imaging dishes. Salivary glands of female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with PbMyoB-GFP parasites were isolated and disrupted using a pestle. Sporozoites were pipetted gently onto seeded HepG2 cells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in complete minimum Eagle's medium containing 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (PAA). Medium was changed 3 h after initial infection and once a day thereafter. For live cell imaging, Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and parasites were imaged 24, 48, and 55 h post-infection using an epi-fluorescence microscope (DMI600B from Leica). Thin smears of parasites were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min followed by blocking in 3% BSA (w/v) in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies were diluted as required; species-specific Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used to visualize primary antibody binding. All antibody dilutions were carried out with 3% BSA (w/v) in PBS. Slides were mounted for microscopic examination using Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies, Inc.). Slides were viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope, and images were captured using a Zeiss Axiocam MRc digital camera and AxioVision 4.8.2 software and prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop. To image stages of invasion of erythrocytes, tightly synchronized PfMyoB-GFP-expressing late stage schizonts were mixed with erythrocytes, and samples were taken after 2, 5, 8, 10, and 30 min and fixed in solution with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde for 60 min at room temperature. Further processing was carried out as described previously (23.Knuepfer E. Suleyman O. Dluzewski A.R. Straschil U. O'Keeffe A.H. Ogun S.A. Green J.L. Grainger M. Tewari R. Holder A.A.

Schizonts from the MyoB-GFP, MyoA-GFP, MLC-B-GFP, and 3D7 parasite lines were first lysed in 0.15% (w/v) saponin in PBS and harvested by centrifugation, and the proteins were extracted using 10 cell pellet volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1× Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Samples were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The detergent concentration in the samples was reduced to 0.2% by dilution with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1× Complete protease inhibitors. Parasite lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with blocked agarose beads (Chromotek) for 1 h, and then the supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap-agarose beads (Chromotek) for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed extensively with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then subjected to a further wash in 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Finally the beads were resuspended in 5 volumes of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to fractionation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE. Cell lysates were separated under reducing conditions on NuPAGE gels (Life Technologies, Inc.). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked in 5% w/v nonfat milk in PBS + 0.2% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% w/v nonfat milk in PBS + 0.2% Tween 20. Species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used, and the signal was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Blots were exposed to BiomaxMR film (Eastman Kodak), and images were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop. Proteins were run 4 mm into a 10% NuPAGE BisTris gel (Life Technologies Inc.) and then excised using a clean scalpel blade. Proteins were reduced and alkylated prior to overnight trypsin digestion. The resulting digests were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Ultimate 3000 nanoRSLC HPLC, equipped with a 50-cm × 75-μm Acclaim Pepmap C18 column, coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro equipped with a Nanoflex electrospray source (all Thermo Scientific).

Proteins with cyclic nucleotide binding and GAF domains can be identified in the genome of mycobacterial species, and some of them have been characterized.

We have characterized the biochemical and thermodynamic parameters for binding of cAMP, and we show that these USPs bind cAMP with a higher affinity than ATP, an established ligand for other USPs. We determined the structure of the USP MSMEG_3811 bound to cAMP, and we confirmed through structure-guided mutagenesis, the residues important for cAMP binding. This family of USPs is conserved in all mycobacteria, and we suggest that they serve as “sinks” for cAMP, making this second messenger available for downstream effectors as and when ATP levels are altered in the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2066460592,"Soil salinity is a major constraint to crop growth and yield. The primary and lateral roots of Arabidopsis thaliana are known to respond differentially to a number of environmental stresses, including salinity. Although the maize root system as a whole is known to be sensitive to salinity, whether or not different structural root systems show differential growth responses to salinity stress has not yet been investigated. The maize primary root (PR) was more tolerant of salinity stress than either the crown root (CR) or the seminal root (SR). To understand the molecular mechanism of these differential growth responses, RNA-Seq analysis was conducted on cDNA prepared from the PR, CR and SR of plants either non-stressed or exposed to 100 mM NaCl for 24 h. A set of 444 genes were shown to be regulated by salinity stress, and the transcription pattern of a number of genes associated with the plant salinity stress response differed markedly between the various types of root. The pattern of transcription of the salinity-regulated genes was shown to be very diverse in the various root types. The differential transcription of these genes such as transcription factors, and the accumulation of compatible solutes such as soluble sugars probably underlie the differential growth responses to salinity stress of the three types of roots in maize."
https://openalex.org/W2044076622,"About half of the known miRNA genes are located within protein-coding host genes, and are thus subject to co-transcription. Accumulating data indicate that this coupling may be an intrinsic mechanism to directly regulate the host gene’s expression, constituting a negative feedback loop. Inevitably, the cell requires a yet largely unknown repertoire of methods to regulate this control mechanism. We propose APA as one possible mechanism by which negative feedback of intronic miRNA on their host genes might be regulated. Using in-silico analyses, we found that host genes that contain seed matching sites for their intronic miRNAs yield longer 32UTRs with more polyadenylation sites. Additionally, the distribution of polyadenylation signals differed significantly between these host genes and host genes of miRNAs that do not contain potential miRNA binding sites. We then transferred these in-silico results to a biological example and investigated the relationship between ZFR and its intronic miRNA miR-579 in a U87 cell line model. We found that ZFR is targeted by its intronic miRNA miR-579 and that alternative polyadenylation allows differential targeting. We additionally used bioinformatics analyses and RNA-Seq to evaluate a potential cross-talk between intronic miRNAs and alternative polyadenylation. CPSF2, a gene previously associated with alternative polyadenylation signal recognition, might be linked to intronic miRNA negative feedback by altering polyadenylation signal utilization."

Previously, both resonance Raman and low-temperature FTIR difference spectroscopy revealed that unlike CrChR2, CaChR1 under our conditions exhibits an almost pure all-trans retinal composition in the unphotolyzed ground state and undergoes an all-trans to 13-cis isomerization during the primary phototransition typical of other microbial rhodopsins such as bacteriorhodopsin (BR). Here, we apply static and rapid-scan FTIR difference spectroscopy along with site-directed mutagenesis to characterize the proton transfer events occurring upon the formation of the long-lived conducting P2380 state of CaChR1. Assignment of carboxylic C=O stretch bands indicates that Asp-299 (homolog to Asp-212 in BR) becomes protonated and Asp-169 (homolog to Asp-85 in BR) undergoes a net change in hydrogen bonding relative to the unphotolyzed ground state of CaChR1. These data along with earlier FTIR measurements on the CaChR1 → P1 transition are consistent with a two-step proton relay mechanism that transfers a proton from Glu-169 to Asp-299 during the primary phototransition and from the Schiff base to Glu-169 during P2380 formation. The unusual charge neutrality of both Schiff base counterions in the P2380 conducting state suggests that these residues may function as part of a cation selective filter in the open channel state of CaChR1 as well as other low-efficiency ChRs.

https://openalex.org/W2087250268,"Background Graves’ disease (GD) is a common cause of hyperthyroidism resulting in development of thyrotoxic heart disease (THD). Objectives to assess cardiovascular disorders and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with THD secondary to GD. Patients and Methods All patients diagnosed with THD secondary to GD between January 2011 and December 2013 were eligible for this study. Clinical assessment was performed at baseline and at the follow-up visit after the restoring of euthyroid state. HRQoL was studied with a questionnaire EQ-5D-5L. Results Follow-up data were available for 61 patients, but only 30 patients with THD secondary to GD were consented to participate in investigation of their HRQoL. The frequency of cardiovascular complications was significantly reduced as compared before and after the antithyroid therapy as follows: resting heart rate (122 vs. 74 bpm), blood pressure: systolic (155 vs. 123 mm Hg), diastolic (83 vs. 66 mm Hg), supraventricular premature contractions (71% vs. 7%), atrial fibrillation (72% vs. 25%), congestive heart failure (69% vs. 20%), thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy (77% vs. 26%), all p<0.01. Anti-TSH receptor antibodies were determined as independent predictor of left ventricular geometry changes, (b-coefficient = 0.04, 95%CI 0.01–0.07, p = 0.02). HRQoL was improved in all domains and self-rated health increased from 43 to 75 units by visual analogue score (p<0.001). Conclusions Restoring of euthyroid state in patients with GD is associated with significant elimination of cardiovascular disorders and improvement of HRQoL. To our knowledge this is the first study evaluating Ukrainian patients with THD secondary to GD with focus on HRQoL."
https://openalex.org/W2052177111,"The bacterial phage shock protein (Psp) system is a highly conserved cell envelope stress response required for virulence in Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica. In non-inducing conditions the transcription factor PspF is inhibited by an interaction with PspA. In contrast, PspA associates with the cytoplasmic membrane proteins PspBC during inducing conditions. This has led to the proposal that PspBC exists in an OFF state, which cannot recruit PspA, or an ON state, which can. However, nothing was known about the difference between these two states. Here, we provide evidence that it is the C-terminal domain of Y. enterocolitica PspC (PspCCT) that interacts directly with PspA, both in vivo and in vitro. Site-specific photocross-linking revealed that this interaction occurred only during Psp-inducing conditions in vivo. Importantly, we have also discovered that PspCCT can interact with the C-terminal domain of PspB (PspCCT·PspBCT). However, the PspCCT·PspBCT and PspCCT·PspA interactions were mutually exclusive in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo, PspCCT contacted PspBCT in the OFF state, whereas it contacted PspA in the ON state. These findings provide the first description of the previously proposed PspBC OFF and ON states and reveal that the regulatory switch is centered on a PspCCT partner-switching mechanism.Background: Regulation of the bacterial phage shock protein (Psp) stress response is poorly understood.Results: The C-terminal domain of PspC (PspCCT) can interact with PspA or PspB.Conclusion: Induction of psp gene expression involves a PspCCT binding partner switch from PspB to PspA.Significance: Understanding the activation mechanism is critical because this system is essential for virulence in Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica. The bacterial phage shock protein (Psp) system is a highly conserved cell envelope stress response required for virulence in Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica. In non-inducing conditions the transcription factor PspF is inhibited by an interaction with PspA. In contrast, PspA associates with the cytoplasmic membrane proteins PspBC during inducing conditions. This has led to the proposal that PspBC exists in an OFF state, which cannot recruit PspA, or an ON state, which can. However, nothing was known about the difference between these two states. Here, we provide evidence that it is the C-terminal domain of Y. enterocolitica PspC (PspCCT) that interacts directly with PspA, both in vivo and in vitro. Site-specific photocross-linking revealed that this interaction occurred only during Psp-inducing conditions in vivo.

Background: Regulation of the bacterial phage shock protein (Psp) stress response is poorly understood. Results: The C-terminal domain of PspC (PspCCT) can interact with PspA or PspB. Conclusion: Induction of psp gene expression involves a PspCCT binding partner switch from PspB to PspA. Significance: Understanding the activation mechanism is critical because this system is essential for virulence in Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica. Many cells monitor their cell envelope and respond to hostile conditions and events that can compromise it. Bacteria achieve this with specialized signaling pathways composed of envelope-associated sensory components and cytoplasmic transcriptional regulators, which work together to alter gene expression to combat the threat (1.Jordan S. Hutchings M.I. Mascher T. Cell envelope stress response in Gram-positive bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 107-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar2.MacRitchie D.M. Buelow D.R.

Pushing the envelope: extracytoplasmic stress responses in bacterial pathogens.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways are known as extracytoplasmic/envelope stress responses. One is the phage shock protein (Psp) 2The abbreviations used are: Pspphage shock proteinSOEsewing overlap extensionDDMn-dodecyl β-d-maltosideIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideMBPmaltose-binding proteinpBpap-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine. system, so-named because it is induced when Escherichia coli is infected with a filamentous phage (5.Brissette J.L. Russel M. Weiner L. Model P. Phage shock protein, a stress protein of Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the Psp system is not linked to phage infection exclusively. Instead, it is thought to promote bacterial survival during conditions that threaten the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane (6.Darwin A.J. The phage-shock-protein response.Mol.

It is essential for the virulence of the enteric pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (9.Darwin A.J. Miller V.L.

Furthermore, the psp genes are up-regulated during biofilm formation, macrophage infection, and the establishment of persister cells (11.Beloin C. Valle J. Latour-Lambert P. Faure P. Kzreminski M.

The Psp system has been studied most in E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, where the psp genes are expressed from σ54-dependent promoters that require the DNA-binding protein, PspF, for activity (16.Green R.C.

Model P. Identification, nucleotide sequence, and characterization of PspF, the transcriptional activator of the Escherichia coli stress-induced psp operon.J.

However, the pspA operons of these two species differ at the distal ends, pspABCDE in E. coli and pspABCDycjXF in Y. enterocolitica. Furthermore, only pspA, -B, -C, and -F have been linked to robust phenotypes, with PspA, -B, and -C each having dual regulatory and stress-mitigating functions (6.Darwin A.J.

Expression of the pspA operon is induced by stimuli that include extreme heat and hyperosmotic shock, high ethanol concentration, and the mislocalization of outer membrane secretin proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane (6.Darwin A.J. The phage-shock-protein response.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 8.Joly N. Engl C. Jovanovic G. Huvet M. Toni T. Sheng X. Stumpf M.P. Buck M.

Of these, only secretin mislocalization induces psp gene expression specifically in both E. coli and Y. enterocolitica (18.Lloyd L.J. Jones S.E. Jovanovic G. Gyaneshwar P. Rolfe M.D. Thompson A. Hinton J.C. Buck M. Identification of a new member of the phage shock protein response in Escherichia coli, the phage shock protein G (PspG).J. Biol.

Secretins are multimeric proteins with significance because they normally form the outer membrane channel of several types of bacterial protein export systems, many of which are involved in pathogenesis (23.Korotkov K.V. Gonen T. Hol W.G. Secretins: dynamic channels for protein transport across membranes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Regulation of pspA operon expression centers upon controlling the activity of the PspF transcription factor. In uninduced Y. enterocolitica cells, PspA inhibits PspF by interacting with it in the cytoplasm (24.Yamaguchi S. Gueguen E. Horstman N.K. Darwin A.J. Membrane association of PspA depends on activation of the phage-shock-protein response in Yersinia enterocolitica.Mol.

Changes in Psp protein binding partners, localization and behaviour upon activation of the Yersinia enterocolitica phage shock protein response.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 87: 656-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, an inducing stimulus causes PspA to redistribute from the cytoplasm to the cytoplasmic membrane, releasing PspF to activate the pspA promoter (24.Yamaguchi S. Gueguen E. Horstman N.K. Darwin A.J. Membrane association of PspA depends on activation of the phage-shock-protein response in Yersinia enterocolitica.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The integral cytoplasmic membrane protein complex PspBC is thought to dissociate the PspA-PspF complex by sequestering PspA (25.Yamaguchi S. Reid D.A. Rothenberg E. Darwin A.J. Changes in Psp protein binding partners, localization and behaviour upon activation of the Yersinia enterocolitica phage shock protein response.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 87: 656-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed a model in which an inducing stimulus causes PspBC to switch from an OFF to an ON state, with only the latter able to interact with PspA (26.Flores-Kim J. Darwin A.J. Phage shock protein C (PspC) of Yersinia enterocolitica is a polytopic membrane protein with implications for regulation of the Psp stress response.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of PspC (PspCCT) has been proposed to mediate the interaction with PspA (26.Flores-Kim J. Darwin A.J. Phage shock protein C (PspC) of Yersinia enterocolitica is a polytopic membrane protein with implications for regulation of the Psp stress response.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27.Jovanovic G. Engl C. Mayhew A.J. Burrows P.C. Buck M. Properties of the phage-shock-protein (Psp) regulatory complex that govern signal transduction and induction of the Psp response in Escherichia coli.Microbiology. 2010; 156: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, PspCCT pulls PspA down from a complex cell lysate in vitro, although it is not known if PspCCT contacts PspA directly (26.Flores-Kim J. Darwin A.J. Phage shock protein C (PspC) of Yersinia enterocolitica is a polytopic membrane protein with implications for regulation of the Psp stress response.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nor is it known what might prevent PspA from associating with PspBC in non-inducing conditions. In other words, what are the differences between the OFF and ON states of PspBC? In this work we have developed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate these questions. Our findings provide the first description of PspBC OFF and ON states and show that the regulatory switch is a PspCCT partner-switching mechanism.

Plasmids encoding GST-PspCCT with or without the V125D mutation or GST-PspBCT were made by amplifying the region encoding the 49 C-terminal amino acids of PspC or the 51 C-terminal amino acids of PspB from the chromosome of an appropriate Y. enterocolitica strain with primers 1986/42 and 1794/107, respectively. The fragments were digested with BamHI/SalI and cloned into pGEX-6P-1. For use in Y. enterocolitica, which is naturally ampicillin-resistant, derivatives of these plasmids encoding kanamycin resistance were made by transferring the kanamycin resistance gene from p34S-Km into the SalI restriction site located downstream of the gst fusion gene. A plasmid encoding PspB and PspC-FLAG was constructed by amplifying pspBC from plasmid pAJD1136 with primers 396/2085 and cloning it as a SacI/XbaI fragment into pWSK129 to generate plasmid pAJD2510. pAJD2510 derivatives containing an amber codon (TAG) at different positions within pspC, the PspB-W23R mutation, or the pspC-V125D mutation were constructed by sewing overlap extension (SOE) PCR (29.Heckman K.L. Pease L.R. Gene splicing and mutagenesis by PCR-driven overlap extension.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pAJD2510 insert was amplified in two sections as separate PCR fragments with primers that generated a short overlap between them, encoding the desired mutation. To generate plasmid pAJD2519 (codon 131 of pspC changed to TAG), the upstream fragment was amplified with primers 396/2084, and the downstream fragment was amplified with primers 2083/2085, both from pAJD1136 template. To generate plasmid pAJD2513 (codon 109 of pspC changed to TAG), the upstream fragment was amplified with primers 396/2074, and the downstream fragment was amplified with primers 2073/2085, both from pAJD1136. To generate plasmid pAJD2534 (encoding PspB-W23R and with codon 109 of pspC changed to TAG), the upstream fragment was amplified from pAJD1340 with primers 396/942, and the downstream fragment was amplified with primers 941/2085 from pAJD2513. To generate plasmid pAJD2600 (encoding PspC-V125D and with codon 109 of pspC changed to TAG), the upstream fragment was amplified with primers 396/2074, and the downstream fragment was amplified with primers 2073/2085, both from pAJD1659. To generate plasmid pAJD2602 (encoding PspB-W23R, PspC-V125D and with codon 109 of pspC changed to TAG), the upstream fragment was amplified with primers 396/2074 from pAJD2534, and the downstream fragment was amplified with primers 2073/2085 from pAJD1659. In all cases, each pair of upstream and downstream fragments was joined by SOE PCR and cloned into pWSK129 as SacI/XbaI fragments.

Reactive oxygen species produced in response to collagen have been found to be responsible for the propagation of GPVI signaling pathways in platelets. Therefore, it has been suggested that antioxidant enzymes could down-regulate GPVI-stimulated platelet activation. Although the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin II (PrxII) has emerged as having a role in negatively regulating signaling through various receptors by eliminating H2O2 generated upon receptor stimulation, the function of PrxII in collagen-stimulated platelets is not known. We tested the hypothesis that PrxII negatively regulates collagen-stimulated platelet activation. We analyzed PrxII-deficient murine platelets. PrxII deficiency enhanced GPVI-mediated platelet activation through the defective elimination of H2O2 and the impaired protection of SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) against oxidative inactivation, which resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of key components for the GPVI signaling cascade, including Syk, Btk, and phospholipase Cγ2. Interestingly, PrxII-mediated antioxidative protection of SHP-2 appeared to occur in the lipid rafts. PrxII-deficient platelets exhibited increased adhesion and aggregation upon collagen stimulation.

This paper demonstrates that understanding of the BJW concept, and its consequences for behavior, is enhanced if we specify what (or who) the source of justice might be. We introduce a new scale, the 5-Dimensional Belief in a Just Treatment Scale (BJT5), which distinguishes five causal dimensions of BJW (God, Nature, Other People, Self, Chance). We confirm the 5-factor structure of the BJT5. We then address whether the BJW should be considered a uni- and/or multi-dimensional construct and find support for our multi-dimensional approach. Finally, we demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity with respect to important correlates of BJW as well as action in response to important negative life events and societal attitudes. This work illustrates the importance of distinguishing causal dimensions with regard to who distributes justice."
https://openalex.org/W2011168291,"A number of imaging factors can affect the orientation distribution function (ODF) reconstruction in high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the b-value on the HARDI reconstruction and to seek for the appropriate b-value for ODF reconstruction from clinical HARDI data.Diffusion MRI data with various b-values were collected on a GE 3T MRI scanner. To reconstruct the diffusion ODF and fiber ODF, decomposition-based spherical polar Fourier imaging and deconvolution-based constrained spherical deconvolution approaches were applied separately. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the ODF and the angular difference of the peaks extracted from ODF were measured to investigate the effect of b-value on the ODF reconstruction. Visual inspection of the ODF was used to evaluate the reconstructions.The FWHM of the ODFs in the corpus callosum, which was chosen as the region of interest (ROI), decreased with increasing b-values. The differences in the FWHM for the diffusion ODF and the fiber ODF between the b-values of 2000 s/mm2 and 2500 s/mm2 were not significant. The angular differences of the ODF between 2000 s/mm2 and 2500 s/mm2 were lowest in both single-directional and two-directional situations. The ODFs became sharper and crossing-fiber situations were detected with an increase in b-value. B = 2000 s/mm2 and above revealed most of the two-way or three-way crossing-fiber structures.Considering both the signal-to-noise ratio and the acquisition time, b = 2000 s/mm2 is the basic requirement for ODF reconstruction using current HARDI methods on clinical data. This study can provide a useful reference for researchers and clinicians attempting to set appropriate scan protocols for specific HARDI experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1999335175,"Pathological cardiac hypertrophy (an increase in cardiac mass resulting from stress-induced cardiac myocyte growth) is a major factor underlying heart failure. Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase (Shp2) is critical for cardiac function because mutations resulting in loss of Shp2 catalytic activity are associated with congenital cardiac defects and hypertrophy. We identified a novel mechanism of Shp2 inhibition that may promote cardiac hypertrophy. We demonstrate that Shp2 is a component of the protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP)-Lbc complex. AKAP-Lbc facilitates PKA phosphorylation of Shp2, which inhibits Shp2 phosphatase activity. We identified two key amino acids in Shp2 that are phosphorylated by PKA. Thr-73 contributes a helix cap to helix αB within the N-terminal SH2 domain of Shp2, whereas Ser-189 occupies an equivalent position within the C-terminal SH2 domain. Utilizing double mutant PKA phosphodeficient (T73A/S189A) and phosphomimetic (T73D/S189D) constructs, in vitro binding assays, and phosphatase activity assays, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of these residues disrupts Shp2 interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands and inhibits its protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Overall, our data indicate that AKAP-Lbc integrates PKA and Shp2 signaling in the heart and that AKAP-Lbc-associated Shp2 activity is reduced in hypertrophic hearts in response to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation and PKA activation. Therefore, although induction of cardiac hypertrophy is a multifaceted process, inhibition of Shp2 activity through AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA is a previously unrecognized mechanism that may promote this compensatory response.Background: The AKAP-Lbc scaffold coordinates cardiac hypertrophic signaling.Results: PKA phosphorylation of Shp2 at Thr-73/Ser-189 inhibits tyrosine-phosphorylated ligand binding and PTP activity.Conclusion: AKAP-Lbc integrates PKA and Shp2 signaling, and AKAP-Lbc-associated Shp2 activity is reduced in hypertrophic hearts following chronic β-adrenergic stimulation.Significance: PKA inhibition of AKAP-Lbc-anchored Shp2 activity is a previously unrecognized mechanism that may promote cardiac hypertrophy.

https://openalex.org/W2073949720,"PKD is a family of three serine/threonine kinases (PKD-1, -2, and -3) involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes including proliferation, migration, secretion, and cell survival. We have previously shown that despite expression of all three isoforms in mouse epidermis, PKD1 plays a unique and critical role in wound healing, phorbol ester-induced hyperplasia, and tumor development. In translating our findings to the human, we discovered that PKD1 is not expressed in human keratinocytes (KCs) and there is a divergence in the expression and function of other PKD isoforms. Contrary to mouse KCs, treatment of cultured human KCs with pharmacological inhibitors of PKDs resulted in growth arrest. We found that PKD2 and PKD3 are expressed differentially in proliferating and differentiating human KCs, with the former uniformly present in both compartments whereas the latter is predominantly expressed in the proliferating compartment. Knockdown of individual PKD isoforms in human KCs revealed contrasting growth regulatory roles for PKD2 and PKD3. Loss of PKD2 enhanced KC proliferative potential while loss of PKD3 resulted in a progressive proliferation defect, loss of clonogenicity and diminished tissue regenerative ability. This proliferation defect was correlated with up-regulation of CDK4/6 inhibitor p15INK4B and induction of a p53-independent G1 cell cycle arrest. Simultaneous silencing of PKD isoforms resulted in a more pronounced proliferation defect consistent with a predominant role for PKD3 in proliferating KCs. These data underline the importance and complexity of PKD signaling in human epidermis and suggest a central role for PKD3 signaling in maintaining human epidermal homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2041047530,"Background Technical efficiency of hospital services is debated since performance has been heterogeneous. Staff time represents the main resource in patient care and its inappropriate allocation has been identified as a key factor of inefficiency. The aim of this study was to analyse the utilisation of physicians’ work time stratified by staff groups, tasks and places of work. A further aim was to use these data to estimate resource use per unit of output. Methods A self-reporting work-sampling study was carried during 14-days at a University Eye Hospital. Staff costs of physicians per unit of output were calculated at the wards, the operating rooms and the outpatient unit. Results Forty per cent of total work time was spent in contact with the patient. Thirty per cent was spent with documentation tasks. Time spent with documentation tasks declined monotonically with increasing seniority of staff. Unit costs were 56 € per patient day at the wards, 77 € and 20 € per intervention at the operating rooms for inpatients and outpatients, respectively, and 33 € per contact at the outpatient unit. Substantial differences in resources directly dedicated to the patient were found between these locations. Conclusion The presented data provide unprecedented units costs in inpatient Ophthalmology. Future research should focus on analysing factors that influence differences in time allocation, such as types of patients, organisation of care processes and composition of staff."
https://openalex.org/W2081687884,"Traditional management practices are usually thought to be sustainable. The Maya manage Sabal (Arecaceae) palms in homegardens, using their leaves for thatching. The sustainability of such production systems depends on the long-term persistence of palm populations, whereas resource availability also depends on the number of leaves on individual palms. We examined how leaf harvest affects Sabal yapa and S. mexicana population growth rates (λ) and leaf production, comparing traditional and alternative harvest regimes in terms of sustainability and productivity. Demographic, harvest and leaf production data were recorded for three years in two homegardens. We used general integral projection models linked to leaf-production models to describe population dynamics and productivity. Harvest had no effect on S. yapa's vital rates or on λ, but it changed the growth rate of individuals of S. mexicana, with a negligible impact on λ. Homegardens affected λ values, reflecting the species' ecological affinities. S. mexicana, introduced from mesic forests, required watering and shade; therefore, its population declined rapidly in the homegarden that lacked both water and shade. The λ of the xerophilic S. yapa was slightly larger without watering than with watering. Palms usually compensated for leaf extraction, causing the number of leaves harvested per individual to increase with harvest intensity. Nevertheless, traditional management is relatively mild, allowing standing leaves to accumulate but reducing the homegarden's yield. Apparently, the Maya do not seek to maximize annual production but to ensure the availability of large numbers of leaves in homegardens. These leaves may then be used when the entire roof of a hut needs to be replaced every few years."
https://openalex.org/W2027684003,"Polyubiquitination is a post-translational event used to control the degradation of damaged or unwanted proteins by modifying the target protein with a chain of ubiquitin molecules. One potential mechanism for the assembly of polyubiquitin chains involves the dimerization of an E2 conjugating enzyme allowing conjugated ubiquitin molecules to be put into close proximity to assist reactivity. HIP2 (UBE2K) and Ubc1 (yeast homolog of UBE2K) are unique E2 conjugating enzymes that each contain a C-terminal UBA domain attached to their catalytic domains, and they have basal E3-independent polyubiquitination activity. Although the isolated enzymes are monomeric, polyubiquitin formation activity assays show that both can act as ubiquitin donors or ubiquitin acceptors when in the activated thioester conjugate suggesting dimerization of the E2-ubiquitin conjugates. Stable disulfide complexes, analytical ultracentrifugation and small angle x-ray scattering were used to show that the HIP2-Ub and Ubc1-Ub thioester complexes remain predominantly monomeric in solution. Models of the HIP2-Ub complex derived from SAXS data show the complex is not compact but instead forms an open or backbent conformation similar to UbcH5b~Ub or Ubc13~Ub where the UBA domain and covalently attached ubiquitin reside on opposite ends of the catalytic domain. Activity assays showed that full length HIP2 exhibited a five-fold increase in the formation rate of di-ubiquitin compared to a HIP2 lacking the UBA domain. This difference was not observed for Ubc1 and may be attributed to the closer proximity of the UBA domain in HIP2 to the catalytic core than for Ubc1."

Here, we report the identification of eight INAD phosphorylation sites using a mass spectrometry approach. PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ4 each harbor one phosphorylation site, three phosphorylation sites are located in the linker region between PDZ1 and 2, one site is located between PDZ2 and PDZ3, and one site is located in the N-terminal region. Using a phosphospecific antibody, we found that INAD phosphorylated at Thr170/Ser174 was located within the rhabdomeres of the photoreceptor cells, suggesting that INAD becomes phosphorylated in this cellular compartment. INAD phosphorylation at Thr170/Ser174 depends on light, the phototransduction cascade, and on eye-Protein kinase C that is attached to INAD via one of its PDZ domains."

The variant was initially identified in a heterozygous state in a PLS unaffected sibling whose whole exome had been sequenced as part of a previous Primary ciliary dyskinesia study. Using this information, a proxy molecular diagnosis was made on the PLS affected siblings after consent was given to study this second disorder found to be segregating within the family. The prevalence of the mutation was then assayed in the local population using a representative sample of 256 unrelated individuals. The variant was absent in all subjects indicating that the variant is rare in Saudi Arabia. This family study illustrates how whole-exome sequencing can generate findings and inferences beyond its primary goal."
https://openalex.org/W2026268226,"The annotated whole-genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed the presence of a putative recD gene; however, the biochemical characteristics of its encoded protein product (MtRecD) remain largely unknown. Here, we show that MtRecD exists in solution as a stable homodimer. Protein-DNA binding assays revealed that MtRecD binds efficiently to single-stranded DNA and linear duplexes containing 5′ overhangs relative to the 3′ overhangs but not to blunt-ended duplex. Furthermore, MtRecD bound more robustly to a variety of Y-shaped DNA structures having ≥18-nucleotide overhangs but not to a similar substrate containing 5-nucleotide overhangs. MtRecD formed more salt-tolerant complexes with Y-shaped structures compared with linear duplex having 3′ overhangs. The intrinsic ATPase activity of MtRecD was stimulated by single-stranded DNA. Site-specific mutagenesis of Lys-179 in motif I abolished the ATPase activity of MtRecD. Interestingly, although MtRecD-catalyzed unwinding showed a markedly higher preference for duplex substrates with 5′ overhangs, it could also catalyze significant unwinding of substrates containing 3′ overhangs. These results support the notion that MtRecD is a bipolar helicase with strong 5′ → 3′ and weak 3′ → 5′ unwinding activities. The extent of unwinding of Y-shaped DNA structures was ∼3-fold lower compared with duplexes with 5′ overhangs.

During the human phase of the M. tuberculosis life cycle, it is exposed to genotoxic stress originating from both antimicrobial host defense mechanisms and the environment. The survival within the infected macrophage and reactivation of the tubercle bacillus from the dormant state are key features of infection; therefore, the maintenance of genome integrity is of critical importance in the biology of M. tuberculosis (21.Dos Vultos T. Mestre O. Tonjum T. Gicquel B. DNA repair in Mycobacterium tuberculosis revisited.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2009; 33: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

The most severe genotoxic lesions are DSBs, which are also important intermediates in different processes of DNA metabolism. Intriguingly, the RecBCD complex, a crucial resection nuclease for HR in E. coli (6.Smith G.R. Amundsen S.K. Dabert P. Taylor A.F.

However, it remains unknown whether or not M. tuberculosis ΔrecBCD mutants behave much like M. smegmatis ΔrecBCD mutants with respect to HR and DNA repair. In the absence of biochemical and biophysical data on the solution properties of mycobacterial RecBCD and the interpretation of genetic data remain speculative. The co-existence of genes encoding both RecBCD and AdnAB enzymes intrinsic to HR and DNA repair is consistent with the notion that they might play diverse and important roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity of cells (16.Sinha K.M.

Notwithstanding, these findings raise important questions regarding the functional characteristics of recB, recC, and recD genes in M. tuberculosis. Specifically, it is not clear whether these putative genes are capable of encoding enzymatically active subunits of the RecBCD enzyme complex. Furthermore, the relative contributions and the importance of RecBCD and AdnAB enzymes to the maintenance of genome integrity remain uncharacterized. Much of our mechanistic insight into the biological functions of RecD helicases is gained from studies of E. coli RecD, which is expressed at low levels, has poor solubility and yield, and is difficult to study in isolation (24.Amundsen S.K.

Dillingham M.S. Superfamily 1 helicases.Front. Biosci. 2013; 5: 206-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many biochemical and mechanistic studies have been on the intact RecBCD enzyme complex, which is complicated by the fact that it contains two helicase subunits, RecB and RecD (7.Dillingham M.S. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecBCD enzyme and the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 642-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the N-terminal truncated form of Deinococcus radiodurans RecD2 helicase has been solved to 2.2-Å resolution (33.Saikrishnan K. Griffiths S.P. Cook N. Court R. Wigley D.B. DNA binding to RecD: role of the 1B domain in SF1B helicase activity.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the structure of a full-length RecD remains to be determined. In this study, we have isolated the M. tuberculosis recD gene, generated its mutant allele, and purified the wild-type and mutant forms of its encoded product (MtRecD) to homogeneity from the soluble fraction of cells. We observed that MtRecD exhibited greater affinity and specificity to Y-shaped and linear duplexes containing a 5′ overhang. The unwinding mechanism proposed for SF1 helicases, based on the crystal structures of PcrA and UvrD, has been the subject of much debate because of the absence of direct evidence that monomers can catalyze DNA-unwinding reactions. Indeed, it has been conjectured that either a homodimer or higher order oligomeric form of SF1 helicase(s) is essential for driving efficient DNA unwinding activity (34.Gilhooly N.S. Gwynn E.J. Dillingham M.S. Superfamily 1 helicases.Front. Biosci. 2013; 5: 206-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our results showing that MtRecD exists in solution as a homodimer, binds more robustly to Y-shaped DNA structures, and catalyzes ATP-dependent unwinding of DNA substrates in both 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′ directions, albeit with different efficiencies, as well as inhibits RecA activity, are striking. In summary, these studies provide the first detailed characterization of MtRecD and present important insights into the type of DNA structures the enzyme is likely to act upon during the processes of DNA repair or HR.

These sequences were analyzed for domain architecture and aligned using multiple alignment algorithm with the Clustal series of programs and visualized using Jalview. The MTCY 20H10 cosmid, which bears the recD gene, was obtained from Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. The nucleotide sequence of recD ORF (accession number, Rv0629c) was identified using the TubercuList database. The predicted ORF corresponding to M. tuberculosis recD was PCR-amplified from MTCY 20H10 cosmid using the following primers: forward primer 5′-AAGGCTGCACATATGAAGCTCACC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATCCCCCTCGAGTCAGCCACACCC-3′ that contained NdeI and XhoI (underlined) restriction sites. A single PCR cycle consisted of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification with each cycle consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 60 s, then annealing at 45 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The PCR product was cloned directionally into the pET21a(+) expression vector, using terminal NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The identity of the cloned M. tuberculosis recD gene was confirmed by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was designated as pMtRD. A point mutation at residue Lys-179 in M. tuberculosis recD was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (39.Heckman K.L. Pease L.R. Gene splicing and mutagenesis by PCR-driven overlap extension.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Briefly, two primers were designed incorporating the mutation. pMtRD was used as a template. Two separate PCRs were performed using the following primers: forward primer 5′-AAGGCTGCACATATGAAGCTCACC 3′ carrying NdeI, and mutant primer 5′-CGTCGTCGTCGCCCCGGTGCC-3′. In the second set of PCRs, the following primers were used: reverse primer 5′-ATCCCCCTCGAGTCAGCCACACCC-3′ carrying XhoI restriction sites and mutant primer 5′-GGCACCGGGGCGACGACGACG-3′. The PCR products were gel-purified. Both the purified fragments were pooled, and another round of PCRs in which gene-specific primers were used, to generate the full-length mutants. The PCR product was cloned directionally into the pET21a(+) expression vector, using terminal NdeI and XhoI restriction sites and was named pMtRDK179A. The identity of M. tuberculosis recD mutant (pMtRDK179A) was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. MtRecD was overexpressed in E. coli host strain Rosetta 2 (DE3)pLysS bearing pMtRD. Fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was inoculated with overnight culture grown under the same conditions at a ratio of 1:100. Cells were grown at 37 °C until the A600 = 0.6 was achieved. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for overexpression of MtRecD at 18 °C for 12 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed with buffer"
https://openalex.org/W2161094794,"Several dietary oils have been used preventatively and therapeutically in the setting of neurological disease. However, the mechanisms underlying their influence on brain function and metabolism remain unknown. It was investigated whether 3 types of dietary oils affected emotional behaviors in mice. Wild-type (WT) mice and sialyltransferase ST3Gal IV-knockout (KO) mice, which exhibit increased emotional and cognitive behaviors, were fed diets containing 20% dietary oils from post-weaning to adulthood. Mice were fed pellets made from control feed AIN93G powder containing 18% fish oil, soybean oil, or a mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-palmitoyl glycerol (POP) and 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl glycerol (SOS), plus 2% soybean oil. Once mice reached adulthood, they were subjected to fear conditioning test to measure cognitive anxiety and forced swim test to measure depression. WT mice fed the POP-SOS diet showed a 0.6-fold decrease in percent freezing with contextual fear compared with WT mice fed the control diet. KO mice fed the fish oil diet showed a 1.4-fold increase in percent freezing with contextual fear compared with KO mice fed the control diet. These findings indicate that response to contextual fear was improved in WT mice that consumed POP-SOS but aggravated in KO mice that consumed fish oils. Furthermore, KO mice showed a 0.4-fold decrease in percent freezing in response to tone fear when they were fed POP-SOS diet compared to a control diet. Thus, POP-SOS diet reduced tone fear level of KO mice until the same level of WT mice. Finally, KO mice fed the soybean oil diet showed a 1.7-fold increase in immobility in the forced swim test compared to KO mice fed the control diet. Taken together, oil-rich diets differentially modulate anxiety and depression in normal and anxious mice. Oils rich in saturated fatty acids may alleviate anxiety more strongly than other oils."
