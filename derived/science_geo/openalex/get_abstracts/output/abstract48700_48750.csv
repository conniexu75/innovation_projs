https://openalex.org/W2028372889,"The influenza A virus M2 protein is expressed abundantly at the cell surface, and in addition to the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), is a third virus-specific membrane protein. M2 has an internal hydrophobic membrane anchorage domain and associates with the same cellular membrane fractions as HA and NA. Trypsin treatment of infected cells and immunoprecipitation with site-specific antisera indicate that a minimum of 18 NH2-terminal amino acids of M2 are exposed at the cell surface. Ten NH2-terminal residues are conserved in all strains of influenza A virus for which sequences are available. Antibodies can recognize M2 on the cell surface and therefore it may be an infected-cell surface antigen. We discuss properties of M2 that match it to the elusive major target molecule on influenza A virus-infected cells for crossreactive cytotoxic T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526978170,"Following the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes insulin acutely activates the rate of 2-deoxy-[1-14C]glucose uptake in the mature 3T3-L1 adipocyte by 15- to 20-fold. Phenylarsine oxide, a trivalent arsenical that forms stable ring complexes with vicinal dithiols, prevents insulin-activated hexose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner (Ki = 7 microM) but has no inhibitory effect on basal hexose uptake. 2,3-Dimercaptopropanol at a level nearly stoichiometric to that of phenylarsine oxide prevents or rapidly reverses the inhibition of hexose uptake; 2-mercaptoethanol, even in high stoichiometric excess over the arsenical, does not reverse inhibition of hexose uptake. When phenylarsine oxide is added after adipocytes have been fully activated by insulin, 2-deoxy-[1-14C]glucose uptake rate decays slowly at a rate corresponding to that caused by the withdrawal of insulin (t1/2 = 10 min). Using the same conditions under which phenylarsine oxide blocked activation, the Km for deoxyglucose uptake, the rate at which 125I-insulin became cell-associated, and the 125I-insulin binding isotherm for solubilized insulin receptor were not affected by phenylarsine oxide. These results support the transporter translocation model for insulin-activated hexose transport and implicate vicinal sulfhydryl groups in a post-insulin binding event essential for the translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2007065677,"The differentiation into macrophages of the monocytic cell line U-937 or the monomyelocytic cell line HL-60 induced by phorbol esters is accompanied by a rapid induction of the expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos. Maximal levels of c-fos gene transcripts accumulate within 20-30 min following induction. By 2 hr, the c-fos-specific mRNA level drops 5 to 10 fold below that detected at 30 min after induction. The concentration of c-fos mRNA remains unchanged for the next 5 days, at which time over 99% of the viable precursor cells are converted to adherent macrophages. c-fos protein can be detected within 20 min of induction, reaching maximal levels by 40-60 min. Little or no c-fos protein is detected by 120-150 min after induction, even though c-fos mRNA remains detectable. Presence of cycloheximide leads to superinduction of c-fos mRNA transcripts. No c-fos gene transcripts are detected when the HL-60 cell line is induced with Me2SO to differentiate to granulocytes. A role for the c-fos protein is envisaged in the monocyte differentiation pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1994340137,"Recently we demonstrated that low-pH compartments can be visualized with the electron microscope using a basic congener of dinitrophenol, 3-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-3'-amino-N-methyldipropylamine (DAMP), which concentrates in acidic compartments and can be detected by immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal anti-dinitrophenol antibody. We now report that DAMP also accumulates in cisternae and vesicles associated with the trans face of the Golgi apparatus. DAMP rapidly leaves this compartment when cells are incubated with the ionophore monensin, which indicates that accumulation is due to the acidic pH in this compartment. Using indirect protein A-gold immunocytochemistry, we localized fibronectin, a major secretory protein in fibroblasts, to the trans Golgi vesicles that took up DAMP. Therefore, the trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and forming secretory vesicles have an acidic pH."
https://openalex.org/W2001870577,"The fidelity of the mitotic transmission of minichromosomes in S. cerevisiae is monitored by a novel visual assay that allows one to detect changes in plasmid copy number in individual mitotic divisions. This assay is used to investigate the mitotic transmission of a plasmid containing a putative yeast origin of replication (ARS 1) and a centromere (CEN3). The rate of improper segregation for the minichromosome is 200-fold higher than observed for a normal chromosome. However, the replication of the minichromosome is stringently controlled; it overreplicates less than once per one thousand mitotic divisions. We also use this assay to isolate and characterize mutations in ARS 1 and CEN3. The mutations in ARS 1 define a new domain required for its optimal activity, and the mutations in CEN3 suggest that the integrity of element II is not essential for centromere function. Finally, the phenotypes of the mutations in ARS 1 and CEN3 are consistent with their function in replication and segregation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1573651134,"The maize chloroplast chromosome contains two light-inducible genes, ps1A1 and ps1A2, that code for 45% homologous polypeptides of 83.2 and 82.5 kDa designated A1 and A2, respectively. Two types of immunochemical evidence show that the upstream gene, ps1A1, codes for a P700 chlorophyll a-protein at the reaction center of photosystem I of the photosynthetic apparatus. Antibodies against a synthetic peptide with a sequence deduced from the DNA sequence of an unconserved segment of A1 react with polypeptides of P700 chlorophyll-protein (CPI) complexes of maize and pea photosystem I; antibodies prepared against barley CPI immunoprecipitate products of in vitro transcription and translation directed by cloned chloroplast DNA containing this gene. The extensive homology between maize polypeptides A1 and A2 suggests that both may be components of CPI, although CPI has been generally considered to be comprised of two molecules of a single protein of only 66 to 70 kDa. The hexapeptide Asp-Pro-Thr-Thr-Arg-Arg in A2 is also present in another chlorophyll protein, the P680 chlorophyll a-protein of photosystem II, and is partially duplicated in A1. The number and locations of histidyl residues, which have been suggested to serve in chlorophyll binding, are highly conserved between A1 and A2."
https://openalex.org/W1550654653,"We have examined the effects of thermosensitive mutations in secA and secY (prlA) genes on the export of proteins to the three layers of the Escherichia coli cell surface. After several hours at the nonpermissive temperature, the export of two major outer membrane proteins, lipoprotein and OmpA, is delayed, then essentially blocked, in either a secA or secY strain. These mutations also have a strong effect on the export of several proteins, such as maltose binding protein, to the periplasm, though the export of many periplasmic proteins is not affected. secA and secY block the assembly of leader peptidase, which is made without a leader sequence, into the inner membrane. However, the membrane assembly of M13 coat protein (an inner membrane protein made with an amino-terminal leader sequence) is not affected. Thus, the requirement for sec function for export does not correlate with the presence or absence of leader peptide or with a particular subcellular compartment, but rather is specific to each particular protein."
https://openalex.org/W1593830931,"The amino acid sequence of human lymphotoxin derived from a 1788 lymphoblastoid cell line was determined. Peptide fragments obtained by trypsin, lysine-C peptidase, cyanogen bromide, and acetic acid cleavage of the intact protein were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by amino acid composition and by automated Edman degradation. The protein is 171 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 18,664. It contains one asparagine-linked glycosylation site and lacks cysteine. The salient features of the amino acid sequence of lymphotoxin are described."
https://openalex.org/W2032050476,"An in vitro model was developed to study the hepatic phase of Plasmodium falciparum, the only malaria parasite lethal to man. Primary cultures of human hepatocytes were inoculated with sporozoites of Brazilian and African strains of P. falciparum. On days 1 through 7 after inoculation examination of fluorescence-labeled and Giemsa-stained preparations demonstrated the presence of many intracellular parasites. In three separate sets of experiments all cultures were found to be infected with as many as 650 liver schizonts measuring up to 40 micrometers. After the addition of red blood cells, intraerythrocytic forms of P. falciparum were detected on days 12 and 13 by an immunofluorescence assay, indicating that the hepatic cycle had been completed in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1596377804,"Abstract Structures of glycolipids isolated from human granulocytes were elucidated by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and exo- and endoglycosidase treatment. All neutral glycolipids, with saccharide residues ranging from 2 to 10, were found to have linear N-acetyllactosaminyl backbones. The majority of neutral glycolipids contain one or two fucosyl residues attached to N-acetylglucosamine residues through the Fuc alpha 1----3 linkage and were reactive with the monoclonal antibody specific to Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc, the Lex structure. Their general structure can be expressed as follows: (formula; see text) where n = 0-3. Glycolipids containing sialic acid (gangliosides) were also found to have linear N-acetyllactosaminyl backbones with sialic acid joined to this backbone by either alpha 2----3 or alpha 2----6 linkage. The gangliosides have the following general structure: (formula; see text) where n = 0-3. The ceramide was composed of sphingosine with d18:1 as the long-chain base and C16:0 (as a major component) or C24:1 (as a minor component) fatty acid. Analysis of glycolipids isolated from granulocytes, erythrocytes, and whole blood cells revealed that, among the glycolipids prepared from the whole blood cells, dihexaosylceramide, lactoneotetraosylceramide, and the above described linear lactoneo series neutral glycolipids are present in granulocytes but barely present in erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1983182251,"Potomac horse fever, a disease characterized by fever, anorexia, leukopenia, and occasional diarrhea, is fatal in approximately 30 percent of affected animals. The seasonal occurrence of the disease (June to October) and evidence of antibodies to the rickettsia Ehrlichia sennetsu in the serum of convalescing horses suggested that a related rickettsia might be the causative agent. Such an agent was isolated in cultured blood monocytes from an experimentally infected pony. This intracytoplasmic organism was adapted to growth in primary cultures of canine blood monocytes. A healthy pony inoculated with these infected monocytes also developed the disease. The organism was reisolated from this animal which, at autopsy, had pathological manifestations typical of Potomac horse fever. Cross serologic reactions between the newly isolated agent and antisera to 15 rickettsiae revealed that it is related to certain members of the genus Ehrlichia, particularly to Ehrlichia sennetsu. Since the disease occurs in other parts of the United States as well as in the vicinity of the Potomac River, and since it has also been reported in Europe, the name equine monocytic ehrlichiosis is proposed as being more descriptive."

https://openalex.org/W1505281346,"The M2 subunit of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase was purified to homogeneity from hydroxyurea-resistant, M2-overproducing mouse cells. The purification procedure involved affinity chromatography on an anti-tubulin antibody-Sepharose column and high performance gel permeation chromatography. The pure protein is a dimer of Mr = 88,000, containing stoichiometric amounts of a non-heme iron center and a tyrosyl free radical. The radical is destroyed by hydroxyurea but can readily be regenerated on incubation of the radical-free protein alone with iron-dithiothreitol in the presence of air. The ability to spontaneously regenerate the tyrosyl radical distinguishes protein M2 from the corresponding subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase, protein B2, but apart from that the two proteins are very similar."
https://openalex.org/W1558811147,"Light-mediated conformational changes in highly purified 124-kDa phytochrome preparations from etiolated oat seedlings have been identified by steric exclusion high performance liquid chromatography and limited proteolytic studies. Steric exclusion high performance liquid chromatography studies of oat and rye phytochromes show photoreversible changes in retention times, with the red absorbing form of phytochrome (Pr form) eluting later than the far red absorbing form of phytochrome produced by saturating red light illumination of Pr (Pfr form) in a variety of different mobile phase buffers. Molecular mass calibration with globular protein standards in Tris-glycol buffers provides estimates of 318-349 and 363-366 kDa for the molecular sizes of the Pr and Pfr forms, respectively. These analyses support earlier studies that phytochrome is a nonglobular homodimer of 124-kDa subunits in vitro. Limited proteolytic dissection of phytochrome in nondenaturing buffers with seven different endoproteases provides evidence for two operational domains within the 124-kDa subunit with molecular mass values of 69-72 and 52-55 kDa. The larger 69-72-kDa domain contains the site for the chromophore attachment as shown by gel electrophoresis derived enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing site-directed rabbit antiserum to a synthetic undecapeptide which is homologous with the chromophore binding site on oat phytochrome. This chromophore domain exhibits a compact structure, resistant to further proteolysis except near its N terminus. By contrast, the 52-55-kDa nonchromophore domain contains multiple sites for further proteolytic cleavage as revealed by rapid cleavage to smaller polypeptide fragments. Detailed kinetic analyses of the limited proteolytic cleavage of phytochrome with four endoproteases, subtilisin BPN', thermolysin, trypsin, and clostripain, has mapped specific regions within the 124-kDa subunit that participate in light-induced conformational changes. These include a 4-10-kDa region near the N terminus of the chromophore binding domain and at least two regions within the nonchromophore domain. A comprehensive peptide map of the oat phytochrome subunit is presented, which incorporates the results of these proteolytic studies with the recent, yet unpublished sequence analyses of Avena phytochrome cDNA clones which show the N-terminal localization of the chromophore binding site (Hershey, H. P., Colbert, J. T., Lissemore, J. L., Barker, R. F., and Quail, P. H. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 2332-2336)."

Fraction I which is excluded from the gel contains alpha-mannosidase activity toward both p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and Man9GlcNAc oligosaccharide as substrates, whereas Fraction II which is included in the gel contains only oligosaccharide alpha-mannosidase activity. The latter enzyme is very specific and removes a single mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc, whereas the alpha-mannosidase activity of Fraction I removes several mannose residues from Man9GlcNAc oligosaccharide. High resolution 1H NMR analysis of the Man8GlcNAc formed from Man9GlcNAc in the presence of the alpha-mannosidase of Fraction II showed only a single isomer with the following structure: (see formula; see text) This specific enzyme is most probably involved in processing of oligosaccharide during biosynthesis of mannoproteins. The mannose analog of 1-deoxynojirimycin (50-500 microM), dideoxy-1,5-imino-D-mannitol, inhibits the oligosaccharide alpha-mannosidase activities of Fractions I and II to about the same extent, but has no effect on the nonspecific alpha-mannosidase which acts on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside."
https://openalex.org/W2169800347,"The kinetics for transport of glucose and 3-O-methylglucose (MeGlc) were determined in preparations of rat adipocytes characterized by low basal rates which could be increased consistently more than 30-fold by addition of insulin (10 nM). In basal cells, the Km of [14C]glucose uptake was about 75 mM. The Ki for glucose inhibition of [14C]MeGlc uptake was similarly high (105 mM). These results were further confirmed by studies of basal glucose consumption which remained linear up to the highest glucose concentration used (30 mM) and by measurements of MeGlc transport kinetics (net and equilibrium exchange Km were both about 35 mM). Basal glucose uptake was determined to be stereospecific and cytochalasin sensitive (greater than 90%) and thus could not be dismissed as nonmediated diffusion. Insulin treatment decreased the transport Km for glucose and MeGlc to one-tenth the values measured in basal cells. The Vmax for glucose was doubled and that for MeGlc quadrupled. We conclude that insulin brings about a great reduction in the Km of hexose transport in adipocytes. This can only be perceived if activation of basal cells by experimental manipulations is avoided. The decrease in Km is the major kinetic factor involved in the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2057226296,"The sequences required for stringent regulation of the E. coli tyrT gene have been analyzed in vivo. Stringent control was analyzed by nuclease-mapping RNA pulse-labeled with 32PO4. A 96 bp DNA fragment carrying the tyrT promoter was sufficient to confer regulation on a plasmid-encoded tyrT-galK fusion transcript. Deletion mutations that remove sequences upstream of the primary promoter elements greatly reduce promoter activity but do not remove the regulatory response. However, a 4 bp substitution mutation, adjacent to the transcription initiation site, disrupts stringent control. Thus the optimal expression and stringent regulation of the tyrT gene appears to result from the action of genetically separable promoter elements."
https://openalex.org/W1500779211,"A major serum protein was isolated from the hemolymph of larvae of the female tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, just prior to metamorphosis. After 3 or 4 days, this predominantly female-specific protein is rapidly cleared from the hemolymph and taken up and stored by the fat body. This larval serum protein was purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation, gel permeation, and ion-exchange chromatography. The purified protein exhibits a single band on native gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Chemical cross-linking with dimethylsuberimidate indicates a hexameric subunit arrangement for the native protein. The amino acid composition, relatively rich in methionine but poor in cysteine, was used to calculate a v = 0.75 cm3/g. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments yielded S020,w = 16.9 S and D020,w = 3.23 X 10(-7) cm2/s. From these values Mr = 510,000, f/f0 = 1.22, and Stokes radius = 66.3 A were calculated. Immunoblotting experiments with anti-larval serum protein serum indicate a cross-reactivity with storage protein-1 of Bombyx mori. The amino acid composition and immunological data suggest that larval serum protein may be an example of a class of insect storage proteins distinct from the arylphorins, which are characterized by high content of aromatic amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1571853241,"To obtain further information concerning the structure of Fc IgG-binding sites on human peripheral blood lymphocytes, enriched T-cells were surface-radioiodinated and treated with nonionic detergent, and the soluble supernatant was submitted to affinity chromatography selecting for components binding complexed IgG. Analysis of eluted material by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and two-dimensional electrophoresis demonstrated the major proteins to be of Mr 56,000, pI 4.8-5.1 and Mr 60,000, pI 5.0-5.6, and these were radiolabeled, indicating an origin in part from the T-cell membrane. While the Mr 56,000 band gave positive reactions upon transblotting with antisera to Gc protein, the identity of the Mr 60,000 protein remains unknown. Three other components were detected, although with less consistency; Mr 78,000, 42,000, and 20,000-25,000, respectively. Immunocytochemical experiments showed that less than 5% freshly isolated native T-cells were positive with antiserum to human Gc, but, after IgG antibody-coated erythrocyte rosetting, the number of positive cells increased to 15-25%, in close agreement with the percentage of IgG antibody-coated erythrocyte rosette-positive T-cells. These findings therefore indicate that, in addition to interaction with components of Mr 60,000, 42,000, and 20,000-25,000, complexed IgG binding to Fc gamma of human peripheral blood T-cells also becomes spatially associated with Gc protein."
https://openalex.org/W1479897624,"Interferon-alpha/beta induces in cells from mice carrying the influenza virus resistance allele Mx+ the synthesis of a unique 75,000-dalton protein (designated here protein Mx) that was not detectable in interferon-treated cells from Mx- mice lacking the resistance allele (Horisberger, M. A., Staeheli, P., and Haller, O. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 1910-1914). We have immunized Mx- BALB/c mice with extracts of interferon-treated cells from congenic Mx+ BALB X A2G-Mx mice. Resulting hyperimmune sera immunoprecipitated a single interferon-inducible 75,000-dalton protein of Mx+ embryo cells. Sera did not react with any interferon-inducible protein of Mx- cells. Synthesis of the immunoprecipitable 75,000-dalton protein Mx was induced by interferon-alpha/beta but not by interferon-gamma in Mx+ cells of diverse genetic backgrounds. Monoclonal antibodies to protein Mx were selected in similar immunoprecipitation assays. One discrete in vitro translation product of relevant mRNA reacted with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and was indistinguishable from in vivo synthesized protein Mx."
https://openalex.org/W2082784572,"Human erythrocyte band 3, a major membrane-spanning protein, was purified and incorporated into liposomes. These liposomes, at nanomolar concentrations of protein, inhibited invasion of human erythrocytes in vitro by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Liposomes containing human band 3 were ten times more effective in inhibiting invasion than those with pig band 3 and six times more effective than liposomes containing human erythrocyte glycophorin. Liposomes alone or liposomes containing erythrocyte glycolipids did not inhibit invasion. These results suggest that band 3 participates in the invasion process in a step involving a specific, high-affinity interaction between band 3 and some component of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1593069995,"Chromogranin polypeptides of Mr 100,000, Mr 85,000, Mr 75,000, and Mr 65,000 have been detected in adrenal medulla chromaffin granules using anti-chromogranin antiserum. Monoclonal antibodies to this protein also detect the multiple molecular weight chromogranin polypeptides. Analysis of phosphorylated amino acids gives a value of 5 phosphoserine residues/mol of Mr 75,000 chromogranin polypeptide. Immunological analysis of dephosphorylated chromogranin shows that the anti-chromogranin serum reacts with both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the protein. Each of the chromogranin polypeptides has been isolated using a combination of DEAE-cellulose chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Sequencer analysis of each protein revealed a high degree of amino acid identities at the amino terminal of these proteins. Amino-terminal Sequencer analysis of chromogranin fragments also provides evidence for a gene duplication event. Preliminary studies also show that chromogranin may be degraded in the chromaffin granules by a calcium-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1544933262,"The mechanism for hyperresponsive insulin-mediated glucose transport in adipose cells from 30-day-old obese Zucker rats was examined. Glucose transport was assayed by measuring 3-O-methylglucose transport, and the concentration of glucose transporters was estimated by measuring specific D-glucose-inhibitable cytochalasin B binding. Insulin increased glucose transport activity by approximately 17 fmol/cell/min in cells from obese rats compared to 3 fmol/cell/min in lean littermates. Insulin increased the concentration of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane fraction by about 15 pmol/mg of membrane protein in both groups. The insulin-mediated decrease in the concentration of transporters in the low-density microsomal fraction was 30 pmol/mg of membrane protein for the obese rats compared to 15 pmol/mg of membrane protein for the lean controls. An estimated number of glucose transporters was calculated using membrane protein and enzyme recoveries for each group. Insulin increased the number of transporters in the plasma membrane by 3 X 10(6) sites/cell for the obese rats and only 0.6 X 10(6) sites/cell for the lean controls. In addition, insulin decreased the number of transporters/cell in the intracellular membrane pool by approximately 4 X 10(6) sites/cell for the obese rats and 0.9 X 10(6) sites/cells for the lean rats. The total number of transporters/cell was about 7 X 10(6) sites/cell for the obese animals and 1.6 X 10(6) sites/cell for the lean controls. In the basal state, more than 80% of these transporters were located in the intracellular pool for both the lean and obese rats. Thus, the marked hyperresponsive insulin-mediated glucose transport observed in adipose cells from 30-day-old obese Zucker rats may be the consequence of a marked increase in the number of glucose transporters in the intracellular pool."
https://openalex.org/W1666406333,"Abstract By use of 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, the branch specificity of bovine colostrum CMP-NeuAc:Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc-R alpha 2----6-sialyltransferase towards a biantennary glycopeptide and oligosaccharides of the N-acetyllactosamine type, differing in completeness and structure of their core portion, was investigated. In agreement with earlier reports (Van den Eijnden, D. H., Joziasse, D. H., Dorland, L., Van Halbeek H., Vliegenthart, J. F. G., and Schmid, K. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 92, 839-845), it appears that the enzyme strongly prefers the galactosyl residue at the Man alpha 1----3Man branch of the biantennary glycopeptide for attachment of the first sialic acid residue. This branch specificity is fully preserved with the structure (formula; see text) Reduction of the reducing N-acetylglucosaminyl residue in this structure, however, leads to a decreased branch specificity, whereas removal of this residue results in a random attachment of sialic acid to the galactoses at both branches. The decrease in branch specificity is accompanied by a reduction in the rate of sialic acid transfer to the galactose at the alpha 1----3 branch. Our results indicate that the presence of the aforementioned N-acetylglucosaminyl residue is a minimal structural requirement for branch specificity of the sialyltransferase. We propose that in the interaction of the sialyltransferase with its substrates, this N-acetylglucosaminyl residue functions as a recognition site mediating the correct positioning of the substrate on the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1506671456,"The 19-kDa glycoprotein (gp 19K) coded by early region E3 of adenovirus is of interest as a model for glycoprotein processing and sorting, as well as for the interaction between viral antigens and class I transplantation antigens. In this paper, we show that gp 19K is a major protein synthesized during early stages of infection of human KB cells. We report the purification of gp 19K to near homogeneity, the preparation of a gp 19K antiserum, and structural analyses on the protein. We have determined the DNA sequence of the gp 19K gene in adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) for comparison with the published sequence (Herisse, J., Courtois, G., and Galibert, F. (1980) Nucleic Acids Res. 8, 2173-2192) of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2). Fragments produced by cyanogen bromide cleavage of Ad2 gp 19K are in accord with the DNA sequence, as are synthetic peptide antibodies targeted to the NH2 terminus of Ad2 gp 19K and the COOH terminus of Ad5 gp 19K. The Ad2 and Ad5 proteins are quite homologous. Conserved features include an NH2-terminal signal sequence, two potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites, and a 20-residue putative transmembrane hydrophobic domain followed by a 15-residue polar domain at the COOH terminus. We show that cleavage of the signal peptide occurs between the 17th and 18th amino acids on both the Ad2 and Ad5 versions of gp 19K and that both potential sites are glycosylated with exclusively high-mannose (as opposed to complex) oligosaccharides. Secondary structure predictions suggest six alpha-helix regions including the signal peptide and transmembrane domain, two or three beta-sheet regions, and about eight beta-turns including the two glycosylation sites and the regions flanking the transmembrane domain."

W., and Nunn, W. D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3735-3742). Mutants defective in the fadL gene lack a 33,000-dalton inner membrane protein as evaluated using two-dimensional pI/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Ginsburgh, C. L., Black, P. N., and Nunn, W. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8437-8443). In an effort to determine whether the fadL gene is the structural gene for this 33,000-dalton protein, we have cloned, mapped, and analyzed the expression of the fadL gene. The fadL gene has been localized on a 2.8-kilobase EcoRV fragment of E. coli genomic DNA. Plasmids containing this gene (i) complement all fadL mutants, (ii) increase the long-chain fatty acid transport activity of fadL strains harboring them by 2- to 3-fold, and (iii) direct the synthesis of a membrane protein which has the same molecular weight and isoelectric point as that described by Ginsburgh et al. This is a heat-modifiable protein which has an apparent molecular weight of 43,000 daltons when solubilized at 100 degrees C in the presence of SDS and 33,000 daltons when solubilized at 50 degrees C in the presence of SDS."
https://openalex.org/W1524360955,"BRL-3A rat liver cells synthesize mature 7484-dalton rat insulin-like growth factor II (rIGF-II) as a approximately 22-kDa precursor, presumably prepro-rIGF-II. In the present study, we have biosynthetically labeled intact BRL-3A cells with [35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitated cell lysates and media with antisera to rIGF-II. A approximately 20-kDa protein was identified in immunoprecipitates of cell lysates having properties consistent with pro-rIGF-II. The approximately 20-kDa protein is precipitated by immune sera but not by nonimmune serum. Its immunoprecipitation is specifically inhibited by unlabeled rIGF-II but not by insulin. It is not precipitated from labeled lysates of a subclone of BRL-3A cells (BRL-3A2) that does not synthesize rIGF-II. The approximately 20-kDa protein is rapidly labeled intracellularly (10 min) but is not detected in BRL-3A media. In pulse-chase experiments, radioactivity in the approximately 20-kDa protein disappears during the chase and appears, at later times, in specifically immunoprecipitated approximately 19-, approximately 10-, approximately 8-, and approximately 7-kDa proteins in media and, to a limited extent, intracellularly. A protein with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the approximately 20-kDa protein observed in cell lysates is immunoprecipitated from 35S-proteins whose synthesis is directed by BRL-3A RNA in a reticulocyte lysate cell-free translation system supplemented with microsomal membranes, and presumably arises by cotranslational removal of the signal peptide from approximately 22-kDa prepro-rIGF-II. Processing of the approximately 20-kDa protein in intact BRL-3A cells to intermediate and mature rIGF-II species appears to occur at the time of secretion and/or shortly thereafter, with the different forms appearing at approximately the same time."
https://openalex.org/W1588161030,"31P NMR signals from substrates and products of alkaline phosphatase have been adapted to measure the rates and product ratios for the hydrolysis and phosphotransferase reactions from pH 6 to 10. Below pH 8, glycerol is a poorer acceptor than H2O (glycerol phosphates:Pi = 0.5). Tris is a more effective acceptor below pH 8, showing a maximum acceptor efficiency at pH 8 (Tris phosphate:Pi = 2). Phosphotransferase efficiencies are in the order expected for the pKaS of the alcohol groups, Tris less than glycerol Cl, C3 less than glycerol C2. Tris and glycerol induce chemical shifts in 113Cd(II) present at the A site but not the B or C sites of the metal triad present at each active center of Cd(II)6 alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that the alcoxides of the acceptors coordinate the A site metal and become the nucleophiles attacking the phosphoseryl residue (E-P) in the second step of the mechanism. The interaction is through the oxygen of Tris. The transferase activity of the amino alcohol shows a bell-shaped pH dependency. Aliphatic alcohol acceptors show small increases in acceptor activity between pH 6 and 8, with 5-fold increases from pH 8 to 10 (at pH 10, glycerol phosphates:Pi = 2.5). 31P NMR inversion transfer has been used to measure the koff for Pi dissociation from the noncovalent enzyme complex (E . P). For the Zn(II)4 alkaline phosphatase koff is essentially pH independent at approximately 35 s-1. For Cd(II) or Mg(II) at the B site in place of Zn(II), koff less than or equal to 1 s-1 X Cl-ion, which appears to coordinate the A site metal ion, enhances koff, suggesting that both Cl- and HPO2-4 can coordinate the A site metal ion in a 5-coordinate intermediate. pH control of the alkaline phosphatase mechanism appears to reside in the stability of E-P and not the dissociation of E . P, compatible with the hypothesis that the activity-linked pKa is that of a H2O molecule coordinated to the A site metal, which in the hydroxide form becomes the nucleophile attacking the phosphoseryl group (E-P)."
https://openalex.org/W1584865457,"A bovine aortic endothelial cell (EC) line released prostacyclin (greater than 1 pmol/10(+5) EC cells) when incubated with fMet-Leu-Phe (FMLP)-stimulated rat and human neutrophils (PMNs). This prostaglandin (PG) I2 was shown to come from the ECs and not from the PMNs by radioactive, high-performance liquid chromatography, and immunochemical criteria. Both FMLP-stimulated rat peritoneal and human peripheral PMNs as well as their stimulated cell-free supernatants and unstimulated sonicates could elicit the release of PGI2 from ECs. Since phorbol myristate acetate stimulated PMN adherence but elicited little PGI2 release from ECs, the PGI2 stimulation in ECs is unrelated to PMN adhesion. The addition of catalase and superoxide dismutase to FMLP-stimulated PMNs enhanced rather than reduced PGI2 formation, indicating that activated oxygen products of the PMN are not responsible for the induction of PGI2. Incubation of ECs with leukotriene (LT) B4, LTC4, or LTD4 did not trigger PGI2 release nor did aspirin pretreatment of the PMNs reduce the PGI2 induction. These data suggest that arachidonic acid metabolites of the PMNs were not responsible for the PGI2 induction. Available data indicates that the PMN factor that stimulates PGI2 from ECs is either released concomitantly with the azurophilic granules or is closely related to this event."

The interferon treatment did not inhibit, but slightly enhanced, the accumulation of the following three PDGF-induced RNAs: myc RNA, JE RNA, and KC RNA. The treatment with interferon changed the pattern of secreted proteins from quiescent cells and from cells treated with partially purified PDGF; it inhibited the accumulation of the PDGF-induced proteins (including proteins of 63 and 32 kDa) and it induced the accumulation of several other proteins (including proteins of 89, 31.5, 30, and 10.5 kDa) in both quiescent and also in PDGF-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1552082201,In this paper we describe the partial proteolytic digestion of recA proteins from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis and the production and isolation of truncated recA polypeptides. A proteolytic fragment of the P. mirabilis recA protein bound single-strand DNA and ATP normally but has altered duplex DNA binding properties. This protein was shown to initiate but not complete DNA strand transfer from a DNA duplex to a complementary single strand. The product of the E. coli recA1 allele bound but could not hydrolyze ATP and the protein bound single-strand but not double-strand DNA. This protein did not appear to initiate the transfer of a strand from a linear duplex to a single-strand circle and inhibited the wild-type recA protein from performing strand transfer. We report that recA protein binds linear duplex DNA in a manner that enhances the rate of ligation by T4 DNA ligase. When heterologous single-strand DNA was added in addition to the duplex DNA large stable aggregates of protein and DNA were formed that could easily be sedimented from solution.
https://openalex.org/W1516952587,"Abstract Two previously described chromosomal mutant alleles, alaS4 and alaS5, of Escherichia coli Ala-tRNA synthetase have been analyzed. Each causes a sharp diminution in aminoacylation activity and disrupts the alpha 4 tetramer structure of identical chains of 875 amino acids; neither mutation significantly disturbs the activity for synthesis of alanyladenylate. The location of each mutation within the structural gene has been mapped by marker rescue with specific gene fragments. Each mutant allele was cloned from the genome by reciprocal recombination with a multicopy plasmid that contains segments of alaS which flank the respective mutations. Further analysis established: 1) a single G----A transition results in a Gly----Asp change for each mutant allele at codon 674 (alaS4) and at codon 677 (alaS5). 2) The mutations are in the oligomerization domain, about 200 amino acids beyond the C-terminal side of the catalytic domain that previously was mapped by deletion analysis; the mutations are, thus, in a part of the polypeptide which is dispensable for catalytic activity. 3) For both mutant enzymes, there is little effect of the mutation on the Km for tRNAAla; kcat for aminoacylation is decreased by an order of magnitude. These point mutations reveal a subtle integration of the catalytic core with parts of the polypeptide that are not essential for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1593211114,"Synthesis and properties of the bacterial precursor of beta-lactamase (E.C.3.5.2.6) were studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants. A protease-deficient yeast mutant was transformed with the plasmid pADH040-2 conferring high expression of the bla gene. Besides precisely processed beta-lactamase, transformed yeast cells contained mainly bla precursor up to the amount of 2% of total cellular protein. The precursor was shown to be synthesized on free polysomes in vivo but could be processed with rough microsomal membranes in a cell-free translation system. By applying an isolation procedure using high-salt conditions, the labile precursor could be separated in a native form from the mature beta-lactamase. Thereby it could be shown that the pre-beta-lactamase had virtually no enzymatic activity in contrast to the mature enzyme, which was indistinguishable from bacterial beta-lactamase. Furthermore, the precursor was highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation by trypsin under conditions which did not affect the mature enzyme. Accordingly, the protein conformation of the precursor must be substantially different from that of the authentic beta-lactamase, demonstrating that specific processing and transport of beta-lactamase is associated with directing the protein to a distinct conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1486158936,"The unambiguous measurement of intracellular sodium ion [Na+]i by the noninvasive NMR technique offers a new opportunity to monitor precisely the maintenance and fluctuations of [Na+]i levels in intact cells and tissues. The anionic frequency shift reagent, dysprosium (III) tripolyphosphate, which does not permeate intact cells, when added to suspensions of intact adult rat cardiac myocytes, alters the NMR frequency of extracellular sodium ions, [Na+]o, leaving that of intracellular ions, [Na+]i, unaffected. Using 23Na NMR in conjunction with this shift reagent, we have determined NMR-visible intracellular Na+ ion concentration in a suspension of isolated cardiac myocytes under standard conditions with insulin and Ca2+ in the extracellular medium to be 8.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/liter of cells (n = 4). This value is comparable to that measured by intracellular ion-selective microelectrodes in heart tissue. Cardiac myocytes incubated for several hours in insulin-deficient, Ca2+-containing medium prior to NMR measurement exhibited a somewhat lower [Na+]i value of 6.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/liter of cells (n = 3). Reversible Na+ loading of the cells by manipulation of extracellular calcium levels is readily measured by the NMR technique. Incubation of myocytes in a Ca2+-free, insulin-containing medium causes a 3-fold increase in [Na+]i to a level of 22.8 +/- 2.6 mmol/liter of cells (n = 10). In contrast to cells with insulin, insulin-deficient myocytes exhibit a markedly lower level of [Na+]i of only 14.6 +/- 2.0 mmol/liter of cells (n = 4) in Ca2+-free medium. These observations suggest that insulin may stimulate a pathway for Na+ influx in heart cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539740676,"We have previously partially purified, characterized, and chromosomally mapped a human isozyme of alpha-glucosidase which is active at neutral pH. This isozyme appears as a doublet of enzyme activity on native gel electrophoresis and was termed neutral alpha-glucosidase AB. We now report genetic and biochemical evidence that neutral alpha-glucosidase AB is synonymous with the glycoprotein processing enzyme glucosidase II. We have found that a mutant mouse lymphoma line which is deficient in glucosidase II is also deficient in neutral alpha-glucosidase AB, as defined electrophoretically and quantitatively (less than 0.5% of parental). In contrast, both mutant and parental cell lines exhibited several lysosomal hydrolases which are processed by glucosidase II. We have also further purified the human neutral alpha-glucosidase A component of neutral alpha-glucosidase AB 740-fold from placenta in order to compare its biochemical properties with those described for rat liver and pig kidney glucosidase II. Both glucosidase II and neutral alpha-glucosidase AB are high-molecular mass (greater than 200,000 dalton) anionic glycoproteins which bind to concanavalin A, have a broad pH optima (5.5-8.5), and have a similar Km for maltose (4.8 versus 2.1 mM) and the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (35 versus 19 microM). Similar to human neutral alpha-glucosidase AB, purified rat glucosidase II migrates as a doublet of enzyme activity on native gel electrophoresis. Although rat glucosidase II has been reported to have a subunit size of 67 kDa, pig glucosidase II has been found to have a subunit size of 100 kDa, like the 98-kDa major protein in purified human neutral alpha-glucosidase A. Although we have not demonstrated that neutral alpha-glucosidase AB is microsomal nor that it hydrolyzes the natural substrate of glucosidase II, we believe that the genetic evidence is compelling for and the biochemical data consistent with the hypothesis that neutral alpha-glucosidase AB and glucosidase II are synonymous. These and previous results would localize glucosidase II to the long arm of human chromosome II."
https://openalex.org/W1597599526,"We have covalently modified the recA protein from Escherichia coli with the photoaffinity ATP analog 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP (N3-ATP). Covalent attachment of N3-ATP to recA protein is dependent on native protein conformation and is shown to be specific for the site of ATP hydrolysis by the following criteria. (i) Binding of the probe to recA protein is inhibited by ATP and competitive inhibitors of its ATP hydrolytic activity, e.g. adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), ADP, and UTP, but not by adenosine; (ii) N3-ATP is efficiently hydrolyzed by recA protein in the presence of single-stranded DNA; (iii) labeling of recA protein occurs at a single site as judged by two-dimensional thin-layer peptide mapping and high-performance liquid chromatography peptide separation. We have purified and identified a tryptic fragment, spanning amino acid residues 257-280, which contains the primary site of attachment of N3-ATP. This peptide is likely to be contained within the ATP hydrolytic site of recA protein."

The membrane form of chromogranin can be purified on a C-18 semi-preparative column using high pressure liquid chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W1514218000,"The possibility that the insulin receptor of adipocytes undergoes cycling was examined by a method involving pronase digestion at 12 degrees C, followed by insulin binding studies to determine receptor location and quantity. In the absence of insulin treatment, the amount of internal receptors (i.e. protected from pronase) was 10% of total receptor content. Following a 30-min insulin treatment (0.1 microM) at 37 degrees C, the internal receptor content increased 2-fold (206 +/- 12% of control, 100%). This effect was rapid, and maximum internalization was approached by 5 min of insulin treatment. Warming pronase-digested cells to 37 degrees C allowed the internal receptors to move to the cell surface. This movement was rapid also, and expansion of the internal pool by insulin pretreatment provided a 2.4-fold increase in the reinsertion of cell-surface receptors (238 +/- 28% of nontreated cells, 100%). Insulin-pretreated and nontreated cells had approximately 13 and 6%, respectively, of their original cell-surface receptor content, i.e. their content before pronase digestion. These receptors appeared intact after the cycling process, as judged by affinity labeling and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the receptor and its binding subunit. The ability of the recycled receptor to respond to insulin was examined by studies of glucose incorporation into lipids and the inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. Cells pretreated with insulin and allowed to recycle (e.g. 13% of normal receptor content) were 2-3-fold more responsive and 7-fold more sensitive to subsequent insulin stimulation than nontreated cells (e.g. 6% of normal receptor content), indicating that the recycled receptors are biologically active and coupled to cellular effector systems."
https://openalex.org/W1931011576,"C1-THF (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate) synthase is a trifunctional protein catalyzing the sequential reactions specified by the enzymes 10-formyl-THF synthetase (EC 6.3.4.3), 5,10-methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9), and 5,10-methylene-THF dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5). These three activities supply the activated one-carbon units required for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidylate, the amino acids histidine and methionine, the vitamin pantothenic acid, and the formyl group of mitochondrial fMet-tRNAfMet. Extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae whose growth is dependent on the three activities of C1-THF synthase contain 2-3 times the level of enzyme activity of extracts from cells grown under conditions where they are independent of this enzyme. Repression of C1-THF synthase activity requires the simultaneous presence of adenine, histidine, methionine, and pantothenic acid. Starvation of the cells for any one of these nutrients leads to derepression of the enzyme. Drug-induced folate starvation also leads to derepression of enzyme activity. The response to changing nutritional conditions occurs within 1 h and is due to changes in the steady-state concentration of C1-THF synthase enzyme, rather than to activation or deactivation of a pre-existing pool of enzyme. Determination of the amount of C1-THF synthase mRNA under the various growth conditions by an in vitro translation/immunoprecipitation assay indicates that regulation of the enzyme occurs predominantly at a pretranslational level since steady-state levels of C1-THF synthase mRNA are 2-3-fold higher in derepressed cells than in repressed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1505276740,"The complete amino acid sequence of a DNA-binding domain isolated from human plasma fibronectin after limited trypsin digestion has been obtained. It contains 132 amino acids and one biantennary glycosyl unit at residue 104, for an estimated Mr of 16,931. The fragment can be purified by a two-step procedure consisting of DNA-affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. It can also be purified by heparin-affinity chromatography. The domain is unusual in its susceptibility to tryptic-like cleavages even by neutral or aromatic residue-specific proteases. It has no cysteine residues and is predicted to favor a beta-sheet structure by Chou and Fasman analysis. Based on this analysis we have proposed a model which exhibits a clustering of aromatic and basic residues, consistent with similar involvement of basic and aromatic residues in other DNA-binding proteins. The net charge of the domain at neutral pH (+1, without sialic acid) argues against a nonspecific charge interaction with polyanionic macromolecules such as DNA and heparin. Internal sequence repeats occur at intervals of 30, 60, and 90 residues, thus suggesting a maximum size for a repetitive building block which gave rise to this domain."

https://openalex.org/W1533604371,Abstract The [alpha-32P]3'-azido-3'-deoxyxylofuranosyl analogues of 5'-ATP and 5'-GTP were used as photoaffinity probes to derivatize two distinctly different active sites of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase obtained from Escherichia coli. The sites derivatized by these probes are both located on the beta subunit. Radioactive 32P containing cyanogen bromide peptides produced from the derivatized beta subunits were observed to give either one of two distinct patterns by high pressure liquid chromatography or TLC analysis. These sites are used alternately for the synthesis of successive phosphodiester bonds. These results support our rotational translocation model for transcription.
https://openalex.org/W1489568067,"The structure of the lipid-containing bacteriophage PR4 was studied using two alkyl imidates, ethyl acetimidate (EAI), a reagent permeant to lipid bilayers and isethionyl acetimidate (IAI), which is impermeant to membranes. The virion is an icosahedral particle consisting of a protein coat surrounding a membrane of phospholipid and protein which in turn encloses the DNA genome. Upon exposure to the permeant reagent, EAI, 50% of the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules reacted rapidly (half-life less than 10 min). A similar fraction of the PE also reacted with IAI, the impermeant reagent. The remaining half of the PE molecules reacted slowly with EAI (half-life of 80 min) and failed to react with IAI. All of the phage proteins reacted with both EAI and IAI (except a DNA-associated protein which reacted only with EAI). These labeling results indicate that the phage membrane consists of a lipid bilayer and that at least a portion of each phage protein (except the DNA-associated protein) is exposed on the external face of the lipid bilayer. Several of the membrane proteins could be cross-linked either to the phage membrane PE after EAI treatment or to phage phosphatidylglycerol after periodate treatment. The major structural protein of the phage was readily cross-linked to PG but failed to cross-link to PE suggesting that the protein specifically interacts with PG."
https://openalex.org/W1502341423,"D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is a lipid-requiring enzyme which is localized on the inner face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The apodehydrogenase, i.e. the purified enzyme devoid of lipid, has been purified from beef heart mitochondria and as such is inactive. It can be reactivated by insertion into phospholipid vesicles containing lecithin. Proteolytic digestion with different proteases has been carried out to obtain insight into the orientation of the enzyme in the membrane and to assess the extent of immersion of the protein into the phospholipid bilayer. Digestion of the apodehydrogenase with either trypsin, chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus protease, thermolysin, carboxypeptidases A and Y, or Pronase (from Streptomyces griseus) leads to loss of activity, as assayed with phospholipid. Limited digestion with carboxypeptidase results in complete inactivation. Of the proteases tested, only Pronase and chymotrypsin cleave and inactivate the enzyme inserted into phospholipid vesicles (enzyme-phospholipid complex). For the enzyme-phospholipid complex, the loss of activity with Pronase digestion follows a single exponential decay to less than 10% of the initial activity. With chymotrypsin digestion, the staining intensity of the original approximately 31,500-dalton polypeptide decreases more rapidly than the loss of enzymic activity. The enzyme-phospholipid complex, after limited cleavage with chymotrypsin, retains enzymic activity and resonance energy transfer from protein to bound NADH and an approximately 26,000-dalton polypeptide is observed. Phospholipid alters the cleavage pattern with both chymotrypsin and Pronase, and the rate of inactivation of the enzyme-phospholipid complex is slowed in the presence of NAD(H). Moreover, the rate of inactivation of the apodehydrogenase with chymotrypsin is diminished approximately 3-fold in the presence of NAD+. Digestion of submitochondrial vesicles with either trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Pronase rapidly inactivates D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; the addition of NAD+ or NADH, together with dithiothreitol and increased salt (to 50 mM), decreases the rate of inactivation, and with trypsin, virtually eliminates inactivation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1521397222,"In previous studies, we have identified possible biosynthetic precursors of rat insulin-like growth factor II (rIGF-II) using specific immunoprecipitation, approximately 22-kDa prepro-rIGF-II and 20-kDa pro-rIGF-II. We now provide chemical evidence that amino acid sequences corresponding to mature 7484-dalton rIGF-II are present at the NH2 terminus of the putative approximately 20-kDa pro-rIGF-II. BRL-3A cultures have been labeled individually with several radioactive amino acid precursors, the cells have been lysed, and the lysates have been immunoprecipitated with antiserum to rIGF-II. Following electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated proteins, labeled approximately 20-kDa pro-rIGF-II was eluted from the gels and subjected to automated radiosequence analysis. Discrete peaks of radioactivity were observed in 12 of the first 30 cycles of Edman degradation. The deduced partial amino acid sequence was identical at each position with that of mature 7484-dalton rIGF-II. These results directly demonstrate that mature rIGF-II sequences are present in the approximately 20-kDa protein, as required if the approximately 20-kDa protein were pro-rIGF-II. In addition, they localize the 7484-dalton rIGF-II to the NH2 terminus of the precursor molecule. A second NH2-terminal sequence differing only in the absence of the NH2-terminal residue, alanine, also was present in an approximately equal amount. Similar NH2-terminal heterogeneity has been reported for 7484-dalton rIGF-II and most likely reflects ambiguity in the cleavage sites for the signal peptidase."

https://openalex.org/W1546921245,"Dihydrofolate reductases from different species contain several highly conserved arginines, some of which have been shown by x-ray crystallography to have their guanido groups near the p-aminobenzoyl glutamate moiety of enzyme-bound methotrexate. The orientation of one of these (Arg-52) appears to be completely reversed in comparing the crystal structures of Escherichia coli with Lactobacillus casei enzyme (Bolin, J. T., Filman, D. J., Matthews, D. A., Hamlin, R. C., and Kraut, J. (1982). J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13650-13662). We synthesized a novel antifolate containing a glyoxal group designed to react specifically with active-site guanido groups which are able to approach the p-aminobenzoyl carbonyl of methotrexate. The binding of this compound to the enzyme was competitive with dihydrofolate (DHF) in ordinary buffers. In borate buffer at pH 8.0 it inactivated dihydrofolate reductases from both E. coli and L. casei at similar maximum rates, while the chicken liver enzyme was more slowly inactivated. The inactivation was stoichiometric, paralleled the loss of the glyoxal chromophore, and showed saturation kinetics. Inhibitor binding and thus inactivation was enhanced by NADPH, while DHF protected the enzyme. This allowed calculation of the Kd for DHF which was found to be identical with its Km. The stoichiometrically inactivated enzyme displayed the 340-nm chromophore characteristic of 4-aminopteridines bound to dihydrofolate reductase confirming active-site labeling with normal orientation of the ligand. The ligand remained covalently bound to inactivated enzyme upon denaturation at low pH but dissociated at neutral pH. Computer graphic modeling of the crystal structures predicted reaction of Arg-31 but not Arg-52 in L. casei dihydrofolate reductase and of only Arg-52 in the E. coli enzyme. Purification of the CNBr fragments from the inactivated enzymes gave a single labeled peptide for each species. The particular peptide tagged in each case was unaffected by the presence of NADPH and was in excellent agreement with the crystallographic predictions."

By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autofluorography, two retinal-binding polypeptides are observed to band near the known molecular weight of the halorhodopsin chromophoric polypeptide (25,000). Synthesis of one of these polypeptides is controlled by retinal and is sufficient for generation of complete halorhodopsin function. The other is constitutively produced by the cells and differs chemically from the haloopsin protein as indicated by differences in their V8 protease digestion patterns. V8 protease cleavage of haloopsin in its native membrane is compared with that of the protein in denaturing and nondenaturing detergents. Protease cleavage sites available in the denatured haloopsin molecule are hidden in its native membrane-integrated conformation and in nondenaturing detergent micelles. Treatment with a variety of proteases indicates susceptibility of a short terminal region of the haloopsin chain in its native conformation."

Upon addition of increasing yet largely substoichiometric amounts of deuterated 30 S ribosomal subunits, selective line broadenings and some chemical shift changes were observed. These effects can be fully reversed by increasing the temperature and/or the ionic strength. The selective line broadenings, which are explained by a medium-fast to fast exchange dynamics between free and bound IF-3 with loss of internal mobility of the protons, shed light on the amino acid residues of IF-3 involved in or affected by the binding to the 30 S subunits. Some effects (i.e. implication of 1 tyrosine, 1 phenylalanine, and some arginine and lysine residues) are seen with both 30 S subunits and rRNA while others (i.e. implication of a second tyrosine or phenylalanine residue of a group of hydrophobic residues and, possibly, of the single histidine residue), seen only or preferentially with 30 S subunits, may reflect additional interactions exclusively occurring at the ribosomal level."
