https://openalex.org/W2005473394,"Resistance to the spore-crystal protein complex of Bacillus thuringiensis, the most widely used and intensively studied microbial insecticide, has been presumed to be unlikely to occur. In this study it was found that Plodia interpunctella, a major lepidopteran pest of stored grain products, can develop resistance to the insecticide within a few generations. Resistance increased nearly 30-fold in two generations in a strain reared on diet treated with Bacillus thuringiensis and after 15 generations reached a plateau 100 times higher than the control level. Resistance was stable when selection was discontinued. The resistance was inherited as a recessive trait. Plodia interpunctella strains collected from treated grain bins were more resistant than strains from untreated bins, indicating that the resistance can develop quickly in the field."

https://openalex.org/W2065022014,X-ray studies of mica specimens from a variety of geological localities show that biotite and certain lithium-rich mica samples are composed of a mixture of different polytypes. Many of the biotite structures are new complex polytypes not before reported. A new method of designating mica polytypes is proposed. Techniques are described for the systematic generation of all the possible layer-stacking sequences of mica polytypes and for the verification of the stacking sequences in newly discovered forms.
https://openalex.org/W2027464604,"A ""bloom"" of near-surface phytoplankton occurs in the Atlantic Slope region of the western Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. East Coast in the spring. Satellite time series of sea-surface temperature and phytoplankton pigment concentration, derived from measurements of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA-7 Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Nimbus-7 Coastal Zone Color Scanner, respectively, give information on the spatial extent and temporal development of such a bloom for a 28-day period in April through May 1982. The phytoplankton concentration of the slope area is comparable to that of the Atlantic Shelf. Total primary productivity of the slope during this period is equivalent to that of the shelf. The primary productivity within a warm-core ring and in the Gulf Stream system is less by a factor of 2."
https://openalex.org/W2049996112,"Spectra of near-Earth asteroids were compared to spectra of selected asteroids, planets, and satellites to determine possible source regions. The diversity of reflectance spectra of the near-Earth asteroids implies different mineralogical compositions and hence more than one source region. The presence of near-Earth asteroid spectral signatures similar to those of certain main-belt asteroids supports models that derive some of these asteroids from the 5:2 Kirkwood gap and the Flora family by gravitational perturbations. Planetary and satellite surfaces are different in composition than the near-Earth asteroids, which is in agreement with theoretical arguments that such bodies should not be sources. Some near-Earth asteroids supply portions of Earth's meteorite flux, but other sources must also contribute."

Rejection of salt can be increased by increase in the pH of the solution or by addition of Th(IV). The filtration seems to accord with a mechanism of salt exclusion characteristic of ion exchangers.
https://openalex.org/W1997162405,"The Very Long Baseline Array is a high-resolution synthesis radio telescope consisting of ten antennas, each 25 meters in diameter, located throughout the United States from Puerto Rico to Hawaii. Each antenna will be equipped with low-noise receivers spaced throughout the frequency range from 330 megahertz to 43 gigahertz, a hydrogen-maser frequency standard for time and frequency reference, and broadband digital tape recorders. Tapes recorded at each antenna will be simultaneously replayed and correlated in a specially built digital correlator, and the correlator output will, by Fourier transformation, be used to construct images of celestial radio sources with an angular resolution better than one thousandth of an arc second."
https://openalex.org/W2065818060,"Phenylketonuria was induced in hooded rats by the conventional procedure of feeding excessive quantities of L-phenylalanine after weaning. Although this procedure reliably induced large, dose-dependent deficits in performance on a water maze, the behavioral deficits were completely eliminated after cessation of phenylalanine loading. These results cast doubt on the assumption that this animal preparation adequately simulates the irreversible intellectual impairments found in the child with late-detected phenylketonuria."
https://openalex.org/W1989757324,Slow drying stimulated the artificial development of fruiting structures by Cladonia cristatella Tuck. Fructification of the fungal partner occurred in the absence of its algal symbiont. Only newly isolated mycobionts produced the reproductive structures. Soredia and squamules were formed in response to the joint effect of slow drying and nutrient-poor conditions.
https://openalex.org/W2029664263,"The rate of decomposition of threonine in 0.01M aqueous solution is unaffected by an equimolar concentration of pyrocatechol, but is increased by the addition of an extracellular polyphenolic material (3 mg/ml) produced by Fucus vesiculosus. Glycine, a pyrolytic product of threonine, behaves similarly."

Concentrations of tin, lead, and antimony are nearly always less than in coins minted before 29 B.C. or after 54 A.D. Older coins were not melted to make copper coins of the early empire."

India has benefited in many fields from international collaboration during the last 30 years, but the country's leaders have also placed particularly strong emphasis on self-reliance."
