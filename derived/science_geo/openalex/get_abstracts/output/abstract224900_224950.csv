https://openalex.org/W2052895805,"THE frequency above which air-borne sound becomes inaudible is generally considered to be about 20 kc./s. All sensitivity determinations agree that the threshold rises very steeply above 12 kc./s.; and above 12 kc./s. there are indications that frequency discrimination begins to fail, that is, that the least discriminable increment of frequency measured as a fraction of an octave begins to rise sharply. It seems to have been tacitly assumed that the human cochlea is incapable of response to frequencies above 20 kc./s., and that the upper limit for air-borne and bone-conducted sound is the same."

https://openalex.org/W2079288935,"THE separation of several non-volatile carboxylic acids by paper chromatography has been described by Lugg and Overell1,2. These workers found that it was impossible to carry out the separation with neutral solvents because the ionization of the acids caused the spots to ‘tail’. They overcame the difficulty by swamping both the stationary and mobile phases with formic or acetic acid. Removal of the swamping acid was then a necessary and sometimes tedious operation before the non-volatile acids could be revealed by spraying with an acid-base indicator."

It is, however, already known1,2 that the isotopes 147, 149 and 143 have half-lives of about four years, 47 hr. and 350 days respectively. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether the unknown promethium-145 is radioactive."

https://openalex.org/W2047853419,"As part of a research programme on non-enzymatic browning of foods, browned solutions were prepared by refluxing all the combinations of glycine and D-glucose at 0.1 M and 1.0 M concentrations, for periods up to 100 hr. At various time intervals samples of these solutions were removed, applied as thin lines across sheets of Whatman No. 1 filter paper and chromatographed by the ascending method in 77 per cent ethanol. The brown pigments (melan-oidins) did not move. After air drying, examination of the chromatograms under ultra-violet light in the 3650 A. region revealed as many as ten fluorescent bands, ranging in RF from 0.07 to 0.91. None of these coincided with glycine or glucose, which did not fluoresce but were detected on the paper by chemical means."

https://openalex.org/W2030232967,"DURING the course of a protein fractionation, it was desired to establish the identity and purity of micro-quantities of proteins. The method described by Cremer and Tiselius1 was investigated with the view of adapting it to the determination of the mobilities and the isoelectric point of proteins as criteria of their purity."
https://openalex.org/W2014552094,"FAST neutrons can be detected by scintillation counters, using organic phosphors such as anthracene, by the proton recoils which they cause1–3. It is usually necessary, however, to detect the neutrons against a background of γ-rays, to which such counters are very sensitive. It is not in general possible to distinguish between neutrons and γ-rays by the use of a voltage discriminator after amplification, because organic phosphors give larger pulses from electrons than from protons of the same energy4,5."
https://openalex.org/W2018027674,"IN a recent communication in Nature1, Alexander and Earland have described experiments in which wool keratin has been rendered soluble in dilute ammonia by pretreatment with peracetic acid. In these experiments they obtained an insoluble sheath-like residue, presumably the remains of the cuticle, amounting to some 10 per cent of the original fibre weight, and found, in collaboration with Happey2, that this material gave a β-type X-ray photograph."

https://openalex.org/W1997778148,"IT has been stated by Dorojkin1 that Solanum curtilobum and eight other South American species and varieties of Solanum are immune from Spongospora subterranea, the causal agent of powdery scab of potatoes; in this paper the number 8008 is linked with S. curtilobum, as are other numbers with the other Solanum species, and these are presumably the reference numbers of individual lines which were being used. Bukasov2 quotes Dorojkin and states that immunity from powdery scab has been established in S. curtilobum and the eight other species and varieties. This statement has been repeated by Hawkes3 and Black4, but in these papers no mention is made of the reference numbers of the individual lines concerned. It might be assumed, therefore, that S. curtilobum as such is immune, despite the fact that many lines or varieties of this species exist. That some of these lines at least do not carry immunity was shown by the following experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1970638165,"THE replacement of the hydrogen of a methine group in a number of conjugated organic compounds by an alkyl radical causes a batho- or hypso-chromic shift in the principal absorption maxima. This effect is particularly noticeable in methyl substitution, and could be explained by the hyperconjugation introduced by the methyl group."

https://openalex.org/W1995901334,"LABOURERS in factories in South Malaya who cut up pineapples by hand for canning invariably show an abnormality of those parts of the body which are exposed to slight pressure and pineapple juice, notably the palmar surfaces of the fingertips and the periphery of the palms. At the beginning of the canning season, the left hand, which comes more into contact with the fruit than the knife-holding hand, becomes sore and small superficial raw areas on the fingertips are often seen. Within several days, however, these heal, and the skin ceases to be sore. The labourers state that this tolerance to the pineapple juice is due to the development of an abnormality of the skin, which in the affected area becomes bluish-white and so smooth that fingerprints may be completely lost. Deep cracks are sometimes seen in the region of the skin creases. These often stay raw and bleeding for a long time, and show no clinical signs of infection, presumably because of removal of dead tissues by enzymatic action."
