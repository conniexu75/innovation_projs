https://openalex.org/W2922021164,"Hooking into antigen transfer Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are anaerobic, spore-forming, clostridia-like organisms that are important immune modulators in the mammalian gut. For some reason, SFB do not provoke inflammatory responses. Ladinsky et al. probed the mechanistic basis of this soothing effect in mice. SFB attach tightly to intestinal epithelial cells via a hook-like structure. Bacterial material is extruded from the hook and enters the host cell by endocytosis. An extruded SFB protein called P3340 is shuttled by the host protein cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42) through the endosomelysosome vesicular pathway to the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelial cell. Here, it prompts an immunomodulatory SFB-specific CD4 T helper 17 cell response, possibly via intestinal macrophages. Science , this issue p. eaat4042"

Materials and methods We studied two independent MRI datasets of 74 lacrymal gland tumors and 30 breast lesions from two different centers. Two pairs of readers performed three two-dimensional delineations for each dataset. Texture features were extracted using two radiomics softwares (Pyradiomics and an in-house software). Reproducible features were selected using a combination of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance and coherence coefficient (CCC) with 0.8 and 0.9 as thresholds, respectively. We tested six absolute and eight relative gray-level discretization methods and analyzed the distribution and highest number of reproducible features obtained for each discretization. We also analyzed the number of reproducible features extracted from computer simulated delineations representative of inter-observer variability. Results The gray-level discretization method had a direct impact on texture feature reproducibility, independent of observers, software or method of delineation (simulated vs. human). The absolute discretization consistently provided statistically significantly more reproducible features than the relative discretization. Varying the bin number of relative discretization led to statistically significantly more variable results than varying the bin size of absolute discretization. Conclusions When considering inter-observer reproducible results of MRI texture radiomics features, an absolute discretization should be favored to allow the extraction of the highest number of potential candidates for new imaging biomarkers. Whichever the chosen method, it should be systematically documented to allow replicability of results."

However, many macroscopic platforms such as pendula evolve on slow time scales, which can limit the observation of states that emerge after many cycles. Matheny et al. fabricated a ring of eight nanoelectromechanical oscillators resonating at ∼2.2 megahertz with quality factors of ∼4000 that could be rapidly controlled and read out. Analysis of these large datasets revealed exotic synchronization states with complex dynamics and broken symmetries. Theoretical modeling showed that emergent higher-order interactions (such as biharmonic and next-nearest neighbor) stabilized complex dynamics, despite the network having weak nearest-neighbor coupling.

https://openalex.org/W2922172644,"The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, a product of triglyceride and fasting glucose, is a reliable marker for insulin resistance (IR). Obesity is also known to be closely related with IR. Recently, the efficiency of TyG-related markers that combine obesity markers with TyG index has been studied; however, earlier studies were limited in number and the results were inconsistent. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the efficiency of several combinations of TyG index and obesity indices, namely, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), in reflecting IR. Data were obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007-2010. A total of 11,149 subjects (4,777 men and 6,372 women) were included. IR was defined as the homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) of above the 75th percentile for each gender. Logistic regression analysis was performed after adjusting for confounding factors, to compare and identify the associations of the 4 parameters (TyG index, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR) with IR. For each parameter, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of quartiles 2-4 were calculated and compared with quartile 1 as a reference. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of each parameter to predict IR. The adjusted ORs of quartile 4 in comparison with quartile 1 (95% CIs) for IR were 7.60 (6.52-8.87) for TyG index, 12.82 (10.89-15.10) for TyG-BMI, 16.29 (13.70-19.38) for TyG-WC, and 14.86 (12.53-17.62) for TyG-WHtR. The areas under the ROC curve for each parameter were 0.690 for TyG index, 0.748 for TyG-BMI, 0.731 for TyG-WC, and 0.733 for TyG-WHtR. In conclusion, TyG-BMI was found to be superior to other parameters for IR prediction. We propose TyG-BMI as an alternative marker for assessing IR in clinical settings."

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target the conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stem of the influenza virus provide hope for the development of universal vaccines and are being evaluated in clinical trials. Van Dongen et al. selected and optimized a small-molecule lead compound that recapitulates key interactions of the bnAb with HA. Like the bnAb, the compound inhibited viral fusion in the endosomes of target cells.

https://openalex.org/W2921911168,"We propose renin angiotensin system (RAS) peptides are critical in wound reparative processes such as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Their role in predicting clinical outcomes in ARDS has been unexplored; thus, we used a targeted metabolomics approach to investigate them as potential predictors of outcomes.Thirty-nine ARDS patients were enrolled within 24 hours of ARDS diagnosis. Plasma RAS peptide levels were quantified at study entry and 24, 48 and 72 hours using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomics assay. RAS peptide concentrations were compared between survivors and non-survivors, and were correlated with clinical and pulmonary measures.Angiotensin I (Ang-I or A(1-10)) levels were significantly higher in non-survivors at study entry and 72 hours. ARDS survival was associated with lower A(1-10) concentration (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.72, p = 0.004) but higher A(1-9) concentration (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.15-4.39, p = 0.018), a biologically active metabolite of A(1-10) and an agonist of angiotensin II receptor type 2. Survivors had significantly higher median A(1-9)/A(1-10) and A(1-7)/A(1-10) ratios than the non-survivors (p = 0.001). Increased A(1-9)/A(1-10) ratio suggests that angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) activity is higher in patients who survived their ARDS insult while an increase in A(1-7)/A(1-10) ratio suggests that ACE activity is also higher in survivors.A(1-10) accumulation and reduced A(1-9) concentration in the non-survivor group suggest that ACE2 activities may be reduced in patients succumbing to ARDS. Plasma levels of both A(1-10) and A(1-9) and their ratio may serve as useful biomarkers for prognosis in ARDS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2921282251,"The particularities of agriculture, as a sector which ensures food supply, result from many factors, including the multilateral interaction between the environment and human activity. The extent of human intervention in the food production process is usually measured with the amount of capital expenditure. Therefore, the food production potential and the resulting food security depend on both natural and economic factors. This paper identifies the current status of food security in different countries around the world, considering both aspects (physical and economic availability) combined together. The variables published by FAO were used together with a variable estimated based on the author's own methodology to identify 8 groups of countries characterized by economic development level, net trade in agricultural products, and selected variables related to agriculture and food situation. As shown by this study, the degree to which food security is ensured with domestic supply varies strongly across the globe. Domestic production provides a foundation for food security in wealthy countries, usually located in areas with favorable conditions for agriculture (including North America, Australia, New Zealand, Kazakhstan) and in countries which, though characterized by a relatively small area of arable land per capita, demonstrate high production intensity (mainly European countries). International trade largely contributes to food security in Middle East and North African countries as well as in selected South American countries which are net importers of food products. The most problematic food situation continues to affect Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2921081488,"Inappropriate and excessive use of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic prophylaxis malpractices are common in obstetrics and gynecology settings and antibiotic stewardship is used to correct such malpractice.To evaluate the impact of antibiotic stewardship interventions on compliance with surgical antibiotic prophylaxis practice in obstetrics and gynecology surgeries.A prospective pre- and post-intervention study was conducted in two tertiary hospitals between May and December 2016. The duration of the each period was 3 months. Antibiotic stewardship interventions including development of a protocol, educational meeting and audit and feedback were implemented. Data were collected using the patient records and analyzed with SPSS version 23.A total of 226 and 238 surgical procedures were included in the pre- and post-intervention periods respectively. Age, length of stay and estimated blood loss were similar between the two groups. However, specialty and surgical procedures varied significantly. There was a significant increase in compliance with timing (from 14.2% to 43.3%) and duration (from 0% to 21.8%) of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis after the interventions. The interventions significantly reduced the prescription of third generation cephalosporin (-8.6%), redundant antibiotic (-19.1%), antibiotic utilization (-3.8 DDD/procedure) and cost of antibiotic prophylaxis (-$4.2/procedure). There was no significant difference in the rate of surgical site infection between the two periods. Post-intervention group (OR: 5.60; 95% CI: 3.31-9.47), elective surgery (OR: 4.62; 95% CI: 2.51-8.47) and hospital attended (OR: 9.89; 95% CI: 5.66-17.26) were significant predictors of compliance with timing while elective surgery (OR: 12.49; 95% CI: 2.85-54.71) and compliance with timing (OR: 58.55; 95% CI: 12.66-270.75) were significantly associated with compliance to duration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.The interventions improve compliance with surgical antibiotic prophylaxis and reduce antibiotic utilization and cost. However, there is opportunity for further improvement, particularly in non-elective surgical procedures."

TAM family receptors stimulate cell proliferation, and the many aspects of the growth signaling pathway downstream of TAM family receptors have been elucidated previously. However, the signaling cascade for TAM receptor–mediated efferocytosis has been elusive. Here we observed that efferocytosis by mouse-resident peritoneal macrophages was blocked by inhibitors against the MERTK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), or STAT6 pathway. Accordingly, apoptotic cells stimulated the phosphorylation of MERTK, ERK, AKT, FAK, and STAT6, but not of IκB or STAT5. A reconstituted efferocytosis system using MERTK- and TIM4-expressing NIH3T3-derived cells revealed that the juxtamembrane and C-terminal regions of MERTK have redundant roles in efferocytosis. The transformation of murine IL-3–dependent Ba/F3 cells (a pro-B cell line) with MERTK and TIM4 enabled them to proliferate in response to apoptotic cells in a PtdSer-dependent manner. This apoptotic cell–induced MERTK-mediated proliferation required both MERTK's juxtamembrane and C-terminal regions and was blocked by inhibitors of not only ERK, AKT, FAK, and STAT6 but also of NF-κB and STAT5 signaling. These results suggest that apoptotic cells stimulate distinct sets of signal transduction pathways via MERTK to induce either efferocytosis or proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2921257516,"We report the identification of citrocin, a 19-amino acid-long antimicrobial lasso peptide from the bacteria Citrobacter pasteurii and Citrobacter braakii. We refactored the citrocin gene cluster and heterologously expressed it in Escherichia coli. We determined citrocin’s NMR structure in water and found that is reminiscent of that of microcin J25 (MccJ25), an RNA polymerase-inhibiting lasso peptide that hijacks the TonB-dependent transporter FhuA to gain entry into cells. Citrocin has moderate antimicrobial activity against E. coli and Citrobacter strains. We then performed an in vitro RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibition assay using citrocin and microcin J25 against E. coli RNAP. Citrocin has a higher minimal inhibition concentration than microcin J25 does against E. coli but surprisingly is ∼100-fold more potent as an RNAP inhibitor. This suggests that citrocin uptake by E. coli is limited. We found that unlike MccJ25, citrocin’s activity against E. coli relied on neither of the two proton motive force-linked systems, Ton and Tol–Pal, for transport across the outer membrane. The structure of citrocin contains a patch of positive charge consisting of Lys-5 and Arg-17. We performed mutagenesis on these residues and found that the R17Y construct was matured into a lasso peptide but no longer had activity, showing the importance of this side chain for antimicrobial activity. In summary, we heterologously expressed and structurally and biochemically characterized an antimicrobial lasso peptide, citrocin. Despite being similar to MccJ25 in sequence, citrocin has an altered activity profile and does not use the same outer-membrane transporter to enter susceptible cells.

The A gene encodes the lasso peptide precursor with an N-terminal leader sequence, whereas the B and C genes encode enzymes required for maturation (Fig. 1A). Lasso peptides that exhibit antimicrobial activity have been found to also contain a D gene that encodes an ABC transporter. This transporter confers host immunity through active efflux of the toxic lasso peptide.

C. pasteurii CIP 55.13 was isolated from a human diarrheal stool sample in Kentucky and deposited into the Collection de l’Institut Pasteur, France, in 1955 (17Clermont D. Motreff L. Passet V. Fernandez J.-C. Bizet C. Brisse S. Multilocus sequence analysis of the genus Citrobacter and description of Citrobacter pasteurii sp. nov.Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2015; 65 (25687346): 1486-149010.1099/ijs.0.000122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We later also identified citrocin’s gene cluster in the recently sequenced Citrobacter braakii type strain ATCC 51113, which was isolated from a snake in France (18Brenner D.J. Grimont P.A. Steigerwalt A.G. Fanning G.R. Ageron E. Riddle C.F. Classification of citrobacteria by DNA hybridization: designation of Citrobacter farmeri sp. nov., Citrobacter youngae sp. nov., Citrobacter braakii sp. nov., Citrobacter werkmanii sp. nov., Citrobacter sedlakii sp. nov., and three unnamed Citrobacter genomospecies.Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43 (8240948): 645-65810.1099/00207713-43-4-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We were able to express citrocin using the native host C. braakii and heterologously in E. coli with a codon-optimized and refactored gene cluster. Purified peptide was used to test thermostability, obtain an aqueous NMR structure, and screen for antimicrobial activity against a panel of Gram-negative bacteria. We show that the Arg-17 side chain is critical for antimicrobial activity of citrocin. We also show that citrocin is a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase in vitro. Finally, we investigated citrocin’s uptake mechanism by generating E. coli variants with resistance and analyzing their genetic changes from the original sensitive strain, revealing the involvement of inner membrane protein SbmA. We confirmed that SbmA is required for uptake using an antimicrobial activity assay against a knockout strain. Surprisingly, the sequencing results and activity assays against outer membrane transporters and Ton/Tol–Pal knockouts indicate that citrocin crosses the outer membrane using a mechanism distinct from that of MccJ25. The citrocin gene cluster was initially identified in C. pasteurii CIP 55.13 using an updated version of our genome mining method (19Maksimov M.O. Pelczer I. Link A.J. Precursor-centric genome-mining approach for lasso peptide discovery.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109 (22949633): 15223-1522810.1073/pnas.1208978109Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).We subsequently confirmed that it can also be identified using a BLAST search with McjB as query. The gene cluster is found on an 18,560-bp contig (CDHL01000044.1). A subsequent run of genome mining also identified the same gene cluster in C. braakii ATCC 51113. Notably, the gene cluster has a very low GC content of 27% compared with the 52% GC content of the C. pasteurii genome and with the 42% GC content of the contig. Although neither the C. pasteurii nor C. braakii genomes are to date fully assembled, the presence of common plasmid-associated genes on this contig suggest that the cluster may be located on a plasmid or a plasmid that has been integrated into the genome. This includes the presence of genes that encode a RepB family plasmid replication initiator protein and two type II toxin–antitoxin pairs (20Unterholzner S.J. Poppenberger B. Rozhon W. Toxin–antitoxin systems: biology, identification, and application.Mobile Genetic Elements. 2013; 3 (24251069)e2621910.4161/mge.26219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). The predicted lasso peptide sequence has significant similarity to that of MccJ25. Fig. 1B shows that the two peptides have ten identical residues and four similar residues. However, there are two major differences: citrocin is shorter and has a net positive charge. Also like MccJ25 and unlike the gene clusters of all other lasso peptides characterized to date, citrocin’s gene cluster has the citA precursor gene transcribed in the opposite direction of the rest of the genes in the cluster (Fig. 1C). Because of the low GC content of the gene cluster, we chose to codon optimize and refactor it before attempting heterologous expression in E. coli. Previously, we had refactored the native MccJ25 gene cluster (without codon optimization) in a similar fashion and found a modest increase in production yield (21Pan S.J. Cheung W.L. Link A.J. Engineered gene clusters for the production of the antimicrobial peptide microcin J25.Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 71 (20035874): 200-20610.1016/j.pep.2009.12.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The precursor gene citA was placed under an isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside–inducible T5 promoter, whereas the citBCD genes were placed under the constitutive promoter for the mcjBCD genes from the MccJ25 gene cluster (Fig. 1D). Citrocin was expressed in E. coli BL21 in M9 medium supplemented with amino acids and purified from the supernatant using HPLC with a yield of 2.7 mg/liter (Fig. 2A). Mass spectrometry confirmed the expected lasso peptide’s monoisotopic mass of 1880 Da (Fig. 2B). C. braakii was grown in M9 medium with and without amino acid supplementation at 30 °C for 2 days. A C8 extract of the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC and LC-MS, confirming the production of citrocin with the same retention time and mass as the peptide heterologously produced in E. coli (Fig. S2). Production level was estimated using HPLC by integrating the peak corresponding to citrocin and comparing it with a standard curve generated using purified citrocin (Fig. S3). C. braakii, when grown in M9 medium with amino acid supplementation, produced 0.7 mg/liter of citrocin. Citrocin was prepared for 2D NMR experiments in 95% H2O/D2O. Fig. S4 shows the TOCSY and NOESY spectra. Simulated annealing of the structures was carried out using CYANA (22Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K.

The top 20 structures were similar to each other (Fig. S5). The top structure is shown in Fig. 3 (A and B). Citrocin has a right-handed lasso structure with the C-terminal end threaded through a macrocyclic ring formed by an isopeptide bond between Gly-1 and Glu-8. The C-terminal tail is sterically locked into place with Arg-17 above the ring and Tyr-18 below the ring. This results in a very short “tail” below the ring, consisting of just Tyr-18 and Gly-19. The only other lasso peptide characterized with such a short tail structure is MccJ25. Three organic solution structures of MccJ25 in methanol or DMSO have been published (27Bayro M.J.

Additionally, a crystal structure of MccJ25 in complex with the outer membrane transporter FhuA is also available in the PDB (code 4CU4) (11Mathavan I. Zirah S. Mehmood S. Choudhury H.G. Goulard C. Li Y. Robinson C.V. Rebuffat S. Beis K. Structural basis for hijacking siderophore receptors by antimicrobial lasso peptides.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 (24705590): 340-34210.1038/nchembio.1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have recently published a crystal structure of MccJ25 bound to E. coli RNAP (code 6N60) (14Braffman N.R. Piscotta F.J. Hauver J. Campbell E.A. Link A.J. Darst S.A. Structural mechanism of transcription inhibition by lasso peptides microcin J25 and capistruin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2019; 116 (30626643): 1273-127810.1073/pnas.1817352116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two solution structures in the PDB show similar ring and tail structures, although the structure of the loop region varies between them and is different from that of MccJ25 in complex with FhuA or RNAP (Fig. S6). This difference is likely due to the flexibility of the loop region while in solution. A comparison of the 1PP5 structure with citrocin’s aqueous structure shows that citrocin has a shorter loop region above the ring (Fig. 3, C and D). The loop region is more similar to MccJ25’s 1PP5 structure than 1Q71 (Fig. S6). Additionally, citrocin has a net positive charge with positively charged Lys-5 and Arg-17 residues and a negatively charged C terminus. Interestingly, the positively charged residues are spatially close together (Fig. S7). The thermostability of citrocin was tested by heating an aqueous solution to 95 °C for 3 h. Part of the sample was then digested with carboxypeptidase. The heat-treated sample before and after digestion was analyzed by HPLC and MALDI. Typically unthreading of the tail, whether partial or complete, causes a retention time shift in the HPLC trace (30Zong C. Wu M.J. Qin J.Z. Link A.J. Lasso peptide benenodin-1 is a thermally actuated [1]rotaxane switch.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017; 139 (28696674): 10403-1040910.1021/jacs.7b04830Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Allen C.D. Chen M.Y. Trick A.Y. Le D.T. Ferguson A.L. Link A.J. Thermal unthreading of the lasso peptides astexin-2 and astexin-3.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 (27588549): 3043-305110.1021/acschembio.6b00588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additionally, unthreading would expose the C-terminal tail allowing carboxypeptidase digestion to occur, which would result in both a retention time change in the HPLC trace, as well as a mass change. HPLC traces and MS data (Fig. S8) show that heat-treated citrocin before and after digestion has the same retention time and mass as unheated citrocin. Hence citrocin is a highly thermostable lasso peptide and able to resist unthreading for 3 h at 95 °C. Purified citrocin dissolved in water was used for spot-on-lawn activity assays. Citrocin was tested against strains of E. coli, Salmonella, Citrobacter, Pseudomonas, and Serratia (Table S1). Inhibition zones were observed against E. coli, Citrobacter, and Salmonella strains. The MICs are reported in Fig. 4. Citrocin had moderate activity against E. coli and Citrobacter strains with MIC values ranging from 16 to 125 μm and some weak activity against Salmonella Newport with a MIC value of 1000 μm. Its strongest activity was against enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 TUV93–0 with an MIC of 16 μm. Interestingly, the EHEC strain was much more sensitive to citrocin than the E. coli lab expression strain BL21, which had a MIC of 100 μm. Also of note, MccJ25 has a much stronger relative activity against Salmonella Newport (40 nm) than against E. coli (1 μm) (32Piscotta F.J. Tharp J.M. Liu W.R. Link A.J. Expanding the chemical diversity of lasso peptide MccJ25 with genetically encoded noncanonical amino acids.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2015; 51 (25407838): 409-41210.1039/C4CC07778DCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the two peptides differ either in uptake, mode of action, or both. Next we tested for in vitro RNA polymerase inhibition using an abortive initiation assay against E. coli RNAP. Citrocin was tested at 1, 10, and 100 μm concentration in triplicate, along with purified MccJ25 for comparison. At 1 μm of citrocin, we observed only 15% of the transcription level compared with the level of the no-inhibitor control (Fig. 5 and Fig. S9). In contrast, 100 μm of MccJ25 was required to achieve the same reduction of transcription (Fig. 5), which is in agreement with previous results (12Mukhopadhyay J. Sineva E. Knight J. Levy R.M. Ebright R.H. Antibacterial peptide microcin J25 (MccJ25) inhibits transcription by binding within, and obstructing, the RNA polymerase secondary channel.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14 (15200952): 739-75110.1016/j.molcel.2004.06.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This 100-fold difference is surprising because citrocin has a higher MIC (16–125 μm) against E. coli than MccJ25 (∼1 μm), yet citrocin is actually a much stronger RNAP inhibitor. This suggests that citrocin uptake is the limiting factor to its activity against E. coli. We generated citrocin-resistant variants of E. coli BW25113 by growing liquid cultures with varying concentrations of citrocin added in triplicate. We chose this strain because it is the parent strain of the Keio collection of single-gene knockouts. At 100 μm of citrocin, none of the triplicate cultures grew after 18 h (Fig. 6A). At 12.5 μm of citrocin, all three cultures showed some growth retardation but were able to grow in a linear fashion. At the intermediate concentrations of 25, 50, and 75 μm, however, the cultures either did not grow by 18 h or exhibited a long lag phase of ∼8 h followed by exponential growth. The bacteria in these five cultures have spontaneously developed resistance to citrocin. This was confirmed by restreaking the cells in the absence of citrocin and growing new liquid cultures for confirmation of resistance using the spot-on-lawn assay (Fig. S10). We then sequenced the resistant variants, as well as the WT E. coli BW25113 strain, and looked for genomic differences. One of the variants had a point mutation in the sbmA gene. Another variant had both a point mutation and deletion of part of the sbmA gene that resulted in a frameshift. A third variant had a large deletion that included the entire sbmA gene. SbmA is an inner membrane protein in E. coli of unknown physiological role that is required for the uptake of other antimicrobial peptides such as microcin J25 and microcin B17 (33Corbalan N. Runti G. Adler C. Covaceuszach S. Ford R.C. Lamba D. Beis K. Scocchi M. Vincent P.A. Functional and structural study of the dimeric inner membrane protein SbmA.J.

The frequency of changes and deletions to sbmA suggested that it is also involved in transporting citrocin across the inner membr"
https://openalex.org/W2919831311,"Neuronal activity-dependent transcription is tuned to ensure precise gene induction during periods of heightened synaptic activity, allowing for appropriate responses of activated neurons within neural circuits. The consequences of aberrant induction of activity-dependent genes on neuronal physiology are not yet clear. Here, we demonstrate that, in the absence of synaptic excitation, the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS family transcription factor ARNT2 recruits the NCoR2 co-repressor complex to suppress neuronal activity-dependent regulatory elements and maintain low basal levels of inducible genes. This restricts inhibition of excitatory neurons, maintaining them in a state that is receptive to future sensory stimuli. By contrast, in response to heightened neuronal activity, ARNT2 recruits the neuronal-specific bHLH-PAS factor NPAS4 to activity-dependent regulatory elements to induce transcription and thereby increase somatic inhibitory input. Thus, the interplay of bHLH-PAS complexes at activity-dependent regulatory elements maintains temporal control of activity-dependent gene expression and scales somatic inhibition with circuit activity."
https://openalex.org/W2922156729,"Episodic memories (EMs) are recollections of contextually rich and personally relevant past events. EM has been linked to the sense of self, allowing one to mentally travel back in subjective time and re-experience past events. However, the sense of self has recently been linked to online multisensory processing and bodily self-consciousness (BSC). It is currently unknown whether EM depends on BSC mechanisms. Here, we used a new immersive virtual reality (VR) system that maintained the perceptual richness of life episodes and fully controlled the experimental stimuli during encoding and retrieval, including the participant’s body. Our data reveal a classical EM finding, which shows that memory for complex real-life like scenes decays over time. However, here we also report a novel finding that delayed retrieval performance can be enhanced when participants view their body as part of the virtual scene during encoding. This body effect was not observed when no virtual body or a moving control object was shown, thereby linking the sense of self, and BSC in particular, to EMs. The present VR methodology and the present behavioral findings will enable to study key aspects of EM in healthy participants and may be especially beneficial for the restoration of self-relevant memories in future experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2920950946,"On vault in artistic gymnastics, a high run-up speed is thought to be important when performing difficult vaults. To test this assumption in a large cohort of elite athletes, we calculated the correlations between the run-up speed, scores, height and length of flight for handspring-, Tsukahara- and Yurchenko-style vaults and compared the performances of male and female elite and junior athletes (n = 407) during the 2016 European Championships. In females, run-up speed correlated significantly with the difficulty (D-) score and height of flight for all vaulting styles (r ≤ 0.80). In males, run-up speed correlated significantly with the D-score, height and length of flight of Tsukahara (r ≤ 0.69) and Yurchenko vaults only (r ≤ 0.65). Males reached 8–9% higher run-up speeds performing handspring and Tsukahara vaults than did females, but similar run-up speeds performing Yurchenko vaults. Elite females achieved higher run-up speeds than junior females performing Yurchenko vaults. Elite males displayed higher run-up speeds than junior males performing handspring and Tsukahara vaults. We conclude that, in females, more difficult vaults require higher run-up speeds than vaults with lower D-scores and thus, within the measured range of speeds, the faster the run-up, the better, regardless of vaulting style. Males, on the other hand, may not need to exhaust their sprinting capacity, even for the most difficult vaults. Finally, the knowledge of the required run-up speed for each vault helps coaches to estimate each athlete’s potential and/or to focus the training on developing the required physical qualities."
https://openalex.org/W2921503875,"Targeted neuromodulation strategies that strengthen neuronal activity are in great need for restoring sensorimotor function after chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, we established changes in the motoneuron output of individuals with and without SCI after repeated noninvasive transspinal stimulation at rest over the thoracolumbar enlargement, the spinal location of leg motor circuits. Cases of motor incomplete and complete SCI were included to delineate potential differences when corticospinal motor drive is minimal. All 10 SCI and 10 healthy control subjects received daily monophasic transspinal stimuli of 1-ms duration at 0.2 Hz at right soleus transspinal evoked potential (TEP) subthreshold and suprathreshold intensities at rest. Before and two days after cessation of transspinal stimulation, we determined changes in TEP recruitment input-output curves, TEP amplitude at stimulation frequencies of 0.1, 0.125, 0.2, 0.33 and 1.0 Hz, and TEP postactivation depression upon transspinal paired stimuli at interstimulus intervals of 60, 100, 300, and 500 ms. TEPs were recorded at rest from bilateral ankle and knee flexor/extensor muscles. Repeated transspinal stimulation increased the motoneuron output over multiple segments. In control and complete SCI subjects, motoneuron output increased for knee muscles, while in motor incomplete SCI subjects motoneuron output increased for both ankle and knee muscles. In control subjects, TEPs homosynaptic and postactivation depression were present at baseline, and were potentiated for the distal ankle or knee flexor muscles. TEPs homosynaptic and postactivation depression at baseline depended on the completeness of the SCI, with minimal changes observed after transspinal stimulation. These results indicate that repeated transspinal stimulation increases spinal motoneuron responsiveness of ankle and knee muscles in the injured human spinal cord, and thus can promote motor recovery. This noninvasive neuromodulation method is a promising modality for promoting functional neuroplasticity after SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2949456311,"As of May 27, 2018, 6 suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI: 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration."

Whereas all of the 3-linked residues of these galactans are in the d-configuration (G unit), the 4-linked galactose units are in the d-configuration in carrageenans (D unit) and in the l-configuration in agars (L unit). A further layer of complexity is introduced by the systematic occurrence of either a 3,6-anhydro bridge or a sulfate group at C6 in the 4-linked galactose residues. Galactose 6-sulfate (referred to as D6S in carrageenans and L6S in agars) is considered as the biogenic precursor of 3,6-anhydro-galactose (referred to as DA in carrageenans and LA in agars). Indeed, the conversion of galactose 6-sulfate into 3,6-anhydro-galactose is catalyzed by galactose-6-sulfurylase (2Lawson C.J. Rees D.A.

The regular structure of the backbone of red algal galactans is often masked by additional chemical modifications, such as ester sulfate groups, methyl groups, or pyruvic acid acetal groups (6Lahaye M.

This complexity has been taken into account in carrageenan nomenclature, and traditionally carrageenans are identified by a Greek prefix, indicating the major component of the sample (7Van de Velde F. Knutsen S. Usov A. Rollema H. Cerezo A. 1H and 13C high resolution NMR spectroscopy of carrageenans: application in research and industry.Trends Food Sci.

However, this system is not sufficient to describe more complex carrageenans, and a letter code–based nomenclature, inspired by the IUPAC nomenclature, was proposed by Knutsen et al. (9Knutsen S. Myslabodski D. Larsen B. Usov A. A modified system of nomenclature for red algal galactans.Bot. Mar. 1994; 37: 163-16910.1515/botm.1994.37.2.163Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar) for systematically describing these complex galactans. A Greek prefix nomenclature has never been introduced for agars, probably because the academic and private sectors have essentially focused on agarose, a high-gelling agar essentially devoid of modifications that is used worldwide in food industries, in molecular biology and for chromatography matrices. However, natural agars are largely as complex as carrageenans (6Lahaye M. Rochas C.

To investigate the structure of natural agars, the combination of biophysical methods and specific enzymes has become a powerful strategy. The main enzymatic tools are the β-agarases and the β-porphyranases, which specifically cleave the β-1,4 linkages in agars and release oligosaccharides of the neo-agarobiose (LA-G) and neo-porphyranobiose (L6S-G) series, respectively (13Jam M.

These studies notably revealed a gradient of tolerance for modifications in the agar chain, from ZgAgaD, which is strictly specific for long stretches of unsubstituted agarobiose motifs, to ZgAgaB and ZgPorB, which can tolerate substituents at some subsites (24Hehemann J.H.

The last putative β-agarase, which has not been characterized in Zobellia galactanivorans, is ZgAgaC. The first mention in the literature of this enzyme was the purification of the WT enzyme from the culture medium of Z. galactanivorans (13Jam M. Flament D. Allouch J. Potin P. Thion L. Kloareg B.

J. 2005; 385 (15456406): 703-71310.1042/BJ20041044Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The authors demonstrated that the extracellular agarolytic activity of this marine flavobacterium is encompassed by two enzymes: ZgAgaA, which was retained on a Sepharose CL6B affinity chromatography column, and ZgAgaC, which was found in the flowthrough of the agarose-containing column. By Edman degradation, an oligopeptide of ZgAgaC was sequenced (ATYDFTGNTP), but the agaC gene was not successfully cloned (13Jam M. Flament D. Allouch J. Potin P. Thion L. Kloareg B. Czjzek M.

J. 2005; 385 (15456406): 703-71310.1042/BJ20041044Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Later, the sequencing of the Z. galactanivorans genome revealed that the ATYDFTGNTP peptide was only found in the ORF ZGAL_4267, which was thus named agaC (18Barbeyron T. Thomas F. Barbe V. Teeling H. Schenowitz C. Dossat C. Goesmann A. Leblanc C. Oliver Glöckner F. Czjzek M. Amann R. Michel G. Habitat and taxon as driving forces of carbohydrate catabolism in marine heterotrophic bacteria: example of the model algae-associated bacterium Zobellia galactanivorans DsijT.Environ.

Here, we present the characterization of the recombinant ZgAgaC on agarose and on a natural complex agar, revealing a previously undescribed substrate specificity. The crystal structure of this enzyme gives insight into the molecular bases of its recognition of agars. Finally, an updated phylogeny of the GH16 galactanases indicates that ZgAgaC and its close homologues constitute a new subfamily within the GH16 family. The agaC gene encodes a protein of 328 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 37.6 kDa. The protein sequence contains a lipoprotein signal peptide (residues 1–17), with a lysine at the +2 position (Lys19) suggesting that ZgAgaC is anchored to the outer membrane (25Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Testing the “+2 rule” for lipoprotein sorting in the Escherichia coli cell envelope with a new genetic selection.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34 (10564520): 810-82110.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01647.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a region rich in glutamate and lysine (Cys18–Asn67) and a catalytic module of the GH16 family (Ala68–Glu328) (Fig. 1A). The low-complexity region is predicted by the DisEMBL server (26Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Protein disorder prediction: implications for structural proteomics.Structure. 2003; 11 (14604535): 1453-145910.1016/j.str.2003.10.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) as being disordered (Hot-loops definition: Leu26–Glu61; Remark-465 definition: Pro32–Glu61), suggesting that this region is a flexible linker. Interestingly, this protein does not feature a C-terminal type IX secretion system (T9SS) domain, which is unique to Bacteroidetes (27McBride M.J. Zhu Y.T. Gliding motility and Por secretion system genes are widespread among members of the phylum Bacteroidetes.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195 (23123910): 270-27810.1128/JB.01962-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), whereas ZgAgaC was shown to be an extracellular enzyme (13Jam M. Flament D. Allouch J. Potin P. Thion L. Kloareg B. Czjzek M. Helbert W. Michel G. Barbeyron T. The endo-β-agarases AgaA and AgaB from the marine bacterium Zobellia galactanivorans: two paralogue enzymes with different molecular organizations and catalytic behaviours.Biochem. J. 2005; 385 (15456406): 703-71310.1042/BJ20041044Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This suggests that ZgAgaC is indeed anchored through a lipid to the outer membrane and likely oriented toward the external medium. Its secretion might be the result of a fortuitous proteolytic cleavage of the linker region. The position of agaC in the genome is noteworthy. Although this gene is not included in a polysaccharide utilization locus (28Grondin J.M. Tamura K. Dájean G. Abbott D.W. Brumer H. Polysaccharide utilization loci: fuelling microbial communities.J.

Indeed, agaC (locus ID: ZGAL_4267) is located next to the mannitol utilization operon (ZGAL_4259–ZGAL_4264) (30Groisillier A. Labourel A. Michel G. Tonon T.

In a recent characterization of the carrageenolytic regulon in Z. galactanivorans (33Ficko-Blean E. Práchoux A. Thomas F. Rochat T. Larocque R. Zhu Y. Stam M. Gánicot S. Jam M. Calteau A. Viart B.

But this was not the case for agaC despite its neighboring location (33Ficko-Blean E. Práchoux A. Thomas F. Rochat T. Larocque R. Zhu Y. Stam M. Gánicot S. Jam M. Calteau A. Viart B. Ropartz D.

Michel G. Gene expression analysis of Zobellia galactanivorans during the degradation of algal polysaccharides reveals both substrate-specific and shared transcriptome-wide responses.Front.

More surprisingly, this gene was also induced in the presence of laminarin, the storage polysaccharide of brown algae. Currently, the GH16 family includes three different types of enzymes specific for sulfated galactans from red algae: κ-carrageenases (35Michel G. Chantalat L. Duee E. Barbeyron T. Henrissat B.

Based on pairwise sequence comparisons with characterized galactanases from Z. galactanivorans, the GH16 module of ZgAgaC appears highly divergent from these different enzymes. The closest homologue is ZgPorA (31% identity), distantly followed by ZgAgaA (23%), ZgAgaB (21%), ZgPorB (21%), and ZgCgkA (19%).

This tree is divided into five very solid clades, with bootstrap values ranging from 86 to 99%. As expected, κ-carrageenases and β-agarases form two different clades. This analysis also indicates that ZgAgaC and its closest homologues (25 sequences) constitute a monophyletic group distinct from “classical” β-agarases. The most surprising result is that β-porphyranases form two distinct monophyletic groups, the ZgPorA-like group and the ZgPorB-like group. Some relative positions of these clades are also solid. The κ-carrageenase clade is the closest to the root and is a sister group of all of the agar-specific enzymes (bootstrap value: 99%). The ZgPorA-like clade is the most ancestral group of agar-specific enzymes, solidly rooting a cluster composed of the three other clades (bootstrap value: 97%). Within this cluster, the relative positions between the clade of the classical β-agarases, the ZgAgaC-like clade and ZgPorB-like clade are unclear, because all of the nodes connecting these clades have bootstrap values below 50%. The recombinant ZgAgaC corresponds to the catalytic GH16 module encoded by agaC (Thr69–Glu328) without the lipoprotein signal peptide and the N-terminal low-complexity region (Fig. 1B). This His-tagged protein (31.3 kDa, pI = 5.81) was produced in soluble form in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with a high yield of ∼185 mg/liter of culture.

Regardless of how leptin exerts its biological activity, it is essential that its production in adipocytes is coupled to nutrient uptake and energy status of the body as circulating leptin levels increase within hours after feeding and decrease shortly after food deprivation (3Ahima R.S.

Although in humans, this effect may not be as fast and robust as in rodents, all mammals studied thus far demonstrate a direct link between food intake and circulating leptin (3Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Leptin.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62 (10845097): 413-43710.1146/annurev.physiol.62.1.413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Based on these results, the predominant hypothesis in the field has been that leptin expression is controlled by nutrients and/or insulin. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that insulin increases leptin production by adipose cells both in vivo and in vitro (3Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Leptin.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62 (10845097): 413-43710.1146/annurev.physiol.62.1.413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Although this regulatory connection is central to all proposed mechanisms of leptin action, its mechanism remains unknown. Here, we are showing that insulin/mTORC1-inducible transcription factor Egr1 binds to the leptin promoter and activates leptin expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin causes a strong but transient induction of Egr1 (see also Ref. 9Chakrabarti P. Kim J.Y. Singh M. Shin Y.K. Kim J. Kumbrink J. Wu Y. Lee M.J. Kirsch K.H. Fried S.K. Kandror K.V. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes via the evolutionarily conserved mTORC1-Egr1-ATGL-mediated pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33 (23858058): 3659-366610.1128/MCB.01584-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) followed by an increase in the leptin mRNA (Fig. 1A). By the same token, a single intraperitoneal insulin injection induces Egr1 and leptin mRNA in epididymal fat pads (Fig. 1B) and in circulating leptin in vivo (Fig. 1C). A luciferase assay performed in HEK 293T cells demonstrates that induction of Egr1 not only precedes leptin expression in adipocytes, but Egr1 can activate the leptin promoter (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, a ChIP assay carried out in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes shows that Egr1 directly binds to the leptin promoter in an insulin-sensitive fashion (Fig. 2B). Previously, we have found that the lipid droplet protein FSP27 (also known as CIDEC) represents a co-repressor of Egr1 (10Singh M. Kaur R. Lee M.J. Pickering R.T. Sharma V.M. Puri V. Kandror K.V. Fat-specific protein 27 inhibits lipolysis by facilitating the inhibitory effect of transcription factor Egr1 on transcription of adipose triglyceride lipase.J. Biol.

In agreement with these results, we now show that FSP27 blocks the effect of Egr1 on the activity of the leptin promoter (Fig. 2C). To determine whether Egr1 is necessary for the effect of insulin on leptin transcription, we have knocked down Egr1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the help of siRNA. As is shown in Fig. 2D, knockdown of Egr1 not only decreases expression of leptin in basal cells, but also completely blocks up-regulation of leptin mRNA by insulin. Importantly, Egr1 not only is necessary but also is sufficient for the up-regulation of leptin expression in adipocytes; overexpression of Egr1 in these cells with the help of adenoviral infection strongly increases levels of the leptin mRNA (Fig. 2E). Previously, we have determined that treatment of cultured adipocytes with insulin stimulates expression of both Egr1 mRNA and protein. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocks insulin-stimulated increase in the Egr1 mRNA but has only a moderate effect on the Egr1 protein. Expression of the latter is completely suppressed by the mTORC1 inhibitor, PP242 (11Singh M. Shin Y.K. Yang X. Zehr B. Chakrabarti P. Kandror K.V. 4E-BPs control fat storage by regulating the expression of Egr1 and ATGL.J. Biol.

Here, we confirm this result and also show that transcription of leptin correlates with the expression of Egr1 in PD98059- and PP242-treated adipocytes (Fig. 3A). To further prove the role of mTORC1 and Egr1 in the regulation of leptin transcription, we decided to mimic the effect of insulin specifically on the expression of Egr1 by deleting its highly structured 5′-UTR using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique (note the loss of the 2.5 kb band in the Δ5′UTR lane in Fig. 3B). This procedure does not significantly change levels of the Egr1 mRNA (Fig. 3C), but it dramatically elevates expression of the Egr1 protein (Fig. 3D). Administration of insulin to the “engineered” cells has only a minimal stimulatory effect on the Egr1 protein levels, suggesting that deletion of the 5′-UTR raises its biosynthesis to the maximum. This result supports our previous conclusion that insulin increases translation of the Egr1 mRNA primarily via the mTORC1–4E-BP1/2 regulatory axis (11Singh M. Shin Y.K. Yang X. Zehr B. Chakrabarti P. Kandror K.V. 4E-BPs control fat storage by regulating the expression of Egr1 and ATGL.J. Biol.

As expected, the luciferase assay has demonstrated that the activity of the leptin promoter in these cells is strongly increased (Fig. 3E). In this study, we provide evidence that insulin/mTORC1-inducible transcription factor Egr1 mediates the physiologically significant stimulatory effect of insulin on leptin transcription. In analyzing these data, it is essential to keep in mind that leptin production by adipose cells is regulated at several different levels: transcription, translation, secretion, and autophagic degradation (12Kandror K.V. Translational and post-translational control of leptin production by fat cells.in: Menon P.K.M.J. Goldstrohm P.A. Post-transcriptional Mechanisms in Endocrine Regulation.

Importantly, both transcription (this report) and translation of leptin are positively regulated by insulin via the mTORC1-mediated pathway (14Chakrabarti P. Anno T. Manning B.D. Luo Z. Kandror K.V.

As activity of mTORC1 depends not only on insulin levels but also on nutrient and energy availability (17Dibble C.C. Manning B.D. Signal integration by mTORC1 coordinates nutrient input with biosynthetic output.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 (23728461): 555-56410.1038/ncb2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 18Sengupta S.

At the same time, mechanisms of regulated leptin secretion and degradation remain virtually unstudied but may substantially contribute to changes in circulating leptin. For example, Lee and Fried (19Lee M.J. Fried S.K. Multilevel regulation of leptin storage, turnover, and secretion by feeding and insulin in rat adipose tissue.J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47 (16738357): 1984-199310.1194/jlr.M600065-JLR200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have found that up to 50% of newly synthesized leptin molecules are rapidly degraded in lysosomes instead of being secreted. The problem of leptin production has another important aspect. In addition to the short-term connection with food intake, circulating leptin levels are known to be steadily elevated in obesity (3Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Leptin.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62 (10845097): 413-43710.1146/annurev.physiol.62.1.413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 4Friedman J.M. Leptin at 14 y of age: an ongoing story.Am. J. Clin.

At the cellular level, larger adipocytes contain and secrete more leptin than smaller cells (20Hamilton B.S. Paglia D. Kwan A.Y. Deitel M. Increased obese mRNA expression in omental fat cells from massively obese humans.Nat. Med. 1995; 1 (7585224): 953-95610.1038/nm0995-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 21Russell C.D.

Because the adipocyte size is defined primarily by the volume of the central lipid droplet, this phenomenon may show a cell-autonomous connection between the amount of stored energy (i.e. obesity at the molecular level) and leptin expression. The correlation between the size of the adipocyte and the level of leptin production has been recognized for a long time, but its mechanism remains obscure. It is unlikely that a single act of food intake can change the size of the adipocyte in a significant fashion, so there should be another explanation for this phenomenon. To this end, it has been established that fat storage in adipocytes is also controlled by mTORC1. In particular, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling suppresses early adipogenesis (22Kim J.E. Chen J.

In agreement with these results, we now show that FSP27 blocks the effect of Egr1 on the activity of the leptin promoter (Fig. 2C). Thus, we hypothesize that FSP27 may link the size of LDs (that account for most of the adipocyte volume) to leptin expression by inhibiting Egr1. In other words, we suggest that increasing size of LDs may “pull” FSP27 out of the nucleus, which should lead to the activation of leptin expression via Egr1.

Sterile zirconium oxide beads measuring 1.0 mm in diameter and bullet homogenizer (Standard BBX24) were purchased from Next Advance (Troy, NY). 12–16-week-old male C57BL6J mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and acclimatized for 2 weeks with a 12-h light/day cycle. Prior to experiments, animals were housed in complete darkness (free-running) for 3 days with access to food and water ad libitum. On the fourth day, animals were fasted for 6 h and injected with insulin (2 units/kg) intraperitoneally. All experimental procedures were approved by the Boston University School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. Culturing and differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells were performed as described previously (9Chakrabarti P. Kim J.Y. Singh M. Shin Y.K. Kim J. Kumbrink J. Wu Y. Lee M.J. Kirsch K.H. Fried S.K. Kandror K.V.

Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 200 μl of cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Millipore, Burlington, MA) supplemented with Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Biotek Synergy™ HT microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Freshly excised adipose tissue (∼100 mg) were collected in prechilled microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 scoop (measuring apparatus provided by Next Advance) of sterile 1.0-mm diameter RNase-free zirconium oxide beads and 200 μl of extraction buffer (40 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Tissue was homogenized in a bullet blender homogenizer and for 5 min each at the maximum intensity. Lysates were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to allow triglycerides to solidify at the top. Nonidet P-40 (1% final) was added to liquid phase for 10 min at 4 °C on a shaker, and samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total RNA was extracted from cultured adipocytes and mouse adipose tissue using TRIzol™ reagent followed by extraction through RNeasy columns from EPOCH (Sugar Land, TX). Total RNA (1 μg) underwent reverse transcription using random decamers through the RETROscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Expression was measured using the ΔΔCt method, including -fold expression of treatments compared with control. Each experiment was done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The adenoviral vector containing human Egr1 cDNA (AdEgr1) was kindly provided by E. Hofer (Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). GFP containing adenovirus was kindly provided by Andy Greenberg (Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA). Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 24-well plates were serum-starved in Opti-MEM medium for 2 h. AdEGR1 or AdGFP were then added to cells at a multiplicity of infection of 4,000. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. After 48 h, cells were harvested for protein and RNA analysis. Suspension transfections were performed according to Kilroy et al. (39Kilroy G. Burk D.H. Floyd Z.E. High efficiency lipid-based siRNA transfection of adipocytes in suspension.PLoS One. 2009; 4 (19759827): e694010.1371/journal.pone.0006940Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated until day 4. Cells were washed gently with PBS, trypsinized with 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 3–5 min, resuspended in 10% FBS/DMEM (5 ml), and placed immediately into 24-well plates containing either Egr1 siRNA or scrambled siRNA. To prepare siRNA transfection mix, scrambled and Egr1 siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were mixed with Opti-MEM medium at a final concentration of 100 nm and allowed to sit for 5 min at room temperature. DharmaFECT Duo (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was added to the previous mixture (1.4 μl/cm2 surface area of transfection). The mixture was allowed to sit for 20 min at room temperature, and then 200 μl was added to each well of a 24-well plate. Cells were incubated for 24 h and thereafter replenished with fresh 10% FBS/DMEM and maintained for an additional 48 h before being harvested for the analysis of protein and RNA. ChIP was performed with the EZ-ChIP kit from Millipore (Burlington, MA). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cross-linked with 18.5% formaldehyde for 10 min and then quenched with 0.125 m glycine for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in SDS lysis buffer. Chromatin fragments were prepared by sonication in the Bioruptor Sonicator using 1.5 ml of Bioruptor® Plus TPX microtubes (Diagenode, Denville, NJ) on ice for 15 cycles (30 s with 30-s intervals) at the high-intensity setting. Novus Egr1 antibody or nonspecific mouse IgG (10 μg) was added to sonicated samples and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Protein G-agarose (60 μl) was added to samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 1 min to pellet the beads and washed before removing the supernatant fraction. Protein–DNA complexes were eluted, treated with RNase A and proteinase K, and transferred to DNA purification spin columns to be eluted and stored in −20 °C. Purified DNA eluates were analyzed by qPCR according to Cardamone et al. (40Cardamone M.D. Orofino J. Labadorf A. Perissi V. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of murine brown adipose tissue.J. Vis.

Dilutions of total lysates (1:10, 1:100, and 1:1,000) were amplified by PCR to form a standard reference curve. Numbers from eluates relative to the total lysate were used to calculate the slope and intercept for the standard reference curve. Ct values of samples were input in the formula, relative input = 10(Ct − intercept)×10/slope. Leptin core promoter spanning −350/+27 was amplified from mouse genomic DNA by PCR with the primers 5′-TAAGCAGCTAGCCTGTAGCCTCTTGCTCCCTGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTTAAAGCTTACCTTGCAGCTGCTGGAGCAGGGATCC-3′ (reverse). Underlined sequences contain restriction enzyme sites NheI for forward and HindIII for reverse primer. Upstream of the restriction enzyme sites are additional base pairs to reduce GC content. pGL4.1 luciferase vector was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Amplified PCR segments were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Products were ligated into the NheI and HindIII sites of pGL4.1 vector ligated following an overnight ligation method, using the Quick Ligation kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), yielding the leptin promoter reporter (−350/+27). Ligated plasmid was then transformed into DH5α supercompetent cells (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Successfully transformed colonies were extracted for plasmid DNA and verified by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T) were grown to 70% confluence in 24-well plates (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) and subsequently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (9Chakrabarti P. Kim J.Y. Singh M.

To normalize transfection efficiency, samples were co-transfected with 100 ng of pRL-CMV-Renilla (Promega, Madison, WI). After 48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were determined by the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System kit (Promega) using a Biotek Synergy™ HT microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). Mouse blood samples (200 μl) were incubated at room temperature for 25 min before being centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Serum was then collected, and circulating leptin was measured using the mouse leptin ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were read at 450-nm absorbance by a Biotek Synergy™ HT microplate reader and were fitted by a standard curve to determine leptin concentration. The DNA region encoding the 5′-UTR of the Egr1 mRNA was deleted using a CRISPR/Cas9 system in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes as described previously (41Sanjana N.E. Shalem O. Zhang F.

The lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid (52961; Addgene) was used to express single guide RNAs and the Cas9 protein along with the lentiviral envelope plasmid pCMV-VSV-G and the packaging plasmid psPAX2. 3T3-L1 cells transduced with lentiviruses were cultured under selection with puromycin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) (5 μg/ml) for 4 days. Single colonies of stably transfected cells were grown in 10% FBS/DMEM containing puromycin (5 μg/ml). The genomic region surrounding the single guide RNA target site was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TGTTAACCTTGACGTCCCCG-3′ and 5′-GGGTGTCCCTAGACATCCCT-3′ and sequenced.

https://openalex.org/W2921738573,"Introduction Preoperative functional mapping in the vicinity of brain lesion is of high importance for avoiding complications in surgical management. However, space-occupying lesions may lead to functional reorganization or decreased BOLD activity. Methods Therefore in 13 patients with cerebral gliomas or brain arterio-venous malformations/ hemangioma fMRI- and MEG-based cortical localizations of motor and somatosensory cortical activation pattern were compared in order to investigate their congruency. Results Localization of cortical sensorimotor areas with fMRI and MEG showed good congruency with a mean spatial distance of around 10 mm, with differences depending on the localization method. The smallest mean differences for the centroids were found for MEF with MNE 8 mm and SEF with sLORETA 8 mm. Primary motor area (M1) reorganization was found in 5 of 12 patients in fMRI and confirmed with MEG data. In these 5 patients with M1-reorganization the distance between the border of the fMRI-based cortical M1-localization and the tumor border on T1w MR images varied between 0–4 mm, which was significant (P = 0.025) different to the distance in glioma patients without M1-reorganization (5–26 mm). Conclusion Our multimodal preoperative mapping approach combining fMRI and MEG reveals a high degree of spatial congruence and provided high evidence for the presence of motor cortex reorganization."

Surveillance is recommended, but the optimal imaging method and screening interval remain to be defined. The main aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of RCC surveillance to get insight in the safety of annual US in these patients. Surveillance data and medical records of 199 patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome were collected retrospectively using medical files and a questionnaire. These patients were diagnosed in two Dutch hospitals and data were collected until June 2014. A first screening for renal cell carcinoma was performed in 172/199 patients (86%). Follow-up data were available from 121 patients. The mean follow-up period per patient was 4.2 years. Of the patients known to be under surveillance, 83% was screened at least annually and 94% at least every two years. Thirty-eight renal cell carcinomas had occurred in 23 patients. The mean age at diagnosis of the first tumour was 51. Eighteen tumours were visualized by ultrasound. Nine small tumours (7–27 mm) were visible on MRI or CT and not detected using ultrasound. Our data indicate that compliance to renal screening is relatively high. Furthermore, ultrasound might be a sensitive, cheap and widely available alternative for MRI or part of the MRIs for detecting clinically relevant renal tumours in BHD patients,but the limitations should be considered carefully. Data from larger cohorts are necessary to confirm these observations."
https://openalex.org/W2921060245,"Objectives Although tacrolimus is useful as an induction therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), information regarding the long-term outcome after tacrolimus therapy is insufficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of the pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a prognostic factor in patients with UC receiving tacrolimus, to aid treatment selection. Materials and methods Patients with moderate-to-severe active UC who received oral tacrolimus induction therapy and subsequent immunomodulatory maintenance therapy at our hospital between 2009 and 2017 and who showed clinical response at week 12, were retrospectively enrolled. Cox regression analysis was conducted to study the prognostic role of the pretreatment NLR. The combined impact of the NLR and other known prognostic factors was investigated with multivariate regression. Results Among 45 patients included in this study, 21 patients experienced relapse during a median follow-up period of 16.6 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the pretreatment NLR (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72–0.94, P < 0.01) and the use of immunomodulators at the start of tacrolimus treatment (HR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05–0.66, P = 0.01) as independent predictors of clinical relapse. Conclusions The pretreatment NLR is an independent prognostic factor in patients with UC treated with tacrolimus."
https://openalex.org/W2949506565,"Blood tests provide crucial diagnostic information regarding several diseases. A key factor that affects the precision and accuracy of blood tests is the interference of red blood cells; however, the conventional methods of blood separation are often complicated and time consuming. In this study, we devised a simple but high-efficiency blood separation system on a self-strained microfluidic device that separates 99.7 ± 0.3% of the plasma in only 6 min. Parameters, such as flow rate, design of the filter trench, and the relative positions of the filter trench and channel, were optimized through microscopic monitoring. Moreover, this air-difference-driven device uses a cost-effective and easy-to-use heater device that creates a low-pressure environment in the microchannel within minutes. With the aforementioned advantages, this blood separation device could be another platform choice for point-of-care testing."
https://openalex.org/W2921184642,"Objectives This study aimed to analyze the daily heart rate variability (HRV) in well-trained female cyclists during the 2017 Tour de France circuit and to relate it to the load and perceived exertion response. Methods Ten female cyclists volunteered to participate in the study. HRV was recorded with a portable heart rate monitor each morning at rest in supine (7 min.) and upright (7 min.) positions, as well as throughout each day’s stage. Pre-Tour baseline HRV recordings were made, as well as during the four weeks following completion of the Tour. Exercise daily load was assessed using the training impulse score (TRIMPS). Post-exercise rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed daily using the Borg CR-10 scale. Results The results show a HRV imbalance, increase of sympathetic and decrease of vagal activities respectively, along the event that correlated with rate of perceived exertion (r = 0.46), training impulse score (r = 0.60), and kilometers (r = 046). The greatest change in HRV balance was observed the days after the greatest relative physical load. Mean heart rate and heart rate variability values returned to their baseline values one week after completion of the event. Conclusions Despite incomplete recovery from day-to-day, fatigue is not summative or augmented with each successive stage and its physical load. Just one week is sufficient to restore baseline values. Heart rate and HRV can be used as a tool to strategically plan the effort of female cyclists that participate in multi-stage events."
https://openalex.org/W2921492061,"The Mo-dependent nitrogenase comprises two interacting components called the Fe protein and the MoFe protein. The MoFe protein is an α2β2 heterotetramer that harbors two types of complex metalloclusters, both of which are necessary for N2 reduction. One type is a 7Fe-9S-Mo-C-homocitrate species designated FeMo-cofactor, which provides the N2-binding catalytic site, and the other is an 8Fe-7S species designated the P-cluster, involved in mediating intercomponent electron transfer to FeMo-cofactor. The MoFe protein's catalytic partner, Fe protein, is also required for both FeMo-cofactor formation and the conversion of an immature form of P-clusters to the mature species. This latter process involves several assembly factors, NafH, NifW, and NifZ, and precedes FeMo-cofactor insertion. Here, using various protein affinity–based purification methods as well as in vivo, EPR spectroscopy, and MALDI measurements, we show that several MoFe protein species accumulate in a NifZ-deficient background of the nitrogen-fixing microbe Azotobacter vinelandii. These included fully active MoFe protein replete with FeMo-cofactor and mature P-cluster, inactive MoFe protein having no FeMo-cofactor and only immature P-cluster, and partially active MoFe protein having one αβ-unit with a FeMo-cofactor and mature P-cluster and the other αβ-unit with no FeMo-cofactor and immature P-cluster. Also, NifW could associate with MoFe protein having immature P-clusters and became dissociated upon P-cluster maturation. Furthermore, both P-clusters could mature in vitro without NifZ.

Efforts to transfer an efficient ability to fix dinitrogen by microbial diazotrophs to eukaryotic organisms critically depend on understanding how the catalytic components of biological nitrogen fixation are assembled. In the present work, the role of NifZ in the maturation of the MoFe protein component of nitrogenase is explored. Mo-dependent nitrogenase catalyzes the reduction of inert dinitrogen gas (N2) and comprises two interacting components called the Fe protein and the MoFe protein (Fig. 1).

For example, NifH (Fe protein), NifU, NifS, NifB, NifEN, and NifV represent the minimum set of proteins required for in vivo formation of FeMo-cofactor, which is separately synthesized and then inserted into an apo-form of the MoFe protein already containing intact P-clusters (Fig. 1) (14Ugalde R.A.

Although details of P-cluster formation are not yet known, three accessory proteins, NafH, NifW, and NifZ, as well as NifH have been shown to sequentially and differentially interact with MoFe protein during the process of P-cluster formation/maturation (13Jimenez-Vicente E.

Inactivation of NifZ, which functions after NifW, produces MoFe protein containing some FeMo-cofactor, as well as a mixture of both mature and immature P-clusters.

The foundational basis for this “stepwise function” model is the claim that isolated MoFe protein produced by a strain deleted for nifZ exhibits ∼50% of activity compared with MoFe protein produced by a WT strain and that the MoFe protein species produced by a strain deleted for nifZ is homogeneous (16Hu Y. Fay A.W. Dos Santos P.C. Naderi F. Ribbe M.W. Characterization of Azotobacter vinelandii nifZ deletion strains: indication of stepwise MoFe protein assembly.J. Biol.

The suggestion that NifZ is involved in the maturation of only one half of the symmetrical α2β2 MoFe protein is not only counterintuitive; it does not adequately explain the originally reported phenotype (19Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemical and genetic analysis of the nifUSVWZM cluster from Azotobacter vinelandii.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219 (2615765): 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) of the nifZ-deletion strain from the model nitrogen-fixing microbe Azotobacter vinelandii used for these studies. Namely, upon a shift from growth medium replete with a fixed nitrogen source, such as urea, to a nitrogen-deficient growth medium, a process usually referred to as “nitrogenase derepression,” WT A. vinelandii is able to continue growth as a consequence of the rapid accumulation of fully active nitrogenase components. In contrast, under the same derepression conditions, a strain deleted for nifZ exhibits a significant lag in growth (19Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemical and genetic analysis of the nifUSVWZM cluster from Azotobacter vinelandii.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219 (2615765): 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). If NifZ activity is only required for maturation of one half of the MoFe protein, no such lag would be expected. Instead, assuming that nitrogen fixation is growth rate–limiting under these conditions, immediate growth for the nifZ-deleted strain would be predicted, albeit at half the rate of the WT strain. Furthermore, MoFe protein measured in extracts of the nifZ-deletion strain following a 3 h shift to nitrogen-deficient conditions exhibited only ∼30% of the MoFe protein activity produced by the WT strain, not 50% (19Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemical and genetic analysis of the nifUSVWZM cluster from Azotobacter vinelandii.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219 (2615765): 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These observations led us to consider a different model (Fig. 2B) for the involvement of NifZ in P-cluster maturation wherein NifZ has an equivalent function in the maturation of both P clusters. In this “equivalent function” model, NifZ, together with NifH, is involved in the maturation of both P-clusters contained within each α2β2 MoFe protein but is not essential for maturation of either one. Namely, the loss of NifZ slows the maturation of both P-clusters but does not prevent the in vivo maturation of either one. In the present work, both the stepwise function and equivalent function models for P-cluster maturation were tested by asking whether different MoFe protein species representing different stages in P-cluster maturation are produced by nifZ-deficient strains. Strains used in the present work are listed in Table 1. Each strain carries either a polyhistidine-encoding tag or a Strep-encoding tag incorporated into the N-terminal coding region of the MoFe protein α-subunit to aid purification by application of affinity purification procedures (20Christiansen J.

In this work, affinity-tagged MoFe proteins are indicated by a superscript to indicate the particular tag for that protein (MoFe proteinHis or MoFe proteinStr), and MoFe proteins produced in assembly-deficient backgrounds are indicated by an additional superscript indicating the deficient gene; for example, MoFe proteinHisΔZ and MoFe proteinStrΔZ carry the corresponding affinity tag and are deleted for nifZ.

WT MoFe protein containing intact FeMo-cofactor and intact P-cluster exhibits an S = 32 EPR signature characteristic of FeMo-cofactor (g = 4.32, 3.64, 2.01).

NifB is required for FeMo-cofactor formation but not for P-cluster maturation (13Jimenez-Vicente E. Yang Z.-Y. Ray W.K. Echavarri-Erasun C. Cash V.L. Rubio L.M. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R.

Therefore, MoFe proteinStrΔB, which contains no FeMo-cofactor but does contain intact P-clusters, exhibits no significant EPR spectrum, except for a trace level of S = ν signal attributed to P-cluster precursor (Fig. 3, red trace; also see comment in the Fig. 3 legend), (13Jimenez-Vicente E.

MoFe proteinStrΔH exhibits only a trace level S = 32 signal but does exhibit a prominent S = ν signal characteristic of the immature P-cluster species (Fig. 3, green trace) (8Hu Y. Fay A.W. Lee C.C.

The S = ν signature associated with immature P-cluster appears as two electronic isomers having similar g-values (g = 2.03, 1.93, and 1.86 and g = 2.06, 1.93, and 1.89). It has been previously shown that the very low level of S = 32 signal associated with MoFe proteinStrΔH, noted in Fig. 3 (green trace), arises from a very weak capacity of the Fe protein associated with the V-dependent nitrogenase, product of vnfH, to support FeMo-cofactor formation (13Jimenez-Vicente E.

MoFe proteinStrΔZ exhibits a small amount of the S = 32 signature characteristic of FeMo-cofactor as well as the S = ν signature of P-cluster precursor (Fig. 3, purple trace). How both of these signals can be present in such samples has been rationalized by the stepwise function model shown in Fig. 2A (8Hu Y. Fay A.W. Lee C.C. Ribbe M.W.

MoFe proteinStrΔZΔH exhibits only the S = ν signature of immature P-cluster (Fig. 3, blue trace), further indicating the involvement of Fe protein in FeMo-cofactor formation and P-cluster maturation. To be certain that the strains producing either MoFe proteinHisΔZ or MoFe proteinStrΔZ are phenotypically the same, their growth upon derepression was compared (Fig. 4A). The growth features are the same for both nifZ-deletion strains and are identical to the originally reported growth features of an A. vinelandii nifZ-deletion strain producing MoFe protein having no affinity tag (19Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemical and genetic analysis of the nifUSVWZM cluster from Azotobacter vinelandii.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219 (2615765): 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The important feature to note is that, relative to the WT strain producing MoFe proteinStr, strains deleted for nifZ exhibit a noticeable lag when switched to diazotrophic growth conditions. This aspect is also evidenced by a lag in the appearance of whole-cell nitrogenase activity in strains deleted for nifZ relative to the WT (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W2918348608,"The nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region, receives synaptic inputs from a range of forebrain and brainstem regions. Many of these projections have been established using electrophysiology or fluorescent tract tracing. However, more recently developed viral tracing techniques have allowed for fluorescent labeling of synaptic afferents in a cell type-specific manner. Since the NAc is comprised of multiple cell types, these methods have enabled the delineation of the cell type-specific connectivity of principal medium spiny neurons in the region. The synaptic connectivity of somatostatin interneurons, which account for <5% of the neurons in the region, has been inferred from electrophysiological and immunohistochemical data, but has not yet been visualized using modern viral tracing techniques. Here, we use the pseudorabies virus (PRV)-Introvert-GFP virus, an alphaherpes virus previously shown to label synaptic afferents in a cell type-specific manner, to label first order afferents to NAc somatostatin interneurons. While we find GFP(+) labeling in several well established projections to the NAc, we also observe that several known projections to NAc did not contain GFP(+) cells, suggesting they do not innervate somatostatin interneurons in the region. A subset of the GFP(+) afferents are c-FOS(+) following acute administration of cocaine, showing that NAc somatostatin interneurons are innervated by some cells that respond to rewarding stimuli. These results provide a foundation for future studies aimed toward elucidating the cell type-specific connectivity of the NAc, and identify specific circuits that warrant future functional characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2921333618,"Portugal underwent significant political, demographic and epidemiological transitions during the 20th century resulting in migration to urban areas with subsequent overcrowding and issues with water sanitation. This study investigates population health during these transitions and interprets results within a framework of recent history and present-day public health information. We investigate skeletal evidence for anemia (cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis) as indicators of stress and frailty-i.e., whether the lesions contribute to susceptibility for disease or increased risk of death.The presence and severity of skeletal lesions were compared against known sex and cause of death data to investigate potential heterogeneity in frailty and the relationship between lesions and risk of dying over time. Additionally, we tested for the presence of selective mortality in our data (i.e., whether or not the sample is biased for individuals with higher frailty). Our sample derives from a large, documented, modern Portuguese collection from Lisbon and is the first study of its kind using a documented collection. The collection represents primarily middle-class individuals.Analyses indicated that porotic hyperostosis became more common and severe over time, while cribra orbitalia severity increased over time. Neither process was linked to cause of death. However, there was a significant relationship to sex; males exhibited a higher prevalence and severity of lesions and increased mortality. A Gompertz function showed decreased survivorship in early life but increased survivorship over age 60. Using comorbidities of anemia, we were unable to detect selective mortality-i.e., in our sample, lesions do not represent a sign of poor health or increased frailty and are not significantly linked with a decreased mean age-at-death. However, lesion prevalence and severity do reflect the socioeconomic processes in urban Lisbon during the 1800s and 1900s and the possibility of water-borne parasites as the contributing factor for iron deficiency anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2921718041,"Working memory performance is a key indicator of cognitive and developmental status. While recent evidence indicates that stabilizing neural gain supports the stabilization of working memory during adolescence, the computational mechanisms linking neural stabilization to behavior are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic account of behavior during the memory-guided saccade task based on a stochastic accumulator framework. Results indicate that a specific balance of independent gain signals affecting working memory representations and oculomotor response thresholds can account for a peculiar U-shaped feature of the speed-accuracy relationship. Additionally, aspects of behavioral variability and mean behavioral performance, as well as subtle shifts in the shape of the speed-accuracy relationship across development, can be accounted for by the stabilization of these two sources of variability. Thus, the stabilization of neural variability can, in part, account for developmental improvements in behavioral variability as well as some improvement in mean behavioral performance."

The study aimed to assess prevalence and reasons for non-adherence to Imatinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML in the first 3-months of treatment. Methods The study was conducted from October 1, 2016 to November 30, 2017 at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 147 newly diagnosed patients were followed and their adherence status was determined using the 8-items Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and reasons for their non-adherence were evaluated using semi-structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data while multivariable logistic regression was employed to explore associations among variables of interest. Results Participants’ median age at time of confirmed diagnosis was 36 years; with most of them in the age group of <40 years (64.6%). Males comprised 59.2%. Adherence rate was found to be 55.1%. Those who lived in rural area, had low income, adverse drug events and comorbidity were significantly associated with treatment non-adherence. Most (68.4%) patients missed their medication due to adverse drug events. Three patients were lost-to-follow-up. Among 144 patients who finished the 3-month follow-up, 91.7% of them achieved complete hematologic remission. Morisky high adherent (AOR = 8.6, 95%CI:4.32–11.1) was positively associated with complete hematologic remission. Conclusions Overall treatment adherence is suboptimal. Thus, efforts should be made to improve adherence and further study is required to explore impact adherence on the cytogenetic and molecular responses of Ethiopian patients with CML."

Autoimmune PAP is an autoimmune lung disease that is caused by autoantibodies directed against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). A shared feature among many autoimmune diseases is a distinct genetic association to HLA alleles. In the present study, we HLA-typed patients with autoimmune PAP to determine if this disease had any HLA association. We analyzed amino acid and allele associations for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1, DPB1, DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5 in 41 autoimmune PAP patients compared to 1000 ethnic-matched controls and did not find any HLA association with autoimmune PAP. Collectively, these data may suggest the absence of a genetic association to the HLA in the development of autoimmune PAP."
https://openalex.org/W2921479805,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the main cause of bronchiolitis during the first year of life, when infections by other viruses, such as rhinovirus, also occur and are clinically indistinguishable from those caused by HRSV. In hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis, the analysis of gene expression profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) may be useful for the rapid identification of etiological factors, as well as for developing diagnostic tests, and elucidating pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different viral agents. In this study we conducted a comparative global gene expression analysis of PBMC obtained from two groups of infants with acute viral bronchiolitis who were infected by HRSV (HRSV group) or by HRV (HRV group). We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) which allows the identification of transcriptional modules and their correlations with HRSV or HRV groups. This approach permitted the identification of distinct transcription modules for the HRSV and HRV groups. According to these data, the immune response to HRSV infection-comparatively to HRV infection-was more associated to the activation of the interferon gamma signaling pathways and less related to neutrophil activation mechanisms. Moreover, we also identified host-response molecular markers that could be used for etiopathogenic diagnosis. These results may contribute to the development of new tests for respiratory virus identification. The finding that distinct transcriptional profiles are associated to specific host responses to HRSV or to HRV may also contribute to the elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different respiratory viruses, paving the way for new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2922219753,"Serum vibriocidal antibody assays have long been used to evaluate the immunogenicity of cholera vaccines formulated with killed whole-cell Vibrio cholerae. However, the antibody isotypes responsible for the serum vibriocidal activity are not fully characterized. In this study, we examined 20 clinical serum samples obtained from human subjects who had been vaccinated with a killed, whole-cell cholera vaccine and a positive control, human convalescent sera with high vibriocidal activity, to determine which isotype antibody is associated with the vibriocidal activity. Antibody isotypes from pooled convalescent sera were fractionated by size-exclusion column chromatography, and the major vibriocidal activity was detected in the IgM fraction. Depletion of IgM antibodies in the convalescent sera produced a significant (P<0.05) decrease in vibriocidal activity (16-fold decrease), whereas only a small change was observed with depletion of IgG or IgA. In addition, anti-LPS IgM antibody showed the highest correlation with vibriocidal activity (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.846) among antibody isotypes against heat-killed V. cholerae, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or major outer membrane protein (Omp U), while total IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody level was not correlated with vibriocidal activity in the 20 human clinical serum samples. Furthermore, human convalescent sera significantly (P<0.001) inhibited the attachment of V. cholerae to HT-29, a human intestinal epithelial cell in vitro. Interestingly, IgM-depleted convalescent sera could not effectively inhibit bacterial adherence compared with non-depleted sera (P<0.05). Finally, bacterial adhesion was significantly inhibited by sera with high vibriocidal titer compared with low-titer sera (P = 0.014). Collectively, we demonstrated that anti-V. cholerae LPS IgM is highly correlated with serum vibriocidal activity and it could be a surrogate antibody isotype representing protective antibodies against V. cholerae."

However, less is known about blame-shifting (i.e., blaming someone else for one’s own failures) and how exposure to a blame-shifting agent might lead to expectations that other agents will also shift blame. The present research tested whether exposure to a blame-shifting (versus responsibility-taking) agent would lead perceivers to expect a second, unrelated target to also shift blame. Contrary to our expectations, people expected greater blame-shifting after exposure to a responsible agent, particularly when perceivers were surprised by this reaction to failure. Discussion focuses on how people habitually expect some people to shift blame for their mishaps, and how expectancy violations when people act in unexpected ways predict the extent to which perceivers expect unrelated agents to also shift blame."
https://openalex.org/W2920947735,"The ecosystem services approach can inform decision-making by accounting for both short- and long-term benefits from different land use options. Here we used the InVEST toolkit to quantify and map key ecosystem services at the largest publicly-owned agro-silvo-pastoral farmstead in Portugal–a site representative for the montado landscape. We analyzed how Provisioning (cork production) and Regulating & Maintenance (carbon storage and sequestration) services would be affected under three land use change scenarios, which were developed in collaboration with the forest manager of the study area: Cattle Intensification, Forest Improvement, and Residential Development. Results show that increasing cattle or residential development would deliver substantially lower levels of services. We find that extensive management, improvements to forest quality, and promotion of traditional livestock grazing would provide the highest levels of assessed ecosystem services, resulting in 13.5% more carbon storage (worth between $0.34-$7.79 million USD depending on carbon price) and 62.7% more cork production (total value of USD $3.5 million) than the current land use. However, a shift in economic incentives to make sustainable cork harvesting and traditional low-density grazing of smaller ruminants like sheep and goats profitable are likely needed to reward traditional land stewardship and help support this iconic Mediterranean landscape in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2921388073,"The observation that exerting self-control in an initial task impairs subsequent self-control performance in a following task has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena. If evidence for this “ego-depletion” effect was initially believed to be strong, it is now questioned. Recent meta-analyses indicated that this effect was sensitive to publication bias and that it was greatly reduced after control for this bias. In a pre-registered replication attempt where an ego-depletion protocol was conducted in multiple independent laboratories, the effect was not distinguishable from zero. Here, a different approach is adopted to examine the validity of this effect by improving the experimental protocol with the addition of important methodological precautions: 1) a pre-test measurement, 2) a learning period, 3) a prolonged depleting task, 4) a similar control condition, and 5) valid indexes of self-control. Accordingly, a well-learned Simon task was done before and after 1h of continuous practice of a Stroop task in a high inhibition demands condition (75% of incongruent trials) or in a control condition (0% of incongruent trials). Datasets from between-subjects (Study 1, N = 82) and within-subjects (Study 2, N = 52) experiments were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. A significant ego-depletion effect was found in Study 1 (greater interference effect and accuracy decline in high inhibition demands than in control condition) but not in Study 2. Because it is difficult to explain this difference in results, the findings suggest that, even in a context chosen to optimize the observation of an ego-depletion effect, it seems difficult to be conclusive about the existence of this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2921615558,"The interactive adjustment of the optimization objectives during the treatment planning process has made it difficult to evaluate the impact of beam quality exclusively in radiotherapy. Without consensus in the published results, the arbitrary selection of photon energies increased the probability of suboptimal plans. This work aims to evaluate the dosimetric impact of various photon energies on the sparing of normal tissues by applying a preconfigured knowledge-based planning (RapidPlan) model to various clinically available photon energies for rectal cancer patients, based on model-generated optimization objectives, which provide a comparison basis with less human interference. A RapidPlan model based on 81 historical VMAT plans for pre-surgical rectal cancer patients using 10MV flattened beam (10X) was used to generate patient-specific objectives for the automated optimization of other 20 patients using 6X, 8X, 10X (reference), 6MV flattening-filter-free (6F) and 10F beams respectively on a TrueBeam accelerator. It was observed that flattened beams produced very comparable target dose coverage yet the conformity index using 6F and 10F were clinically unacceptable (>1.29). Therefore, dose to organs-at-risk (OARs) and normal tissues were only evaluated for flattened beams. RapidPlan-generated objectives for 6X and 8X beams can achieve comparable target dose coverage as that of 10X, yet the dose to normal tissues increased monotonically with decreased energies. Differences were statistically significant except femoral heads. From the radiological perspective of view, higher beam energy is still preferable for deep seated tumors, even if multiple field entries such as VMAT technique can accumulate enough dose to the target using lower energies, as reported in the literature. In conclusion, RapidPlan model configured for flattened beams cannot optimize un-flattened beams before adjusting the target objectives, yet works for flattened beams of other energies. For the investigated 10X, 8X and 6X photons, higher energies provide better normal tissue sparing."
https://openalex.org/W2921790308,"Resistin promotes hypothalamic neuroinflammation and insulin resistance through Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), this hormone is thought to be a link between obesity and insulin-resistance. Indeed, resistin plasma levels are higher in obese and insulin resistant subjects. However, the impact of maternal resistin on the predisposition of offspring to hypothalamic neuroinflammation is unknown. Here, female mice were treated with resistin during gestation/lactation periods, then hypothalamic neuroinflammation was investigated in male offspring at p28 and p90. At p28, resistin increased the expression of inflammation markers (IL6, TNFα and NFκB) and TLR4 in the hypothalamus and decreased both hypothalamic insulin and leptin receptors’ expression. The hypothalamic up-regulation IL6, TNFα and TLR4 was sustained until p90 promoting most likely hypothalamic inflammation. Maternal resistin also increased IL6 and TNFα in the adipose tissue of offspring at p90 associated with a higher body weight gain. In contrast, liver and muscle were not affected. These findings reveal that the augmentation of maternal resistin during gestation and lactation promotes hypothalamic and adipose tissue inflammation of offspring as evidenced by sustained increase of inflammation markers from weaning to adulthood. Thus, maternal resistin programs offspring hypothalamic and adipose tissue inflammation predisposing then offspring to body weight gain."

However, standardised norms and centile growth curves for language disorder that reflect the entire UK local school population do not exist. Methods Scores on six language indices assessing receptive and expressive functioning of children were obtained from the SCALES population survey. Monolingual English speaking participants were aged between five and nine years. Children who attended special schools at study intake, or who were learning English as an additional language were excluded. We constructed language norms using the LMS method of standardisation which allows for skewed measurements. We made use of probability weights that were produced from a two-step logistic model. Distributions of estimated standard scores from an intensively assessed sub-population and from the full population were contrasted to demonstrate the role of weights. Results Non-overlapping centile curves and standardised scores at each age were obtained for the six language indices. The use of weights was essential at retrieving the target distribution of the scores. An online calculator that estimates standardised scores for the measures was constructed and made freely available. Conclusions The findings highlight the usefulness and flexibility of the LMS method at dealing with the standardisation of linguistic and educational measures that are sufficiently continuous. The paper adds to the existing literature by providing population norms for a number of language tests that were calculated from the same group of individuals."

In France, where access to ART is free and universally available, we analyze the way in which social determinants of health (i.e. cultural, environmental) and economic factors might influence virological outcomes. A cross-sectional study was performed in two hospitals located in Paris area. All consecutive people living with HIV (PLHIV) on ART for at least 6 months attending the outpatient clinics between 01/05/2013 and 31/10/2014 answered an individual score of deprivation, EPICES, retrieving information on health insurance status, economic status, family support and leisure activity. This score varies from 0 to 100 with deprivation state defined above 30.17. Factors associated with HIV viral load >50 copies/ml were assessed by logistic regression modeling with a backward stepwise selection to select the final multivariable model. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two other thresholds for virological non-suppression (100 or 200 copies/ml). Overall, 475 PLHIV were included (53% male, median age 47 years, 66% not born in France mainly in a sub-Saharan African country). Half of French natives and 85% of migrants were classified as deprived. Median duration on ART was 9.7 years with virological suppression in 95.2% of non-deprived participants and in 83.5% of deprived ones (p = 0.001). The final multivariable model retained ART tiredness, younger age, a previous AIDS event and social deprivation (adjusted Odds Ratio, 2.9; 95%CI, 1.2–7.0) as determinants of virological non-suppression but not migration in itself. When using separate components of EPICES score, reporting economic difficulties and non-homeownership were associated with virological non-suppression. In addition to interventions focusing on cultural aspects of migration, social interventions are needed to help people with social vulnerability to obtain sustained responses on ART."
https://openalex.org/W2921534430,"A better understanding of sickle cell anemia (SCA) and improvements in drug therapy and health policy have contributed to the emergence of a large population of adults living with this disease. The mechanisms by which SCA produces adverse effects on the respiratory system of these patients are largely unknown. Fractional-order (FrOr) models have a high potential to improve pulmonary clinical science and could be useful for diagnostic purposes, offering accurate models with an improved ability to mimic nature. Part 2 of this two-part study examines the changes in respiratory mechanics in patients with SCA using the new perspective of the FrOr models. These results are compared with those obtained in traditional forced oscillation (FOT) parameters, investigated in Part 1 of the present study, complementing this first analysis.The data consisted of three categories of subjects: controls (n = 23), patients with a normal spirometric exam (n = 21) and those presenting restriction (n = 24). The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by investigating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Initially, it was observed that biomechanical changes in SCA included increased values of fractional inertance, as well as damping and hysteresivity (p<0.001). The correlation analysis showed that FrOr parameters are associated with functional exercise capacity (R = -0.57), pulmonary diffusion (R = -0.71), respiratory muscle performance (R = 0.50), pulmonary flows (R = -0.62) and airway obstruction (R = 0.60). Fractional-order modeling showed high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of early respiratory abnormalities (AUC = 0.93), outperforming spirometry (p<0.03) and standard FOT analysis (p<0.01) used in Part 1 of this study. A combination of machine learning methods with fractional-order modeling further improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.97).FrOr modeling improved our knowledge about the biomechanical abnormalities in adults with SCA. Changes in FrOr parameters are associated with functional exercise capacity decline, abnormal pulmonary mechanics and diffusion. FrOr modeling outperformed spirometric and traditional forced oscillation analyses, showing a high diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of early respiratory abnormalities that was further improved by an automatic clinical decision support system. This finding suggested the potential utility of this combination to help identify early respiratory changes in patients with SCA."
https://openalex.org/W2921336251,"It has been widely recognized that the early or delayed puberty appears to display harmful effects on adult health outcomes. During the timing of puberty, pituitaries responds to the hypothalamus and then introduce the following response of ovaries in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. DNA methylation has been recently suggested to regulate the onset of puberty in female mammals. However, to date, the changes of DNA methylation in pituitaries have not been investigated during pubertal transition. In this study, using gilts as the pubertal model, the genome-scale DNA methylation of pituitaries was profiled and compared across Pre-, In- and Post-puberty by using the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We found that average methylation levels of each genomic feature in Post- were lower than Pre- and In-pubertal stage in CpG context, but they were higher in In- than that in Pre- and Post-pubertal stage in CpH (where H = A, T, or C) context. The methylation patterns of CpHs were more dynamic than that of CpGs at the location of high CpG content, low CpG content promoter genes, and differently genomic CGIs. Furthermore, the differently genomic CGIs were likely to show in a similar manner in CpG context but display in a stage-specific manner in the CpH context across the Pre-, In- and Post-pubertal stage. Among these pubertal stages, 5 kb upstream regions of the transcription start sites were protected from both CpG and CpH methylation changes. 12.65% of detected CpGs were identified as the differentially methylated CpGs, regarding 4301 genes which were involved in the fundamental functions of pituitaries. 0.35% of detected CpHs were identified as differentially methylated CpHs, regarding 3691 genes which were involved in the biological functions of releasing gonadotropin hormones. These observations and analyses would provide valuable insights into epigenetic mechanism of the initiation of puberty in pituitary level."
https://openalex.org/W2922482708,"Catastrophic events can significantly impact the demographic processes that shape natural populations of organisms. However, linking the outcomes of such events to specific demographic parameters is often challenging due to a lack of detailed pre-event data. The eruption of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex on 4 June 2011 had profound consequences for the biota of southwestern Argentina. Our long-term behavioral, ecological, and demographic studies of two species of tuco-tucos (Ctenomys sociabilis and C. haigi) that occur in the region most heavily impacted by ash fall from the eruption provided an unusual opportunity to assess the effects of this event on natural populations of mammals. The post-eruption density of the study population for each species was markedly reduced compared to pre-eruption values, with the relative magnitude of this reduction being greater for the group-living C. sociabilis. The more extensive data set for this species indicated that ash fall from the eruption altered the food resources available to these animals; differences in pre- and post-eruption stable isotope signatures for fur samples from C. sociabilis were consistent with observed changes in vegetation. Per capita female reproductive success was also reduced in this species during the first breeding season following the eruption. Based on our detailed demographic records for C. sociabilis, neither survival of yearling females from 2010 to 2011 nor the percentage of unmarked females in the study population in 2011 differed from pre-eruption values. Instead, the post-eruption decrease in population density for C. sociabilis appeared to reflect reduced within-population recruitment of juvenile females to the 2011 breeding population. Although the eruption did not result in the local extinction of either study population, the demographic consequences detected are likely to have impacted the effective sizes of these populations, creating important opportunities to link specific demographic parameters to previously reported decreases in genetic variability detected after this significant natural event."

Specifically, we report evidence that states are less likely to ratify when states within their region ratify, and results suggesting that countries positively influence other countries at similar levels of economic development. By examining several prominent treaties, we illustrate the complex nature of influence: a single act of ratification can dramatically reshape global environmental politics.

https://openalex.org/W2921181921,"Marine protists play an important role in oceanic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. However, the difficulties in culturing pelagic protists indicate that their ecology and behavior remain poorly understood; phylogeographic studies based on single-cell genetic analyses have often shown that they are highly divergent at the biological species level, with variable geographic distributions. This indicates that their ecology could be complex. On the other hand, the biomineral (calcareous) shells of planktic foraminifers are widely used in geochemical analyses to estimate marine paleoenvironmental characteristics (i.e., temperature), because the shell chemical composition reflects ambient seawater conditions. Among the pelagic protists, planktic foraminifers are ideal study candidates to develop a combined approach of genetic, morphological, and geochemical methods, thus reflecting environmental and ecological characteristics. The present study precisely tested whether the DNA extraction process physically and chemically affects the shells of the planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber. We used a nondestructive method for analyzing physical changes (micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (MXCT) scanning) to compare specimens at the pre- and post-DNA extraction stages. Our results demonstrate that DNA extraction has no significant effect on shell density and thickness. We measured stable carbon and oxygen isotopes on the shell of each individual in a negative control or one of two DNA-extracted groups and detected no significant differences in isotopic values among the three groups. Moreover, we evaluated isotopic variations at the biological species level with regard to their ecological characteristics such as depth habitat, life stages, and symbionts. Thus, our examination of the physiochemical effects on biomineral shells through DNA extraction shows that morphological and isotopic analyses of foraminifers can be combined with genetic analysis. These analytical methods are applicable to other shell-forming protists and microorganisms. In this study, we developed a powerful analytical tool for use in ecological and environmental studies of modern and past oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2921940949,"Plasmodium falciparum severe malaria causes more than 400,000 deaths every year. One feature of P. falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (pRBC) leading to cerebral malaria (CM), the most dangerous form of severe malaria, is cytoadherence to endothelium and blockage of the brain microvasculature. Preventing ligand-receptor interactions involved in this process could inhibit pRBC sequestration and insurgence of severe disease whilst reversing existing cytoadherence could be a saving life adjunct therapy. Increasing evidence indicate the endothelial Rho signaling as a crucial player in malaria parasite cytoadherence. Therefore, we have used the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), an Escherichia coli protein able to modulate the activity of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, three subfamilies of the Rho GTPases family, to study interactions between infected erythrocytes and cerebral endothelium in co-culture models. The main results are that CNF1 not only prevents cytoadherence but, more importantly, induces the detachment of pRBCs from endothelia monolayers. We first observed that CNF1 does affect neither parasite growth, nor the morphology and concentration of knobs that characterize the parasitized erythrocyte surface, as viewed by scanning electron microscopy. On the other hand, flow cytometry experiments show that cytoadherence reversion induced by CNF1 occurs in parallel with a decreased ICAM-1 receptor expression on the cell surface, suggesting the involvement of a toxin-promoted endocytic activity in such a response. Furthermore, since the endothelial barrier functionality is compromised by P. falciparum, we conducted a permeability assay on endothelial cells, revealing the CNF1 capacity to restore the brain endothelial barrier integrity. Then, using pull-down assays and inhibitory studies, we demonstrated, for the first time, that CNF1 is able not only to prevent but also to cause the parasite detachment by simultaneously activating Rho, Rac and Cdc42 in endothelial cells. All in all our findings indicate that CNF1 may represent a potential novel therapeutic strategy for preventing neurological complications of CM."
https://openalex.org/W2922046654,"Present knowledge of attention and awareness centres on deficits in patients with right brain damage who show severe forms of inattention to the left, called spatial neglect. Yet the functions that are lost in neglect are poorly understood. In healthy people, they might produce ""pseudoneglect""-subtle biases to the left found in various tests that could complement the leftward deficits in neglect. But pseudoneglect measures are poorly correlated. Thus, it is unclear whether they reflect anything but distinct surface features of the tests. To probe for a common mechanism, here we asked whether visual noise, known to increase leftward biases in the grating-scales task, has comparable effects on other measures of pseudoneglect. We measured biases using three perceptual tasks that require judgments about size (landmark task), luminance (greyscales task) and spatial frequency (grating-scales task), as well as two visual search tasks that permitted serial and parallel search or parallel search alone. In each task, we randomly selected pixels of the stimuli and set them to random luminance values, much like a poor TV signal. We found that participants biased their perceptual judgments more to the left with increasing levels of noise, regardless of task. Also, noise amplified the difference between long and short lines in the landmark task. In contrast, biases during visual searches were not influenced by noise. Our data provide crucial evidence that different measures of perceptual pseudoneglect, but not exploratory pseudoneglect, share a common mechanism. It can be speculated that this common mechanism feeds into specific, right-dominant processes of global awareness involved in the integration of visual information across the two hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W2921225504,"Recent research has demonstrated that small heat shock protein (sHsp) phosphorylation plays a variety of roles in neural cells. While the phosphorylation of serine 16 (Ser16) is blocked, Hsp20 no longer has neuroprotective effects. To further investigate the mechanism underlying this process, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was used with human SH-SY5Y cells and mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells. When SH-SY5Y and N2a cells were transfected with pEGFP-Hsp20(WT), pEGFP-Hsp20(S16A), and pEGFP-Hsp20(S16D) plasmids, the Golgi apparatus (GA) became more swollen and scattered, and many small fragments formed in the MOCK and S16A groups after OGD/R (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network was reduced, and the lamellar structure increased. However, these changes were not as obvious in the WT and S16D groups. Additionally, after OGD/R, Golgi Stress related protein contents were increased in the WT and S16D groups compared with the MOCK and S16A groups (P < 0.05). However, ER Stress related protein contents were decreased in the WT and S16D groups compared with the MOCK and S16A groups (P < 0.05). Our study demonstrates that Hsp20 phosphorylation on Ser16 protects against not only OGD/R-induced GA fragmentation in SH-SY5Y cells and N2a cells via Golgi stress but also OGD/R-induced ER structural changes in SH-SY5Y cells via ER stress. These findings suggest that Hsp20 is a potential drug target for ischemia stroke treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2922422169,"Gender disparity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields is an on-going challenge. Gender bias is one of the possible mechanisms leading to such disparities and has been extensively studied. Previous work showed that there was a gender bias in how students perceived the competence of their peers in undergraduate biology courses. We examined whether there was a similar gender bias in a mechanical engineering course. We conducted the study in two offerings of the course, which used different instructional practices. We found no gender bias in peer perceptions of competence in either of the offerings. However, we did see that the offerings' different instructional practices affected aspects of classroom climate, including: the number of peers who were perceived to be particularly knowledgeable, the richness of the associated network of connections between students, students' familiarity with each other, and their perceptions about the course environment. These results suggest that negative bias against female students in peer perception is not universal, either across institutions or across STEM fields, and that instructional methods may have an impact on classroom climate."
https://openalex.org/W2920830160,"Spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster is characterized by a specific transcriptional program during the spermatocyte stage. Transcription of thousands of genes is regulated by the interaction of several proteins or complexes, including a tTAF-containing TFIID variant, tMAC, Mediator, and chromatin interactors, e.g., bromodomain proteins. We addressed how distinct subsets of target genes are selected. We characterized the highly similar proteins tPlus3a and tPlus3b, which contain a Plus3 domain and are enriched in the testis, mainly in spermatocytes. In tPlus3a and tplus3b deletion mutants generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, fertility was severely reduced and sperm showed defects during individualization. tPlus3a and tPlus3b heterodimerized with the bromodomain protein tBRD-1. To elucidate the role of the tPlus3a and tPlus3b proteins in transcriptional regulation, we determined the transcriptomes of tplus3a-tplus3b and tbrd-1 deletion mutants using next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and compared them to that of the wild-type. tPlus3a and tPlus3b positively or negatively regulated the expression of nearly 400 genes; tBRD-1 regulated 1,500 genes. Nearly 200 genes were regulated by both tPlus3a and tPlus3b and tBRD-1. tPlus3a and tPlus3b activated the Y-chromosomal genes kl-3 and kl-5, which indicates that tPlus3a and tPlus3b proteins are required for the function of distinct classes of genes. tPlus3a and tPlus3b and tBRD-1 repress genes relevant for seminal fluid and heat shock. We hypothesize that tPlus3a and tPlus3b proteins are required to specify the general transcriptional program in spermatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2921581996,"The 14-3-3 proteins are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of neuronal damage during infectious meningitis and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Little is known about dynamic changes in the individual isoforms in response to parasitic eosinophilic meningitis. The purposes of this study were to determine the 14-3-3 protein isoform patterns, examine the kinetics and correlate the severity of blood brain barrier (BBB) damage with the expressions of these markers in mice with eosinophilic meningitis. Mice were orally infected with 50 A. cantonensis L3 via an oro-gastric tube and sacrificed every week for 3 consecutive weeks after infection. The Evans blue method and BBB junctional protein expressions were used to measure changes in the BBB. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to analyze pathological changes in the mice brains following 1-3 weeks of infection with A. cantonensis. The levels of 14-3-3 protein isoforms in serum/CSF and brain homogenates were analyzed by Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to explore the different isoform distributions of 14-3-3 proteins and changes in BBB junctional proteins in the mice brain meninges. Dexamethasone was injected intraperitoneally from the seventh day post infection (dpi) until the end of the study (21 dpi) to study the changes in BBB junctional proteins. The amounts of Evans blue, tight junction and 14-3-3 protein isoforms in the different groups of mice were compared using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. There were significant increases in 14-3-3 protein isoforms β and γ in the CSF in the second and third weeks after infection compared to the controls and first week of infection, which were correlated with the severity of BBB damage in brain histology, and Evans blue extravasation. Using IHC to assess the distribution of 14-3-3 protein isoforms and changes in BBB junctional proteins in the mice brain meninges, the expressions of isoforms β, γ, ε, and θ and junctional proteins occludin and claudin-5 in the brain meninges increased over a 3-week period after infection compared to the controls and 1 week after infection. The administration of dexamethasone decreased the expressions of BBB junctional proteins occludin and claudin-5 in the mice brain meninges. Our findings support that 14-3-3 proteins β and γ can potentially be used as a CSF marker of neuronal damage in parasitic eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis."
https://openalex.org/W2922431404,"It has been reported that donor age affects patient outcomes after liver transplantation, and that telomere length is associated with age. However, to our knowledge, the impact of donor age and donor liver telomere length in liver transplantation has not been well investigated. This study aimed to clarify the influence of the length of telomere and G-tail from donor livers on the outcomes of living donors and recipients after living donor liver transplantation. The length of telomere and G-tail derived from blood samples and liver tissues of 55 living donors, measured using the hybridization protection assay. The length of telomeres from blood samples was inversely correlated with ages, whereas G-tail length from blood samples and telomere and G-tail lengths from liver tissues were not correlated with ages. Age, telomere, and G-tail length from blood did not affect postoperative liver failure and early liver regeneration of donors. On the other hand, the longer the liver telomere, the poorer the liver regeneration tended to be, especially with significant difference in donor who underwent right hemihepatectomy. We found that the survival rate of recipients who received liver graft with longer telomeres was inferior to that of those who received liver graft with shorter ones. An elderly donor, longer liver telomere, and higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score were identified as independent risk factors for recipient survival after transplantation. In conclusion, telomere shortening in healthy liver does not correlate with age, whereas longer liver telomeres negatively influence donor liver regeneration and recipient survival after living donor liver transplantation. These results can direct future studies and investigations on telomere shortening in the clinical and experimental transplant setting."
