https://openalex.org/W3015750969,"Introduction An Australian case series study demonstrated the effectiveness of the REsilience and Activities for every DaY for people with multiple sclerosis (READY for MS), a resilience group training program based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, in improving quality of life in people with MS. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Italian READY for MS program, and to preliminary assess its efficacy when compared to an active control intervention (group relaxation). Methods Single-blind phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) and nested qualitative study (ISRCTN registration number: 38971970). Health-related quality of life (primary study outcome), mood, resilience, psychological flexibility and its protective factors were measured at baseline, after seven, 12 and 24 weeks. READY participants completed the purpose-built satisfaction questionnaire after 12 weeks. After trial completion, the control group also received READY. One-to-one participant interviews were conducted within three months of finishing the READY groups. Results Four intervention groups were conducted with 39 participants (20 READY, 19 relaxation). Two patients (READY) withdrew before beginning the intervention due to unexpected work commitments. Feasibility and acceptability of READY were good, with high participant engagement and satisfaction. No statistical effects of READY were detected vs relaxation. Thirty participants were interviewed (18 READY; 12 relaxation + READY). Content data analysis revealed seven overarching themes: “Attitudes towards participation”; “Perceptions of program composition”; “Program impacts on life domains”; “Program active elements”; “Program improvement trajectories”; “Program differences and similarities”; “Suggested READY improvements”. Conclusion READY was well accepted by MS patients with varied socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Qualitative (but not quantitative) data provided evidence in favour of READY. Our findings will inform methodological and intervention refinements for the multi-centre RCT that will follow."
https://openalex.org/W3015826015,"Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease with its prevalence being described since the 15th century. Although its etiological agent and also the treatment measures are widely known, syphilis is still a great public health problem worldwide, mainly in countries with limited resources associated to low investments in health primary care. The aim of the present study was to analyze the trend and regional distribution of syphilis in Brazil between 2007 and 2017. This is an ecological study using secondary data from the Brazilian notification system. The Ministry of Health selected 100 municipalities which presented the worse outcomes related to syphilis from the 5,570 Brazilian municipalities as a target for a comprehensive project in order to tackle the prevalence of syphilis, called the ""No Syphilis Project"". These priority municipalities represent 57.7% of syphilis cases and about one third of the Brazilian population. They were compared with other 189 non-priority municipalities with more than 100 thousand inhabitants among the Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Center-West). Polynomial regression methods and Joinpoint analyses were used to analyze the trend, from which the Annual Average Percent Change (AACP) for each time period was calculated. There was a significant growth trend in all regions for the main three forms of syphilis (in pregnancy, congenital and acquired), especially in the South. The ratio between syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis increased in both priority (AAPC: 8.54%; p<0.001) and non-priority municipalities (AAPC: 2.61%; p = 0.005), as well as in the regions, except the Center-West. High growth trends in syphilis prevalence were found in all municipalities, as well as all five regions between 2007 and 2017, showing that the challenge to reduce or even eliminate syphilis in Brazil is still difficult."
https://openalex.org/W3016097973,"The monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) are a subset of dendritic cells widely used in immunological studies as a convenient and easy approach after isolation of mononuclear cells directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Both the purification and cell culture of monocytes impact on the differentiation of monocytes into moDCs. The methodology to isolate and differentiate monocytes into moDCs is still controversial. We aimed to compare three different protocols for monocyte isolation from PBMC: 1) Cold-aggregation; 2) Percoll gradient; and 3) Magnetic beads cell-enrichment. Additionally we also compared four different monocyte differentiation and culture techniques: 1) Cell culture media; 2) Serum sources; 3) required GM-CSF and IL-4 concentrations; 4) Cell culture systems. We used flow cytometry analysis of light scattering and/or expression of pan surface markers, such as CD3, CD14 and CD209 to determine isolation/differentiation degree. Purified PBMC followed by two steps of cold aggregation, yielded cell viability around 95% with poor monocyte enrichment (monocytes increase vs. lymphocytes reduction was not statistically significant, p>0.05). Conversely, monocyte isolation from PBMC with discontinuous Percoll gradient generated around 50% cell viability. Albeit, we observed a significant reduction (p≤0.05) of lymphocytes contaminants. The magnetic beads cell-enrichment yield cell viability higher than 95%, as high as a significant lymphocyte depletion (p≤0.005) when compared to all other techniques employed. The moDCs showed better differentiation based on increased CD209 expression, but lower CD14 levels, when cells were cultured in RPMI medium plus 500IU/mL of both GM-CSF and IL-4 in a semi-adherent fashion. Serum sources showed no influence on the culture performance. In conclusion, the magnetic beads cell-enrichment showed superior cell viability, indicating that this approach is a better choice to isolate monocytes, and moDCs cultured afterwards in appropriate medium, serum, cytokines and culture system might influence the monocytes differentiation into moDC."
https://openalex.org/W3015250385,"Background Knowledge about the health impacts of the absence of health insurance for migrants with precarious status (MPS) in Canada is scarce. MPS refer to immigrants with authorized but temporary legal status (i.e. temporary foreign workers, visitors, international students) and/or unauthorized status (out of legal status, i.e. undocumented). This is the first large empirical study that examines the social determinants of self-perceived health of MPS who are uninsured and residing in Montreal. Methods and findings Between June 2016 and September 2017, we performed a cross-sectional survey of uninsured migrants in Montreal, Quebec. Migrants without health insurance (18+) were sampled through venue-based recruitment, snowball strategy and media announcements. A questionnaire focusing on sociodemographic, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, social determinants, health needs and access to health care, and health self-perception was administered to 806 individuals: 54.1% were recruited in urban spaces and 45.9% in a health clinic. 53.9% were categorized as having temporary legal status in Canada and 46% were without authorized status. Regions of birth were: Asia (5.2%), Caribbean (13.8%), Europe (7.3%), Latin America (35.8%), Middle East (21%), Sub-Saharan Africa (15.8%) and the United States (1.1%). The median age was 37 years (range:18–87). The proportion of respondents reporting negative (bad/fair) self-perception of health was 44.8%: 36.1% among migrants with authorized legal status and 54.4% among those with unauthorized status (statistically significant difference; p<0.001). Factors associated with negative self-perceived health were assessed using logistic regression. Those who were more likely to perceive their health as negative were those: with no diploma/primary/secondary education (age-adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.49 [95% CI 1.53–4.07, p<0.001] or with a college diploma (AOR: 2.41 [95% CI 1.38–4.20, p = 0.002); whose family income met their needs not at all/a little (AOR: 6.22 [95% CI 1.62–23.85], p = 0.008) or met their needs fairly (AOR: 4.70 [95% CI 1.21–18.27], p = 0.025); with no one whom they could ask for money (AOR: 1.60 [95% CI 1.05–2.46], p = 0.03); with perception of racism (AOR: 1.58 [95% CI 1.01–2.48], p = 0.045); with a feeling of psychological distress (AOR: 2.17 [95% CI 1.36–3.45], p = 0.001); with unmet health care needs (AOR: 3.45 [95% CI 2.05–5.82], p<0.001); or with a health issue in the past 12 months (AOR: 3.44 [95% CI 1.79–6.61], p<0.001). Some variables that are associated with negative self-perceived health varied according to gender: region of birth, lower formal education, having a family income that does not meet needs perfectly /very well, insalubrious housing, not knowing someone who could be asked for money, and having ever received a medical diagnosis. Conclusions In our study, almost half of immigrants without health insurance perceived their health as negative, much higher than reports of negative self-perceived health in previous Canadian studies (8.5% among recent immigrants, 19.8% among long-term immigrants, and 10.6% among Canadian-born). Our study also suggests a high rate of unmet health care needs among migrants with precarious status, a situation that is correlated with poor self-perceived health. There is a need to put social policies in place to secure access to resources, health care and social services for all migrants, with or without authorized status."
https://openalex.org/W3015990373,"Women are known to be associated with a higher susceptibility to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In contrast, male PAH patients have a worse survival prognosis. In this study, we investigated whether the contribution of sex goes beyond the effects of sex hormones by comparing the ability of isolated male and female pulmonary endothelial cells to respire, proliferate and tolerate the stress. Mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) were isolated from the lungs of male and female 3-week old mice. Male MLEC showed an increased basal mitochondrial respiration rate, elevated maximal respiration, a significantly greater level of mitochondrial polarization, and a higher rate of proliferation. Exposure of cells to hypoxia (2% of O2 for 24 hours) induced a strong apoptotic response in female but not male MLEC. In contrast, treatment with mitochondrial respiratory Complex III inhibitor Antimycin A (AA, 50μM) mediated severe necrosis specifically in male MLEC, while female cells again responded primarily by apoptosis. The same effect with female cells responding to the stress by apoptosis and male cells responding by necrosis was confirmed in starved pulmonary endothelial cells isolated from human donors. Elevated necrosis seen in male cells was associated with a significant release of damage-associated alarmin, HMGB1. No stimuli induced a significant elevation of HMGB1 secretion in females. We conclude that male cells appear to be protected against mild stress conditions, such as hypoxia, possibly due to increased mitochondrial respiration. In contrast, they are more sensitive to impaired mitochondrial function, to which they respond by necrotic death. Necrosis in male vascular cells releases a significant amount of HMGB1 that could contribute to the pro-inflammatory phenotype known to be associated with the male gender."
https://openalex.org/W3015748496,"This study aims to discuss audiences' interaction and engagement with live streaming from a sociological perspective to investigate the different effects of information factors on audiences' real-time interactions. Based on the interaction ritual chains theory, a data crawler was written using Python to collect data on the Huajiao platform for 1090 groups from 480 video game live rooms and 610 talent show live rooms. The results show that audiences' commenting was mostly affected by the number of viewers, the gender of streamers, the number of likes, the number of gifts, and the duration of the live stream. Group comparison found that the effect of the number of viewers was significantly stronger in video game streaming, while the number of likes had a negative effect in video game streaming and a strong positive effect in live talent shows."
https://openalex.org/W3015541531,"Organic Amendments (OAs) has been used in agroecosystems to promote plant growth and control diseases caused by soilborne pathogens. However, the role of OAs chemistry and decomposition time on plant growth promotion and disease suppression is still poorly explored. In this work, we studied the effect of 14 OAs at four decomposition ages (3, 30, 100, and 300 days) on the plant-pathogen system Lactuca sativa-Rhizoctonia solani. OAs chemistry was characterized via 13C-CPMAS NMR spectroscopy as well as for standard chemical (i.e. N content, pH, EC) and biological parameters (i.e. phytotoxicity and R. solani proliferation bioassay). OAs have shown variable effects, ranging from inhibition to stimulation of Lactuca sativa and Lepidium sativum growth. We recorded that N rich OAs with high decomposability were conducive in the short-term, while converting suppressive in the long term (300 days). On the other hand, cellulose-rich OAs with high C/N ratio impaired L. sativa growth but were more consistent in providing protection from damping-off, although this property has significantly shifted during decomposition time. These results, for the first time, highlight a consistent trade-off between plant growth promotion and disease control capability of OAs. Finally, we found that OAs effects on growth promotion and disease protection can be hardly predictable based on the chemical characteristic, although N content and some 13C CPMAS NMR regions (alkyl C, methoxyl C, and carbonyl C) showed some significant correlations. Therefore, further investigations are needed to identify the mechanism(s) behind the observed suppressive and conducive effects and to identify OAs types and application timing that optimize plant productivity and disease suppression in different agro-ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3015803957,"Background The ColoREctal Wellbeing (CREW) study is the first study to prospectively recruit colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, carry out the baseline assessment pre-treatment and follow patients up over five years to delineate the impact of treatment on health and wellbeing. Methods CRC patients received questionnaires at baseline (pre-surgery), 3, 9, 15, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months. The primary outcome was Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors (QLACS); self-efficacy, mental health, social support, affect, socio-demographics, clinical and treatment characteristics were also assessed. Representativeness was evaluated. Predictors at baseline and at 24 months of subsequent worsened quality of life (QOL) were identified using multivariable regression models. Results A representative cohort of 1017 non-metastatic CRC patients were recruited from 29 UK cancer centres. Around one third did not return to pre-surgery levels of QOL five years after treatment. Baseline factors associated with worsened QOL included >2 comorbidities, neoadjuvant treatment, high negative affect and low levels of self-efficacy, social support and positive affect. Predictors at 24 months included older age, low positive affect, high negative affect, fatigue and poor cognitive functioning. Conclusions Some risk factors for poor outcome up to five years following CRC surgery, such as self-efficacy, social support and comorbidity management, are amenable to change. Assessment of these factors from diagnosis to identify those most likely to need support in their recovery is warranted. Early intervention has the potential to improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3015710186,"Walnut shell suture strength directly impacts the ability to maintain shell integrity during harvest and processing, susceptibility to insect damage and other contamination, and the proportion of kernel halves recovered during cracking. Suture strength is therefore an important breeding objective. Here, two methods of phenotyping this trait were investigated: 1) traditional, qualitative and rather subjective scoring on an interval scale by human observers, and; 2) quantitative and continuous measurements captured by a texturometer. The aim of this work was to increase the accuracy of suture strength phenotyping and to then apply two mapping approaches, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genome wide association (GWAS) models, in order to dissect the genetic basis of the walnut suture trait. Using data collected on trees within the UC Davis Walnut Improvement Program (n = 464), the genetic correlation between the texturometer method and qualitatively scored method was high (0.826). Narrow sense heritability calculated using quantitative measurements was 0.82. A major QTL for suture strength was detected on LG05, explaining 34% of the phenotypic variation; additionally, two minor QTLs were identified on LG01 and LG11. All three QTLs were confirmed with GWAS on corresponding chromosomes. The findings reported in this study are relevant for application towards a molecular breeding program in walnut."
https://openalex.org/W3016117695,"Software development outsourcing is becoming more and more famous because of the advantages like cost abatement, process enhancement, and coping with the scarcity of needed resources. Studies confirm that unfortunately a large proportion of the software development outsourcing projects fails to realize anticipated benefits. Investigations into the failures of such projects divulge that in several cases software development outsourcing projects are failed because of the issues that are associated with requirements engineering process. The objective of this study is the identification and the ranking of the commonly occurring issues of the requirements engineering process in the case of software development outsourcing. For this purpose, contemporary literature has been assessed rigorously, issues faced by practitioners have been identified and three questionnaire surveys have been organized by involving experienced software development outsourcing practitioners. The Delphi technique, cut-off value method and 50% rule have also been employed. The study explores 150 issues (129 issues from literature and 21 from industry) of requirements engineering process for software development outsourcing, groups the 150 issues into 7 identified categories and then extricates 43 customarily or commonly arising issues from the 150 issues. Founded on ‘frequency of occurrence’ the 43 customarily arising issues have been ranked with respect to respective categories (category-wise ranking) and with respect to all the categories (overall ranking). Categories of the customarily arising issues have also been ranked. The issues’ identification and ranking contribute to design proactive software project management plan for dealing with software development outsourcing failures and attaining conjectured benefits of the software development outsourcing."
https://openalex.org/W3015399614,"Individuals with severe mental illness have long been segregated from living in communities and participating in socio- cultural life. In recent years, owing to progressive legislations and declarations (in India and globally), there has been a growing movement towards promoting social inclusion and community participation, with emphasis on the need to develop alternative and inclusive care paradigms for persons with severe mental illness. However, transitions from inpatient care to community settings is a complex process involving implications at multiple levels involving diverse stakeholders such as mental health service users, care providers, local communities and policy makers. This article studies how the transition from a hospital setting to a community-based recovery model for personals with severe mental illness can be facilitated. It reflects on the innovative process of creating a Supported Housing model in South India, where 11 MH Service users transitioned from a psychiatric ECRC to independent living facilities. Experiences in various phases of the project development, including care provider- and community level responses and feedback were scrutinised to understand the strategies that were employed in enabling the transition. Qualitative methods (including in-depth interviews and naturalistic observations) were used with residents and staff members to explore the challenges they encountered in stabilizing the model, as well as the psychosocial benefits experienced by residents in the last phase. These were complemented with a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and WHO Quality of Life scale to compare baseline and post-assessment results and an increase of quality of life. Results display a significant reduction of psychiatric symptoms in patients (p< 0.5). It also describes the challenges encountered in the current context, and strategies that were used to respond and adapt the model to address these concerns effectively. Positive behavioural and psycho-emotional changes were observed amongst the residents, significant amongst those being enhanced in their mobility and participation. The article concludes by discussing the implications of this study for the development of innovative community-based models in wider contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3015697358,"A flavone luteolin has various health-promoting activities. Several studies reported that high dose of luteolin activates the Nrf2/ARE pathway in the liver. However, the effect of the low dose of luteolin that can be taken from a dietary meal on the Nrf2 activation remain unclear. It is expected that the flavonoid metabolism possesses a circadian rhythm, since nutritional metabolism processes daily cycle. In this study we investigated whether an administration affects the Nrf2 activation. ICR mice were orally administered 0.01–10 mg/kg body weight of luteolin once a day for 7 days at two time-points: at the start of active phase (ZT12) or at that of inactive phase (ZT0). Luteolin increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, resulting in the increases in its target gene products HO-1 and NQO1 at ZT12 but not at ZT0. The expression level of Nrf2 was lower at ZT12 than at ZT0 in the liver. We also found that the level of luteolin aglycon in the plasma is higher at ZT12 than at ZT0. These results suggest that the low dose of luteolin can activate Nrf2 pathway and the aglycon form of luteolin may mainly contribute to activate the Nrf2 pathway at ZT12 in the liver."

However, the resistance nature of S. alba was not exploited generously due to the unavailability of usable genome sequences in public databases. Therefore, the present study was conducted to assemble the first draft genome from raw whole genome shotgun sequences with annotation and develop simple sequence repeat markers for molecular genetics and marker-assisted breeding.The raw genome sequences had 96x coverage on the Illumina platform with 170 Gbp data. The developed assembly by SOAPdenovo2 has ~459 Mbp genome size covered in 403,423 contigs with an average size of 1138.04 bp. The assembly was BLASTX with Arabidopsis thaliana which showed 32.9% positive hits between both plants. The top hit species distribution analysis showed the highest similarity with A. thaliana. A total of 809,597 GO level annotations were recorded after BLASTX results, and 34,012 sequences were annotated with different enzyme codes grouped under seven classes. The gene prediction tool AUGUSTUS identified 113,107 probable genes with an average size of 684 bp. The biochemical pathway annotation assigned 16,119 potential genes to 152 KEGG maps and 1751 enzyme codes. The development of potential SSRs from the de-novo assembly yielded 70731 unique primer pairs. Out of 159 randomly selected SSR markers for validation, 149 successfully amplified in S. alba. However, 10 SSR markers did not amplify during the validation experiment.The annotated genome assembly with a large number of SSRs was developed in the present study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of S. alba genome assembly development, annotation, and SSRs mining to date. The data presented here will be a very important resource for future crop improvement programs, especially for resistant breeding."

We stratified patients into two groups according to their age (elderly [≥75 years old], n = 3,885; non-elderly, n = 13,458). We analyzed the effect of treatment modality and anti-vasospasm agents (fasudil hydrochloride, ozagrel sodium, cilostazol, statin, eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], and edaravone) on in-hospital poor outcomes (mRS 3-6 at discharge) and mortality using multivariable analysis.The elderly patients were more likely to be female, have impaired levels of consciousness and comorbidity, and less likely to be treated with clipping and anti-vasospasm agents, except for ozagrel sodium and statin. In-hospital mortality and poor outcomes were higher in the elderly (15.8% vs. 8.5%, 71.7% vs. 36.5%). Coiling was associated with higher mortality (odds ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.2-1.7) despite a lower proportion of poor outcomes (0.84, 0.75-0.94) in the non-elderly, in contrast to no effect on clinical outcomes in the elderly. A comparable effect of anti-vasospasm agents on mortality was observed between non-elderly and elderly for fasudil hydrochloride (non-elderly: 0.20, 0.17-0.24), statin (0.63, 0.50-0.79), ozagrel sodium (0.72, 0.60-0.86), and cilostazol (0.63, 0.51-0.77). Poor outcomes were inversely associated with fasudil hydrochloride (0.59, 0.51-0.68), statin (0.84, 0.75-0.94), and EPA (0.83, 0.72-0.94) use in the non-elderly. No effect of these agents on poor outcomes was observed in the elderly.In contrast to the non-elderly, no effect of treatment modality on clinical outcomes were observed in the elderly. A comparable effect of anti-vasospasm agents was observed on mortality, but not on functional outcomes, between the non-elderly and elderly."

Long, cold winters in the region make identifying successful cover crop species and management practices a challenge. Two experiments were conducted in Minnesota, USA from fall 2016 through spring 2019 to examine the effect of cover crops interseeded at four- to six-leaf collar (early-interseeded) and dent to physiological maturity (late-interseeded) on biomass and grain yield of maize. Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) were evaluated as monocultures and in mixtures with crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) and forage radish (Raphanus sativus L.). Differences in canopy cover and biomass of late-interseeded cover crops were observed at the southernmost location in 2018. Additional accumulated growing-degree days in fall 2018 did not translate into increased cover crop canopy coverage of late-interseeded cover crops. Differences in cover crop canopy cover and biomass of early-interseeded cover crops were observed by fall frost at all locations in 2017 and at the northernmost location in 2018. Cover crop canopy cover and biomass at termination before planting maize, soil moisture at maize planting as well as maize aboveground biomass and yield were not affected by spring cereal rye regrowth of cover crops late-interseeded the previous year. Similarly, early-interseeded cover crops did not affect maize aboveground biomass or yield. We attribute these results to limited cover crop growth. This highlights the potential of a variety of cover crop strategies interseeded into maize in the U.S. upper Midwest; however, efforts to fine-tuning cover crop management and weather conditions are needed to benefit from such practice."
https://openalex.org/W3016102906,"Background Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder, in which a female is partially or entirely missing one of the two X chromosomes, with a prevalence of 1:2500 live female births. The present study aims to identify a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature for TS patients with and without congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods Microarray platform interrogating 2549 miRNAs were used to detect the miRNA abundance levels in the blood of 33 TS patients and 14 age-matched healthy volunteer controls (HVs). The differentially abundant miRNAs between the two groups were further validated by RT-qPCR. Results We identified 60 differentially abundant miRNA in the blood of TS patients compared to HVs, from which, 41 and 19 miRNAs showed a higher and a lower abundance levels in TS patients compared to HVs, respectively. RT-qPCR confirmed the significantly higher abundance levels of eight miRNAs namely miR-374b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-340-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30e-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-5695, and miR-26b-5p in TS patients as compared with the HVs. The abundance level of miR-5695 was higher in TS patients displaying CHD as compared to TS patients without CHD (p = 0.0265; log2-fold change 1.99); whereas, the abundance level of miR-126-3p was lower in TS patients with congenital aortic valve disease (AVD) compared to TS patients without BAV (p = 0.0139, log2-fold change 1.52). The clinical feature statistics revealed that miR-126-3p had a significant correlation with sinotubular junction Z-score (r = 0.42; p = 0.0154). Conclusion The identified circulating miRNAs signature for TS patients with manifestations associated with cardiovascular diseases provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of TS that may guide the development of novel diagnostic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3015398550,"The domesticated horse has played a unique role in human history, serving not just as a source of animal protein, but also as a catalyst for long-distance migration and military conquest. As a result, the horse developed unique physiological adaptations to meet the demands of both their climatic environment and their relationship with man. Completed in 2009, the first domesticated horse reference genome assembly (EquCab 2.0) produced most of the publicly available genetic variations annotations in this species. Yet, there are around 400 geographically and physiologically diverse breeds of horse. To enrich the current collection of genetic variants in the horse, we sequenced whole genomes from six horses of six different breeds: an American Miniature, a Percheron, an Arabian, a Mangalarga Marchador, a Native Mongolian Chakouyi, and a Tennessee Walking Horse, and mapped them to EquCab3.0 genome. Aside from extreme contrasts in body size, these breeds originate from diverse global locations and each possess unique adaptive physiology. A total of 1.3 billion reads were generated for the six horses with coverage between 15x to 24x per horse. After applying rigorous filtration, we identified and functionally annotated 17,514,723 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and 1,923,693 Insertions/Deletions (INDELs), as well as an average of 1,540 Copy Number Variations (CNVs) and 3,321 Structural Variations (SVs) per horse. Our results revealed putative functional variants including genes associated with size variation like LCORL gene (found in all horses), ZFAT in the Arabian, American Miniature and Percheron horses and ANKRD1 in the Native Mongolian Chakouyi horse. We detected a copy number variation in the Latherin gene that may be the result of evolutionary selection impacting thermoregulation by sweating, an important component of athleticism and heat tolerance. The newly discovered variants were formatted into user-friendly browser tracks and will provide a foundational database for future studies of the genetic underpinnings of diverse phenotypes within the horse."

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Rickettsia helvetica in ticks collected from migratory birds in Norway. A total of 815 Ixodes ricinus ticks from 216 birds trapped at Lista Bird Observatory in southern Norway during spring and autumn migration in 2008 were analysed by real-time PCR. B. burgdorferi s. l. was the most prevalent pathogen, detected in 6.1% of the ticks. The prevalence of N. mikurensis, A. phagocytophilum and R. helvetica was 1.2%, 0.9% and 0.4% respectively. In addition, one sample (0.1%) was positive for B. miyamotoi. In total, 8.2% of the ticks were infected with at least one pathogen. Co-infection with B. burgdorferi s. l. and N. mikurensis or A. phagocytophilum was found in 6.0% of the infected ticks. Our results show that all the known major tick-borne bacterial pathogens in Norway are subject to transport by migratory birds, potentially allowing spread to new areas. Our study showed a surprisingly high number of samples with PCR inhibition (57%). These samples had been extracted using standard methodology (phenol-chloroform extraction). This illustrates the need for inhibition controls to determine true prevalence rates."

The complex mathematical analysis for facial point acquisition in three-dimensional models has made many craniofacial assessments laborious. Method This study investigates three-dimensional (3D) soft-tissue craniofacial variation, with relation to ethnicity, sex and age variables in British and Irish white Europeans. This utilizes a geometric morphometric approach on a subsampled dataset comprising 292 scans, taken from a Liverpool-York Head Model database. Shape variation and analysis of each variable are tested using 20 anchor anatomical landmarks and 480 sliding semi-landmarks. Results Significant ethnicity, sex, and age differences are observed for measurement covering major aspects of the craniofacial shape. The ethnicity shows subtle significant differences compared to sex and age; even though it presents the lowest classification accuracy. The magnitude of dimorphism in sex is revealed in the facial, nasal and crania measurement. Significant shape differences are also seen at each age group, with some distinct dimorphic features present in the age groups. Conclusions The patterns of shape variation show that white British individuals have a more rounded head shape, whereas white Irish individuals have a narrower head shape. White British persons also demonstrate higher classification accuracy. Regarding sex patterns, males are relatively larger than females, especially in the mouth and nasal regions. Females presented with higher classification accuracy than males. The differences in the chin, mouth, nose, crania, and forehead emerge from different growth rates between the groups. Classification accuracy is best for children and senior adult age groups."
https://openalex.org/W3015775000,"We evaluated the minimum inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and erythromycin toward 98 Bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from several types of fermented soybean foods manufactured in several districts of Korea. First, based on recent taxonomic standards for bacteria, the 98 strains were separated into 74 B. licheniformis strains and 24 B. paralicheniformis strains. Both species exhibited profiles of erythromycin resistance as an acquired characteristic. B. licheniformis strains exhibited acquired clindamycin resistance, while B. paralicheniformis strains showed unimodal clindamycin resistance, indicating an intrinsic characteristic. Comparative genomic analysis of five strains showing three different patterns of clindamycin and erythromycin resistance identified 23S rRNA (adenine 2058-N6)-dimethyltransferase gene ermC and spermidine acetyltransferase gene speG as candidates potentially involved in clindamycin resistance. Functional analysis of these genes using B. subtilis as a host showed that ermC contributes to cross-resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin, and speG confers resistance to clindamycin. ermC is located in the chromosomes of strains showing clindamycin and erythromycin resistance and no transposable element was identified in its flanking regions. The acquisition of ermC might be attributable to a homologous recombination. speG was identified in not only the five genome-analyzed strains but also eight strains randomly selected from the 98 test strains, and deletions in the structural gene or putative promoter region caused clindamycin sensitivity, which supports the finding that the clindamycin resistance of Bacillus species is an intrinsic property."

However, during a time-out, surgical participants are unable to review the patient’s charts due to their aseptic hands. To improve the conditions in surgical time-outs, we introduce a deep learning-based smart speaker to confirm the surgical information prior to cataract surgeries. This pilot study utilized the publicly available audio vocabulary dataset and recorded audio data published by the authors. The audio clips of the target words, such as left, right, cataract, phacoemulsification, and intraocular lens, were selected to determine and confirm surgical information in the time-out speech. A deep convolutional neural network model was trained and implemented in the smart speaker that was developed using a mini development board and commercial speakerphone. To validate our model in the consecutive speeches during time-outs, we generated 200 time-out speeches for cataract surgeries by randomly selecting the surgical statuses of the surgical participants. After the training process, the deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.3% for the validation dataset of short-word audio clips. Our deep learning-based smart speaker achieved an accuracy of 93.5% for the 200 time-out speeches. The surgical and procedural accuracy was 100%. Additionally, on validating the deep learning model by using web-generated time-out speeches and video clips for general surgery, the model exhibited a robust and good performance. In this pilot study, the proposed deep learning-based smart speaker was able to successfully confirm the surgical information during the time-out speech. Future studies should focus on collecting real-world time-out data and automatically connecting the device to electronic health records. Adopting smart speaker-assisted time-out phases will improve the patients’ safety during cataract surgeries, particularly in relation to wrong-site surgeries."

We achieved effective stage-specific differentiation of BrC patients from healthy controls with 82.3% specificity, 84.1% sensitivity, and 82.8% accuracy for stage 1 BrC and recognized hormone receptor-2 and lymph node invasion subtypes based on N-glycan profiles. Our novel technique supplements conventional diagnostic strategies for BrC detection and can be developed as an independent platform for BrC screening."
https://openalex.org/W3016138934,"Enrichment of omega-3 fatty acids (ɷ-3 FAs) in natural oils is important to realize their health benefits. Lipases are promising catalysts to perform this enrichment, however, fatty acid specificity of lipases is poor. We attempted to improve the fatty acid selectivity of a lipase from Geobacillus thermoleovorans (GTL) by two approaches. In a semi-rational approach, amino acid positions critical for binding were identified by docking the substrate to the GTL and best substitutes at these positions were identified by site saturation mutagenesis followed by screening to obtain a variant of GTL (CM-GTL). In the second approach based on rational design, a variant of GTL was designed (DM-GTL) wherein the active site was narrowed by incorporating two heavier amino acids in the lining of acyl-binding pocket to hinder access to bulky ɷ-3 FAs. The affinities DM-GTL with designed substrates were evaluated in silico. Both, CM-GTL and DM-GTL have shown excellent ability to discriminate against the ɷ-3 FAs during hydrolysis of oils. Engineering the binding pocket of an enzyme of a complex substrate, such as a triglyceride, by incorporating the information on substrate structure and computationally derived binding modes, has resulted in designing two efficient lipase variants with improved substrate selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3015420622,"To determine parental awareness of influenza vaccination recommendations for children and explore associations with awareness.Cross-sectional survey.South Australian parents with a telephone listing in the Electronic White Pages were randomly selected.Participants were interviewed using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) during May-July 2016. Univariable and multivariable analyses explored characteristics associated with awareness; with the survey data weighted to reflect the population of SA and the probability of selection within a household.Of 539 parents, 33% were aware of the recommendation that all children (<5 years) should receive the influenza vaccine annually with 51.9% aware that children with special risk medical conditions (SRMC) should also receive the vaccine annually. Characteristics strongly associated with parental awareness of the recommendation for children aged < 5 years were knowledge of recommendation for children with a SRMC (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 10.46, CI 4.44-24.63) or living in a metropolitan area (aOR 2.91, CI 1.19-7.09). There was lack of awareness in those not working (aOR 0.13, CI 0.04-0.47), with trade level education (compared with high school) (aOR 0.25 CI, 0.09-0.71) and in those born in the UK or Ireland (aOR 0.19, CI 0.04-0.85). Awareness of the recommendation for children with SRMC to receive the vaccine was strongly associated with knowledge of the influenza recommendation for children <5 years (aOR 10.22, CI 4.39-23.77) or not being born in Australia [UK/ Ireland (aOR 7.63, CI 1.86-31.31); other (aOR 3.93, CI 0.94-16.42)]. The most influential cues to future receipt were a general practitioner (GP) recommendation (63.8%) and providing influenza vaccine free for all children (37.6%). More parents who delayed or excluded vaccines believed that their children's vaccinations (in general) were unnecessary, as other children were vaccinated (42.8%) compared to those with no or minor concerns (11.1%) (p<0.0001).Parental awareness of children's influenza vaccine recommendations is low. Targeted communication strategies and resources are required to establish broader community awareness of recommendations. Healthcare provider endorsement of the vaccine remains key and health care professionals, particularly GPs and paediatric specialists should be encouraged to discuss influenza vaccine with parents at every opportunity. Many parents have vaccine concerns and addressing concerns across the spectrum of hesitancy is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3015937072,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death globally and the leading cause of death by a single infectious pathogen. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the End TB Strategy, which targets a 90% reduction in the incidence rate by the year 2035 compared to the level in the year 2015. In this work, a TB model is considered to understand the transmission dynamics in the top three TB burden countries—India, China, and Indonesia. Country-specific epidemiological parameters were identified using data reported by the WHO. If India and Indonesia succeed in enhancing their treatment protocols and increase treatment and treatment success rate to that of China, the incidence rate could be reduced by 65.99% and 68.49%, respectively, by the end of 2035. Evidently, complementary interventions are essential to achieve the WHO target. Our analytical approach utilizes optimal control theory to obtain time-dependent nonpharmaceutical and latent case finding controls. The objective functional of the optimal control problem includes a payoff term reflecting the goal set by WHO. Appropriate combinations of control strategies are investigated. Based on the results, gradual enhancement and continuous implementation of intervention measures are recommended in each country."
https://openalex.org/W3015212806,"As active commuting levels continue to decline among primary schoolchildren, evidence about which built environmental characteristics influence walking or cycling to school remains inconclusive and is strongly context-dependent. This study aimed to identify the objective built environmental drivers of, and barriers to, active commuting to school for a multi-ethnic sample of 1,889 healthy primary schoolchildren (aged 5–11) in London, UK. Using cross-sectional multilevel ordered logistic regression modelling, supported by the spatial exploration of built environmental characteristics through cartography, the objective built environment was shown to be strongly implicated in children’s commuting behaviour. In line with earlier research, proximity to school emerged as the prime variable associated with the choice for active commuting. However, other elements of the urban form were also significantly associated with children’s use of active or passive modes of transport. High levels of accidents, crime and air pollution along the route to school were independently correlated with a lower likelihood of children walking or cycling to school. Higher average and minimum walkability and higher average densities of convenience stores along the way were independently linked to higher odds of active commuting. The significance of the relations for crime, air pollution and walkability disappeared in the fully-adjusted model including all built environmental variables. In contrast, relationships with proximity, traffic danger and the food environment were maintained in this comprehensive model. Black children, pupils with obesity, younger participants and those from high socioeconomic families were less likely to actively commute to school. There is thus a particular need to ensure that roads with high volumes of actively commuting children are kept safe and clean, and children’s exposure to unhealthy food options along the way is limited. Moreover, as short commuting distances are strongly correlated with walking or cycling, providing high-quality education near residential areas might incite active transport to school."

Methods National population-based survey data regarding FGM/C prevalence were applied to female migrants in the Netherlands who migrated from 29 countries with available nationally representative data on FGM/C. Results As of January 1st 2018, there were 95,588 female migrants residing in the Netherlands, originating from 29 countries with available nationally representative data on FGM/C. Our findings suggest that about 41,000 women had undergone FGM/C, of which 37% had Type III (infibulation). In total 4,190 girls are estimated to be at risk of FGM/C in the next 20 years, of whom 394 were first-generation girls. Conclusion These findings show the urgency to develop appropriate strategies and policies to prevent FGM/C, to protect girls and women at risk of the practice, and to provide adequate services and support for those affected by FGM/C in the Netherlands."
https://openalex.org/W3015838826,"Evans syndrome is defined by autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and immune thrombocytopenia occurring in the same patient. Although known to be rare the frequency and prognosis of Evans syndrome in children is unknown, and only few registry-based studies are available. The epidemiology and prognosis of Evans syndrome in patients above 13 years of age has recently been investigated. In this age group both incidence and prevalence of Evans syndrome increased during the study period and median survival was just 7.2 years. Using Danish health registries and the same approach, we identified 21 children below 13 years of age with Evans syndrome during 1981–2015. Patients with Evans syndrome were age–and sex matched with children both from the general population, and with patients with either autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or immune thrombocytopenia. The incidence of Evans syndrome ranged between 0.5 and 1.2/1,000,000 person-years. Prevalence was 6.7 and 19.3/1,000,000 in 1990 and 2015 respectively. Hazard ratio for death was 22 fold higher for children with ES compared to matched children from general population, and was also elevated compared to children with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or immune thrombocytopenia. We conclude that pediatric ES is very rare and associated with elevated mortality. However, despite the nationwide study and a long and complete follow-up, results are imprecise due to the rarity of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3015374802,"Objective In breast cancer patients, treatment at the end of life accounts for a major share of medical spending. However, little is known about the variability of cost trajectories between patients. This study aims to identify underlying latent groups of advanced breast cancer patients with similar cost trajectories over the last year before death. Methods Data from deceased advanced breast cancer patients, diagnosed between 2010 and 2017, were retrieved from the Southeast Netherlands Advanced Breast Cancer (SONABRE) Registry. Costs of hospital care over the last twelve months before death were analyzed, and the variability of longitudinal patterns between patients were explored using group-based trajectory modeling. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were applied to investigate differences between the identified latent groups. Results We included 558 patients. Over the last twelve months before death, mean hospital costs were €2,255 (SD = €492) per month. Costs increased over the last five months and reached a maximum of €3,614 in the last month of life, driven by hospital admissions, while spending for medication declined over the last three months of life. Based on patients’ individual cost trajectories, we identified six latent groups with distinct longitudinal patterns, of which only two showed a marked increase in costs over the last twelve months before death. Latent groups were constituted of heterogeneous patients, and clinical characteristics explained membership only to a limited extent. Conclusions The average costs of advanced breast cancer patients increased towards the end of life. However, we uncovered several latent groups of patients with divergent cost trajectories, which did not reflect the overall increasing trend. The mechanisms underlying the variability in cost trajectories warrants further research."
https://openalex.org/W3016092687,"Prohormone convertases (PCs) are subtilisin-like proteases responsible for the intracellular processing of prohormones and proneuropeptides in vertebrates and invertebrates. The full-length PC2 cDNA sequence was cloned from pleuropedal ganglion of Haliotis discus hannai, consisted of 2254-bp with an open reading frame of 1989-bp and encoded a protein of 662 amino acid residues. The architecture of Hdh PC2 displayed key features of PCs, including a signal peptide, a pro-segment domain with sites for autocatalytic activation, a catalytic domain, and a pro-protein domain (P-domain). It shares the highest homology of its amino acid sequence with the PC2 from H. asinina and to lesser extent with that of Homo sapiens and Rana catesbeiana PC2. Sequence alignment analysis indicated that Hdh PC2 was highly conserved in the catalytic domain, including a catalytic triad of serine proteinases of the subtilisin family at positions Asp-195, His-236, and Ser-412. The cloned sequence contained a canonical integrin binding sequence, and four cysteine residues involved in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide link. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Hdh PC2 is robustly clustered with the Has PC2. Quantitative PCR assay demonstrated that the Hdh PC2 was predominantly expressed in the pleuropedal ganglion rather than in other examined tissues. Although PC2 mRNA was expressed throughout the gametogenetic cycle of male and female abalone, the expression level was significantly higher in the ripening stage of female abalone. Also, a significantly higher expression was observed in the pleuropedal ganglion and gonadal tissues at a higher effective accumulative temperature (1000°C). In situ hybridization revealed that the PC2 mRNA expressing neurosecretory cells were distributed in the cortex region of the pleuropedal ganglion. According to the results, it can be concluded that pleuropedal ganglion is the highest site of PC2 activity, and this enzyme might be involved in the abalone reproduction process."
https://openalex.org/W3015273478,"In Hong Kong, there is a cattle population of ~1,200 individuals of uncertain origin and genetic diversity. This population shows heterogeneous morphology, both in body type and pigmentation. Once used as draught animals by the local farmers, they were abandoned around the 1970s due to changes in the economy, and since then have lived as feral populations. To explore the origins of these cattle, we analysed ~50k genotype data of 21 Hong Kong feral cattle, along with data from 703 individuals of 36 cattle populations of European, African taurine, and Asian origin, the wild x domestic hybrid gayal, plus two wild bovine species, gaur and banteng. To reduce the effect of ascertainment bias ~4k loci that are polymorphic in the two wild species were selected for further analysis. The stringent SNP selection we applied resulted in increased heterozygosity across all populations studies, compared with the full panel of SNP, thus reducing the impact of ascertainment bias and facilitating the comparison of divergent breeds of cattle. Our results showed that Hong Kong feral cattle have relatively high levels of genetic distinctiveness, possibly due to the low level of artificial selection, and a likely common ancestry with wild species. We found signs of a putative taurine introgression, probably dating to the import of north European breeds during the British colonialism of Hong Kong. We showed that Hong Kong feral cattle, are distinct from Bos taurus and Bos indicus breeds. Our results highlight the distinctiveness of Hong Kong feral cattle and stress the conservation value of this indigenous breed that is likely to harbour adaptive genetic variation, which is a fundamental livestock resource in the face of climate change and diversifying market demands."
https://openalex.org/W3015648757,"Various injuries to the neural tissues can cause irreversible damage to multiple functions of the nervous system ranging from motor control to cognitive function. The limited treatment options available for patients have led to extensive interest in studying the mechanisms of neuronal regeneration and recovery from injury. Since many neurons are terminally differentiated, by increasing cell survival following injury it may be possible to minimize the impact of these injuries and provide translational potential for treatment of neuronal diseases. While several cell types are known to survive injury through plasma membrane repair mechanisms, there has been little investigation of membrane repair in neurons and even fewer efforts to target membrane repair as a therapy in neurons. Studies from our laboratory group and others demonstrated that mitsugumin 53 (MG53), a muscle-enriched tripartite motif (TRIM) family protein also known as TRIM72, is an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) can be applied exogenously to increase membrane repair capacity both in vitro and in vivo. Increasing the membrane repair capacity of neurons could potentially minimize the death of these cells and affect the progression of various neuronal diseases. In this study we assess the therapeutic potential of rhMG53 to increase membrane repair in cultured neurons and in an in vivo mouse model of neurotrauma. We found that a robust repair response exists in various neuronal cells and that rhMG53 can increase neuronal membrane repair both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide direct evidence of conserved membrane repair responses in neurons and that these repair mechanisms can be targeted as a potential therapeutic approach for neuronal injury."

The abundances of nine ARGs belonging to four commonly used antibiotic classes (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and multidrug) and class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) were quantified. Sulfonamides gene (sulI) accounted for the highest percentage of detected ARGs in most sampling sites, including in water, biofilm, and sediment. Among the resistance genes, IntI1 and sul1 were significantly correlated (r>0.800, p<0.01) with a fecal coliform (FC) detected in the biofilm, and there was also a significantly positive correlation between the abundances of 16SrRNA and intI1 in the biofilms. Compared with the sediment and water samples, the biofilms contained sufficient nutrients to promote bacterial reproduction. Under sufficient total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, the horizontal gene transfer due to intI1 plays a key role in the formation and migration of ARGs within biofilms."

https://openalex.org/W3015214878,"Variation of information in the firing rate of neural population, as reflected in different frequency bands of electroencephalographic (EEG) time series, provides direct evidence for change in neural responses of the brain to hypnotic suggestibility. However, realization of an effective biomarker for spiking behaviour of neural population proves to be an elusive subject matter with its impact evident in highly contrasting results in the literature. In this article, we took an information-theoretic stance on analysis of the EEG time series of the brain activity during hypnotic suggestions, thereby capturing the variability in pattern of brain neural activity in terms of its information content. For this purpose, we utilized differential entropy (DE, i.e., the average information content in a continuous time series) of theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands of fourteen-channel EEG time series recordings that pertain to the brain neural responses of twelve carefully selected high and low hypnotically suggestible individuals. Our results show that the higher hypnotic suggestibility is associated with a significantly lower variability in information content of theta, alpha, and beta frequencies. Moreover, they indicate that such a lower variability is accompanied by a significantly higher functional connectivity (FC, a measure of spatiotemporal synchronization) in the parietal and the parieto-occipital regions in the case of theta and alpha frequency bands and a non-significantly lower FC in the central region's beta frequency band. Our results contribute to the field in two ways. First, they identify the applicability of DE as a unifying measure to reproduce the similar observations that are separately reported through adaptation of different hypnotic biomarkers in the literature. Second, they extend these previous findings that were based on neutral hypnosis (i.e., a hypnotic procedure that involves no specific suggestions other than those for becoming hypnotized) to the case of hypnotic suggestions, thereby identifying their presence as a potential signature of hypnotic experience."

However, there still is a lack of consensus and clear indication on use of allograft augmentation. Therefore, this study aims to investigate outcome after osteosynthesis with and without allograft augmentation. It focuses on bone density results obtained by DEXA as potential examination that might help decision-making.This study included patients aged 65 years and older that were treated at one Level 1 trauma center between 2007 and 2018. Inclusion criteria: Proximal humerus fracture treated with or without allograft, conclusive data-sets. Exclusion criteria: prior surgical treatment of the proximal humerus, open fracture with bone loss, neurological damage. Patients were stratified according to the use of allograft augmentation in two groups: Group NA (no allograft augmented PHILOS) and Group A (PHILOS with allograft augmentation). Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Fractures were graded according to the classification by Neer. Radiographic union was analyzed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and at year follow up. Complications include surgical site infection, implant failure, humeral head necrosis, or delayed union. Allograft was used in cases of 1inch/3cm3 bone-loss or an egg-shell situation, where the patient refused arthroplasty.This study included 167 patients, with 143 (85%) in the Group NA, and 24 (15%) in the Group A. There were no significant differences in age, gender, injury distribution, and distribution of Neer classification or CCI. Patients in Group A had significantly lower T-scores preoperatively (-2.87 ± 1.08 versus -0.9 ± 2.12, p = 0.003). No difference occurred in any of the complications. At one-year follow-up, the range of motion was comparable in both groups.In patients with allograft augmentation and severe osteopenia, similar clinical and radiological results were obtained when compared with patients with better preoperative bone density scores (T-scores, DEXA). In view of a lack of guidelines indicating the indication for the use of allograft, this difference may be worth further study."
https://openalex.org/W3015914967,"Information on the spatial ecology of reef sharks is critical to understanding life-history patterns, yet gaps remain in our knowledge of how these species move and occupy space. Previous studies have focused on offshore reefs and atolls with little information available on the movement and space use of sharks utilising reef habitats closer to shore. Cross-shelf differences in physical and biological properties of reefs can alter regional ecosystem processes resulting in different movement patterns for resident sharks. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to examine residency, space use and depth use of 40 blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, on an inshore reef in Queensland, Australia, and assess temporal or biological influences. All sharks showed strong site-attachment to inshore reefs with residency highest among adult females. Sharks exhibited a sex-based, seasonal pattern in space use where males moved more, occupied more space and explored new areas during the reproductive season, while females utilised the same amount of space throughout the year, but shifted the location of the space used. A positive relationship was also observed between space use and size. There was evidence of seasonal site fidelity and long-distance movement with the coordinated, annual migration of two adult males to the study site during the mating season. Depth use was segregated with some small sharks occupying shallower depths than adults throughout the day and year, most likely as refuge from predation. Results highlight the importance of inshore reef habitats to blacktip reef sharks and provide evidence of connectivity with offshore reefs, at least for adult males."
https://openalex.org/W3015507760,"Compensatory behaviour is regarded as a helpful strategy to mediate drivers’ deteriorated hazard perception ability due to visual field defects. However, helpfulness of compensatory behaviour for drivers with advanced visual field defects has largely unexplored. This study aims to clarify the effectiveness and limitation of compensatory head movements in critical situations where included pedestrians stepping off a sidewalk under the simulation of advanced visual defects. 18 healthy-sighted drivers participated the data collection that was conducted in a driving simulator under three driving conditions: (1) without visual impairment, (2) with visual impairment and not performing active compensation, and (3) with visual impairment but performing active compensation. The result showed that active compensation led quick accelerator and brake response times, reducing the risk and number of pedestrian collisions. The active compensation led a decrease in the number of non-responses to hazardous pedestrians compared to while driving not performing compensation. However, the compensation could not reduce the number of pedestrian collisions to those of healthy-sighted drivers. Compensatory viewing behaviour contributed to improved driving performance as well as has limits to lead driving performance like healthy-sighted drivers. Developing driver assistance systems and practical compensatory strategies concerning the degrees of impairment and traffic conditions may provide opportunities to improve driving safety deteriorated hazard perception for visually impaired drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3015993830,"The target species (Aphia minuta and Pseudaphya ferreri) of the transparent goby fishery on Mallorca Island (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean) are currently discarded when the maximum daily catch is exceeded or when the sorting process is unworkable. The mortality suffered by this discarded fraction remains unknown, although it may be important for resource management. Accordingly, the aims of this study were to (1) assess the environmental drivers of the relative post-release survival of the discarded target species and (2) test the correlations between post-release survival and two behavior-related variables (swimming speed and its increase after a stimulus, assessed via video recording). To do so, mortality of the target species from 47 hauls sampled under normal fishing boat operations was monitored when the gear was onboard and after a few hours. At the reference level (an average depth of 25.7 m and temperature of 15.7 ºC), the immediate survival was 99.9% (95% CI: 97.9 to 100%), but the estimated post-release survival decreased to 47.2% (33.8 to 65.8%). Relative post-release mortality doubled when the water temperature increased by 2.8 ºC or when the fishing depth increased up to 32 m. Furthermore, the swimming speed of the target species was significantly correlated with the estimated post-release survival; thus, this vitality metric may offer a promising strategy for more easily estimating post-release mortality in other fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W3016038574,"Advances in surgical techniques have improved clinical outcomes and decreased complications. At the same time, heightened attention to care quality has resulted in increased identification of hospital-acquired adverse events. We evaluated these divergent effects on the reported safety of lung cancer resection.We analyzed hospital-acquired adverse events in patients undergoing lung cancer resection using the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) database from 2001-2010. Demographics, diagnoses, and procedures data were abstracted using ICD-9 codes. We used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) to identify hospital-acquired adverse events. Weighted analyses were performed using t-tests and chi-square.A total of 302,444 hospitalizations for lung cancer resection and were included in the analysis. Incidence of PSI increased over time (28% in 2001-2002 vs 34% in 2009-2010; P<0.001). Those with one or more PSI had increased in-hospital mortality (aOR = 11.1; 95% CI, 4.7-26.1; P<0.001) and prolonged hospitalization (12.5 vs 7.8 days; P<0.001). However, among those with PSI, in-hospital mortality decreased over time, from 17% in 2001-2002 to 2% in 2009-2010.In a recent ten-year period, documented rates of adverse events associated with lung cancer resection increased. Despite this increase in safety events, we observed that mortality decreased. Because such metrics may be incorporated into hospital rankings and reimbursement considerations, adverse event coding consistency and content merit further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3016126864,"Connexin 43 (Cx43) may be important in cell death and survival due to cell-to-cell communication-independent mechanisms. In our previous study, we found that small G protein signaling modulator 3 (SGSM3), a partner of Cx43, contributes to myocardial infarction (MI) in rat hearts. Based on these previous results, we hypothesized that SGSM3 could also play a role in bone marrow-derived rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate into cardiomyocytes and/or cells with comparable phenotypes under low oxygen conditions. Cx43 and Cx43-related factor expression profiles were compared between normoxic and hypoxic conditions according to exposure time, and Sgsm3 gene knockdown (KD) using siRNA transfection was performed to validate the interaction between SGSM3 and Cx43 and to determine the roles of SGSM3 in rat MSCs. We identified that SGSM3 interacts with Cx43 in MSCs under different oxygen conditions and that Sgsm3 knockdown inhibits apoptosis and cardiomyocyte differentiation under hypoxic stress. SGSM3/Sgsm3 probably has an effect on MSC survival and thus therapeutic potential in diseased hearts, but SGSM3 may worsen the development of MSC-based therapeutic approaches in regenerative medicine. This study was performed to help us better understand the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, as well as provide data that could be used pharmacologically."
https://openalex.org/W3016161246,"Background Breastfeeding has clear benefits. Yet, breastfeeding practices fall short of recommendations in low-income populations including participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). To promote breastfeeding, it is important to understand breastfeeding-related behaviors such as initiation and maintenance within the context of a complex societal system. For individual women, making choices about infant feeding (whether to breastfeed or formula-feed a newborn, or when to stop breastfeeding) is a dynamic process involving interactions with health professionals, family, peers and workplaces. Integrating behavioral change theories with systems science tools such as agent-based modeling can help illuminate patterns of breastfeeding behaviors, identify key factors affecting breastfeeding behaviors within this complex dynamic system, and estimate the population impact of hypothetical interventions. Methods An agent-based model (ABM) was developed to investigate the influences of multiple levels of factors affecting breastfeeding behaviors among WIC participants. Health behavioral change theories were applied and stakeholder input obtained to improve the model, particularly during the conceptual design and model specification steps. The model was then used to identify critical points for intervention and assess the effects of five common interventions (improving knowledge through education, implementing Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative practices, providing postpartum breastfeeding counselling, strengthening partner support, and fostering supportive workplace environments.) Results The ABM developed in this study produced outcomes (i.e., breastfeeding rates) that were concordant with empirical data. Increasing the coverage of the five selected interventions produced various levels of improvement in breastfeeding practices in the target population. Specifically, improving breastfeeding knowledge had a positive impact on women’s intent to breastfeed, while increasing the availability of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative improved breastfeeding initiation rates. However, neither of these two interventions showed a significant impact on breastfeeding maintenance, which was supported by postpartum breastfeeding counseling, partner support and a supportive workplace environment. These three intervention strategies each improved breastfeeding rates at 6 months from 55.6% to 57.1%, 59.5% and 59.3%, respectively. Increasing the coverage of multiple interventions simultaneously had a synergistic effect on breastfeeding maintenance with their effects being greater than the cumulative effects of increasing the coverage of these interventions individually. Conclusion The ABM we developed was helpful for understanding the dynamic process of decision-making regarding infant feeding modalities in a low-income population, and for evaluating the aggregated population-level impact of breastfeeding promotion interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3015716741,"To investigate the longitudinal findings of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in relation to the morphologic features in Rdh5 knockout (Rdh5-/-) mice.The mouse retina was segmented into four layers; the inner retinal (A), outer plexiform and outer nuclear (B), rod/cone (C), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid (D) layers. The thickness of each retinal layer of Rdh5-/- mice was longitudinally and quantitatively measured at six time points from postnatal months (PM) 1 to PM6 using SD-OCT. Age-matched C57BL/6J mice were employed as wild-type controls. The data were statistically compared using Student's t-test. The fundus appearance was assessed, histologic and ultrastructural examinations were performed in both groups.Layers A and B were significantly thinner in the Rdh5-/- mice than in the wild-type C57BL/6J mice during the observation periods. Layers C and D became thinner in the Rdh5-/- mice than in the wild-type mice after PM6. Although no abnormalities corresponding to whitish fundus dots were detected by SD-OCT or histologic examinations, the intracellular accumulation of low-density vacuoles was noted in the RPE of the Rdh5-/- mice by electron microscopy. The photoreceptor nuclei appeared less dense in the Rdh5-/- mice than in the wild-type mice.The results from the present study suggest that although it is difficult to detect qualitative abnormalities, SD-OCT can detect quantitative changes in photoreceptors even in the early stage of retinal degeneration induced by the Rdh5 gene mutation in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3015944373,"This paper introduces a new family of matrix variate distributions based on the mean-mixture of normal (MMN) models. The properties of the new matrix variate family, namely stochastic representation, moments and characteristic function, linear and quadratic forms as well as marginal and conditional distributions are investigated. Three special cases including the restricted skew-normal, exponentiated MMN and the mixed-Weibull MMN matrix variate distributions are presented and studied. Based on the specific presentation of the proposed model, an EM-type algorithm can be directly implemented for obtaining maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. The usefulness and practical utility of the proposed methodology are illustrated through two conducted simulation studies and through the Landsat satellite dataset analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3015990405,"We evaluated the characteristics of patients with diverticular bleeding in whom emergency endoscopy should be proactively performed and those in whom it is unnecessary for spontaneous hemostasis following conservative treatment.This study involved 132 patients in whom diverticular bleeding was diagnosed on lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. We evaluated the rate of identification of the bleeding diverticulum during endoscopy and the rate of spontaneous hemostasis following conservative treatment.In 26 patients (20%), bleeding diverticulum was identified during endoscopy. Extravasation or fluid collection on CT imaging was an important factor of successful identification of the bleeding source on endoscopy. Of the 104 patients in the conservative treatment group, 91 (87%) were able to be discharged after spontaneous hemostasis. Univariate analysis revealed a high rate of spontaneous hemostasis in patients without extravasation and fluid collection on CT imaging, those without adhesion of blood during endoscopy, those without diabetes, and those with a hemoglobin level ≥10 g/dL.In patients with colonic diverticular bleeding, extravasation or fluid collection on CT is an important factor related to the identification of the bleeding diverticulum. Patients without characteristic CT findings had a high rate of spontaneous hemostasis after conservative treatment.Diverticular bleeding is the most frequent cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding accounting for 20%-40% of all cases in Japan and 20%-48% of all those in the Western countries[1, 2]. The prevalence of colonic diverticula tends to increase with age; thus, the overall prevalence of diverticular bleeding is expected to increase in the future. In Japan, the Japanese Gastroenterological Association published guidelines on colonic diverticulitis in 2017; these guidelines recommend the performance of lower gastrointestinal endoscopic examination within 24 h in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding suspected to be diverticular bleeding[3]. It has been reported that, for patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, urgent endoscopy helps avoid embolotherapy, colectomy, massive blood transfusion, and repeat bleeding[1, 4, 5]. However, it is often difficult to identify the bleeding point [6]; further, there are many challenging cases wherein it is difficult to decide whether urgent endoscopy should be performed in situations where there is insufficient medical staff, such as during nighttime and on holidays. Bleeding is reported to stop spontaneously with conservative treatment alone in 70% of diverticular bleeding cases[7, 8]. In particular, when determining the treatment policy for diverticular bleeding and in the case of patients at high risk of complications following endoscopy, such as older patients, those with poor performance status or cardiovascular disease, and those in whom spontaneous hemostasis can be expected, urgent endoscopy should be avoided, and elective endoscopy should be selected. Therefore, the type of cases wherein urgent endoscopy is effective and the type wherein it is unnecessary need to be clarified. Thus far, there have been very few reports of the characteristics of patients with diverticular bleeding in whom spontaneous hemostasis was achieved. We aimed to assess the characteristics of patients in whom emergency endoscopy should be proactively performed and those for whom it is unnecessary. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed the identification rate for the responsible diverticulum in patients with diverticular bleeding and the rate of spontaneous hemostasis following conservative treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3015664103,"Limited data is available concerning the safety of active middle ear implants (AMEI) during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Measurements in temporal bones are the gold standard for preclinical assessment of device safety. In this study the coupling stability of an actuator as used in a fully implantable AMEI was determined in temporal bones. Eleven temporal bones were implanted with the actuator according to the manufacturer’s surgical guidelines. The actuator was coupled on the incus short process as recommended for sensorineural hearing loss. Temporal bones were exposed 10 times to the MRI magnetic field by entering the MRI suite in a clinically relevant way. Computed Tomography (CT) images were acquired before and after the experiment to investigate the risk of actuator dislocation. Based on the electrical impedance of the actuator, the loading of the actuator to the incus was confirmed. Relative actuator displacement was determined on the CT images by comparing the initial with the final actuator position in 3D space. Impedance curves were analyzed after each exposure to check the loading of the actuator to the ossicles. Analysis of CT images with a 0.30.6 mm in-plane resolution indicate no actuator displacement. The maximum detected change in impedance for all actuators was 8.43 Ω at the actuator’s resonance frequency. Impedance curves measured when the actuator was retracted from the short process after the experiment still indicate the presence of a clear resonance peak. No actuator displacement or dislocation could be detected in the analysis of CT images and the measured impedance curves. Impedance curves obtained when the actuator was retracted from the incus short process still show a clear resonance peak, indicating the device is still functional after the MRI exposures."

The study examined VTE cases after surgery to determined how this condition imposed an economic burden on patients based on the national health insurance reimbursement database. Methods: This retrospective analysis adopted the public payer's perspective. The direct medical cost was estimated using data from the national claims database of Vietnam from Jan 1, 2017 to Sep 31, 2018. Adult patients who underwent surgeries were recruited for the study. Patients with a diagnostic code of up to 90 days after surgery were considered VTE cases with the outcome measure being the surgery-related costs within 90 days.The 90-day cost of VTE patients was found to be US$2,939. The rate of readmission increased by 5.4 times, the rate of outpatient visits increased by 1.8 times and total costs over 90 days in patients with VTE undergoing surgery increased by 2.2 times. Estimation using propensity score matching method showed that an increase of US$1,019 in the 90-day cost of VTE patients.The VTE-related costs can be used to assess the potential economic benefit and cost-savings from prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3015638171,"Interrogation elicits anxiety in individuals under scrutiny regardless of their innocence, and thus, anxious responses to interrogation should be differentiated from deceptive behavior in practical lie detection settings. Despite its importance, not many empirical studies have yet been done to separate the effects of interrogation from the acts of lying or guilt state. The present fMRI study attempted to identify neural substrates of anxious responses under interrogation in either innocent or guilt contexts by developing a modified ""Doubt"" game. Participants in the guilt condition showed higher brain activations in the right central-executive network and bilateral basal ganglia. Regardless of the person's innocence, we observed higher activation of the salience, theory of mind and sensory-motor networks-areas associated with anxiety-related responses in the interrogative condition, compared to the waived conditions. We further explored two different types of anxious responses under interrogation-true detection anxiety in the guilty (true positive) and false detection anxiety in the innocent (false positive). Differential neural responses across these two conditions were captured at the caudate, thalamus, ventral anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We conclude that anxiety is a common neural response to interrogation, regardless of an individual's innocence, and that there are detectable differences in neural responses for true positive and false positive anxious responses under interrogation. The results of our study highlight a need to isolate complex cognitive processes involved in the deceptive acts from the emotional and regulatory responses to interrogation in lie detection schemes."
https://openalex.org/W3015662508,"With the widespread of multicore systems, automatic parallelization becomes more pronounced, particularly for legacy programs, where the source code is not generally available. An essential operation in any parallelization system is detecting data dependence among parallelization candidate instructions. Conducting dependence analysis at the binary-level is more challenging than that at the source-level due to the much lower semantics of the binary code. In this paper, we consider using the elaborate ‘static’ analysis of abstract interpretation, for the first time, at runtime for data dependence detection. Specifically, our system interprets instructions at a hot region, while at the same time, collect programs semantics for seen program points, thereby conducting abstract interpretation analysis dynamically. The analysis is guaranteed to be correct as long as execution does not exit the region prematurely. Moreover, successive hot region re-entries will resume previous analysis, albeit much faster in case no major change in the program semantics. Such approach provides for more rigorous analysis than other simple dynamic analysis which would typically miss parallelization opportunities. The proposed approach also does not require any hardware support, availability of the source code, as well as any code re-compilation. To study the performance and accuracy of our approach, we have extended the Padrone dynamic code modification framework, and conduct an initial study on a set of PolyBench kernels and selected programs from SPEC CPU. Experimental results show accurate dependence detection with low overhead."
