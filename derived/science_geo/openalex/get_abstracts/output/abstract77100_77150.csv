https://openalex.org/W2094676073,White zebra finches exposed to artificial sunlight used an average of 22.9 percent less energy after they were dyed black. The hypothesis that black homeotherm coloration functions primarily to maximize absorption of radiant solar energy is suggested. This hypothesis may explain the dark skin pigmentation of certain human populations.

S91 Albinotyrosinase Type B apparently cannot ""aggregate"" into melanosomes because its protein carrier is genetically altered. Therefore, albinotyrosinase remains vulnerable to its inhibitor and cannot produce melanin, even though the enzyme has a functioning active center."

https://openalex.org/W1991937664,"A hexokinase, with a low Michaelis constant, not previously described, has been found in extracts of human and dog liver but not of rat liver. Earlier reports are contradicted in that glucokinase occurs in extracts of liver from well-nourished humans and dogs; it is absent, or almost so, during states of poor nutrition."

https://openalex.org/W2143641578,"A RECENT survey has measured the effects of volatile metabolites from sixty-two fungal cultures on chosen characters of growth and reproduction of five assay species, namely: Rhizopus sexualis (Smith) Callen, Chaetomium globosum Kunze ex Fr., Stereum hirsutum (Willd.) Fr., Aspergillus niger van Tiegh., and Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr. The sixty-two species tested consisted of thirteen Phycomycetes, thirteen Ascomycetes, six Basidiomycetes and thirty Fungi Imperfecti, representing a wide range of habit. These species were tested using the simple apparatus shown in Fig. 1; each test consisted of a comparison of three replicate cultures, each containing the assay fungus on the upper agar plate and the test fungus on the lower plate, with three replicate controls each containing the assay fungus on the top plate and sterile agar on the lower plate."

https://openalex.org/W2017832723,"ON May 29, 1965, a female tree shrew—Tupaia glis sordida, according to the system of Lyon1—was found in a late stage of pregnancy on Tioman Island off Malaya. A nodular lesion measuring about 4 mm was present beneath the skin of the right thoracic breast near the nipple. No other lesions were found and there were no large ectoparasites. The animal was marked and released in accordance with standard procedure2. Three days later, the animal was found dead in a trap; the cause of death was not apparent, and the animal was well preserved and had obviously given birth since it was released. The carcass was injected with 70 per cent alcohol, and a week later placed in a strong solution of formaldehyde, and taken to the United States. On arrival it was washed in water and examined."
https://openalex.org/W1963924133,"REPORTS of the occurrence of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine (DMPE) in the urine of schizophrenic patients are attracting increasing attention1,2, although some of the chromatographic procedures used to detect this amine have been criticized as being insufficiently definitive. This communication reports an investigation in which, using two-way thin-layer chromatography, we have failed to detect urinary DMPE in any of twenty-two schizophrenic patients. In seventeen of the patients the illness was of recent acute onset, the remaining five having been ill for several years. Of the seventeen acute cases, fourteen had received no previous medication at all for their condition, while the other three had been treated with barbiturates only. None of the five chronically ill patients had received drug therapy for at least 3 years. No dietary restrictions were imposed."

https://openalex.org/W1996960982,"BHATTACHARYA1,2 has described a method for separating from rabbit semen two fractions of sperm with which he achieved a significant degree of predetermination of sex. He suggested that the separation depends on the tendency of the female producing X-sperm to sediment more rapidly than the male-producing Y-sperm, when the sperm are rendered immotile by cooling to 1° C and then allowed to sink under the influence of gravity for 12 h through a column of a viscous egg yolk medium. This communication describes briefly the results of experiments designed to examine the applicability of Bhattacharya's technique to cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2016037521,"Markovetz and Kallio1 pointed out that the assimilation of hydrocarbons might be of value in the classification of yeasts. Komagata et al.2 found that fifty-six of 498 yeast strains belonging to twenty-eight genera were able to grow on kerosene as the sole source of carbon and energy. All strains except two belonged to the genus Candida. In several species some strains grew well on kerosene, while others did not. No growth on kerosene was observed with some species, which were able to assimilate pure hydrocarbons of the kerosene fraction according to other reports1,3."

https://openalex.org/W2067999827,Dogs were trained to press a pedal to avoid shock. They were then operantly reinforced for making or for refraining from making a series of electromyographic responses while almost completely curarized. Tests after recovery from curarization showed that operant conditioning under curare influenced the original pedal-press response.

https://openalex.org/W2073979299,"The history of the development of a radiocarbon chronology shows how the establishment of the times of events and the order of them has greatly improved the understanding of prehistory in North America. This is true also of other parts of the world. Too little has been said of existing discordance between archeologically determined sequences, and interregional associations, and the radiocarbon chronology. It does appear that these will be resolved as additional dates are added and as the results become more finely calibrated so that secular variations may be accounted for. The collaborative aspect of the venture was apparent at the outset. Nevertheless no one expects an archeologist to delve into nuclear physics and geochemistry, and vice versa. There is great need, nevertheless, for the man in the laboratory to comprehend the difficulties of sample collecting and of judgement of the significance of the source of organic matter to be dated. At the same time, the archeologist must become more familiar with the importance of the various steps in the processing of the sample and with, what is most vital, interpretation of the significance of the numbers that appear on the counters."

https://openalex.org/W2028360202,"NATURALLY occurring tumours are extremely rare in insects. Harker1 in her review reports that, except for those in Drosophila, only two have been described during the past 25 years. Tumours can, however, be induced in cockroaches by cutting the nerves2,3, by repeated implantation of suboesophageal ganglia which are out of phase4, and by ligature of the salivary ducts5. We have tried to induce tumours experimentally in the German cockroach, and discovered that naturally occurring tumours (those occurring without known causes) were very frequent in our colony of the insect. If the recurrent nerve, which innervates the anterior parts of the intestine and the salivary organs, was severed, there was no effect on tumour frequency in our experiments on Blattella germanica. Similar results were obtained in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, after severance of the recurrent nerve5. We were therefore able to treat all our material as a single unit. Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically the distribution and frequency of tumours in the salivary organs and the intestines of a total of 246 individuals of Blattella germanica. This shows that tumours were found mostly in the ectodermal parts of the intestinal tracts and especially in the rectal parts. Tumour frequency increased with the age of the host and 96 per cent of older males were tumorous. Females from the same age groups were less susceptible than the males."

In a preliminary investigation4,5 we demonstrated the existence of ATP in “venom” squeezed manually from the parotoid glands of Bufo vulgaris and viridis, while we were unable to observe ATP in venom from Salamandra maculosa and Salamandra atra with the procedure used at that time."

https://openalex.org/W1998143415,"FOR many years it has been believed that the cutaneous pigment cell system of the so-called lower vertebrates—fishes and amphibians—is mainly a dermal one. As an effector system its function is primarily to show aggregated or dispersed melanin in different hormonal situations, and it does not significantly donate pigment to other tissues. On the other hand, the pigment cell system of birds and mammals has been considered to have primarily a cytocrine function, and to be effectively resident in the epidermis and its derivatives. Here the melanocytes function by donating melanin to contiguous epidermal cells in the integumental epidermis, or in the matrix of hairs or the collars of feathers. It is difficult to understand how the presumably dermal pigmentation of the ancestral vertebrates produced the very elegant epidermal system of birds and mammals, and little descriptive work on the reptile pigment cell system has proved of value in this connexion."

Unlike other tissues examined, the bone marrow was found to show a high protein-bound sulphydryl level and a relatively low acid-soluble sulphydryl level. The investigation was extended to determine whether this unusual distribution of sulphydryl was a feature of other bone marrows."

https://openalex.org/W1973057464,"THE lactation and radionuclide metabolism of dairy cattle after lethal doses of gamma and neutron radiation have recently been investigated by Cragle et al.1. One of the effects of radiation is a general body infection, and the composition of milk might be expected to be similar to that produced by cows with mastitis, that is, to show an increase in chloride concentration. This has been shown to influence palatability of the milk. Chloride determinations were made by titration against silver nitrate of milk samples produced by the cows used in the work of Cragle et al. Some of the samples contained added or induced radioactivity, and no organoleptic analyses were made in these cases."
