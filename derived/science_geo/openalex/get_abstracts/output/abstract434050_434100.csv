https://openalex.org/W2042386784,"Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths per year worldwide. Here, we report exome and genome sequences of 183 lung adenocarcinoma tumor/normal DNA pairs. These analyses revealed a mean exonic somatic mutation rate of 12.0 events/megabase and identified the majority of genes previously reported as significantly mutated in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we identified statistically recurrent somatic mutations in the splicing factor gene U2AF1 and truncating mutations affecting RBM10 and ARID1A. Analysis of nucleotide context-specific mutation signatures grouped the sample set into distinct clusters that correlated with smoking history and alterations of reported lung adenocarcinoma genes. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed frequent structural rearrangements, including in-frame exonic alterations within EGFR and SIK2 kinases. The candidate genes identified in this study are attractive targets for biological characterization and therapeutic targeting of lung adenocarcinoma.

Most often, tumors are discovered as locally advanced or metastatic disease, and despite improvements in molecular diagnosis and targeted therapies, the average 5 year survival rate for lung adenocarcinoma is ∼15% (Minna and Schiller, 2008Minna J.D. Schiller J.H. Lung Cancer.in: Fauci A.S. Braunwald E. Kasper D.L. Hauser S.L. Longo D.L. Jameson J.L. Loscalzo J. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine. 17th Edition. McGraw-Hill, New York2008: 551-562Google Scholar). Molecular genotyping is now routinely used to guide clinical care of lung adenocarcinoma patients, largely due to clinical trials that demonstrated superior efficacy of targeted kinase inhibitors as compared to standard chemotherapy for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK fusions (Kwak et al., 2010Kwak E.L. Bang Y.J. Camidge D.R. Shaw A.T. Solomon B. Maki R.G. Ou S.H. Dezube B.J. Jänne P.A. Costa D.B. et al.Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer.N. Engl. J.

Rational, biologically based treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 760-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). In addition to EGFR and ALK alterations found in ∼15% of U.S. cases, lung adenocarcinomas frequently harbor activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, and PIK3CA or translocations in RET and ROS1 (Pao and Hutchinson, 2012Pao W. Hutchinson K.E. Chipping away at the lung cancer genome.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), all of which are being pursued as targets in ongoing clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). Lung adenocarcinomas also often harbor loss-of-function mutations and deletions in tumor suppressor genes TP53, STK11, RB1, NF1, CDKN2A, SMARCA4, and KEAP1 (Ding et al., 2008Ding L. Getz G.

Unfortunately, such alterations are difficult to exploit therapeutically. Therefore, knowledge of additional genes altered in lung adenocarcinoma is needed to further guide diagnosis and treatment. Previous efforts in lung adenocarcinoma genome characterization include array-based profiling of copy number changes (Tanaka et al., 2007Tanaka H. Yanagisawa K. Shinjo K. Taguchi A. Maeno K.

Bhatt D. et al.The mutation spectrum revealed by paired genome sequences from a lung cancer patient.Nature. 2010; 465: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These studies identified somatic focal amplifications of NKX2-1, substitutions and copy number alterations in known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and recurrent in-frame fusions of KIF5B and RET. These studies have also nominated several putative cancer genes with somatic mutations (EPHA family, NTRK family, TLR4, LPHN3, GRM1, and GLI), but the functional consequence of many alterations is unknown. A recent study describing whole-exome sequencing of 16 lung adenocarcinomas (Liu et al., 2012Liu P. Morrison C. Wang L. Xiong D. Vedell P. Cui P. Hua X. Ding F. Lu Y. James M. et al.Identification of somatic mutations in non-small cell lung carcinomas using whole-exome sequencing.Carcinogenesis. 2012; 33: 1270-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) enumerated several mutated genes but did not identify genes undergoing positive selection for mutation in the studied tumors. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to sequence the exomes and/or genomes of DNA from 183 lung adenocarcinomas and matched normal adjacent tissue pairs. In addition to verifying genes with frequent somatic alteration in previous studies of lung adenocarcinoma, we identified novel mutated genes with statistical evidence of selection and that likely contribute to pathogenesis. Together, these data represent a significant advance toward a comprehensive annotation of somatic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma. We sequenced DNA from 183 lung adenocarcinomas and matched normal tissues by using paired-end massively parallel sequencing technology (Bentley et al., 2008Bentley D.R. Balasubramanian S.

Bignell H.R. et al.Accurate whole human genome sequencing using reversible terminator chemistry.Nature. 2008; 456: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). The cohort included 27 never-smokers, 17 light smokers (defined by less than ten pack years of tobacco use), 118 heavy smokers (more than ten pack years), and 21 patients of unknown smoking status (Table 1). The cohort included 90 stage I, 36 stage II, 22 stage III, and 10 stage IV lung adenocarcinoma cases, as well as 25 patients with unknown stage. All tumors were chemotherapy-naive, primary resection specimens except for one case with whole-genome sequence data (LU-A08-43) that was a postchemotherapy metastatic tumor from a never-smoker.

We examined 183 lung adenocarcinoma tumor/normal pairs with a combination of whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS): 159 WES, 23 WES and WGS, and 1 WGS only. Exomes were sequenced to a median fold coverage of 92 (range: 51–201) on 36.6 Mb of target sequence (Fisher et al., 2011Fisher S. Barry A. Abreu J. Minie B. Nolan J. Delorey T.M. Young G.

Genomes were sequenced to a median coverage of 69 (range: 25–103) in the tumor and 36 (range: 28–55) in the normal, with the higher tumor coverage to adjust for stromal contamination. Complementary SNP array analysis of 183 pairs was used to detect genome-wide somatic copy number alterations.

We identified somatic substitutions and small insertions and deletions (indels) through statistical comparison of paired tumor/normal sequence data by using algorithms calibrated for stromally contaminated cancer tissues (Banerji et al., 2012Banerji S.

Exonic regions of the 183 cases contained 77,736 somatic variants corresponding to a median of 8.1 mutations/Mb and a mean of 11.9 mutations/Mb (range: 0.04–117.4). These comprised 43,813 missense, 14,801 silent, 3,504 nonsense, 1,460 splice-site, 2,310 deletions, 839 insertions, and 11,009 other mutations (predominantly residing in 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions [UTRs]). Of the 3,149 indels, 182 were in-frame, 1,785 were predicted to cause a frame shift, 68 occurred at a splice site, and 1,114 were otherwise classified. Mutation calls were validated by cross-comparison of coding mutations detected by WES and WGS from 24 cases with both data types. We validated 84% of 380 indels and 97% of 9,354 substitutions identified by WGS at sufficiently powered sites in the corresponding WES tumor sample. In the converse analysis, we validated 86% of 338 indels and 98% of 8,912 substitutions from WES at sufficiently powered sites in the corresponding WGS tumor sample (Figure S1, Table S2A, and Extended Experimental Procedures). To validate mutations from cases with only WES data, we randomly selected 69 candidate mutations for ultradeep (>1,000-fold) targeted resequencing. Somatic status was confirmed for 30 of 33 (91%) indel events and 33 of 36 (92%) substitution events (Table S2B). These validation rates generally meet or exceed those reported in similar sequencing studies (Banerji et al., 2012Banerji S. Cibulskis K. Rangel-Escareno C. Brown K.K. Carter S.L. Frederick A.M.

Lung adenocarcinoma mutation rates in our cohort exceeded those reported for other epithelial tumor types, except melanoma and squamous cell lung cancer (Hodis et al., 2012Hodis E. Watson I.R.

Genet. 2011; 43: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To characterize the mutation spectrum of lung adenocarcinoma, we analyzed somatic substitutions and covered bases within their trinucleotide sequence context (Figure 1A). The most frequent mutation signatures were C→T transitions in the setting of CpG dinucleotides (CpG→T) and C→A transversions. The least frequent mutation type was A→C. Unbiased hierarchical clustering of context-specific mutation rates across 182 WES cases yielded five mutation spectrum clusters. These clusters represented grades of increasing mutational complexity: cluster 1 was enriched for CpG→T mutations and was marked by an overall low mutation rate; cluster 2 was characterized by CpG→T transitions and CpG→A transversions; cluster 3 showed additional C→A transversions outside of the CpG context; cluster 4 showed additional C→T transitions outside of the CpG context and TpC transversions that mutated to either a T or a G; and cluster 5 comprised hypermutated tumors containing a broad mutational spectrum that included rare mutation signatures, such as A→T transversions. Mutation spectrum clusters in tumors correlated with clinical features of patients. Cluster 1 was significantly enriched in never- and light smokers (p = 1.9 × 10−9, Fisher’s exact test), whereas cluster 4 was significantly enriched in patients with advanced (IIIB or IV) stage (p = 0.0063, Fisher’s exact test). Differentiation of smokers and never-smokers was evident from comparison of mutation counts from the most frequent mutational signatures, CpG→T and C→A (Figure 1B). These results were consistent with previous reports of signatures of DNA damage by tobacco (Hainaut and Pfeifer, 2001Hainaut P. Pfeifer G.P. Patterns of p53 G—>T transversions in lung cancers reflect the primary mutagenic signature of DNA-damage by tobacco smoke.Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 367-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Applying thresholds to a log-adjusted ratio of CpG→T and C→A mutations (see Experimental Procedures), we imputed smoking status for 21 patients who lacked reported smoking history and accurately recapitulated reported smoking status for more than 75% of the remaining cases (Figure 1B). Exonic and intronic mutation rates, context-specific mutation counts, imputed smoking status, and mutation spectrum cluster assignments for each patient are provided in Table S1. The high mutation rates in lung adenocarcinoma and other tumors (Hodis et al., 2012Hodis E. Watson I.R. Kryukov G.V. Arold S.T. Imielinski M. Theurillat J.P. Nickerson E. Auclair D. Li L.

More than 13,000 of 18,616 genes with adequate sequence coverage had nonsynonymous somatic mutations in at least one tumor, and more than 3,000 were mutated in at least five patients. These genes included those with very large genomic footprints (e.g., TTN), genes with low basal expression in lung adenocarcinomas (e.g., CSMD3), and genes accumulating high numbers of silent substitutions (e.g., LRP1B). Application of a standard binomial background mutation model assuming a constant mutation rate in each patient and nucleotide context stratum (Berger et al., 2011Berger M.F. Lawrence M.S. Demichelis F. Drier Y. Cibulskis K. Sivachenko A.Y. Sboner A. Esgueva R. Pflueger D. Sougnez C. et al.The genomic complexity of primary human prostate cancer.Nature. 2011; 470: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) yielded profound test statistic inflation (Figure S2A) and identified more than 1,300 significantly mutated genes. Genes with significant p values in this analysis had low basal expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V. Sonkin D. et al.The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.Nature. 2012; 483: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B), harbored high fractions of synonymous mutations, and were enriched in gene classes previously unassociated with cancer (e.g., olfactory receptors and solute transporters). Recalibration of this model by limiting to genes with evidence of expression improved, but did not completely correct, this statistical inflation (Figure S2C). These results suggested a high degree of variation in neutral somatic mutation rates among genes, including expression-dependent variation. This observation is consistent with reports of regional mutation rates correlated with density of H3K9 chromatin marks across cancers (Schuster-Böckler and Lehner, 2012Schuster-Böckler B. Lehner B. Chromatin organization is a major influence on regional mutation rates in human cancer cells.Nature. 2012; 488: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and with gene expression in multiple myeloma (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman M.A. Lawrence M.S. Keats J.J. Cibulskis K. Sougnez C. Schinzel A.C. Harview C.L. Brunet J.P. Ahmann G.J. Adli M. et al.Initial genome sequencing and analysis of multiple myeloma.Nature. 2011; 471: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). To more adequately model variation of neutral somatic mutation rates among genes, we applied the InVEx algorithm (Hodis et al., 2012Hodis E. Watson I.R. Kryukov G.V. Arold S.T. Imielinski M. Theurillat J.P. Nickerson E. Auclair D. Li L. Place C. et al.A landscape of driver mutations in melanoma.Cell. 2012; 150: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) to exploit the abundant noncoding mutations detected by both WES and WGS. InVEx permutes coding, untranslated, and intronic mutations within covered territories of each gene, patient, and nucleotide context to generate within-gene null distributions of “functional impact” across a sample set (see Experimental Procedures). Our primary InVEx analysis employed a PolyPhen-2 (PPH2)-based metric (Adzhubei et al., 2010Adzhubei I.A. Schmidt S. Peshkin L. Ramensky V.E. Gerasimova A. Bork P. Kondrashov A.S. Sunyaev S.R. A method and server for predicting damaging missense mutations.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9354) Google Scholar) to assess the functional impact of observed and permuted mutations. Applying this analysis to 12,907 mutated genes with at least one PPH2-scored event yielded a well-distributed test statistic with minimal inflation (Figure S2D) and without gene expression bias in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (Figure S2B). To increase specificity and power, we restricted our analysis to 7,260 genes demonstrating expression (median Robust Multiarray Average [RMA] value ≥5) in a panel of 40 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V. Sonkin D. et al.The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.Nature. 2012; 483: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar), which resulted in a similarly well-calibrated test statistic (Figure S2E). Next, we tested for enrichment of loss-of-function (LOF) mutations by considering only truncating mutations as functional and all remaining mutation types as neutral. We applied this method to 2,266 genes with evidence of expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and at least one truncating mutational event. Finally, we applied both PPH2 and LOF InVEx analyses to a focused set of Cancer Gene Census (CGC) genes expressed in lung adenocarcinoma and mutated or amplified in one or more tumor types. The primary PPH2 InVEx analysis yielded 13 genes with statistical evidence of positive selection (q < 0.25) (Table S3A). These included lung adenocarcinoma genes with nonsynonymous mutation frequencies that were consistent with previous reports: TP53 (50%), KRAS (27%), EGFR (17%), STK11 (15%), KEAP1 (12%), NF1 (11%), BRAF (8%), and SMAD4 (3%). This analysis also uncovered five novel candidates, including CHEK2, a gene driven by an apparent recurrent mapping artifact in three tumors and removed from all subsequent analyses (see Extended Experimental Procedures). The remaining candidates were mutated at frequencies lower than most previously reported genes, demonstrating the increased power of our large sample set. The LOF InVEx yield"

We propose that dedifferentiation trumps endocrine cell death in the natural history of β cell failure and suggest that treatment of β cell dysfunction should restore differentiation, rather than promoting β cell replication. Dedifferentiation, not apoptosis, is the main cause of β cell failure FoxO1 enforces the β cell fate during β cell adaptation to metabolic stress Dedifferentiated β cells are prone to converting into α, δ, and Pp endocrine cells The pathogenesis of β cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes remains controversial (Talchai et al., 2009Talchai C. Lin H.V. Kitamura T. Accili D. Genetic and biochemical pathways of beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2009; 11: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). β cells of diabetics respond poorly to a glucose challenge and fail to mount an appropriately timed response (Ferrannini, 2010Ferrannini E. The stunned beta cell: a brief history.Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 349-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, physiologic adaptation of β cell function to conditions like pregnancy or aging—mainly achieved by modulating β cell replication—is most taxing for prediabetic individuals, indicating that not only is the endocrine islet's homeostatic function poor, but so is its ability to cope with metabolic or environmental stressors (Accili et al., 2010Accili D. Ahrén B. Boitard C. Cerasi E. Henquin J.C. Seino S. What ails the β-cell?.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2010; 12: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). During the course of diabetes, and in animal models of β cell dysfunction, deficits in adaptive β cell mass are largely viewed as arising from an unbalanced rate of self-renewal versus apoptosis (Butler et al., 2007Butler P.C. Meier J.J. Butler A.E. Bhushan A. The replication of beta cells in normal physiology, in disease and for therapy.Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar; Rieck et al., 2009Rieck S. White P. Schug J. Fox A.J. Smirnova O. Gao N. Gupta R.K. Wang Z.V. Scherer P.E. Keller M.P. et al.The transcriptional response of the islet to pregnancy in mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the increased rate of apoptosis in diabetic islets is modest relative to the impairment of β cell function (Butler et al., 2007Butler P.C. Meier J.J. Butler A.E. Bhushan A. The replication of beta cells in normal physiology, in disease and for therapy.Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), while individual variations in β cell mass are extensive (Rahier et al., 2008Rahier J. Guiot Y. Goebbels R.M. Sempoux C. Henquin J.C. Pancreatic beta-cell mass in European subjects with type 2 diabetes.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2008; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In addition to cell-autonomous defects that can be demonstrated long before disease onset (Weyer et al., 1999Weyer C. Bogardus C. Mott D.M. Pratley R.E. The natural history of insulin secretory dysfunction and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar), there are cell-nonautonomous contributors to β cell dysfunction: hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hormones, cytokines, changes in endothelial cell function, and vascular flow (Ferrannini, 2010Ferrannini E. The stunned beta cell: a brief history.Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 349-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The failure of sustainable β cell function under metabolic stress (e.g., during pregnancy or aging) (Rankin and Kushner, 2010Rankin M.M. Kushner J.A. Aging induces a distinct gene expression program in mouse islets.Islets. 2010; 2: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar; Rieck et al., 2009Rieck S. White P. Schug J. Fox A.J. Smirnova O.

Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has been attributed to different biological mechanisms. Autophagy, a physiologic process of organelle maintenance, can morph into a disease process under conditions of nutrient oversupply—as seen in diabetes (Hur et al., 2010Hur K.Y. Jung H.S. Lee M.S. Role of autophagy in β-cell function and mass.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2010; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Activation of the unfolded protein response affects insulin secretion, with subsequent changes in β cell mass (Matsuda et al., 2010Matsuda T. Kido Y. Asahara S. Kaisho T. Tanaka T. Hashimoto N. Shigeyama Y. Takeda A. Inoue T. Shibutani Y. et al.Ablation of C/EBPbeta alleviates ER stress and pancreatic beta cell failure through the GRP78 chaperone in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The limited glycolytic capacity of the β cell can result in the generation of reactive oxygen species, and the ensuing oxidative stress can uncouple glucose sensing from insulin secretion (Robertson, 2004Robertson R.P. Chronic oxidative stress as a central mechanism for glucose toxicity in pancreatic islet beta cells in diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42351-42354Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In addition to processes impinging on β cell survival and hence on islet mass, β cell dedifferentiation can be observed in vitro (Weinberg et al., 2007Weinberg N. Ouziel-Yahalom L. Knoller S. Efrat S. Dor Y. Lineage tracing evidence for in vitro dedifferentiation but rare proliferation of mouse pancreatic beta-cells.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and during ex vivo culture of human islets (Gershengorn et al., 2004Gershengorn M.C. Hardikar A.A. Wei C. Geras-Raaka E. Marcus-Samuels B. Raaka B.M. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition generates proliferative human islet precursor cells.Science. 2004; 306: 2261-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Evidence that it might occur in common forms of β cell failure has been inferred from partial pancreatectomy studies (Jonas et al., 1999Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patanè G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Chronic hyperglycemia triggers loss of pancreatic beta cell differentiation in an animal model of diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), but has not been shown to occur in type 2 diabetes, nor has its mechanism been explored. Recent studies have shone light on fate conversion of pancreatic cells under genetically extreme conditions, such as: (1) α cell to β cell in response to forced expression of Pax4 (Collombat et al., 2007Collombat P. Hecksher-Sørensen J. Krull J. Berger J. Riedel D. Herrera P.L. Serup P. Mansouri A. Embryonic endocrine pancreas and mature beta cells acquire alpha and PP cell phenotypes upon Arx misexpression.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or extreme ablation of β cells (Thorel et al., 2010Thorel F. Népote V. Avril I. Kohno K. Desgraz R. Chera S. Herrera P.L. Conversion of adult pancreatic alpha-cells to beta-cells after extreme beta-cell loss.Nature. 2010; 464: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar); (2) β cell to duct epithelium in response to Akt gain of function (Elghazi et al., 2009Elghazi L.

Transcription factor FoxO1 integrates signals regulating β cell mass (Kitamura et al., 2002Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D.

FoxO1 has been found to determine cell fate in differentiating adipocytes (Nakae et al., 2003Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. The forkhead transcription factor Foxo1 regulates adipocyte differentiation.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), myoblasts (Kitamura et al., 2007Kitamura T. Kitamura Y.I. Funahashi Y. Shawber C.J. Castrillon D.H. Kollipara R. DePinho R.A. Kitajewski J. Accili D. A Foxo/Notch pathway controls myogenic differentiation and fiber type specification.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2477-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and enteroendocrine cells (Talchai et al., 2012Talchai C. Xuan S. Kitamura T. DePinho R.A. Accili D. Generation of functional insulin-producing cells in the gut by Foxo1 ablation.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 (S1): 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). But considerably less is known about FoxO1 requirements in maintaining cell differentiation. In light of its role, straddling diverse aspects of β cell physiology, we used mice lacking FoxO1 in β cells to probe mechanisms of β cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Surprisingly, our studies reveal that β cell dedifferentiation and conversion into other endocrine cell types are underrecognized mechanisms of β cell failure in type 2 diabetes and that FoxO1 is required to enforce the β cell fate under metabolic stress. To determine FoxO1 activity during diabetes progression, we surveyed FoxO1 immunoreactivity in β cells of mice with insulin-resistant diabetes: GIRKO (Lin et al., 2011Lin H.V. Ren H. Samuel V.T. Lee H.Y. Lu T.Y. Shulman G.I. Accili D. Diabetes in mice with selective impairment of insulin action in Glut4-expressing tissues.Diabetes. 2011; 60: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as well as db/db mice. In addition to euglycemic mice (glucose ≤150 mg/dl), we studied mice with mild fasting hyperglycemia (150–250 mg/dl), and severe hyperglycemia (≥500 mg/dl). In euglycemia, FoxO1 showed cytoplasmic localization in β cells (Figure 1A). In contrast, with mild hyperglycemia, FoxO1 could be found in a distinctive punctate nuclear pattern in β cells, consistent with its nuclear translocation in response to oxidative stress (Kitamura et al., 2005Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. FoxO1 protects against pancreatic beta cell failure through NeuroD and MafA induction.Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In this condition, we also saw partial loss of insulin and FoxO1-expressing cells (Figure 1A). As hyperglycemia increased, loss of FoxO1 immunoreactivity paralleled loss of insulin content (Figure 1A), consistent with previous observations (Kitamura et al., 2005Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D.

Ren H. Samuel V.T. Lee H.Y. Lu T.Y. Shulman G.I. Accili D.

Cinti F. Perincheri S. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Genetic analysis of type-1 insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling through insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 in pancreatic beta cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41044-41050Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we don't know whether loss of FoxO1 is a cause or an effect of β cell failure, nor do we know what happened to the “missing” β cells. To address these questions, we utilized mice with somatic deletion of Foxo1 in β cells (IKO) (Kitamura et al., 2009Kitamura T. Kitamura Y.I. Kobayashi M. Kikuchi O. Sasaki T. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Regulation of pancreatic juxtaductal endocrine cell formation by FoxO1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4417-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To document Foxo1 deletion in Cre-expressing cells, we generated IKO:Rosa26-Gfp and control Ins2-cre:Foxo1fl/+:Rosa26-Gfp mice. As expected, Gfp+ cells lacked FoxO1 immunoreactivity (Figure 1B), while measurements of Foxo1 mRNA in collagenase-purified islets demonstrated an ∼70% decrease compared with wild-type controls, with residual mRNA probably arising from islet vasculature and connective tissue (Figure S1A available online). In basal conditions, IKO mice showed normal body weight (Figure S1B), islet architecture, β cell morphology by electron microscopy (EM), and levels of mRNA encoding β cell markers Pdx1, MafA, Nkx6.1, NeuroD1, Insulin1, Insulin2, Prohormone convertase 1 (Pcsk1), Pcsk2, Glucokinase (Gck), and Glucose transporter 2 (Glut2). Interestingly, they showed increased mRNA encoding Foxo3a and Foxo4 (Figures S1C–S1H). IKO mice displayed normal glucose tolerance and insulin and glucagon secretion (Figures S1I–S1Q). In addition, fasting blood glucose was normal, as were fed insulin and glucagon levels and pancreatic content of insulin and glucagon (Figures 1D–1J). To assess the consequences of FoxO1 ablation in the β cell response to physiologic stress, we studied multiparous females (Rieck et al., 2009Rieck S. White P. Schug J. Fox A.J. Smirnova O. Gao N. Gupta R.K. Wang Z.V. Scherer P.E. Keller M.P. et al.The transcriptional response of the islet to pregnancy in mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and aging males (Rankin and Kushner, 2010Rankin M.M. Kushner J.A. Aging induces a distinct gene expression program in mouse islets.Islets. 2010; 2: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as pathophysiologic models of β cell stress. In both models, we saw an ∼30% decrease of β cell mass and an ∼50% increase in α cell mass, associated with fasting hyperglycemia, decreased fed insulin levels and pancreatic insulin content, and increased fed glucagon levels and pancreatic glucagon content (Figures 1C–1J). We further examined β cell and α cell function in vivo, and found that both multiparous and aging IKO mice had impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin secretion, and elevated glucagon secretion in response to glucose and arginine compared to wild-type controls (Figures S1I–S1P). To distinguish between an intrinsic defect of insulin and glucagon secretion in multiparous IKO mice and secondary changes brought about by glucose toxicity (Robertson, 2004Robertson R.P. Chronic oxidative stress as a central mechanism for glucose toxicity in pancreatic islet beta cells in diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42351-42354Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), we isolated islets and compared insulin secretion. We observed reduced insulin release in response to different glucose concentrations in islets from IKO multiparae (Figures S1Q and S1R), consistent with a cell-autonomous effect of the Foxo1 mutation. We confirmed these findings in two additional models of β cell dysfunction: (1) hyperglycemia–induced by chemical ablation of β cells with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) (Movassat et al., 1997Movassat J. Saulnier C. Portha B. Insulin administration enhances growth of the beta-cell mass in streptozotocin-treated newborn rats.Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and (2) insulin resistance–caused by insulin receptor haploinsufficiency (InsR+/−) (Kido et al., 2000Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. Tissue-specific insulin resistance in mice with mutations in the insulin receptor, IRS-1, and IRS-2.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In both instances, we saw decreased β cell mass, altered pancreatic glucagon and insulin content, abnormal fed plasma insulin and glucagon, with fasting hyperglycemia (Figures S1S–S1Y). The constellation of hyperglycemia, hyperglucagonemia and relative hypoinsulinemia with decreased insulin-to-glucagon ratios is reminiscent of human type 2 diabetes (Dunning and Gerich, 2007Dunning B.E. Gerich J.E. The role of alpha-cell dysregulation in fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes and therapeutic implications.Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 253-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To examine whether β cell dysfunction was due to loss of β cell number or β cell function, we employed lineage tracing to mark cells in which Ins2-cre had been active. In these experiments, we used a sensitive approach based on automated localization of confocal immunofluorescence, and compared virgin female and multiparous IKO mice with matched wild-type controls using immunohistochemistry with Gfp and insulin (Figure 2A, green and red, respectively). The activation frequency of Ins2-cre in β cells—as defined by the ratio of colocalization area (yellow) to insulin-immunoreactive area (red) —was 75%–88% in virgin IKO and wild-type mice (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A). We then assessed the proportion of green (Gfp+), red (Ins+), and yellow cells (Gfp+/Ins+) in IKO versus wild-type multiparae. The predictions were that (1) if reduced β cell mass in IKO multiparae was due to decreased cell-autonomous survival, the number of yellow cells should decrease; (2) if reduced β cell mass was due to impaired repopulation of the islets by newly formed β cells that escaped Cre-mediated recombination, the number of red cells should decrease, and (3) if both mechanisms contributed to the reduction, red and yellow cells should decrease (Figure 2A). Instead, we observed similar numbers of red cells in the two genotypes (Figure S2A), while—to our surprise—multiparous IKO mice showed a large increase in the number of green cells, i.e., recombined β cells that no longer produced insulin. There were large inter-islet variations, even within the same pancreas. In some islets we observed residual punctate insulin immunoreactivity, resulting in faint merged fluorescence (i.e., intensity of red color ≤40% of average wild-type β cells) (Figure 2C, middle panels), while in others insulin immunoreactivity could no longer be detected, resulting in completely green cells (Figure 2C, right-hand panels). Double immunohistochemistry with Gfp and Pdx1, or Gfp and MafA revealed that wholly green cells expressed neither β cell transcription factor (Figure 2C), while cells with residual faint yellow immunoreactivity showed persistent expression of both proteins (Figure 2D). Thus, based on the proposed criteria for the progression of β cell failure (Weir and Bonner-Weir, 2004Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Five stages of evolving beta-cell dysfunction during progression to diabetes.Diabetes. 2004; 53: S16-S21Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), it appears that faintly yellow cells are partly degranulated β cells, while green cells are dedifferentiated β cells (Weinberg et al., 2007Weinberg N. Ouziel-Yahalom L. Knoller S. Efrat S. Dor Y. Lineage tracing evidence for in vitro dedifferentiation but rare proliferation of mouse pancreatic beta-cells.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The two cell types combined represented ∼25% of total recombined cells in IKO islets, thus accounting nearly entirely for the loss of β cell mass in Foxo1-ablated multiparae (Figure S2B). To extend our findings, we performed lineage-tracing studies in aging IKO (>16 months old), and IKO/InsR+/− males, age-matched with multiparous females (8 months old). We confirmed the occurrence of degranulation and dedifferentiation in both models (Figure S2A). These data suggest that dedifferentiation is a shared cell-autonomous mechanism of β cell loss, rather than a specific response to multiple pregnancies. The presence of similar numbers of β cells that escaped recombination in IKO and controls (Figure S2B, red bars) demonstrates that the two groups did not differ by their regenerative abilities, i.e., that the difference in β cell mass is due to cell-autonomous effects of Foxo1 ablation. The data are consistent with the explanation that FoxO1-deficient β cells have normal survival, but become dedifferentiated. Accordingly, islet EM showed cells with scattered residual EM-dense granules, typical of degranulated β cells, as well as cells with empty granules in multiparous IKO mice (Figure 2E). In addition, double immunostaining with Gfp and various β cell markers demonstrated a near-complete loss of C-peptide, Pcsk1, and Pcsk2 (encoding prohormone convertases 1 and 2) and substantial decreases of Glut2 and Gck immunoreactivities in multiparous and in aging IKO mice (Figures 2F–2I and S2D). Further, mRNAs encoding Pdx1, Nkx6.1, NeuroD1, MafA, Pcsk2, Gck, and Glut2 were decreased in islets isolated from IKO multiparae (Figure S2C), providing a potential explanation for the secretory defects observed in vivo (Figures 1 and S1). Apoptosis contributes to β cell loss (Butler et al., 2007Butler P.C. Meier J.J. Butler A.E. Bhushan A. The replication of beta cells in normal physiology, in disease and for therapy.Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 758-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In light of the possible proapoptotic role of FoxO1, we surveyed apoptotic cells by quantification of cleaved caspase-3 and by TUNEL assays, but found similar numbers in multiparous IKO and wild-type mice (Figures 3A and 3B ). Interestingly, no pancreatic hormone colocalized with apoptotic nuclei, suggesting that apoptosis occurred in dedifferentiated cells. To quantitate the contribution of dedifferentiation versus death to β cell loss, we compared the ratios of Gfp and insulin immunoreactive areas to total pancreatic area in virgin and multiparous mice from both genotypes. In basal conditions, we observed no difference between virgin animals of the two genotypes, indicating that they possess the same complement of β cells and similar recombination rates. If the reduced β cell mass in multiparous IKO was due to cell death, we should have observed a reduction of both Gfp- and insulin-immunoreactive areas as a fraction of total pancreatic area in IKO versus wild-type mice. But we observed that only the insulin-immunoreactive area was reduced in multiparous IKO mice, while the Gfp-immunoreactive area was similar between the two genotypes (Figure 3C). These data show that loss of β cell mass in IKO multiparae is due to loss of insulin production in β cells, not to cell death. We also investigated the possibility that FoxO1-ablated β cells had abnormal turnover. But immunohistochemistry with the cell cycle antigen Ki67 under basal conditions, or during and after pregnancy showed no difference in labeling between the two genotypes. We obtained similar data in glucagon-producing cells (Figures S3A–S3C), ruling out a contribution of altered cell replication to decreased β cell mass and increased α cell mass. We probed the differentiation stage of FoxO1-deficient, insulin-depleted β cells, using markers of pre-endocrine progenitors (Sox9), endocrine progenitors (Neurog3), and committed endocrine cells (ChromograninA, ChgA) (Seymour et al., 2007Seymour P.A. Freude K.K. Tran M.N. Mayes E.E. Jensen J. Kist R. Scherer G. Sander M. SOX9 is required for maintenance of the pancreatic progenitor cell pool.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). FoxO1-deficient Gfp+ cells were Sox9−/ChgA+, indicating that they are endocrine pre-β cells, and not pre-endocrine progenitors (Figure 4A). Neurog3 detection in adult islets is problematic at best (Wang et al., 2009Wang S. Jensen J.N. Seymour P.A. Hsu W. Dor Y. Sander M. Magnuson M.A. Serup P. Gu G. Sustained Neurog3 expression in hormone-expressing islet cells is required for endocrine maturation and function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9715-9720Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Neurog3 immunoreactivity was hardly detectable in islets from virgin 3-month-old mice of either genotype (Figure S4A), but clearly visible in fetal pancreas (Figure S4B). We detected a stark increase of Neurog3 immunoreactivity in FoxO1-ablated cells of multiparous, aging, and InsR+/−/IKO mice (Figures 4A and S4D). Double immunohistochemistry demonstrated that cells expressing high levels of Neurog3 (Neurog3high) contained no insulin, Pdx1, and MafA while mature β cells showed the opposite pattern (Figures 4B and S4E) (Wang et al., 2009Wang S. Jensen J.N. Seymour P.A. Hsu W. Dor Y. Sander M. Magnuson M.A. Serup P. Gu G. Sustained Neurog3 expression in hormone-expressing islet cells is required for endocrine maturation and function.Proc.

We identified 3,726 point mutations and more than 90 indels in the coding sequence, with an average mutation frequency more than 10-fold higher in smokers than in never-smokers. Novel alterations in genes involved in chromatin modification and DNA repair pathways were identified, along with DACH1, CFTR, RELN, ABCB5, and HGF. Deep digital sequencing revealed diverse clonality patterns in both never-smokers and smokers. All validated EFGR and KRAS mutations were present in the founder clones, suggesting possible roles in cancer initiation. Analysis revealed 14 fusions, including ROS1 and ALK, as well as novel metabolic enzymes. Cell-cycle and JAK-STAT pathways are significantly altered in lung cancer, along with perturbations in 54 genes that are potentially targetable with currently available drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1990960113,"The mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway regulates cell growth in response to numerous cues, including amino acids, which promote mTORC1 translocation to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. The heterodimeric RagA/B-RagC/D GTPases, the Ragulator complex that tethers the Rags to the lysosome, and the v-ATPase form a signaling system that is necessary for amino acid sensing by mTORC1. Amino acids stimulate the binding of guanosine triphosphate to RagA and RagB but the factors that regulate Rag nucleotide loading are unknown. Here, we identify HBXIP and C7orf59 as two additional Ragulator components that are required for mTORC1 activation by amino acids. The expanded Ragulator has nucleotide exchange activity toward RagA and RagB and interacts with the Rag heterodimers in an amino acid- and v-ATPase-dependent fashion. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into how mTORC1 senses amino acids by identifying Ragulator as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rag GTPases."

The reprogramming process is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes (Koche et al., 2011Koche R.P. Smith Z.D. Adli M. Gu H. Ku M. Gnirke A. Bernstein B.E. Meissner A.

To further understand the reprogramming process, transcriptional and epigenetic changes in cell populations were analyzed at different time points after factor induction. For example, microarray data showed that the immediate response to the reprogramming factors was characterized by dedifferentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and upregulation of proliferative genes, consistent with c-Myc expression (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the endogenous pluripotency markers Sox2 and Nanog are activated after early markers such as alkaline phosphatase (AP) and SSEA1 (Stadtfeld et al., 2008Stadtfeld M. Maherali N.

Defining molecular cornerstones during fibroblast to iPS cell reprogramming in mouse.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 230-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Recently, gene expression profiling and RNAi screening in fibroblasts revealed three phases of reprogramming termed initiation, maturation, and stabilization, with the initiation phase marked by a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) (Li et al., 2010Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F. Zhuang Q. et al.A mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition initiates and is required for the nuclear reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar; Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010Samavarchi-Tehrani P.

Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Given these data, a stochastic model has emerged to explain how forced expression of the transcription factors initiates the process that eventually leads to the pluripotent state in only a small fraction of the transduced cells (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J. Lengner C.J. Creyghton M.P. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Direct cell reprogramming is a stochastic process amenable to acceleration.Nature. 2009; 462: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar; Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. Elite and stochastic models for induced pluripotent stem cell generation.Nature. 2009; 460: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Most data have been interpreted to support a stochastic model (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J. Lengner C.J. Creyghton M.P. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Direct cell reprogramming is a stochastic process amenable to acceleration.Nature. 2009; 462: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) posing that the reprogramming factors initiate a sequence of probabilistic events that eventually lead to the small and unpredictable fraction of iPSCs. Clonal analyses support the stochastic model, demonstrating that activation of pluripotency markers occurs at different times after infection in individual daughters of the same fibroblast (Meissner et al., 2007Meissner A. Wernig M. Jaenisch R. Direct reprogramming of genetically unmodified fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). However, because the molecular changes occurring at the different stages during the reprogramming process were based upon the analysis of heterogeneous cell populations, it has not been possible to clarify the events that occur in the rare single cells that eventually form iPSCs. Moreover, there has been little insight into the sequence of events that drive the process. To understand the changes that precede iPSC formation, we used gene expression analysis to profile 48 genes in single cells derived from early time points, intermediate cells, and fully reprogrammed iPSCs, demonstrating that cells at different stages of the reprogramming process can be separated into two defined populations with high variation in gene expression at early time points. We also demonstrate that activation of genes such as Fbxo15, Fgf4, and Oct4 does not stringently predict successful reprogramming, in contrast to Esrrb, Utf1, Lin28, and Dppa2, which more rigorously mark the rare cells that are destined to become iPSCs. Moreover, our results suggest that stochastic gene expression changes early in the reprogramming process are followed by a “nonstochastic” or more ”hierarchical” phase of gene expression responsible for the activation of the endogenous pluripotency circuitry. Finally, based on the events that occur in this late consecutive phase, we show that the activation of the pluripotency core circuitry is possible by various combinations of factors and even in the absence of the generic “Yamanaka” factors. To measure gene expression in single cells at defined time points during the reprogramming process, we combined two complimentary tools: (1) 96.96 Dynamic Array chips (Fluidigm), which allows quantitative analysis of 48 genes in duplicate in 96 single cells (Guo et al., 2010Guo G. Huss M. Tong G.Q. Wang C. Li Sun L. Clarke N.D. Robson P. Resolution of cell fate decisions revealed by single-cell gene expression analysis from zygote to blastocyst.Dev. Cell. 2010; 18: 675-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and (2) single-molecule-mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (sm-mRNA-FISH), which allows the quantification of mRNA transcripts of up to three genes in hundreds to thousands of cells (Raj et al., 2008Raj A. van den Bogaard P. Rifkin S.A. van Oudenaarden A. Tyagi S. Imaging individual mRNA molecules using multiple singly labeled probes.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). We selected gene candidates based on the major events that occur during reprogramming (Figure S1A available online). Because reprogramming requires a vast number of epigenetic changes, we chose a group of ESC-associated chromatin-remodeling genes and modification enzymes (Myst3, Kdm1, Hdac1, Dnmt1, Prmt7, Ctcf, Myst4, Dnmt3b, Ezh2, Bmi1) (Reik, 2007Reik W.

Hajkova P. Genetic and epigenetic regulators of pluripotency.Cell. 2007; 128: 747-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Because high proliferative capacity is essential to facilitate the reprogramming process, we selected ESC cell-cycle regulator genes (Bub1, Cdc20, Mad2l1, Ccnf) (Hong et al., 2009Hong H. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Kanagawa O. Nakagawa M. Okita K. Yamanaka S. Suppression of induced pluripotent stem cell generation by the p53-p21 pathway.Nature. 2009; 460: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). We also included key genes that are active in signal transduction pathways important for ESC maintenance and differentiation (Bmpr1a, Stat3, Ctnnbl1, Nes, Wnt1, Gsk3b, Csnk2a1, Lifr, Hes1, Jag1, Notch1, Fgf5, Fgf4) (Boiani and Schöler, 2005Boiani M.

Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Finally, we chose a large number of pluripotency marker genes in an attempt to detect early and late markers in reprogramming (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Lin28, Fbxo15, Zfp42, Fut4, Tbx3, Esrrb, Dppa2, Utf1, Sall4, Gdf3, Grb2, Slc2a1, Fthi17, Nr6a1) (Ng and Surani, 2011Ng H.H.

Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. “Stemness”: transcriptional profiling of embryonic and adult stem cells.Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). We used Gapdh and Hprt as control genes and Thy1 and Col5a2 as markers for MEFs. To circumvent the genetic heterogeneity of “primary” virus-transduced fibroblasts, we utilized previously characterized clonal doxycycline (dox)-inducible secondary NGFP2 MEFs (Wernig et al., 2008Wernig M. Lengner C.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Steine E. Foreman R. Staerk J. Markoulaki S. Jaenisch R. A drug-inducible transgenic system for direct reprogramming of multiple somatic cell types.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 916-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, these cells are derived from a homogenous donor cell population containing preselected proviral integrations of OSKM, each under the TetO promoter, reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) in the Rosa26 locus, and a GFP reporter knocked into the Nanog locus. To compare variability between systems, we quantified Sox2 and Klf4 transcripts by sm-mRNA-FISH in single virus-infected MEFs and single secondary MEFs on dox for 6 days. Because transgene expression between single cells was more variable in the virus-infected MEFs, we used the secondary system for all analyses (Figures S1B and S1C). We analyzed clonal populations (cells derived from a single cell) throughout the process of dox-independent iPSC formation, beginning at day 2 of dox addition with the first colonies appearing around 7 days after dox addition. Thus, to detect early transcriptional changes in the reprogramming process, nonclonal populations of NGFP2 MEFs were exposed to dox for 2, 4, and 6 days. At each time point, the cells were imaged and sorted to single cells, and gene expression was profiled using the Fluidigm system (Figures 1A and 1B ). To profile clonal populations of cells on dox for more than 6 days, we utilized a modified experimental setup. Because most cells senesced, became contact inhibited, or transformed after exposure to dox for 6 days, which interfered with single-cell sorting to identify those rare cells that were destined to become iPSCs, we generated secondary cells that, in addition to the Nanog-GFP gene, carried a tdTomato reporter. tdTomato was electroporated into NGFP2 iPSCs, and a single colony was picked and expanded. Cells derived from this colony were injected into blastocysts, and secondary MEFs were derived (Figure S1D). The presence of the tdTomato reporter enabled us to sort single secondary cells in the presence of unmarked feeder cells, which were important for both cell-cell interactions enabling proliferation of single cells and calibration of the FACS machine (i.e., tdTomato+ cells versus tdTomato− cells). This system allowed tracing of the tdTomato+ rare cells that bypassed senescence and contact inhibition and continued to proliferate forming colonies on the feeder layer. Initially, labeled NGFP2 MEFs were exposed to dox for 6 days, sorted for tdTomato, and seeded each as a single cell in one well of four 24-well plates containing unmarked feeders. At different times between 1 and 3 weeks during the reprogramming process, tdTomato+ colonies derived from single cells were imaged, split to another plate, sorted to single cells, and analyzed for their transcriptional profile using Fluidigm. Each parental cell was passaged to test its capacity to generate dox-independent, fully reprogrammed iPSCs. This system allowed tracing gene expression changes in multiple clonally related single sister cells over different times during reprogramming. Clonal populations were passaged, and gene expression was profiled as a function of time in three subpopulations: (1) early dox-dependent GFP− cells, (2) intermediate dox-dependent GFP− and GFP+ cells, and (3) dox-independent GFP+ cells (Figures 1C and 1D). Out of 96 tdTomato+ single cells, only seven cells generated a colony reflecting the low efficiency of the process. Single cells in these seven clonal populations (colonies 15, 16, 20, 23, 34, 43, and 44) were profiled over the course of 94 days (Figure 1E). Cells were sorted for GFP after detection on the inverted fluorescence microscope. Colonies 34, 20, and 43 gave rise to dox-independent cells relatively early in the process, whereas colony 16 gave rise to dox-independent cells very late in the process. Colonies 23 and 44 did not generate stable GFP colonies for 81 days of continuous culture in dox. Colony 44 contained a few cells with a very low level of GFP (Figure S1E) that disappeared upon further passaging. A few cells (0.01%) from colony 23 activated GFP only at day 81. To gain insight into intermediate clonal cell populations, we analyzed by Fluidigm single tdTomato+/GFP+ double-positive cells from colony 20 at day 32 in dox. Using Pearson distance and average linkage of the gene expression data, we found that these double-positive cells represented an intermediate state between tdTomato+/GFP− and tdTomato−/GFP+ cells (Figure S2A). To test whether tdTomato+/GFP− cells present at day 32 are on the path toward iPSCs or are “stuck,” we sorted 20 cells from colony 20 tdTomato+/GFP−, tdTomato+/GFP+, and tdTomato−/GFP+ cells onto three different feeder plates in dox (Figure S2B). After 5 days, the tdTomato+/GFP− cells gave rise to tdTomato−/GFP+ colonies (Figures S2C and S2D). All groups generated stable, dox-independent tdTomato−/GFP+ iPSCs, albeit with different latencies (Figure S2E). Of the genes examined, Kdm1, a lysine-specific demethylase involved in silencing of viral sequences in mouse ESCs (mESCs) (Macfarlan et al., 2011Macfarlan T.S. Gifford W.D. Agarwal S. Driscoll S. Lettieri K. Wang J. Andrews S.E. Franco L. Rosenfeld M.G. Ren B. Pfaff S.L. Endogenous retroviruses and neighboring genes are coordinately repressed by LSD1/KDM1A.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 594-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), was found differentially expressed between tdTomato+/GFP−, tdTomato+/GFP+, and tdTomato−/GFP+ cells (Figure S2F). These data support the notion that silencing of viral sequences is a common late step in reprogramming. For each profiled subpopulation, we obtained replicate gene expression data for 48 genes in 96 single cells. The Fluidigm microfluidics system combines samples and primer-probe sets for 9,216 quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions. The output of one run on the Biomark is a 96 × 96 matrix of cycle threshold (Ct) values (Figure S3). To globally visualize the data, we used principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a technique used to reduce dimensionality of the data by finding linear combinations (dimensions; in this case, the number of genes) of the original data ranked by their importance. The data are projected to PC1 and PC2, the two most important PCs. In Figure 2A, the gene expression space is 48 dimensional because of the 48 genes, and each of the data points is a cell. The coordinate in each dimension is the normalized gene expression value for a given gene in that cell. Each component has contributions from all of the 48 genes since the components cut across this 48D space. Applied to the expression data derived from 1,864 cells from different stages during reprogramming, we found that the first principal component (PC1) explains 22.5% of the observed variance, whereas the second principal component (PC2) explains 5.8%. These values are lower than in a recent single-cell study of 64-celled embryos (Guo et al., 2010Guo G. Huss M. Tong G.Q. Wang C. Li Sun L. Clarke N.D. Robson P. Resolution of cell fate decisions revealed by single-cell gene expression analysis from zygote to blastocyst.Dev. Cell. 2010; 18: 675-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and may reflect the substantially higher number of cells analyzed and the high degree of cell heterogeneity during reprogramming. A projection of the expression patterns onto PC1 and PC2 separates individual cells into two distinct clusters (blue and red circles) as well as a third cluster (orange dotted circle) representing the early transition from fibroblasts to iPSC precursors (Figure 2A). The first cluster (dark blue, enclosed in the blue circle) contains the three control groups, tail tip fibroblasts (TTF), MEFs, and NGFP2 MEFs. The second cluster (orange, red, brown, enclosed in the red circle) contains dox-dependent and -independent GFP+ cells and the parental NGFP2 iPSCs. The third rather heterogeneous cluster (lighter blue(s), turquoise, green, and yellow, enclosed in the orange dotted circle) contains the GFP− cells exposed to dox for 2, 4, and 6 days and dox-dependent later GFP− cells. This cluster contains induced cells prior to the activation of the Nanog-GFP locus, possibly representing an early intermediate state. Importantly, a few cells from earlier time points (green and yellow dots) showed a similar pattern of expression as in the second cluster. This agrees with the observation that iPS colonies appear with different latencies and that early colonies with ESC-like morphology may not be dox independent. Cells on dox for 4 days cluster very closely to the MEFs, suggesting that the epigenetic changes that characterize a fully reprogrammed iPSC do not occur early in reprogramming (Guo et al., 2010Guo G.

Cell. 2010; 18: 675-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The gap between the orange dotted and red clusters reflects the transition from induced fibroblast to iPSC (Figure 2A). Because PCA components consist of contributions from all 48 genes, it is possible to identify the most information-rich genes in classifying the two clusters (Figure 2B). Of the genes examined, Thy1, Col5a2, Bmi1, Gsk3b, and Hes1 were the most specific markers of the first cluster. For the second cluster, it was Dppa2, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb, Oct4, Sall4, Utf1, Lin28, and Nr6a1, whereas several other pluripotency genes were not strictly associated. For example, Fut4 and Grb2 do not significantly differentiate between the two clusters. Similarly, genes such as Stat3, Hes1, Jag1, Gsk3b, Bmpr1a, Nes, and Wnt1, which are known to be important for the ESC state, are less indicative of the second cluster (Figure 2B). To examine within-group variability combining all genes, we used Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) (Figures 2C and 2D). The parental NGFP2 iPSCs were the least variable group. An increase in variation was seen in MEFs when dox was added followed by a steep decrease after the activation of the Nanog locus (GFP+ cells), suggesting that the activation of the endogenous Nanog locus marks events that drive the cells to pluripotency (Silva et al., 2009Silva J. Nichols J. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. van Oosten A.L. Barrandon O. Wray J. Yamanaka S. Chambers I. Smith A. Nanog is the gateway to the pluripotent ground state.Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Notably, although the dox-independent cells were derived from the same parental cells, they exhibited a higher variation (red) than their parental cells (brown), indicating that each reprogramming event (colony) results in a slightly different epigenetic state (Figure 2C). We used JSD to further examine the variation within and between colonies (Figure 2D) and found that the variation between GFP− and GFP+ cells within a colony was similar to that among all colonies (Figure 2C). Colony 44, which contained only a few cells with low GFP (Figure S1E), exhibited high variation between the GFP+ cells. Colonies 20 and 34, which gave rise to early stable dox-independent iPSC colonies, showed low variation between late GFP− cells (Figure 2D) even early in the process. Notably, all of the colonies that gave rise to fully reprogrammed iPSCs (colonies 43, 16, 20, 34) exhibited a similarly low variation between GFP+ dox-independent cells, indicating significantly reduced variation between single cells after core circuitry activation. Upon retrospective tracing, we found two colonies, 23 and 44, that failed to give rise to stable iPSCs (Figure S4A). Both exhibited early dedifferentiating morphological changes associated with reprogramming (Smith et al., 2010Smith Z.D. Nachman I. Regev A. Meissner A. Dynamic single-cell imaging of direct reprogramming reveals an early specifying event.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), with colony 23 producing homogenous cultures of cells with epiblast stem cell-like morphology (flat colonies), and colony 44 producing transformed-like cells. Colony 23 failed to activate GFP in most cells with only a small fraction activating the endogenous Nanog locus (0.01% GFP+) even after 81 days of culture. Colony 44 contained a few cells with a low level of GFP that appeared at day 61 and disappeared upon continued passaging and dox withdrawal. Because colonies 23 and 44 did not generate iPSCs, they were designated as “partially reprogrammed colonies.” We treated colonies 23 and 44 with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-cytidine (azaC) to test whether methylation of pluripotency genes contributed to the partially reprogrammed state (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). After 30 days of azaC and dox treatment followed by 8 days of azaC and dox withdrawal, GFP+ cells appeared at a frequency of 2.2% in colony 23 and 0.5% in colony 44, compared to none in untreated cells (Figure S4B). These partially reprogrammed colonies were used as a control for fully reprogrammed colonies. To determine whether the variability in single-cell gene expression was a result of differences between distinct cell populations or just stochastic noise, we analyzed our data with violin plots. Population noise and gene expression noise should exhibit unimodal distribution around a reference level in these density plots, whereas a multimodal distribution is indicative of distinct gene expression differences between cell populations. Of the genes examined, we identified a highly conserved zinc finger protein, Ctcf (Phillips and Corces, 2009Phillips J.E. Corces V.G. CTCF: master weaver of the genome.Cell. 2009; 137: 1194-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar), exhibiting unimodal distributions of extremely high expression only in the partially reprogrammed colony 23 tdTomato+/GFP− cells (Figure S4C). To determine whether Ctcf interfered with reprogramming, we overexpressed Ctcf in NGFP2 MEFs (Figure S4D). This resulted in reduced AP staining and fewer GFP+ cells (seen by FACS) after 13 days of dox exposure followed by 3 days of dox withdrawal, suggesting that controlled levels of Ctcf may be important for the reprogramming process (Figures S4E and S4F). High proliferation is one of the hallmarks of mESCs. As an initial control, we used violin plots to analyze the expression of four well-known mESC cell-cycle regulators, Bub1, Ccnf, Cdc20, and Mad2l1. As expected, the expression levels of these genes in single cells were upregulated and were most uniformly expressed in later stage cells and in dox-independent iPSCs (Figure S5A). To examine the expression of established early markers in reprogramming, we analyzed the expression profiles of three well-known markers, Fbxo15, Fgf4, and endogenous Oct4 (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R.

Of the genes examined, all three genes exhibited high expression levels very early in the process (days 2, 4, 6) in a few cells (1 to 8 cells) and were highly expressed in the GFP+ cells as expected for potential early markers. Very early and late in the process, the expression levels of Fbxo15, Fgf4, and endogenous Oct4 were unimodal, with a very narrow peak indicating low variation between individual cells.Figure 3Established Early Markers Are Not Sufficient to Mark Cells that Will Become iPSCsShow full caption(A–C) mRNA expression levels of Fbxo15, Fgf4, and Oct4 (A); Sall4 (B); and Esrrb, Utf1, Lin28, and Dppa2 (C) in populations noted in Figure 1 and legend (upper right) are shown in violin plots.

https://openalex.org/W1974432822,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) expressing GFP were embedded into fibrin matrices containing growth factor cocktails and grafted to sites of severe spinal cord injury. Grafted cells differentiated into multiple cellular phenotypes, including neurons, which extended large numbers of axons over remarkable distances. Extending axons formed abundant synapses with host cells. Axonal growth was partially dependent on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), but not Nogo signaling. Grafted neurons supported formation of electrophysiological relays across sites of complete spinal transection, resulting in functional recovery. Two human stem cell lines (566RSC and HUES7) embedded in growth-factor-containing fibrin exhibited similar growth, and 566RSC cells supported functional recovery. Thus, properties intrinsic to early-stage neurons can overcome the inhibitory milieu of the injured adult spinal cord to mount remarkable axonal growth, resulting in formation of new relay circuits that significantly improve function. These therapeutic properties extend across stem cell sources and species."
https://openalex.org/W2029746613,"DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine (5-mC) is a key epigenetic mark that is critical for various biological and pathological processes. 5-mC can be converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA hydroxylases. Here, we report that ""loss of 5-hmC"" is an epigenetic hallmark of melanoma, with diagnostic and prognostic implications. Genome-wide mapping of 5-hmC reveals loss of the 5-hmC landscape in the melanoma epigenome. We show that downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and TET family enzymes is likely one of the mechanisms underlying 5-hmC loss in melanoma. Rebuilding the 5-hmC landscape in melanoma cells by reintroducing active TET2 or IDH2 suppresses melanoma growth and increases tumor-free survival in animal models. Thus, our study reveals a critical function of 5-hmC in melanoma development and directly links the IDH and TET activity-dependent epigenetic pathway to 5-hmC-mediated suppression of melanoma progression, suggesting a new strategy for epigenetic cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2075928340,"Heart development is exquisitely sensitive to the precise temporal regulation of thousands of genes that govern developmental decisions during differentiation. However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of how chromatin and gene expression patterns are coordinated during developmental transitions in the cardiac lineage. Here, we interrogated the transcriptome and several histone modifications across the genome during defined stages of cardiac differentiation. We find distinct chromatin patterns that are coordinated with stage-specific expression of functionally related genes, including many human disease-associated genes. Moreover, we discover a novel preactivation chromatin pattern at the promoters of genes associated with heart development and cardiac function. We further identify stage-specific distal enhancer elements and find enriched DNA binding motifs within these regions that predict sets of transcription factors that orchestrate cardiac differentiation. Together, these findings form a basis for understanding developmentally regulated chromatin transitions during lineage commitment and the molecular etiology of congenital heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2084377803,"Ubiquitin-dependent signaling during the DNA damage response (DDR) to double-strand breaks (DSBs) is initiated by two E3 ligases, RNF8 and RNF168, targeting histone H2A and H2AX. RNF8 is the first ligase recruited to the damage site, and RNF168 follows RNF8-dependent ubiquitination. This suggests that RNF8 initiates H2A/H2AX ubiquitination with K63-linked ubiquitin chains and RNF168 extends them. Here, we show that RNF8 is inactive toward nucleosomal H2A, whereas RNF168 catalyzes the monoubiquitination of the histones specifically on K13-15. Structure-based mutagenesis of RNF8 and RNF168 RING domains shows that a charged residue determines whether nucleosomal proteins are recognized. We find that K63 ubiquitin chains are conjugated to RNF168-dependent H2A/H2AX monoubiquitination at K13-15 and not on K118-119. Using a mutant of RNF168 unable to target histones but still catalyzing ubiquitin chains at DSBs, we show that ubiquitin chains per se are insufficient for signaling, but RNF168 target ubiquitination is required for DDR."
https://openalex.org/W2077219861,"Immune recognition of protein antigens relies on the combined interaction of multiple antibody loops, which provide a fairly large footprint and constrain the size and shape of protein surfaces that can be targeted. Single protein loops can mediate extremely high-affinity binding, but it is unclear whether such a mechanism is available to antibodies. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an antibody called C05, which neutralizes strains from multiple subtypes of influenza A virus, including H1, H2 and H3. X-ray and electron microscopy structures show that C05 recognizes conserved elements of the receptor-binding site on the haemagglutinin surface glycoprotein. Recognition of the haemagglutinin receptor-binding site is dominated by a single heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 loop, with minor contacts from heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 1, and is sufficient to achieve nanomolar binding with a minimal footprint. Thus, binding predominantly with a single loop can allow antibodies to target small, conserved functional sites on otherwise hypervariable antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1967902354,"NRAS-driven melanomas have limited therapeutic options. Combining genetically engineered models and oncogenic signaling inhibitors with rational systems-biology approaches, the authors compare the effects of genetic extinction of NRAS to that of chemical pathway inhibition targeting downstream MEK. The differences provide actionable targets by revealing that NRAS signaling operates as a gated output and that MEK inhibition, although inducing apoptosis, is not able to achieve further inhibition of NRAS-induced outputs such as cell-cycle progression. A combination of MEK and CDK4 inhibitors provides a more complete inhibition of NRAS signaling and a more effective antitumor effect in vivo. The discovery of potent inhibitors of the BRAF proto-oncogene has revolutionized therapy for melanoma harboring mutations in BRAF, yet NRAS-mutant melanoma remains without an effective therapy. Because direct pharmacological inhibition of the RAS proto-oncogene has thus far been unsuccessful, we explored systems biology approaches to identify synergistic drug combination(s) that can mimic RAS inhibition. Here, leveraging an inducible mouse model of NRAS-mutant melanoma, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activates apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest, which is in contrast to complete genetic neuroblastoma RAS homolog (NRAS) extinction, which triggers both of these effects. Network modeling pinpointed cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key driver of this differential phenotype. Accordingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial synergy in therapeutic efficacy. We suggest a gradient model of oncogenic NRAS signaling in which the output is gated, resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological phenotypes as a result of incomplete inhibition. Such a gated signaling model offers a new framework to identify nonobvious coextinction target(s) for combined pharmacological inhibition in NRAS-mutant melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2062690397,"The lymphatic network that transports interstitial fluid and antigens to lymph nodes constitutes a conduit system that can be hijacked by invading pathogens to achieve systemic spread unless dissemination is blocked in the lymph node itself. Here, we show that a network of diverse lymphoid cells (natural killer cells, γδ T cells, natural killer T cells, and innate-like CD8+ T cells) are spatially prepositioned close to lymphatic sinus-lining sentinel macrophages where they can rapidly and efficiently receive inflammasome-generated IL-18 and additional cytokine signals from the pathogen-sensing phagocytes. This leads to rapid IFNγ secretion by the strategically positioned innate lymphocytes, fostering antimicrobial resistance in the macrophage population. Interference with this innate immune response loop allows systemic spread of lymph-borne bacteria. These findings extend our understanding of the functional significance of cellular positioning and local intercellular communication within lymph nodes while emphasizing the role of these organs as highly active locations of innate host defense."

We show that differentiation of human ESCs into cardiovascular cells is accompanied by programmed temporal alterations in chromatin structure that distinguish key regulators of cardiovascular development from other genes. We used this temporal chromatin signature to identify regulators of cardiac development, including the homeobox gene MEIS2. Using the zebrafish model, we demonstrate that MEIS2 is critical for proper heart tube formation and subsequent cardiac looping.

Indeed, “bivalent” promoters marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in pluripotent cells are found to have either the H3K4me3 or the H3K27me3 mark (but not both) in definitive cell types, implying that this bivalency resolves to either a transcriptionally active or silent state (Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S.

It is currently unknown how Polycomb- and Trithorax-related histone modification patterns evolve during the transition from pluripotency to definitive cells during lineage differentiation. Moreover, because Polycomb-driven marking of key regulatory genes in ESCs is not specific to any given lineage, it is currently not possible to identify lineage-specific regulators simply from the chromatin state of pluripotent stem cells. We sought to determine whether temporal patterning of histone modifications during differentiation along a defined lineage would clarify the relationships among key regulators of lineage-specific differentiation and further distinguish regulatory from lineage-specific structural genes. Specifically, we hypothesized that key regulators of differentiation would show stage-specific changes in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 because inappropriate activation or silencing of these genes could alter cell fate by affecting many downstream target genes.

We therefore asked how chromatin modifications evolve temporally along the cardiac differentiation axis and whether the temporal patterning of histone modifications might provide a reliable signature that could discriminate key known regulators of cardiovascular development, as well as enable the identification of previously undiscovered regulators. Directed differentiation of H7 human ESCs to the cardiovascular lineage was achieved by allowing the cells to form embryoid bodies (EBs) in the presence of defined serum-free medium as previously described (Kattman et al., 2011Kattman S.J.

Mesoderm induction was accomplished using bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), activin A and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). On day 5 (T5) of differentiation, a tripotential cardiovascular progenitor emerges, identified based on low expression of VEGFR2 (KDR) and PDGFRα (Kattman et al., 2011Kattman S.J. Witty A.D. Gagliardi M. Dubois N.C. Niapour M. Hotta A. Ellis J. Keller G. Stage-specific optimization of activin/nodal and BMP signaling promotes cardiac differentiation of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell lines.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 228-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Over time, this progenitor gives rise to cultures that contain predominantly cardiomyocytes and also contain endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, identified by flow cytometry for cardiac troponin T (cTnT), CD31/PECAM1, and smooth muscle alpha actin (SMA), respectively (Figure S1 available online). For all genome-wide experiments, parallel samples were maintained in culture after the times of harvest for immunoprecipitation, and only runs that were >80% KDR+/PDGFRα+ at the T5 progenitor stage and >50% cTnT+ cardiomyocytes at the T14 definitive cardiovascular cell stage were used. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3 modifications genome-wide at five key developmental stages during cardiovascular directed differentiation including pluripotent cells (T0), mesodermal progenitors (T2), specified tripotential cardiovascular progenitors (T5), committed cardiovascular cells (T9), and definitive cardiovascular cells (primarily cardiomyocytes, T14). We performed differentiation and ChIP-seq experiments in duplicate, with high reproducibility between biological replicates at each time point (average Pearson correlation 0.94). Figure S2A shows two biological replicates for chromatin modification at the TBX5 locus, a transcription factor (TF) implicated in generation of the first heart field (Takeuchi et al., 2003Takeuchi J.K. Ohgi M. Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Shiratori H. Sakaki I. Ogura K. Saijoh Y. Ogura T. Tbx5 specifies the left/right ventricles and ventricular septum position during cardiogenesis.Development. 2003; 130: 5953-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Across all time points, all three histone modification patterns with respect to the transcription start site (TSS) showed the expected morphologies (Figure S2B), with H3K4me3 signal peaking within a narrow window around the TSS, H3K27me3 signal peaking in the vicinity of the TSS (though more broadly distributed than H3K4me3) with a prominent decrease over the TSS (consistent with reduced nucleosomal density and increased turnover in this region [Möbius and Gerland, 2010Möbius W. Gerland U. Quantitative test of the barrier nucleosome model for statistical positioning of nucleosomes up- and downstream of transcription start sites.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2010; 6: 6Google Scholar]), and H3K36me3 signal increasing rapidly from the TSS region to a plateau over the gene body, consistent with its deposition by the elongating polymerase complex (Pjanic et al., 2011Pjanic M. Pjanic P. Schmid C. Ambrosini G. Gaussin A. Plasari G. Mazza C. Bucher P. Mermod N. Nuclear factor I revealed as family of promoter binding transcription activators.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the pattern of sequential epigenetic alterations accompanying cardiovascular differentiation, we next examined the histone modification profiles and RNA expression of genes with established roles in heart development and function. These ranged from sequence-specific transcriptional regulators, such as NKX2.5 (Figure 1A), to cardiomyocyte contractile proteins, including alpha myosin heavy chain (MYH6) (Figure 1B), as well as genes expressed in cardiovascular progenitors, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (Figures S3A–S3C). A majority of cardiac transcription factors showed high levels of H3K27me3 during pluripotency that gradually decreased as differentiation progresses, paralleled by gradual increases in H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and RNA expression (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1E). Similarly, many of the members of key signaling pathways involved in cardiac development, such as the TGFβ family, Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, the FGF family, PDGF, and VEGF showed stage-specific activation (H3K4me3, H3K36me3, RNA expression) and repression (H3K27me3), compatible with tight control over signaling pathways that direct cell fate (Figure S3D). In contrast, although genes encoding cardiomyocyte contractile proteins showed similar time-dependent increases in H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and RNA expression, these genes did not have appreciable levels of H3K27me3 deposition at any time (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1F). As such, the temporal evolution of histone modifications provides a chromatin “signature” that differentiates key cardiac regulatory genes, including both transcription factors and soluble signals, from lineage-specific genes encoding proteins that regulate cardiac function and homeostasis.Figure S3Histone Modification and RNA Expression Patterns for Genes Expressed in Different Cell Types, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–I) Patterns are shown for: (A) genes expressed in cardiovascular progenitors, (B) genes expressed in smooth muscle cells, (C) genes expressed in endothelium, (D) signaling pathway molecules involved in cardiovascular development, (E) genes involved in mesoderm specification, (F) genes expressed in skeletal muscle, (G) genes expressed in hematopoietic cells, (H) genes involved in neuroectoderm specification and differentiation or function of neuroectoderm derivatives, and (I), genes involved in endoderm specification and differentiation or function of endoderm derivatives.

All other genes are shown in black text on white background. The top 10 from this figure are displayed in Figure 2. To assess the cardiac lineage-specificity of the temporal chromatin signature for cardiac regulators, we compared this signature with the temporal chromatin patterns at genes involved in specification of noncardiac mesoderm, neuroectoderm and endoderm fates (Figures S3E–S3I). Similar to cardiac transcription factors, most of the major transcription factor genes involved in hematopoiesis (e.g., TAL1, RUNX1, HHEX and LMO2) and skeletal muscle differentiation (e.g., MYOD1, MYF5, and MYF6) had low levels of H3K4me3 and high levels of H3K27me3 in the pluripotent state. However unlike cardiac TFs, noncardiac factors do not activate in this system and generally resolve to only H3K27me3 by T5. Some lineage-selective factors such as GATA1, a key regulator of erythroid fate, showed negligible levels of any of the histone modifications at any time point. Genes encoding transcription factors involved in neuroectoderm differentiation, such as NEUROD1, show high levels of H3K27me3 (often in large domains (Guenther et al., 2010Guenther M.G. Frampton G.M. Soldner F. Hockemeyer D. Mitalipova M. Jaenisch R. Young R.A. Chromatin structure and gene expression programs of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 249-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar)) in combination with low H3K4me3 in the pluripotent state (Figure S3H). But whereas H3K27me3 levels at neuroectodermal genes remain high throughout differentiation, they evince a dramatic drop in H3K4me3 by T2. Notably, hematopoietic and skeletal muscle transcription factors also show declines in H3K4me3 but not until T5. This ordering recapitulates the later fate choice for mesoderm subtypes versus the early choice of primary germ layer (mesoderm versus ectoderm). Interestingly, several genes typically associated with endoderm formation are activated at T5, including FOXA2 and SOX17. This could be due to the presence of a small number of endodermal cells in our cultures or the fact that many of these genes have roles in both mesoderm and endoderm formation. We next sought to determine if the temporal chromatin signature of cardiac regulators could be used to identify regulators of human cardiac development. Using a curated set of known cardiac regulators (Figure 1), we developed a classifier based on the concomitant induction of mRNA, loss of H3K27me3 marks, and anticorrelation coefficients of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 signals over the time course (see Experimental Methods). Next, we scored each gene against the classifier and rank-ordered each gene at T5, T9, and T14 by its classification score. For comparison, we performed a similar ranking using a classifier based on mRNA expression only. Figure 2A shows the top ten genes at each time point using each algorithm, functionally annotated as cardiac developmental regulators, cardiac structural genes, developmental regulators with unknown cardiac roles, and all other genes (including unknown cardiac or developmental roles). A list of the top 100 genes identified by using expression alone and chromatin + expression at each time point is shown in Figure S4. Using mRNA expression alone, 14 nonredundant genes comprised the top 10 list at the three time points. Of these, six (43%) encoded cardiac structural proteins, five (36%) encoded known cardiac developmental regulators, one (7%) encoded a developmental regulator with unknown cardiac function, and two (14%) were genes with unknown function. Using the chromatin + expression method, the top ten lists across all time points contained 15 nonredundant genes. In contrast to the mRNA expression-only approach, 11 of these genes (73%) encode developmental regulators with known cardiac roles, three others (20%) encode developmental regulators with unknown cardiac roles, and one gene (7%) encodes a protein of unknown function. Interestingly, this gene (CCDC92) is predicted to contain a coiled-coil domain, which is found in many transcription factors. Notably, none of the top-scoring genes in the combined algorithm encode cardiac structural proteins. Beyond the top 10, the chromatin + expression algorithm identified many genes with less well-defined roles in cardiac development including transcription factors, cell surface proteins, signaling ligands, extracellular matrix proteins, and enzymes. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that the top 100 genes identified by using chromatin + expression are highly enriched for regulation of transcription and differentiation functions (Figure 2B). To determine the accuracy with which each classifier could discriminate known cardiac regulators from all other genes, and specifically from cardiac structural genes, we computed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each class using both the mRNA expression-only and the chromatin + expression classifier. These showed that the combined (histone modification + expression) classifier had extremely high sensitivity and specificity both for discrimination of cardiac regulators from all genes (ROC = 0.994) and from cardiac structural proteins (ROC = 1.000) (Figure 2C). By contrast, a classifier based on temporal mRNA patterns alone can reasonably discriminate genes with a cardiac role from all other genes but cannot distinguish regulators from cardiomyocyte structural proteins involved in muscle contraction and energy production. The selective discrimination of genes regulating cardiac differentiation by comparison of epigenetic profiles and expression led us to ask whether we could identify factors not"

We found no differences in DNA methylation between irreversible worker and queen castes, but substantial differences between nurses and forager subcastes. Reverting foragers back to nurses reestablished methylation levels for a majority of genes and provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence in any organism of reversible epigenetic changes associated with behavior."

Sequence analysis predicted major TFs binding at epigenomically annotated hNCC enhancers, including a master NC regulator, TFAP2A, and nuclear receptors NR2F1 and NR2F2. Although many TF binding events occur outside enhancers, sites coinciding with enhancer chromatin signatures show significantly higher sequence constraint, nucleosomal depletion, correlation with gene expression, and functional conservation in NCC isolated from chicken embryos.

Recent studies showed that epigenomic profiling of chromatin features commonly associated with enhancers, including occupancy of general transcriptional coactivators, hypersensitivity to nucleases, and enrichment of certain histone marks at flanking nucleosomes, allows for identification of enhancers in a genome-wide, cell-type-specific, and conservation-independent manner (Heintzman et al., 2009Heintzman N.D.

We reasoned that hESC differentiation models combined with epigenomic enhancer annotation and sequence analysis of the underlying DNA can be used as an unbiased approach to identify main TFs driving gene expression in transient cell types arising during human development. As a proof of concept, we focus here on the NCC, a vertebrate-specific transient embryonic cell group that is ectodermal in origin but upon delamination from the neural tube acquires a remarkably broad differentiation potential and ability to migrate throughout the body to give rise to craniofacial bones and cartilages, peripheral nervous system, pigment cells, and certain cardiac structures (Gammill and Bronner-Fraser, 2003Gammill L.S.

Aberrant NC development is associated with a broad variety of congenital malformations, known as neurocristopathies, which, due to a critical contribution of the NC to the head mesenchyme, often manifest in deafness and complex craniofacial defects and include a large variety of syndromes, as well as nonsyndromic manifestations, such as cleft lip and palate, one of the most common congenital defects (Birnbaum et al., 2009Birnbaum S.

Regulatory events that accompany NC formation occur at 3 to 6 weeks of human gestation and are largely inaccessible for studies in an embryonic context (Betters et al., 2010Betters E. Liu Y. Kjaeldgaard A. Sundström E. García-Castro M.I. Analysis of early human neural crest development.Dev. Biol. 2010; 344: 578-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To overcome this limitation we previously developed an in vitro hESC differentiation model, which recapitulates gene expression, migratory potential, and differentiation characteristics of NCC (Bajpai et al., 2010Bajpai R. Chen D.A. Rada-Iglesias A. Zhang J. Xiong Y. Helms J. Chang C.P. Zhao Y. Swigut T. Wysocka J. CHD7 cooperates with PBAF to control multipotent neural crest formation.Nature. 2010; 463: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Here we use this model for genome-wide analyses of chromatin marking patterns, gene expression, and TF occupancy in hNCC. Through these analyses we annotate hNCC enhancer regions and subsequently predict and confirm that they are commonly co-occupied by the NC lineage specifier TFAP2A and orphan nuclear receptors NR2F1/2. We further show that these TFs synergize to bring about active chromatin states and demonstrate the requirement for NR2F1 function in NC gene expression, enhancer activity, and morphogenesis of the ectomesenchyme. To obtain NCC for genomic analyses, we used an in vitro differentiation model in which hESC are first induced to form neuroectodermal spheres (hNEC) that subsequently give rise to migratory cells expressing early NC markers and recapitulating neuronal, mesenchymal, and melanocytic differentiation potential of the NC (Bajpai et al., 2010Bajpai R.

CHD7 cooperates with PBAF to control multipotent neural crest formation.Nature. 2010; 463: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To examine chromatin patterns associated with NC regulatory regions we performed ChIP-seq analyses from hNCC population in which both premigratory and migratory anterior NC fates were represented, using antibodies recognizing p300, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 (Figure S1A available online). We identified over 4,300 genomic elements marked by the active enhancer signature (Heintzman et al., 2009Heintzman N.D. Hon G.C. Hawkins R.D. Kheradpour P. Stark A. Harp L.F. Ye Z. Lee L.K.

Typical of enhancers, identified elements were generally located within 1–200 kb away from the nearest transcription start site (TSS; Figure S1B), overlapped with FAIRE hypersensitive sites (Figure S1C), and were on average more evolutionary constrained than flanking noncoding regions (Figure S1D). Comparisons of hNCC ChIP-seq results with the corresponding data sets from hESC and hNEC (Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011Rada-Iglesias A. Bajpai R. Swigut T. Brugmann S.A. Flynn R.A. Wysocka J.

In contrast to enhancers, considerably less cell-type-specific variation was observed in chromatin marking patterns at proximal promoter regions (Figure S1E). Thus, enhancer utilization is highly dynamic even among the genetically matched and transient cell types examined in our studies. Due to their extreme developmental plasticity, human NCC are postulated to share many properties of hESC (d’Aquino et al., 2011d’Aquino R. Tirino V. Desiderio V. Studer M. De Angelis G.C. Laino L. De Rosa A. Di Nucci D. Martino S. Paino F. et al.Human neural crest-derived postnatal cells exhibit remarkable embryonic attributes either in vitro or in vivo.Eur. Cell.

Adult craniofacial stem cells: sources and relation to the neural crest.Stem Cell Rev. 2012; 8: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Among prevalent features of hESC chromatin are so-called bivalent promoters (marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) (Zhao et al., 2007Zhao X.D. Han X. Chew J.L. Liu J. Chiu K.P. Choo A. Orlov Y.L. Sung W.K. Shahab A. Kuznetsov V.A. et al.Whole-genome mapping of histone H3 Lys4 and 27 trimethylations reveals distinct genomic compartments in human embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 286-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and poised developmental enhancers characterized by the presence of H3K27me3 instead of H3K27ac (Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011Rada-Iglesias A. Bajpai R. Swigut T. Brugmann S.A. Flynn R.A. Wysocka J. A unique chromatin signature uncovers early developmental enhancers in humans.Nature. 2011; 470: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). We observed these features to be much less abundant in hNCC, whereas the number of enhancers and promoters marked by active signatures is comparable between the two cell types (Figures 1E and 1F). This result is not an artifact of ineffective H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in hNCC, as the number of H3K27me3-only marked promoters is higher in hNCC than in hESC. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that a portion of the observed hNCC bivalent promoters and poised enhancers arises from heterogeneity in the hNCC population, rather than true bivalency. Regardless, our results suggest that hNCC did not broadly coopt typical hESC chromatin features; however, it remains a possibility that rare cells within our population do exhibit hESC-like properties. To test whether the presence of the identified putative enhancer regions positively correlates with expression of nearby genes, we performed polyA transcriptome analysis of hNCC by RNA-seq and validated the results by RT-qPCR analysis of selected transcripts (Data S2, Figure S1F). Transcriptome profiling confirmed our earlier observations that hNCC express well-characterized NC markers (e.g., TWIST1, SNAI1, SNAI2, SOX9, SOX10, SOX11, FOXD3, NGFR [p75], and TFAP2A) and showed that these cells are HOX-negative and DLX1/2-positive, a gene expression pattern consistent with the dorsal-anterior cranial NCC, which preferentially differentiate into ectomesenchymal derivatives and give rise to the majority of craniofacial bones and cartilages (Minoux and Rijli, 2010Minoux M. Rijli F.M. Molecular mechanisms of cranial neural crest cell migration and patterning in craniofacial development.Development. 2010; 137: 2605-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We next examined expression of transcripts arising from the TSS closest to hNCC enhancers and observed a strong positive correlation between identified regions and genes highly expressed and upregulated in hNCC (Figure 1G). Functional annotation of hNCC enhancers using GREAT (McLean et al., 2010McLean C.Y. Bristor D. Hiller M. Clarke S.L. Schaar B.T. Lowe C.B. Wenger A.M. Bejerano G. GREAT improves functional interpretation of cis-regulatory regions.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar) showed association with genes expressed in neurectoderm, branchial arches, and head mesenchyme consistent with the dorsal-anterior premigratory and migratory NC identity of the analyzed cell population (Figure 2A , top panel). Strikingly, when we considered mouse phenotypes associated with deletion of genes linked to the identified enhancers, the most enriched categories included abnormalities of cranial bones, neural tube defects, and malformations of NC-derived facial structures, such as the mandible, maxilla, and palate (Figure 2A, middle panel). Moreover, when associations with human malformations were considered, enriched categories included cleft lip/palate, abnormalities of palpebral fissures and ear structures, and other craniofacial anomalies, all consistent with defects of cranial NC-derived head mesenchyme (Passos-Bueno et al., 2009Passos-Bueno M.R. Ornelas C.C. Fanganiello R.D. Syndromes of the first and second pharyngeal arches: A review.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2009; 149A: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as well as open (patent) ductus arteriosus, a specialized heart blood vessel derived largely from the cardiac NC (Ivey et al., 2008Ivey K.N. Sutcliffe D. Richardson J. Clyman R.I. Garcia J.A. Srivastava D. Transcriptional regulation during development of the ductus arteriosus.Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A, bottom panel). Association with hand malformations was also detected, which is not unexpected, as limb anomalies are commonly associated with neurocristopathies (Tucker et al., 1999Tucker A.S. Al Khamis A. Ferguson C.A. Bach I. Rosenfeld M.G. Sharpe P.T. Conserved regulation of mesenchymal gene expression by Fgf-8 in face and limb development.Development. 1999; 126: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of genes previously implicated in NC development, Wnt signaling, cell migration, and malformations including cleft lip/palate, frontonasal dysplasia, and patent ductus arteriosus have at least one hNCC enhancer located in relative proximity (select functional categories and corresponding genes are shown in Table S1). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the identified elements represent bona fide active enhancers relevant for NC gene expression, human craniofacial development, and neurocristopathogenesis. Regulatory regions commonly show lower evolutionary constraint than coding sequences (Bulger and Groudine, 2010Bulger M. Groudine M. Enhancers: the abundance and function of regulatory sequences beyond promoters.Dev. Biol. 2010; 339: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, Bulger and Groudine, 2011Bulger M. Groudine M. Functional and mechanistic diversity of distal transcription enhancers.Cell. 2011; 144: 327-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, for 23% of the hNCC enhancer regions, corresponding conserved sequences can be identified in the chicken genome. Therefore, to further support biological relevance of the identified human enhancers, we examined conservation of H3K27ac, a chromatin mark closely associated with enhancer activity, at these corresponding regions in chicken NCC. To obtain chicken NCC we dissected the dorsal anterior neural folds from embryos prior to the onset of NC migration (st8) and cultured them ex vivo for 72 hr (approximately st11–14), allowing NCC to emigrate out (Figure 2B). In parallel, we dissected the frontonasal prominences of st20 embryos and separated NCC away from the epithelium (Figure 2C) (Brugmann et al., 2010Brugmann S.A. Powder K.E. Young N.M. Goodnough L.H. Hahn S.M. James A.W. Helms J.A. Lovett M. Comparative gene expression analysis of avian embryonic facial structures reveals new candidates for human craniofacial disorders.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We chose the frontonasal prominence over other facial prominences because it is solely comprised of NC mesenchyme. These early and late chicken NCC populations were then analyzed by H3K27ac ChIP-seq. Average H3K27ac enrichment profiles were generated over chicken genomic regions corresponding to hNCC enhancers or, to control for specificity, those corresponding to hESC enhancers. Remarkably, regions corresponding to hNCC enhancers showed high enrichment of H3K27ac in chicken NCC (both early and late) with a characteristic central dip in enrichment profile, indicative of the presence of nucleosomal depletion/hypermobility regions typical of enhancers (Figures 2D and 2E). As exemplified by the conserved enhancer acetylation patterns at select NC gene loci, corresponding chicken enhancers were acetylated either in both chicken NCC populations or preferentially in one population (e.g., compare PLXND1 and ETS1 loci with MYCN locus) (Figure S2A). Taken together, these results validate biological relevance of our analysis and uncover conservation of H3K27ac patterns at NCC enhancers between species. To further substantiate functional conservation of identified regulatory regions, we selected three human elements and tested their activity in vivo in the zebrafish transgenic enhancer reporter assay (Figure S2B). The selected enhancers (named A, B, and C) were proximal to, respectively, WNT1, CCND1, and BMP7 genes and corresponded to uncharacterized genomic sequences, with the exception of the WNT1 proximal enhancer, which falls within a broader region homologous to that commonly used as WNT1 NC-specific driver in mouse conditional knockout experiments (Echelard et al., 1994Echelard Y. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Cis-acting regulatory sequences governing Wnt-1 expression in the developing mouse CNS.Development. 1994; 120: 2213-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, all three tested enhancers showed GFP expression in cranial NCC migrating to anterior branchial arches, as demonstrated by colocalization with Sox10 reporter-labeled cells (in red) (Figure S2C). In addition, enhancers proximal to WNT1 and BMP7 showed activity in the dorsal neural tube, where delaminating NCC could be observed (Figure S2C). We hypothesized that interrogation of DNA sequence motifs most recurrent at hNCC enhancer regions will reveal identity of major TFs driving NC gene expression. The most highly overrepresented motif corresponds to the recognition sequence for TFAP2A (a.k.a. AP2α), a TF implicated in NC induction, specification, and differentiation (Figure 2F) (de Crozé et al., 2011de Crozé N. Maczkowiak F. Monsoro-Burq A.H. Reiterative AP2a activity controls sequential steps in the neural crest gene regulatory network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). TFAP2A deletion in mice results in severe dysmorphogenesis of the face, skull, sensory organs, and cranial ganglia (Schorle et al., 1996Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Transcription factor AP-2 essential for cranial closure and craniofacial development.Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), whereas in humans mutations in TFAP2A cause autosomal-dominant branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS), characterized by malformations of craniofacial structures of NC origin (Milunsky et al., 2008Milunsky J.M. Maher T.A. Zhao G. Roberts A.E. Stalker H.J. Zori R.T. Burch M.N. Clemens M. Mulliken J.B. Smith R. Lin A.E. TFAP2A mutations result in branchio-oculo-facial syndrome.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 1171-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Despite the critical role of TFAP2A, its genomic location in the context of NC remains unknown. To test whether TFAP2A is broadly associated with hNCC enhancers we performed TFAP2A ChIP-seq analysis, which identified 16,851 high-confidence binding sites, of which 12,305 (73%) were promoter distal (Figures 3A–3B ). As expected, the TFAP2A consensus binding sequence was the most overrepresented motif among bound regions, even in a de novo analysis (Figure 3C), with ∼90% of bound regions containing at least one strong TFAP2A consensus binding sequence. Importantly, 30% of all hNCC enhancer regions were bound by TFAP2A (a representative locus is shown in Figure 3A), indicating extensive occupancy of TFAP2A at hNCC enhancers. To further validate our data we performed ChIP-qPCR analyses from cells corresponding to two developmental time points: (1) neuroectodermal rosettes (hNEC) just prior to NC migration and (2) hNCC after migration from rosettes. Low or no TFAP2A binding was detected at any of the interrogated regions in hNEC, but significant TFAP2A enrichment was observed at enhancers bound by TFAP2A according to ChIP-seq in hNCC (Figure 3D). Although nearly one-third of hNCC enhancer regions are occupied by TFAP2A, surprisingly, only 10% of distal TFAP2A sites coincide with the presence of the active enhancer signature, with an additional 30% of sites occurring within regions marked by a “partial” signature (that is, only p300 or only enhancer-associated histone modifications) (Figure 3E). To examine whether the presence or absence of enhancer signatures at TFAP2A sites reflects biologically meaningful differences, we compared genomic properties of TFAP2A sites with or without enhancer chromatin signatures. On average, TFAP2A enrichment levels at regions overlapping active signatures were less than 1.5-fold higher than over unmarked regions (Figure 3F). Indeed, robust TFAP2A binding at sites occurring within unmarked chromatin was evident upon examination of individual loci (for a representative example, see Figure 3B), indicating that unmarked sites do not simply represent weak affinity associations. Strikingly, both nucleosomal depletion/hypermobility measured by FAIRE, as well as DNA sequence conservation, were substantially stronger at TFAP2A sites overlapping active signatures than at those unmarked, with sites overlapping “partial” signatures falling in between (Figures 3G and 3H). Although, on average, TFAP2A-bound regions overlapping active signatures were more evolutionary constrained in sequence, we could still identify many unmarked TFAP2A sites conserved in the chicken genome. Nonetheless, when we compared H3K27ac patterns over these corresponding regions in chicken NCC, we observed that conserved TFAP2A sites that coincided with active signatures in hNCC were also enriched for H2K27ac in chicken NCC, while conserved unmarked TFAP2A sites showed no such enrichment (Figure 3I, Figure S3), supporting functional conservation of TFAP2A binding events. Importantly, TFAP2A sites overlapping active or partial enhancer signatures were linked to genes highly expressed and upregulated in hNCC, but unmarked TFAP2A sites showed no correlation with elevated expression in any of the examined cell types (Figure 3J). Similarly, functional annotation of TFAP2A sites overlapping active enhancers linked them to NC and craniofacial genes, whereas unmarked TFAP2A sites lacked clear association with NC or other tissues (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that chromatin signatures can facilitate identification of TFAP2A sites relevant for NC gene expression (and, perhaps more generally, identification of productively engaged TF sites, see Discussion) and indicate that TFAP2A binding is not sufficient for the assembly of the productive enhanceosome complexes. We hypothesized that to activate NC gene expression, TFAP2A cooperates with additional sequence-specific TFs binding at hNCC enhancer elements. We reasoned that such factors should be well expressed in NC and their recognition motifs overrepresented at hNCC enhancers. We therefore re-examined enriched hNCC enhancer sequence motifs, which, in addition to the TFAP2A motif, included those for zinc finger protein ZIC1; the insulator binding protein"

https://openalex.org/W2075887668,"Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus involves activation of quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) to yield transiently amplifying NSCs, progenitors, and, ultimately, neurons that affect learning and memory. This process is tightly controlled by microenvironmental cues, although a few endogenous factors are known to regulate neuronal differentiation. Astrocytes have been implicated, but their role in juxtacrine (that is, cell-cell contact dependent) signaling in NSC niches has not been investigated. We found that ephrin-B2 presented from rodent hippocampal astrocytes regulated neurogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, clonal analysis in NSC fate-mapping studies revealed a previously unknown role for ephrin-B2 in instructing neuronal differentiation. In addition, ephrin-B2 signaling, transduced by EphB4 receptors on NSCs, activated β-catenin in vitro and in vivo independently of Wnt signaling and upregulated proneural transcription factors. Ephrin-B2(+) astrocytes therefore promote neuronal differentiation of adult NSCs through juxtacrine signaling, findings that advance our understanding of adult neurogenesis and may have future regenerative medicine implications."
https://openalex.org/W2165918521,"A defining feature of vertebrate immunity is the acquisition of immunological memory, which confers enhanced protection against pathogens by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Here, we compared responses by virus-specific naive T cells (T(N)) and central memory T cells (T(CM)) to viral antigen challenge in lymph nodes (LNs). In steady-state LNs, both T cell subsets localized in the deep T cell area and interacted similarly with antigen-presenting dendritic cells. However, upon entry of lymph-borne virus, only T(CM) relocalized rapidly and efficiently toward the outermost LN regions in the medullary, interfollicular, and subcapsular areas where viral infection was initially confined. This rapid peripheralization was coordinated by a cascade of cytokines and chemokines, particularly ligands for T(CM)-expressed CXCR3. Consequently, in vivo recall responses to viral infection by CXCR3-deficient T(CM) were markedly compromised, indicating that early antigen detection afforded by intranodal chemokine guidance of T(CM) is essential for efficient antiviral memory."

Global or endothelial-cell-specific deficiency of PI3K-C2α resulted in embryonic lethality caused by defects in sprouting angiogenesis and vascular maturation. PI3K-C2α knockdown in endothelial cells resulted in a decrease in the number of PI3-phosphate-enriched endosomes, impaired endosomal trafficking, defective delivery of VE-cadherin to endothelial cell junctions and defective junction assembly. PI3K-C2α knockdown also impaired endothelial cell signaling, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor internalization and endosomal RhoA activation. Together, the effects of PI3K-C2α knockdown led to defective endothelial cell migration, proliferation, tube formation and barrier integrity. Endothelial PI3K-C2α deficiency in vivo suppressed postischemic and tumor angiogenesis and diminished vascular barrier function with a greatly augmented susceptibility to anaphylaxis and a higher incidence of dissecting aortic aneurysm formation in response to angiotensin II infusion. Thus, PI3K-C2α has a crucial role in vascular formation and barrier integrity and represents a new therapeutic target for vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1981379568,"In nonhuman primates, we previously demonstrated that a maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) induces fetal nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alters the fetal metabolome. These changes are accompanied by altered acetylation of histone H3 (H3K14ac). However, the mechanism behind this alteration in acetylation remains unknown. As SIRT1 is both a lysine deacetylase and a crucial sensor of cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that SIRT1 may be involved in fetal epigenomic alterations. Here we show that in utero exposure to a MHFD, but not maternal obesity per se, increases fetal H3K14ac with concomitant decreased SIRT1 expression and diminished in vitro protein and histone deacetylase activity. MHFD increased H3K14ac and DBC1-SIRT1 complex formation in fetal livers, both of which were abrogated with diet reversal despite persistent maternal obesity. Moreover, MHFD was associated with altered expression of known downstream effectors deregulated in NAFLD and modulated by SIRT1 (e.g., PPARΑ, PPARG, SREBF1, CYP7A1, FASN, and SCD). Finally, ex vivo purified SIRT1 retains deacetylase activity on an H3K14ac peptide substrate with preferential activity toward acetylated histone H3; mutagenesis of the catalytic domain of SIRT1 (H363Y) abrogates H3K14ac deacetylation. Our data implicate SIRT1 as a likely molecular mediator of the fetal epigenome and metabolome under MHFD conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2115897508,"Transcription elongation is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of gene regulation. Here, we show that microprocessor controls gene expression in an RNAi-independent manner. Microprocessor orchestrates the recruitment of termination factors Setx and Xrn2, and the 3'-5' exoribonuclease, Rrp6, to initiate RNAPII pausing and premature termination at the HIV-1 promoter through cleavage of the stem-loop RNA, TAR. Rrp6 further processes the cleavage product, which generates a small RNA that is required to mediate potent transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling at the HIV-1 promoter. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified cellular gene targets whose transcription is modulated by microprocessor. Our study reveals RNAPII pausing and premature termination mediated by the co-operative activity of ribonucleases, Drosha/Dgcr8, Xrn2, and Rrp6, as a regulatory mechanism of RNAPII-dependent transcription elongation."

Tutor song-contingent optogenetic or electrical disruption of neural activity in the pupil's song premotor nucleus HVC prevented song copying, indicating that a premotor structure important to the temporal control of birdsong also helps encode the tutor song. In vivo multiphoton imaging and neural manipulations delineated a pathway and a candidate synaptic mechanism through which tutor song information is encoded by premotor circuits. These findings provide evidence that premotor circuits help encode sensory information about the behavioral model before shaping and executing imitative behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2046092608,"Antiviral responses must be tightly regulated to defend rapidly against infection while minimizing inflammatory damage. Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are crucial mediators of antiviral responses and their transcription is regulated by a variety of transcription factors; principal among these is the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). The IRF gene regulatory networks are complex and contain multiple feedback loops. The tools of systems biology are well suited to elucidate the complex interactions that give rise to precise coordination of the interferon response. Here we have used an unbiased systems approach to predict that a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, FOXO3, is a negative regulator of a subset of antiviral genes. This prediction was validated using macrophages isolated from Foxo3-null mice. Genome-wide location analysis combined with gene deletion studies identified the Irf7 gene as a critical target of FOXO3. FOXO3 was identified as a negative regulator of Irf7 transcription and we have further demonstrated that FOXO3, IRF7 and IFN-I form a coherent feed-forward regulatory circuit. Our data suggest that the FOXO3-IRF7 regulatory circuit represents a novel mechanism for establishing the requisite set points in the interferon pathway that balances the beneficial effects and deleterious sequelae of the antiviral response."

For monitoring internal cues, head direction cells in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus are one of the best candidates for the neural mechanism underlying path integration. This study shows that head-direction cells in rats act as a mediator of path integration such that their firing matches the level of movement trajectory heading errors in a cumulative manner, and that head-direction cells correct their firing when internal error is corrected by external cues. Head-direction cells have frequently been regarded as an internal 'compass' that can be used for navigation, although there is little evidence showing a link between their activity and spatial behavior. In a navigational task requiring the use of internal cues to return to a home location without vision (path integration), we found a robust correlation between head-direction cell activity and the rat's heading error in the rat's homing behavior. We observed two different correction processes that rats used to improve performance after an error. The more frequent one consists of 'resetting' the cell whenever the rat returns to the home location. However, we found that when large errors occur, the head-direction system has the ability to 'remap' and set a new reference frame, which is then used in subsequent trials. We also offer some insight into how these two correction processes operate when rats make an error."

RNA geranylation can be increased or abolished by mutation or deletion of the selU (ybbB ) gene in E. coli, and purified SelU protein in the presence of geranyl pyrophosphate and tRNA can produce geranylated tRNA.

Here, we report the novel finding that Lcn2 regulates breast cancer angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key angiogenic activator, was significantly increased with Lcn2 expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as well as in an angiogenic line derived from MDA-MB-436 cells. Treatment with a VEGF-neutralizing antibody demonstrates that VEGF is essential for the angiogenic activity of Lcn2. We further demonstrate that Lcn2-induced VEGF is mediated through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and that Lcn2 regulates HIF-1α through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). The regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF by Lcn2 was also demonstrated in the aggressive MDA-MB-231 cell line. Using the mouse corneal pocket assay, we found that Lcn2 significantly enhanced the angiogenesis induced by VEGF. Taken together, these results are the first to demonstrate that Lcn2 promotes angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and suggest a novel mechanism through which Lcn2 may promote tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1981724568,"Cells and intracellular organelles are enclosed by bilayer lipid membranes, whose curvatures define their shape. Generation of bilayer curvature is critical for organelle biogenesis and to mediate vectorial transport from one membrane to another via vesicular or tubular intermediates. Membrane curvature can be driven by lipid perturbations that create asymmetry in the two leaflets of the bilayer, by bilayer binding and/or penetrating proteins, or by forces applied to membranes by the cytoskeleton. This SnapShot provides an overview of the mechanisms through which these proteins generate and/or sense curvature. These two properties are tightly interconnected. Proteins that initiate curvature by inserting a wedge in the bilayer (for example, amphipathic helices and hydrophobic loops) will bind preferentially to a precurved bilayer, where bending has created a gap in lipid packing. Likewise, proteins that function primarily as curved scaffolds generally assemble into polymers that propagate curvature, and their binding to the bilayer and their polymerization are both facilitated by a precurved surface. In some proteins, both scaffold mechanisms and wedge-based mechanisms cooperate. Major mechanisms of protein-driven membrane deformation are listed below. Examples given refer to structures and schematic cartoons shown in the figure."
https://openalex.org/W1990569007,"Mammalian spermatozoa must complete an acrosome reaction prior to fertilizing an oocyte. The acrosome reaction is a unique exocytotic event involving a series of prolonged membrane fusions that ultimately result in the production of membrane vesicles and release of the acrosomal contents. This event requires the concerted action of a large number of fusion-competent signaling and scaffolding proteins. Here we show that two different members of the dynamin GTPase family localize to the developing acrosome of maturing mouse germ cells. Both dynamin 1 and 2 also remain within the periacrosomal region of mature mouse spermatozoa and are thus well positioned to regulate the acrosome reaction. Two pharmacological inhibitors of dynamin, dynasore and Dyngo-4a, blocked the in vitro induction of acrosomal exocytosis by progesterone, but not by the calcium ionophore A23187, and elicited a concomitant reduction of in vitro fertilization. In vivo treatment with these inhibitors also resulted in spermatozoa displaying reduced acrosome reaction potential. Dynamin 1 and 2 phosphorylation increased on progesterone treatment, and this was also selectively blocked by dynasore. On the basis of our collective data, we propose that dynamin could regulate specific membrane fusion events necessary for acrosomal exocytosis in mouse spermatozoa."
https://openalex.org/W2029097383,"It is well established that the small GTPase Ras promotes tumor initiation by activating at least three different mediators: Raf, PI3K, and Ras-like (Ral) guanine nucleotide exchange factors. However, the exact mechanisms that underlie these different Ras signaling pathways, which are involved in tumor progression, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we report that the Ras-PI3K pathway, but not Raf or the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors, specifically targets the acetylation of H3 at lysine 56 (H3K56ac), thereby regulating tumor cell activity. We demonstrate that the Ras-PI3K-induced reduction in H3K56ac is associated with the proliferation and migration of tumor cells by targeting the transcription of tumor-associated genes. The depletion of the histone deacetyltransferases Sirt1 and Sirt2 rescues the Ras-PI3K-induced decrease in H3K56ac, gene transcription, tumor cell proliferation, and tumor cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Ras-PI3K-AKT pathway regulates H3K56ac via the MDM2-dependent degradation of CREB-binding protein/p300. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that the Ras-PI3K signaling pathway targets specific epigenetic modifications in tumor cells."

There is very little information on the molecular mechanisms involved in the PGE2-induced up-regulation of Il23a gene expression. In this study we investigated the signaling pathways and transcription factors involved in the stimulatory effect of PGE2. Although PGE2 does not induce IL-23p19 expression by itself, it synergizes with both extra- and intracellular Toll-like receptor ligands and with inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. We established that the effect of PGE2 in conjunction with either LPS or TNFα is mediated through the EP4 receptor and the cAMP-dependent activation of both protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). Using the EP4 agonist PGE(1)OH in conjunction with TNFα, we found that PKA-induced phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein ((P)CREB) and EPAC-induced phosphorylation of C/AATT enhancer-binding protein β ((P)C/EBPβ) mediate the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on IL-23p19 expression. This is the first report of CREB and C/EBPβ involvement in Il23a promoter activation. Mutation within the putative CREB and C/EBP sites combined with in vivo DNA binding (ChIP) assays identified the distal CREB site (-1125) and the two proximal C/EBP sites (-274 and -232) as essential for PKA-activated CREB and EPAC-activated C/EBPβ-induced IL-23p19 expression."

Despite the increasing appreciation for the importance of NFAT-dependent transcription in the nervous system, the regulation and function of specific NFAT isoforms in neurons are poorly understood. Here, we compare the activation of NFATc3 and NFATc4 in hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurons following electrically evoked elevations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). We find that NFATc3 undergoes rapid dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation that are essentially complete within 20 min, although NFATc4 remains phosphorylated and localized to the cytosol, only exhibiting nuclear localization following prolonged (1–3 h) depolarization. Knocking down NFATc3, but not NFATc4, strongly diminished NFAT-mediated transcription induced by mild depolarization in neurons. By analyzing NFATc3/NFATc4 chimeras, we find that the region containing the serine-rich region-1 (SRR1) mildly affects initial NFAT translocation, although the region containing the serine-proline repeats is critical for determining the magnitude of NFAT activation and nuclear localization upon depolarization. Knockdown of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) significantly increased the depolarization-induced nuclear localization of NFATc4. In contrast, inhibition of p38 or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinases had no significant effect on nuclear import of NFATc4. Thus, electrically evoked [Ca2+]i elevation in neurons rapidly and strongly activates NFATc3, whereas activation of NFATc4 requires a coincident increase in [Ca2+]i and suppression of GSK3β, with differences in the serine-proline-containing region giving rise to these distinct activation properties of NFATc3 and NFATc4.

Although PaeM is structurally similar to ColM, the conformation of their active sites differs radically; in PaeM, residues essential for enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity converge toward a same pocket, whereas in ColM they are spread along a particularly elongated active site. We have also isolated a minimal domain corresponding to the C-terminal half of the PaeM protein and exhibiting a 70-fold higher enzymatic activity as compared with the full-length protein.

The recent discovery that the in vivo activity of ColM was also dependent upon a specific periplasmic protein, FkpA, from the targeted cells, further complicated the story (9Hullmann J. Patzer S.I.

E. coli mutants affected in either of the latter proteins are, therefore, fully resistant to ColM. All colicins show a similar three-domain structural organization, each of these domains playing a specific role in the mode of action of the colicin, the N-terminal and central domains being required for toxin translocation and receptor binding steps, respectively, and the C-terminal domain carrying the toxic activity (1Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Colicin biology.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). As is the case for colicinogenic strains in general, ColM-producing strains are protected against the toxin they secrete by concomitant expression of a specific immunity protein. The mechanism of action of the ColM immunity protein, Cmi, whose x-ray structure has recently been solved (10Gérard F. Brooks M.A. Barreteau H. Touzé T. Graille M. Bouhss A.

Genes encoding proteins that exhibit similarity to E. coli ColM were recently identified in the genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Burkholderia spp., and Pectobacterium carotovorum species (12Barreteau H. Bouhss A. Fourgeaud M. Mainardi J.L. Touzé T. Gérard F. Blanot D. Arthur M. Mengin-Lecreulx D.

Ferredoxin containing bacteriocins suggest a novel mechanism of iron uptake in Pectobacterium spp.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e33033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Only a limited number of strains from these species harbored these genes, which were often localized within pathogenicity islands. In particular, the P. aeruginosa homologue was located in the 80-kb exoU-containing genomic island A, a large horizontally acquired genetic element and virulence determinant (14Kulasekara B.R. Kulasekara H.D. Wolfgang M.C. Stevens L. Frank D.W. Lory S. Acquisition and evolution of the exoU locus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4037-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These ColM homologues exhibited significant sequence homology (35–45% identity) in the C-terminal region, roughly the second half of these proteins, which corresponds to the catalytic domain. In contrast, no homology was detected in their N-terminal regions, which presumably participate in receptor binding and import (12Barreteau H. Bouhss A. Fourgeaud M. Mainardi J.L. Touzé T. Gérard F. Blanot D. Arthur M. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Human- and plant-pathogenic Pseudomonas species produce bacteriocins exhibiting colicin M-like hydrolase activity toward peptidoglycan precursors.J.

The translocation/reception domain sequences of ColM-like bacteriocins from the phytopathogenic P. carotovorum bacterium (pectocins M1 and M2) present extensive similarity to those of plant ferredoxins. It was further demonstrated that these domains are used to parasitize an iron uptake system from the targeted bacteria (13Grinter R. Milner J. Walker D. Ferredoxin containing bacteriocins suggest a novel mechanism of iron uptake in Pectobacterium spp.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e33033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This shows that a ColM-like killing domain can be fused through evolution to domains of different folds to hijack specific import machineries. The ColM-like proteins from P. aeruginosa (PaeM), P. syringae (PsyM), and P. fluorescens (PflM) were purified, and their lipid II-degrading activity was confirmed. All these enzymes require Mg2+ for activity and cleave lipid II at the same position as ColM. In vivo assays showed that these ColM homologues have narrow antibacterial spectra (12Barreteau H. Bouhss A. Fourgeaud M. Mainardi J.L. Touzé T. Gérard F. Blanot D. Arthur M. Mengin-Lecreulx D.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3657-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For instance, despite its high catalytic activity (600-fold higher kcat/Km ratio as compared with E. coli ColM), PaeM did not show any cytotoxic effect toward E. coli cells, suggesting a failure for this toxin to parasitize the ColM reception and import systems. However, PaeM exerted a bacteriostatic effect on certain P. aeruginosa strains chosen among reference strains and clinical isolates (12Barreteau H. Bouhss A. Fourgeaud M. Mainardi J.L. Touzé T. Gérard F. Blanot D. Arthur M. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Human- and plant-pathogenic Pseudomonas species produce bacteriocins exhibiting colicin M-like hydrolase activity toward peptidoglycan precursors.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3657-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of ColM, recently determined by Zeth et al. (16Zeth K. Römer C. Patzer S.I. Braun V. Crystal structure of colicin M, a novel phosphatase specifically imported by Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25324-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), revealed a very compact fold lacking the well individualized domains observed in all other colicins. We report here the crystal structure of the ColM-like protein (PaeM) from P. aeruginosa as well as the functional characterization of its activity domain. This structure highlights major differences within the active site, which could explain why the PaeM enzyme exhibits much higher specific enzymatic activity toward lipid II than its ColM homologue. The E. coli strains DH5α (Invitrogen) and XL1-blue (Stratagene) were used as the hosts for propagation of plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, respectively. Strains C43(DE3) (Avidis) and Rosetta were used for the production of PaeM proteins. The P. aeruginosa strains JJ692 and DET08 were described earlier (12Barreteau H. Bouhss A. Fourgeaud M.

The construction of pMLD245, a pET2160 derivative plasmid allowing high level expression of the PaeM protein with a C-terminal six-histidine tag (Arg-Ser-His6 extension) was previously described (12Barreteau H.

Growth was monitored at 600 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genes was performed in a Bio-med Thermocycler 60 apparatus (B. Braun) using Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science). DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification kit (Promega), and standard procedures for DNA digestion, ligation, and agarose gel electrophoresis were used (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmid isolation was carried out by the alkaline lysis method, and E. coli cells were transformed with plasmid DNA by the method of Dagert and Ehrlich (20Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Prolonged incubation in calcium chloride improves the competence of Escherichia coli cells.Gene. 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab For expression of full-length PaeM proteins (wild-type and mutants), C43(DE3)(pMLD245) cells were grown at 37 °C in 2YT-ampicillin medium (1-liter cultures). When the culture optical density (A600 nm) reached 1.0, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (1 mm), and growth was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. Truncated forms of PaeM protein were expressed in the presence of chaperones by using Rosetta(pLysS)(pREP4groESL) as the host strain. This strain carrying plasmids pMLD362 (PaeM-Δ1–126) or pMLD363 (PaeM-Δ1–133) was grown at 37 °C as described above, but at A600 nm = 1.0 the temperature was lowered to 15 °C before the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm), and cells were incubated overnight at this temperature. In all cases cells were harvested, washed with 40 ml of cold 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), resuspended in 12 ml of the same buffer, and disrupted by sonication (Bioblock Vibracell sonicator, model 72412). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 200,000 × g in a TL100 Beckman centrifuge, and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. The PaeM mutants W54K, E55A, and W54K/E55A formed inclusion bodies when expressed as described for the wild-type protein. They were solubilized and renaturated from these inclusion bodies as follows. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 7000 × g to collect the insoluble material, and this pellet was suspended in 2 ml of 8 m urea for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged again. The proteins were finally refolded by a 50-fold dilution of the supernatant in buffer A before purification. His6-tagged proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Ni2+-NTA)-agarose under native conditions. Crude soluble protein extracts obtained as described above were incubated with 1.5 ml of polymer pre-equilibrated in buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole for 1 h at 4 °C. The polymer was washed extensively with buffer A containing 20 and 40 mm imidazole, and proteins were eluted using increasing concentrations of imidazole (100, 200, and 300 mm). Purified protein fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (10K Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter, Millipore), and dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of buffer A. Final preparations were stored at −20 °C after the addition of 10% glycerol. For crystallization trials, the His6-tagged full-length PaeM protein eluted from the Ni2+-NTA polymer was further subjected to a S75 size-exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins was performed as described previously (21Laemmli U.K. Favre M. Maturation of the head of bacteriophage T4. I. DNA packaging events.J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford procedure (22Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) as well as quantitative amino acid analysis with a Hitachi model L8800 analyzer (ScienceTec) after hydrolysis of samples for 24 h at 105 °C in 6 m HCl containing 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol. For Western blot and immunodetection, proteins were transferred from the gels onto nitrocellulose membranes, and blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Anti-PaeM polyclonal antibodies produced in rat (GeneCust, Dudelange, Luxembourg) were used at 1:100 dilutions. The enzymatic activity of PaeM and of its different variants was tested in a reaction mixture (10 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2.3 μm [14C]radiolabeled lipid II (140 Bq), and 0.2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Unless otherwise noted, the meso-diaminopimelic acid-containing lipid II from E. coli was used as the substrate in this assay. Lipids II from other bacterial species were also tested to analyze the substrate specificity of the PaeM protein. These lipids were obtained by a chemo-enzymatic procedure, as previously described (23Patin D. Barreteau H. Auger G. Magnet S. Crouvoisier M. Bouhss A. Touzé T. Arthur M. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of the purified protein (from 2 to 10 μg in 5 μl of buffer A), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking (Thermomixer, Eppendorf). The reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 1 min and then analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on LK6D silica gel plates (Whatman) using 1-propanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (6:3:1; v/v/v) as a mobile phase. The radioactive spots were visualized with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and located and quantified with a radioactivity scanner (Rita Star, Raytest Isotopenmeβgeräte GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany). Under these conditions the radiolabeled substrate (lipid II) and product (1-pyrophospho-MurNAc[pentapeptide]-GlcNAc) migrated with Rf values of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. 2YT top agar (3 ml) was inoculated with the P. aeruginosa PaeM-susceptible DET08 strain (108 cells) and poured onto 2YT agar plates. 2-μl samples of the purified PaeM proteins (wild-type and mutated forms) were then spotted onto the surface of the top agar, and growth inhibition was observed after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. The antibacterial activity of these proteins was also similarly tested against some Gram-positive species: Staphylococcus aureus (strain RN4220), Enterococcus faecalis (strain JH2–2), and Enterococcus faecium (strain D344). The cytotoxic effect of these different proteins was tested on the E. coli strain BW25113 under previously described conditions (15Barreteau H. Bouhss A. Gérard F. Duché D. Boussaid B. Blanot D.

Crystals of P. aeruginosa PaeM protein were obtained at 19 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein (15–25 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with a crystallization buffer composed of either 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 2 m sodium formate (formate-form) or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm MgCl2, and 30% (w/v) PEG 4000 (Mg2+-form). For data collection, crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution consisting of crystallization buffer provided with progressively higher ethylene glycol concentrations up to 30%. The datasets were collected on beam line Proxima-1 (SOLEIL, St-Aubin, France). Crystals from the Mg2+-form diffracted up to 1.7 Å resolution, whereas those from the formate-form diffracted more weakly (2.4 Å resolution). The structure was determined by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using the anomalous signal extracted from x-ray data collected on selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals from the Mg2+-form. Diffraction data were recorded at the wavelengths corresponding to the peak, edge, and remote of the selenium fluorescence spectrum. Data were processed using the XDS package (24Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). The space group was P212121 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. All the expected selenium sites (two per monomer) were found with the program SHELXD in the 41–3 Å resolution range (25Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M.

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase superfamily and regulates cell cycle progression. The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP: NR0B2) plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic processes. Here, we studied the role of ATM on GH-dependent regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis in the liver. GH induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase gene expression in primary hepatocytes. GH treatment and adenovirus-mediated STAT5 overexpression in hepatocytes increased glucose production, which was blocked by a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, dominant negative STAT5, and STAT5 knockdown. We identified a STAT5 binding site on the PEPCK gene promoter using reporter assays and point mutation analysis. Up-regulation of SHP by metformin-mediated activation of the ATM-AMP-activated protein kinase pathway led to inhibition of GH-mediated induction of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which was abolished by an ATM inhibitor, KU-55933. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that SHP physically interacted with STAT5 and inhibited STAT5 recruitment on the PEPCK gene promoter. GH-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis was decreased by either metformin or Ad-SHP, whereas the inhibition by metformin was abolished by SHP knockdown. Finally, the increase of hepatic gluconeogenesis following GH treatment was significantly higher in the liver of SHP null mice compared with that of wild-type mice. Overall, our results suggest that the ATM-AMP-activated protein kinase-SHP network, as a novel mechanism for regulating hepatic glucose homeostasis via a GH-dependent pathway, may be a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1973647063,"Macrophages represent the second major type of decidual leukocytes at the fetomaternal interface. Changes in macrophage number and activity are associated with fetal loss and pregnancy complications. Glycodelin-A (GdA) is an abundant glycoprotein in the first-trimester decidua. It is involved in fetomaternal defense and early placental development through its regulatory activities in various immune cells. The N-glycosylation of GdA mediates the binding and therefore the activities of the molecule. In this study, we studied the biological activities of GdA in the functions of human monocytes/macrophages. GdA was purified from amniotic fluid by affinity chromatography. GdA treatment did not affect the viability, cell death, or phagocytic activity of the monocytes/macrophages. GdA, but not recombinant glycodelin without glycosylation, induced IL-6 production as demonstrated by cytokine array, intracellular staining, and ELISA. GdA also induced phosphorylation of ERK in monocytes/macrophages. The involvement of ERKs in IL-6 induction was confirmed using pharmacological inhibitors. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that L-selectin on the monocytes/macrophages was the binding protein of GdA. Treatment with anti-L-selectin antibody reduced GdA binding and GdA-induced IL-6 production. GdA-treated macrophages suppressed IFN-γ expression by co-cultured T-helper cells in an IL-6-dependent manner. These results show that GdA interacts with L-selectin to induce IL-6 production in monocytes/macrophages by activating the ERK signaling pathway. In turn, the increased IL-6 production suppresses IFN-γ expression in T-helper cells, which may play an important role in inducing a Th-2-polarized cytokine environment that flavors the immunotolerance of the fetoplacental unit."
https://openalex.org/W2003040695,"We have used fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular modeling, and limited proteolysis to examine structural dynamics of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA). The Ca-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from fast twitch muscle (SERCA1a isoform) was selectively labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a probe that specifically reacts with Lys-515 in the nucleotide-binding site. Conformation-specific proteolysis demonstrated that FITC labeling does not induce closure of the cytoplasmic headpiece, thereby assigning FITC-SERCA as a nucleotide-free enzyme. We used enzyme reverse mode to synthesize FITC monophosphate (FMP) on SERCA, producing a phosphorylated pseudosubstrate tethered to the nucleotide-binding site of a Ca(2+)-free enzyme (E2 state to prevent FMP hydrolysis). Conformation-specific proteolysis demonstrated that FMP formation induces SERCA headpiece closure similar to ATP binding, presumably due to the high energy phosphoryl group on the fluorescent probe (ATP·E2 analog). Subnanosecond-resolved detection of fluorescence lifetime, anisotropy, and quenching was used to characterize FMP-SERCA (ATP·E2 state) versus FITC-SERCA in Ca(2+)-free, Ca(2+)-bound, and actively cycling phosphoenzyme states (E2, E1, and EP). Time-resolved spectroscopy revealed that FMP-SERCA exhibits increased probe dynamics but decreased probe accessibility compared with FITC-SERCA, indicating that ATP exhibits enhanced dynamics within a closed cytoplasmic headpiece. Molecular modeling was used to calculate the solvent-accessible surface area of FITC and FMP bound to SERCA crystal structures, revealing a positive correlation of solvent-accessible surface area with quenching but not anisotropy. Thus, headpiece closure is coupled to substrate binding but not active site dynamics. We propose that dynamics in the nucleotide-binding site of SERCA is important for Ca(2+) binding (distal allostery) and phosphoenzyme formation (direct activation)."
https://openalex.org/W2044309976,"Cellular membrane remodeling events such as mitochondrial dynamics, vesicle budding, and cell division rely on the large GTPases of the dynamin superfamily. Dynamins have long been characterized as fission molecules; however, how they mediate membrane fusion is largely unknown. Here we have characterized by cryo-electron microscopy and in vitro liposome fusion assays how the mitochondrial dynamin Mgm1 may mediate membrane fusion. Using cryo-EM, we first demonstrate that the Mgm1 complex is able to tether opposing membranes to a gap of ∼15 nm, the size of mitochondrial cristae folds. We further show that the Mgm1 oligomer undergoes a dramatic GTP-dependent conformational change suggesting that s-Mgm1 interactions could overcome repelling forces at fusion sites and that ultrastructural changes could promote the fusion of opposing membranes. Together our findings provide mechanistic details of the two known in vivo functions of Mgm1, membrane fusion and cristae maintenance, and more generally shed light onto how dynamins may function as fusion proteins."

Because a nuclear receptor-dependent PC pathway has been determined to exert antidiabetic effects, we now analyzed the role of ABCB4 in glucose metabolism. We bred congenic Abcb4-knockout (Abcb4–/–) mice on the fibrosis-susceptible BALB/cJ background. Knockout mice and wild-type controls were phenotyped by measuring plasma glucose concentrations, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, hepatic RNA expression profiles, and liver histology. In addition, 4 procholestatic ABCB4 gene variants were correlated with blood glucose levels in 682 individuals from 2 independent European cohorts. Systemic glucose levels differ significantly between Abcb4–/– mice and wild-type controls, and knockout mice display improved glucose tolerance with significantly lower area under the curve values on intraperitoneal glucose challenge. Of note, hepatic expression of the antidiabetic nuclear receptor 5A2 (LRH-1) is induced consistently in Abcb4–/– mice, and its specific rare PC ligands are detected in liver by mass spectrometry imaging. In humans, serum glucose levels are associated significantly with the common ABCB4 variant c.711A>T. In summary, ABCB4 might play a critical role in glucose homeostasis in mice and humans. We speculate that the effects could be mediated via LRH-1-dependent PC pathways.—Hochrath, K., Krawczyk, M., Goebel, R., Langhirt, M., Rathkolb, B., Micklich, K., Rozman, J., Horsch, M., Beckers, J., Klingenspor, M., Fuchs, H., Gailus-Durner, V., Wolf, E., Acalovschi, M., Volmer, D.

https://openalex.org/W2027558032,"A major problem in the insulin therapy of patients with diabetes type 2 (T2DM) is the increased occurrence of hypoglycemic events which, if left untreated, may cause confusion or fainting and in severe cases seizures, coma, and even death. To elucidate the potential contribution of the liver to hypoglycemia in T2DM we applied a detailed kinetic model of human hepatic glucose metabolism to simulate changes in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism induced by deviations of the hormones insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine from their normal plasma profiles. Our simulations reveal in line with experimental and clinical data from a multitude of studies in T2DM, (i) significant changes in the relative contribution of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism to hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization; (ii) decreased postprandial glycogen storage as well as increased glycogen depletion in overnight fasting and short term fasting; and (iii) a shift of the set point defining the switch between hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization to elevated plasma glucose levels, respectively, in T2DM relative to normal, healthy subjects. Intriguingly, our model simulations predict a restricted gluconeogenic response of the liver under impaired hormonal signals observed in T2DM, resulting in an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The inability of hepatic glucose metabolism to effectively counterbalance a decline of the blood glucose level becomes even more pronounced in case of tightly controlled insulin treatment. Given this Janus face mode of action of insulin, our model simulations underline the great potential that normalization of the plasma glucagon profile may have for the treatment of T2DM."

DNA binding of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, TAL1/SCL, is required for normal erythropoiesis. A link between elevated TAL1 and excessive erythrocytosis is suggested by erythroid progenitor cells from a patient that exhibits unusually high sensitivity to erythropoietin with concomitantly elevated TAL1 and EPO-R expression. We found that TAL1 regulates EPO-R expression mediated via three conserved E-box binding motifs (CAGCTG) in the EPO-R 5′ untranslated transcribed region. TAL1 increases association of the GATA-1·TAL1·LMO2·LDB1 transcription activation complex to the region that includes the transcription start site and the 5′ GATA and 3′ E-box motifs flanking the EPO-R transcription start site suggesting that TAL1 promotes accessibility of this region. Nucleosome shifting has been demonstrated to facilitate TAL1 but not GATA-1 binding to regulate target gene expression. Accordingly, we observed that with induced expression of EPO-R in hemotopoietic progenitor cells, nucleosome phasing shifts to increase the linker region containing the EPO-R transcription start site and TAL1 binds to the flanking 5′ GATA and 3′ E-box regions of the promoter.

EPO-R is expressed on early erythroid progenitor cells or BFU-E (burst forming unit erythroid) at a low level and is up-regulated with erythroid differentiation to CFU-Es (colony forming unit erythroid) that require EPO for survival (1Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F.

EPO induction of its own receptor is mediated in part by EPO induction of GATA-1, which can transactivate EPO-R (24Fujiwara T. O'Geen H. Keles S. Blahnik K. Linnemann A.K. Kang Y.A. Choi K.

The importance of TAL1 in erythroid differentiation is underscored by erythroid progenitor cell cultures from an individual with chronic isolated, excessive erythropoiesis (see below). These erythroid precursor cells exhibit EPO hypersensitivity and elevated EPO-R expression but normal GATA-1 and GATA-2 levels. We found abnormally high levels of TAL1 and increased TAL1 binding to EPO-R proximal promoter following EPO stimulation. We show that forced expression of EPO-R in human primary erythroid progenitor cells promotes EPO response via increased expression of GATA-1, TAL1, and EPO-R. Similarly, overexpression of TAL1 increases EPO-R expression and erythroid differentiation without affecting GATA-1 expression, whereas TAL1 knockdown decreases EPO-R expression and erythroid differentiation. TAL1 binds directly to the conserved E-box region downstream of the EPO-R transcription start site and regulates promoter activity. TAL1 regulation of EPO-R and the elevated induction of TAL1 and EPO-R in differentiating erythroid progenitor cell cultures from Patient A link to the observed EPO hypersensitivity in this case of chronic increase in erythropoiesis. In contrast, cultures of Jak2V617F erythroid progenitor cells show normal EPO-R and TAL1 levels. Human primary erythroid progenitor cells were isolated from blood obtained from healthy volunteers through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Transfusion Medicine or from consenting patients and cultured as described (27Fibach E. Techniques for studying stimulation of fetal hemoglobin production in human erythroid cultures.Hemoglobin. 1998; 22: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, buffy coats isolated from whole blood were diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and gently layered on Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma). They were centrifuged first to separate red blood cells, platelets, and plasma from the mononuclear cells, and then further centrifuged to wash the cells with PBS. Cells were then cultured 5–7 days in phase I medium containing α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% conditioned medium (from 5637 human bladder carcinoma cell line culture), 1.5 mm glutamine, 1 μg/ml of cyclosporin A, and antibiotics at 37 ºC with 5% CO2. To generate primary adult human erythroid progenitor cell (hAEPC) cultures, at the end of phase I, cells were then cultured in phase II medium containing EPO (1 unit/ml), α-minimal essential medium, 30% FBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10−6 m dexamethasone, 10−5 m β-mercapthoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml of human holotransferrin (Sigma), 10 ng/ml of stem cell factor, and antibiotics for up to 12 days. Viable cell counts were obtained using trypan blue exclusion. Benzidine staining was used for counting Hb containing cells. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. For other studies, CD34+ and CD133+ hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from apheresis products using immunomagnetic beads specific for CD34+ and CD133+ (Miltenyi CliniMacs system). For differentiation into CD36+ cells, the CD133+ cells were suspended in maintenance media prepared using α-minimal essential medium (for a final concentration of 10 mg/ml of BSA, 10 μg/ml of insulin, 200 μg/ml of holotransferrin and supplemented with 900 ng/ml of ferrous sulfate, 90 ng/ml of ferric nitrate, 10−6 m hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml of stem cell factor, 5 ng/ml of IL-3, and 3 units/ml of EPO). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for 9–11 days, followed by FACS analysis for the presence of CD36+ cells. Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Synthesis of first-strand cDNA from 1 μg of total RNA was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) and oligo(dT)16 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed as previously described using a 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) and gene-specific primers and TaqMan probes for EPO-R, GATA-1, GATA-2, TAL1, EKLF, β-globin, γ-globin, and β-actin (11Rogers H.M.

Serial dilutions of plasmids containing the cDNA of interest were used to create standard curves. Mononuclear cells (2 × 105) from peripheral blood were cultured in 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes in methylcellulose medium (Stemcell number 04434) and incubated at 37 ºC, in 5% CO2, with ≥95% humidity for 14–16 days. CFU-E and BFU-E were identified by their red color via a microscope with a ×4 objective for CFU-E (×40 magnification), and a ×2 objective for BFU-E (×20 magnification). After 3 days of EPO exposure, erythroid progenitor cells were transfected with an expression plasmid containing mouse Epo-R (expression vector PIRES2-EGFP-mEpoR), TAL1 (expression vector PIRES2-EGFP-TAL1), TAL1 antisense cDNA, mouse Eklf (mEklf) cDNA, or no plasmid using the Amaxa Nucleofector for CD34+ cells (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). Cells were analyzed on the days indicated following EPO stimulation. For stable TAL1 overexpression in K562 erythroid cells, K562 were co-transfected with a TAL1 expression vector PIRES2-EGFP-TAL1 and RSVneo. Cells were seeded at low dilution in media containing G418. K562/TAL1 colonies were isolated and propagated in suspension culture and the expression level of TAL1, EPO-R, and other erythroid genes determined. A human EPO-R reporter gene construct (EPOR) extending 5′ 194 and 3′ 120 bp from the transcription start site was linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (26Chin K. Oda N. Shen K. Noguchi C.T. Regulation of transcription of the human erythropoietin receptor gene by proteins binding to GATA-1 and Sp1 motifs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ΔEPOR with deletion of the conserved E-box region was constructed similarly with the promoter fragment extending only 26 bp 3′. Δ3EPR was constructed from EPOR by mutation of each of the three E-box motifs. Luciferase plasmids were co-transfected with a Renilla luciferase construct (pRL-TK) into K562 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested after 48 h and luciferase activity was determined by the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). A promoterless construct containing only the 5′ untranslated transcribed region of EPO-R linked to luciferase was used as a negative control. Analysis was carried out in K562 cells without and with TAL1 overexpression (K562/TAL1) as previously described (28Fernández L.A. Winkler M. Grosschedl R. Matrix attachment region-dependent function of the immunoglobulin mu enhancer involves histone acetylation at a distance without changes in enhancer occupancy.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, isolated 1% formaldehyde cross-linked cells were lysed (lysis buffer: 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1) and sonicated on ice. DNA was sheared to an average length of around 500 bp. The sonicated cell supernatant was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris−HCl, 167 mm NaCl, pH 8.1). Chromatin was precleared using protein G-agarose (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with specific antibodies or nonspecific IgG (control). Immunoprecipitates were recovered with protein G-agarose (4 °C for 2 h), followed by low-speed centrifugation. Washed pellets were reverse cross-linked. DNA was phenol chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extracted, ethanol precipitated, and used for PCR analysis. Erythroid progenitor cells from normal volunteers and Patient A were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors). Proteins were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with EPO-R antibody (M-20), TAL1 antibody, or anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibodies, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (GE Healthcare). DNA was isolated directly from erythroid progenitor cell cultures from Patient A. Primer pairs were designed to PCR amplify and sequence the erythroid 1a promoter, +19 enhancer, and +51 enhancer regions of the TAL1 gene. Sequencing results were analyzed using the BLASTn tool. Genomic DNA isolated from immortalized B-cells from Patient A was digested by restriction enzyme and analyzed for TAL1 rearrangements by Southern blotting (supplemental Fig. 1A). DNA primers specific for the interstitial deletion between the TAL1 and SIL genes were synthesized and also used for genomic analysis (29Aplan P.D. Lombardi D.P. Reaman G.H. Sather H.N. Hammond G.D. Kirsch I.R. Involvement of the putative hematopoietic transcription factor SCL in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Blood. 1992; 79: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme digestion and direct DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the PCR product. EPO-R RNA-seq was performed as described (30Chepelev I. Wei G. Tang Q. Zhao K. Detection of single nucleotide variations in expressed exons of the human genome using RNA-Seq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e106Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, mRNAs isolated from CD34+ and CD36+ cells from a healthy donor were converted to cDNA using standard protocols. The cDNAs were fragmented to 100−200 bp using sonication, followed by end repair and Solexa adaptor ligation. The products were sequenced on an Illumina GAII system according to established procedures. Nucleosome phasing was performed using Solexa Sequencing technology as described (31Schones D.E. Cui K.

We identified a patient with unusually high hemoglobin of 22 g/dl upon emergency hospitalization for a brain hemorrhage. Patient A, an adult male, had normal white blood cell count, differential white blood cell count and platelet count were normal. Mean corpuscular volume and red cell morphology were normal. No vascular abnormality aside from the brain hemorrhage and no enlargement of liver or spleen were found. The skin of the patient was a gray-purple color at presentation but returned to normal when hemoglobin was decreased to the normal range. EPO level, pO2, oxygen saturation, p50, and hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal. Patient A was emergently treated with phlebotomy to lower his hemoglobin to the normal range and he recovered from all neurologic defects. The elevated erythrocytosis appeared to be inherited as the patient's father and daughter had high hemoglobin. Sequencing of genomic DNA from Patient A did not reveal any mutations in the erythropoietin receptor or in other genes associated with isolated erythrocytosis such as VHL, PDH-2, hypoxia inducible factor-2α, Jak2V617F, exon 12 mutations of the JAK2 gene, and hemochromatosis. The hAEPC cultures derived from CD34+ cells from Patient A required EPO for colony formation but exhibited unusually large erythroid colonies. Erythroid progenitor cells exhibited hypersensitivity to EPO with increased induction of EPO-R and β-globin expression compared with the control hAEPC culture (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, hAEPC cultures from patients with the Jak2V617F mutation exhibit increased numbers of early erythroid progenitor cells even in the absence of EPO (32Nussenzveig R.H. Swierczek S.I. Jelinek J. Gaikwad A. Liu E. Verstovsek S. Prchal J.F. Prchal J.T. Polycythemia vera is not initiated by JAK2V617F mutation.Exp. Hematol. 2007; 35: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EPO stimulated induction of EPO-R and β-globin expression in Jak2V617F cultures did not exhibit the increased level observed in erythroid progenitor cell cultures from Patient A (Fig. 1B). The increased level of EPO-R expression provides a possible explanation for the hypersensitivity to EPO during erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells from Patient A. The colony assays of the patient progenitor cells showed an increase in CFU-E but not BFU-E (Fig. 1C), consistent with the increased proliferative response with EPO stimulation. EPO-R promoter is transactivated by GATA-1, which requires the GATA-1 binding motif for high-level EPO-R expression. However, quantification of GATA-1 expression in EPO-stimulated hAEPC cultures from Patient A revealed that EPO induction of GATA-1, as well as down-regulation of GATA-2, was similar for cultures from Patient A and for normal control (Fig. 2A). Erythroid progenitor cells from Patient A did show increased induction of EKLF in response to EPO stimulation, consistent with the increased induction of β-globin expression compared with control or Jak2V617F cultures (Fig. 2B). However, overexpression of mEklf in control hAEPC did not increase the EPO-R mRNA level, but did increase erythroid differentiation, determined by benzidine staining, and decreased progenitor cell number (supplemental Fig. 1B). Although GATA-1 expression appeared normal, we observed increased induction in TAL1 mRNA with EPO stimulation in hAEPC cultures from Patient A (Fig. 2C). In control hAEPC cultures and cultures of Jak2V617F hAEPC, EPO induction of TAL1 expression peaked between days 8 and 10 of EPO stimulation and was then down-regulated. In hAEPC cultures from Patient A, TAL1 expression continued to increase even beyond day 10 reaching expression levels 2-fold or greater than the peak level determined for control and Jak2V617F cultures. Furthermore, the TAL1 protein level at day 12 was confirmed to be increased by more than 3-fold compared with control cultures (Fig. 2D). Consistently, the EPO-R protein level was observed to be elevated at day 12 compared with day 10 in Patient A and compared with day 12 in control (Fig. 2D, bottom panel). In contrast to the normal level of GATA-1 expression, the increased EPO induction of TAL1 and EPO-R provides a potential link to the EPO hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitor cells from Patient A. Genetic analysis was carried out to determine the presence of mutations in the major regulatory regions contributing to TAL1 gene expression or evidence of gene rearrangements that might account for elevated TAL1 expression in progenitor cells from Patient A. Southern blotting and PCR analysis of DNA did not reveal the major chromosomal rearrangements associated with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (33Aplan P.D.

https://openalex.org/W2086904093,"RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) is an essential, evolutionarily conserved endoribonuclease composed of 10 different protein subunits and a single RNA. RNase MRP has established roles in multiple pathways including ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and mitochondrial DNA replication. Although each of these functions is important to cell growth, additional functions may exist given the essential nature of the complex. To identify novel RNase MRP substrates, we utilized RNA immunoprecipitation and microarray chip analysis to identify RNA that physically associates with RNase MRP.

RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) 2The abbreviations used are: MRPmitochondrial RNA processingRIP-chipRNA immunoprecipitation and microarray chip analysisTAPtandem affinity purificationRMRPRNase MRP RNATAMtemporal asymmetric MRP. is a highly conserved and essential endoribonuclease enzyme complex present in all eukaryotes with known functions in mitochondrial DNA replication, ribosomal biosynthesis, and cell cycle regulation. The yeast RNase MRP is composed of 10 protein subunits and a 340-nucleotide RNA encoded by the NME1 gene, all of which are essential for viability. It shares eight of these proteins (Pop1p, Pop3p, Pop4p, Pop5p, Pop6p, Pop7p, Pop8p, and Rpp1) with the evolutionarily related RNase P, an endoribonuclease responsible for cleaving tRNA at its 5′-end as a normal part of the tRNA maturation process (1Salinas K.

RNase MRP mutants exhibit a mitotic cell cycle delay characterized by the formation of large budded cells, an hourglass-shaped nucleus that is split between mother and daughter cells, and a long mitotic spindle (7Cai T.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase mitochondrial RNA processing is critical for cell cycle progression at the end of mitosis.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased spindle stability in these mutants is caused by elevated levels of the B-type mitotic cyclin Clb2p, resulting in the extended activity of the Clb2p/Cdc28p cyclin kinase pair and consequently an extended mitosis (9Gill T.

In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that RNase MRP directly cleaves the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of CLB2 mRNA in a site-specific manner, facilitating its rapid degradation by the 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease Xrn1p (9Gill T.

In yeast, RNase MRP colocalizes with Xrn1p in the cytoplasm of the daughter cell during mid-to-late mitosis in a pattern characterized by small punctate foci (temporal asymmetric MRP (TAM) bodies) that appear during anaphase. They are transported in a Myo4p-dependent manner to the cytoplasm of the daughter cell where they persist until cytokinesis (8Gill T. Aulds J. Schmitt M. A specialized processing body that is temporally and asymmetrically regulated during the cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The localization of these foci is conditional on RNase MRP function, and they are proposed to be the sites of mRNA processing by RNase MRP and subsequent degradation by Xrn1 (8Gill T. Aulds J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether RNase MRP has additional RNA substrates, we utilized TAP-tagged RNase MRP protein Rmp1 to affinity capture RNase MRP and its substrates. As the endoribonuclease activity of the enzyme requires the physical association of the substrate with the enzyme, captured RNAs outside of the MRP RNA are expected to be candidate substrates. We identified the captured RNAs using oligonucleotide microarrays for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have modified this approach by subjecting the cells to ultraviolet light prior to lysis to covalently bind substrate RNA to the RNase MRP complex and thus increase the RNA substrate yield (14Jain R.

Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using the pJA110 template for the A3 cleavage as a positive control. The template for the CTS1 substrate was generated by PCR amplification of the 5′-UTR of the CTS1 gene with a 5′ primer bearing an SP6 polymerase promoter (CTS1-F3) and a 3′ primer bearing a BamHI site (CTS1-R3). This fragment was cloned into the pRS315 vector and digested with BamHI for the synthesis of RNA with SP6 RNA polymerase. The substrate RNA is ∼265 nucleotides. RNase MRP was purified from S. cerevisiae with the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag protocol as described (1Salinas K. Wierzbicki S. Zhou L. Schmitt M.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 11352-11360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Rmp1 TAP-tagged strain used in this manuscript is KLS116 (1Salinas K. Wierzbicki S. Zhou L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 11352-11360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Primer extension was carried out as described previously (9Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E. RNase MRP cleaves the CLB2 mRNA to promote cell cycle progression: novel method of mRNA degradation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with CTS1-R3 oligonucleotide labeled with [32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase on its 5′-end. The same primer was used in a DNA sequencing reaction and run in parallel on a sequencing gel as described (9Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E. RNase MRP cleaves the CLB2 mRNA to promote cell cycle progression: novel method of mRNA degradation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Erlenmeyer flasks containing 350 ml of synthetic complete dextrose (9Gill T. Cai T. Aulds J. Wierzbicki S. Schmitt M.E.

The cultures were incubated at 28 °C and shaken until the densities reached 1.5 × 107 cells/ml. At that time, 25 ml of 210 mg/ml hydroxyurea (Arco; 99% pure) was added into each culture and incubated an additional 3 h whereupon cells were collected at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 28 °C and washed four times with 35 ml of 28 °C synthetic complete dextrose each time. Cells were suspended in 35 ml of 28 °C synthetic complete dextrose, inoculated into 350 ml of synthetic complete dextrose, and incubated at 31 °C. From these cultures, we collected 25 ml of cells at 15-min intervals from 0 to 180 min. Cell density was determined every 30 min using a hemocytometer. For each time point, cells were photographed from the most representative field for each culture at each time fraction using 450× magnification with the differential interference contrast setting. After collection at each time point, cells were immediately stored at −80 °C. Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium were inoculated at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with shaking at 28 °C for 8 h until they reached a density of around 5.0 × 107 cells/ml. We performed UV irradiation by quickly transferring all of each culture to 12 × 22-inch glass trays and irradiating cells for two 2-min intervals at 254 nm in a Stratagene Corp. Stratalinker (∼930 mJ/cm2). Cultures were stirred between irradiations and collected at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in chilled water twice, collected as before, and stored at −80 °C until lysis. Purification of RNase MRP with substrate was carried out as described previously (1Salinas K. Wierzbicki S. Zhou L. Schmitt M.E. Characterization and purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase MRP reveals a new unique protein component.J. Biol.

Instead, the tobacco etch virus protease elution was directly extracted as described below. To the tobacco etch virus protease elution we added 20% SDS to a final concentration of 5% (v/v) and 2-mercaptoethanol to 10% (v/v) and then heated the sample to 95 °C for 10 min. We allowed the samples to cool to room temperature, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and Proteinase K was added to final a concentration of 100 μg/ml. The sample was incubated at 50 °C for 1 h followed by 95 °C for 5 min to inactivate the Proteinase K. Phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation of RNA were then performed as described (18Cai T. Reilly T.R. Cerio M. Schmitt M.E. Mutagenesis of SNM1, which encodes a protein component of the yeast RNase MRP, reveals a role for this ribonucleoprotein endoribonuclease in plasmid segregation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7857-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA pellets were suspended with 200 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated double distilled H2O. RNA concentration and quality were determined by UV spectrophotometric analysis at 260 and 280 nm. Samples were run through an Agilent bioanalyzer on an RNA nanochip for qualitative analysis. Microarray analysis was performed in the State University of New York Upstate Medical University Microarray Core Facility using Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 arrays. For RNA labeling, 100 ng of total RNA was amplified using Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 from NuGEN Technologies. The cDNA generated from this protocol was fragmented and biotin-labeled using the Encore Biotin Module. Each labeled cDNA sample was then hybridized to a microarray with incubation at 45 °C in Affymetrix Hybridization Oven 645. After 18 h of incubation, the arrays were processed in Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 using reagents from Affymetrix and standard protocols. Arrays were scanned with Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 7G Plus. To identify novel RNase MRP substrates, we utilized a previously characterized strain expressing an Rmp1 TAP-tagged allele, KLS116 (1Salinas K. Wierzbicki S. Zhou L. Schmitt M.E. Characterization and purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase MRP reveals a new unique protein component.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11352-11360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cross-linked with UV irradiation as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the RNase MRP enzyme was immunoprecipitated using the TAP tag, and co-purifying RNAs were isolated and hybridized to a DNA microarray. The data were parsed in two different ways: by a call on whether it was present or absent and by an overall change in signal level over an untagged control strain. A probe proximal to a well characterized RNase MRP cleavage site in the rRNA precursor was found to be overrepresented 17.38-fold over control. Hence, we made this the cutoff for a significant hit. Remaining were 70 positive probes that were found to be overrepresented from 17.7- to 210-fold over control. These represented 64 unique ORFs (Table 1TABLE 1RNAs identified to be associated with the TAP-tagged version of Rmp1Affymetrix probe setGeneAverage -fold overrepresentedDescriptionCommentsProtein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis5670_i_atRPL34A210.6YER056C-A9897_f_atRPL31B178.4YLR406C4909_f_atRPS23A87.6YGR118W7707_i_atRPL43A71.1YPR043W7633_s_atRPL11A67.0YPR102C6069_i_atRPL12B63.7YDR418W10386_s_atRPL8B63.4YLL045C4165_i_atRPL34B59.6YIL052C5985_atRPL27B59.5YDR471W5075_i_atRPL7A57.3YGL076C10783_atSNR19050.4SNR190; small nuclear RNA190C/D box LSU G23955076_f_atRPL7A47.9YGL076C8054_atSNR5043.6SNR50 snRNAC/D box LSU G86710387_atYLL044w41.1YLL044W; questionable ORFOverlaps with RPL8B5142_i_atRPL9A38.4YGL147C6866_atRPS14A36.6YCR031C8270_f_atRPS10A36.0YOR293W8246_s_atYOR309C35.5YOR309COverlaps with Nop586493_atNOP134.1YDL014W9691_i_atRPS1B33.8YML063W10739_f_atRPL17A33.4YKL180W7454_s_atRPL23A32.1YBL087C6672_s_atRPL35A31.4YDL191W9193_atSNR7327.9SNR73; snRNAC/D box position C29599176_atKRI127.1YNL308CrRNA processing4528_i_atRPL27A25.7YHR010W9496_atRPL13B25.0YMR142C7316_s_atRPS11B24.8YBR048W10707_atSRP2122.3YKL122C; component of signal recognition particle6070_s_atRPL12B21.8YDR418W10717_atRPS27A21.2YKL156W7806_atEGD120.8YPL037C; associated with ribosomes8879_atPUB120.1YNL016W; poly(A)+ RNA-binding protein7656_s_atTEF120.0YPR080W; translational elongation factor EF-1α5807_atSNR1320.0SNR13; snRNAC/D box LSU A22807191_f_atRPS9B19.9YBR189W11205_i_atRPL17B19.8YJL177W4771_atNOP1919.3YGR251WrRNA processing4516_f_atRPL14B17.8YHL001W6895_atSRO917.7YCL037C; RNA binding associated with ribosome3808_s_atITS117.4RDN37-1; 35 S ribosomal RNATy elements3781_f_at66.4YLRWTY1-2; full length Ty13350_f_at50.7YERCTY1-1; full length Ty13786_s_at42.9Ty1B proteinCell cycle6301_atCPR185.9YDR155C; cyclophilin10045_atCTS167.9YLR286C; endochitinase6235_atHTB128.4YDR224C; histone H2B7369_s_atHHT123.0YBR010W; histone H310243_atSIC120.9YLR079W; p40 inhibitor of Cdc284233_atSIM120.8YIL123W; involved in cell cycle regulation and aging7245_atCMD119.6YBR109C; calmodulinMetabolism11031_s_atTDH2105.2YJR009C; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase9979_atILV571.6YLR355C; acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase8973_atLEU437.9YNL104C; α-isopropylmalate synthase4856_atCYS423.2YGR155W; cystathionine β-synthase7689_atSPE320.3YPR069C; putrescine aminopropyltransferase4499_atTHR120.0YHR025W; homoserine kinase4321_atBAT119.8YHR208W; branched-chain amino acid transaminase7152_atPGI118.9YBR196C; glucose-6-phosphate isomeraseOthers6954_atLSR1140.0LSR1; U2 snRNA10180_atSTM175.7YLR150W; specific affinity for G-rich quadruplex nucleic acids7290_atTIP147.7YBR067C; cell wall mannoprotein6324_g_at40.6YDR133C; questionable ORF4709_atSCW438.2YGR279C; glucanase gene family member5553_atBUR634.8YER159C; transcriptional regulator4526_atSOD229.3YHR008C; manganese-containing superoxide dismutase4561_s_atSNR7-L26.2SNR7-L; U5 snRNA5923_at25.4YDL085c-a; identified by SAGE4751_atPHB224.8YGR231C; mitochondrial protein; prohibitin homolog5268_atGUS124.0YGL245W; glutamine-tRNA ligase8935_atCOX5a23.7YNL052W; cytochrome-c oxidase chain Va5709_atNTF223.4YER009W; nuclear import8314_g_atSRL122.7YOR247W; mannoprotein associated with the cell wall9974_atORM222.6YLR350W3949_i_atYIP322.5YNL044W; ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport10954_atLIA121.9YJR070C; deoxyhypusine hydroxylase6410_atSSS118.7YDR086C; part of the Sec61 trimeric complex7639_atRPN718.5YPR108W; subunit of the regulatory particle of the proteasome5728_i_atPMP218.1YEL017C-A; proteolipid with plasma membrane H+-ATPase Open table in a new tab Many of these co-precipitating RNAs were encoded by ribosomal protein genes, but there were several groups of RNAs identified whose products are involved in other aspects of protein synthesis. However, most abundant in terms of hybridization signal were ribosomal protein transcripts. This abundance may be an artifact of their high abundance in a cell; however, levels of these transcripts were considerably lower or absent in the untagged strain. In addition to transcripts whose product is involved in translation, we encountered a small group of cell cycle-regulated transcripts. To verify whether or not the individual RNAs identified by microarray analysis were indeed RNase MRP substrates, we first determined whether the steady-state level of each RNA was altered in RNase MRP mutants. Compared with wild-type cells, RNase MRP mutants exhibit decreased RNA processing ability, resulting in an increase in the stability and hence the amount of substrate RNA in the cell. This relative increase of substrate RNA in RNase MRP mutants compared with wild-type cells can be measured most effectively by Northern blot analysis. We selected several RNAs with elevated signals from the RIP-chip analysis: RPL31b, RPL34a, STM1, and LSR1 were chosen based on their exceptionally high hybridization levels; CTS1, SIC1, and HTB1 were selected as representative cell cycle-regulated transcripts; NOP1 was selected as representative of rRNA processing; and Ty1 RNA was examined because of the multiple hits we received with it. We choose four different RNase MRP mutant strains to examine RNA levels. Two of the mutants contained different temperature-sensitive alleles of the RNase MRP RNA, nme1-P6 and nme1-Δ2 (19Shadel G.S. Buckenmeyer G.A. Clayton D.A. Schmitt M.E. Mutational analysis of the RNA component of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase MRP reveals distinct nuclear phenotypes.Gene. 2000; 245: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and two contained different temperature-sensitive alleles of a unique RNase MRP protein component, snm1-172 and snm1-P18 (18Cai T. Reilly T.R. Cerio M. Schmitt M.E. Mutagenesis of SNM1, which encodes a protein component of the yeast RNase MRP, reveals a role for this ribonucleoprotein endoribonuclease in plasmid segregation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7857-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was collected from all four yeast strains along with wild-type controls. RNA was separated, blotted, and probed using DNA probes specific for each mRNA. The steady-state mRNA levels of RPL31b, RPL34a, HTB1, NOP1, and STM1 showed only modest changes in the mutant strains as compared with the wild-type strains (data not shown). These results indicate that although these transcripts may associate with RNase MRP they are not necessarily substrates of the enzyme. In contrast, Northern blot analysis of SIC1, LSR1, and CTS1 indicated an increase in RNA levels consistent with RNase MRP playing a role in their degradation (Fig. 1). SIC1, the yeast homolog of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is a key regulator of mitotic exit and Clb2p abundance. Human p27 has been implicated in cell cycle deregulation and cancer development (20Barberis M. De Gioia L. Ruzzene M. Sarno S. Coccetti P. Fantucci P. Vanoni M. Alberghina L. The yeast cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 and mammalian p27Kip1 are functional homologues with a structurally conserved inhibitory domain.Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SIC1 is expressed in a manner similar to but slightly later than CLB2 mRNA and is enriched >2-fold in RNase MRP mutants as determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a sic1Δ/nme1-p6 double mutant exhibits a synthetic growth defect, indicating a genetic interaction likely due to their roles in reducing Clb2 activity (Fig. 2A). The elevated SIC1 mRNA levels and its association with Rmp1 strongly suggest that it is an RNase MRP substrate and indicate that RNase MRP may have additional roles in fine tuning mitotic exit. LSR1, the U2 snRNA and integral component of the spliceosome required for splicing of intron-bearing transcripts, exhibited a significant enrichment in the RIP-chip analysis. Northern analysis showed an elevation of LSR1 RNA levels in MRP mutants as compared with wild-type cells, indicating that RNase MRP may function in the assembly or degradation of this RNA (Fig. 1C). We directly tested for genetic interactions between the nme1-P6 mutation and two non-essential protein components of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, Msl1 and Lea1. Msl1 and Lea1 are the U2B component and U2A component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, respectively (21Stevens S.W. Ryan D.E. Ge H.Y. Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Composition and functional characterization of the yeast spliceosomal penta-snRNP.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Double mutants containing either msl1Δ/nme1-p6 or lea1Δ/nme1-p6 were found to be slow growing (Fig. 2B). We also found that deletion of DBR1, the gene for the debranching enzyme that resolves the excised intron lariat (22Chapman K.B. Boeke J.D. Isolation and characterization of the gene encoding yeast debranching enzyme.Cell. 1991; 65: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), is growth-defective in combination with nme1-p6 (Fig. 2B). In addition, a deletion of the gene for the pseudouridine synthase, Pus7, which is necessary for the proper pseudouridylation of U2 RNA (23Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. Pseudouridylation (ψ) of U2 snRNA in S. cerevisiae is catalyzed by an RNA-independent mechanism.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), exhibits a genetic interaction with RNase MRP (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W1834072123,"The biosynthesis of steroid hormones, essential to the survival of all mammals, is dependent on the activity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-Δ4 isomerase (3βHSD). 3βHSD activity is, in turn, influenced by cytochrome-b5 (Cyt-b5). However, the mechanism through which this occurs is unknown. In this study, we investigated this mechanism by evaluating the influence of Cyt-b5 on the dehydrogenase and isomerase activities of 3βHSD. Capra hircus 3βHSD was overexpressed in SF-9 cells, using a baculovirus expression system, and purified. Substrate and cofactor kinetics were determined spectrophotometrically in the presence and absence of purified Ovis aries liver Cyt-b5. Nonspecific enzyme activity was evaluated by zero-enzyme, -substrate, and -cofactor blanks. Fusion proteins, 3βHSD-eCFP, and Cyt-b5-eYFP were subsequently coexpressed in COS-1 cells and analyzed for FRET. A CFP-YFP fusion protein served as positive control, while coexpression of 3βHSD-eCFP and cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase-eYFP (CYP17A1-eYFP) served as negative control. Results showed Cyt-b5 to decrease the Km,NAD+ value of 3βHSD ≈3.5-fold while increasing the Vmax,app of the dehydrogenase reaction ≈17%. FRET analysis showed COS-1 cells coexpressing 3βHSD-eCFP and Cyt-b5-eYFP to exhibit a FRET signal ≈9-fold greater than that of the negative control. These results indicate that Cyt-b5 augments 3βHSD activity via an allosteric mechanism by increasing the affinity of the enzyme toward NAD+.—Goosen, P., Swart, A. C., Storbeck, K.-H., Swart, P.

This year, the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award will be shared by Michael Sheetz, James Spudich, and Ronald Vale for discoveries concerning the biophysical actions of cytoskeletal motor-protein machines that move cargo within cells, contract muscles, and enable cell motility. “Nothing is more revealing than movement.”—Martha Graham As the Mars rover Curiosity begins its unmanned exploration of the surface of the Red Planet, Earth-bound scientists debate whether alien life can be recognized as such by an automated system performing analytical experiments based on our own experience with the biochemistry of living organisms. Yet there can be no doubt that one observation would settle the matter forever: the observation of something strolling by the rover’s camera and turning to look at it. The biochemistry of life may be moot, but one phenomenon is linked to it so tightly as to not be debatable: purposeful movement. Not every living organism exhibits this property in an obvious fashion, but anything that exhibits it is living. Nor is such movement confined to the organism as a whole or to its appendages. Inside of every living cell is a vast and complex transportation network resembling that of 19th century England, with cargo being hauled on railroad tracks to precise destinations by sophisticated machinery. Proper operation of this system is essential for the function of all eukaryotic cells, but nowhere is it more dramatically important than in the central nervous system, where neurons as long as a meter depend on machines to transport substances as small as acetylcholine and as large as ribosomes vast distances with precision and speed. The 2012 Lasker Basic Medical Research Award recognizes the three scientists who discovered the engines that power such machines and showed how they work. The study of motility in biology has a long history, but its molecular investigation began in the middle of the 20th century, when Hugh Huxley and others proposed and later validated a model for how an ATP-dependent motor protein, myosin, might drive muscle contraction. A major figure in that story was Jim Spudich, who started his career at Stanford in 1971 by trying to obtain evidence for Huxley’s swinging/tilting lever arm hypothesis for muscle contraction, which requires a large conformational change in the myosin head domain during the power stroke. Although studies of muscle led many people to conclude that other forms of motility might operate in similar ways, identification of the players in those systems eluded investigators until the 1980s, in large part because there was no assay that would permit their biochemical isolation. All that changed during a remarkable four-year period that began in 1982, when Mike Sheetz decided to take a sabbatical at Stanford in the Spudich laboratory. There, he undertook the formidable task of developing an in vitro motility assay that did not involve the enormous biochemical complexity of muscle fibers or cilia and flagella. By coating beads with crude heavy meromyosin preparations, Sheetz and Spudich were able to show in 1983 that ATP-dependent movement along actin cables in flayed algal cells could be observed directly (Sheetz and Spudich, 1983Sheetz M.P. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1983; 303: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar); this was followed rapidly by an improved assay using purified myosin and actin, which allowed them to demonstrate that myosin can move along actin cables with a velocity comparable to that of muscle contraction (Spudich et al., 1985Spudich J.A. Kron S.J. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 1985; 315: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Spudich and associates went on to use this assay to establish the biophysical parameters for myosin movement, to validate the swinging/tilting lever model in detail (e.g., Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and to show that cytoplasmic myosin powers cytokinesis (reviewed in Robinson and Spudich, 2004Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). His studies also mark the beginning of the field of single molecule biology, which has made important contributions to our understanding of many cellular processes, including DNA replication. Ron Vale enters the picture at the same time. He met Sheetz and Spudich in 1982, when he was a graduate student in neuroscience in Eric Shooter’s lab at Stanford. Working with Sheetz and Andrew Szent-Gyorgyi, Vale used their newly developed assay to show that myosin movement on actin is calcium dependent (Vale et al., 1984Vale R.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Sheetz M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1984; 81: 6775-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Then, in 1983, he decided to employ the same principles to develop an assay for the transport of substances along the axons in neurons and, accompanying Sheetz to the Marine Biology Laboratory at Woods Hole, began, with collaborators Bruce Schnapp and Thomas Reese, to carry out experiments that led to the biochemical identification of the force-generating molecule. In a landmark series of five papers in 1985, Sheetz, Vale, and coworkers published the first in vitro assay for cytoplasmic transport and used it to show: (1) that axonal transport runs along railroad tracks and does not operate via fluid flow, as others had proposed, and that the railroad tracks are microtubules (Vale et al., 1985bVale R.D. Schnapp B.J. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 40: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); (2) that the transport along single microtubules is bidirectional (Schnapp et al., 1985Schnapp B.J. Vale R.D. Sheetz M.P. Reese T.S. Cell. 1985; 40: 455-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); (3) that a single protein, which could be isolated from either squid or mammalian brain and was later dubbed kinesin, was sufficient to power this transport in an ATP-dependent manner (Vale et al., 1985cVale R.D. Schnapp B.J. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 40: 559-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); (4) that kinesin-powered transport operates solely in the plus-end direction (toward the nerve terminal) (Vale et al., 1985aVale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar); (5) and that minus-end motion from the terminal toward the cell body requires a different motor protein that has the properties of the microtubule-binding protein dynein (Vale et al., 1985dVale R.D. Schnapp B.J. Mitchison T. Steuer E. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 43: 623-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). One may assume that Vale’s Ph.D. defense, which occurred that same year, was a relatively painless affair. Vale went on, as an independent investigator, to develop a complete structural model for kinesin action. Together with UCSF colleague Bob Fletterick, he worked out the three-dimensional structure of kinesin by X-ray crystallography and showed that it is similar to the structure of myosin (Kull et al., 1996Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). He then joined with Ron Milligan to use electron microscopy to determine how kinesin binds to tubulin and how its nucleotide-dependent conformational change powers its movement (reviewed in Vale and Milligan, 2000Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). More recently, he has turned his attention to dynein, a much larger motor protein about which much less is known. He has determined structures of its tubulin-binding domain and its motor domain, which have begun to shed light on how ATP hydrolysis powers its retrograde transport function (Carter et al., 2011Carter A.P. Cho C. Jin L. Vale R.D. Science. 2011; 331: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). With the advent of complete genome sequencing, the general importance of the work of Sheetz, Spudich, and Vale has become even more evident. For example, the kinesin superfamily in humans encompasses 45 distinct motor proteins. These molecules power not just axonal transport, but also, among other things, vesicle trafficking, messenger RNA localization, ribosome transport for local protein synthesis, the transport of whole mitochondria, chromosome movement, microtubule dynamics, and the transport of viruses within their host cells. Much has also been learned about the molecules that regulate these motors. A family of small GTPases, the Rab proteins, which were initially identified in the late 1980s, has emerged as master regulators of intracellular trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. Rab proteins cycle between distinct conformations that are dependent on their guanine-nucleotide-bound status: an active (GTP-bound) state, in which they localize to the cytosolic face of specific membranes and recruit downstream effector proteins, which include microtubule-bound kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein motor complexes. Other Rabs associate with microtubule-based motors via adaptor proteins that simultaneously interact with both the GTP-bound Rab and specific motor complexes. Binding to Rab proteins initiates a series of intracellular trafficking steps, including vesicle motility. Figure 1 shows an artist’s conception of a kinesin motor protein walking a large Rab-bound vesicle along a microtubule railroad track. But kinesins are far from the whole story. In the central nervous system alone, the formation of new synapses requires active transport driven by molecular motor proteins to move synaptic cargo to their specific sites of action along both microtubules (where the motors are both kinesin and dynein, depending on the direction of motion) or actin filaments (where the motor is cytoplasmic myosin). These mechanisms are crucial both for synaptogenesis and for activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength during plasticity. Much also remains to be learned about dynein and the way that it is regulated. In contrast to the relatively simple structure of kinesin, the dynein motor proteins typically have six tandemly linked so-called AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) domains arranged in a ring, a long N-terminal tail, and a coiled-coil stalk. Cytoplasmic dyneins function as individual homodimers and, as noted above, are responsible for minus-end-oriented transport along microtubules. But there are also axonemal dyneins, found in flagella and cilia, that are anchored in arrays to peripheral microtubules by their N-terminal tails and generate sliding motions of adjacent microtubule doublets toward the plus end. It appears that the coiled-coil stalk transmits conformational information between the AAA+ domains and the microtubule-binding domain. In the dynein arrays, a number of isoforms of axonemal dyneins are integrated to generate the bending motions of the flagella and cilia filaments. A crystal structure of an “ATP-bound” and/or “ADP-Pi-bound” state will be needed to reveal the key “prestroke” conformation of dynein; the current structures are of the ADP (Dictyostelium) and nucleotide-free (yeast) “post-stroke” states. Information on both the pre- and post-powerstroke conformations will be essential for understanding the motility cycle of dynein, as it has been for myosin. But, as Cho and Vale point out in a recent review (Cho and Vale, 2012Cho C. Vale R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), there are likely to be many more important conformations to investigate, as dynein has three other nucleotide-binding sites in addition to the main ATP hydrolysis site. Variations in the nucleotide state of these sites may well change the conformation of the AAA+ ring. The current model for dynein function also requires more direct data to establish precisely what conformational changes occur during dynein’s ATPase cycle. Structural studies of the dynein stalk will likely provide new insight into how coiled coils are used in biological systems. Computational studies as well as direct experimental observation of the conformational changes will be important next steps, as will studies of the possible role of random, diffusional motions of the head relative to the other domains. Of course, eventually, it will also be necessary to work out the structure and dynamics of the dynein holoenzyme as it exists in the cell. Several studies have already started to dissect how newly discovered dynein adaptor proteins such as Lis1 and dynactin regulate dynein’s ATPase activity and processivity. Also, there are important studies ongoing concerning the myosin motor and its mechanism, both in muscle contraction and inside of the cell. Spudich and coworkers have shown that the stroke size varies with the type of myosin, from 10 nm for myosin II to 36 nm for myosin VI (the only myosin that moves in the minus-end direction; for example, Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The force generated by a single myosin molecule is impressive: 5 pN or more. Some myosins have a lever arm swing of about 70 degrees, but others, despite having a short canonical lever arm, swing through an angle of almost 180 degrees. Some, like myosin V and VI, are processive, whereas others, such as myosin II, appear not to be. It seems that, at least for myosin V, when the lever arm stroke is completed, the trailing head of the two-headed molecule searches for the next actin-binding site by free diffusion. X-ray diffraction studies, not only of myosin itself (first by Ivan Rayment’s lab and then by the groups of Carolyn Cohen and Anne Houdusse), but also of intact muscles and single muscle fibers with permeabilized membranes have revealed the structural changes that underlie force generation and work production by this motor. The general structural features of the motor domain are now well established, as is a subset of the structural changes that occur during the actin-myosin catalytic cycle (reviewed in Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Not yet visualized are the structural rearrangements triggered by actin binding and the way that they are coupled to force generation and product release. Time-resolved low-angle X-ray diffraction on contracting muscle fibers using synchrotron radiation sources has also been used recently (by Hugh Huxley and others; see Huxley, 2004Huxley H.E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1879-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to follow movement of myosin heads with both temporal and spatial resolution under near physiological conditions. Motor proteins have also been shown to play important roles in human disease. Mutations in kinesins cause inherited neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie Tooth disease, as well as some kidney diseases, and mutations in myosin or its binding proteins often lead to severe myopathies, including familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an autosomal dominant disorder that can cause sudden death in young athletes. Dynein deficiencies give rise to chronic infections of the respiratory tract due to cilia dysfunction. Drugs that target kinesin are under development for cancer chemotherapy, and myosin-targeting drugs are being tested in the clinic for heart disease. There are a number of morals from this story, not the least of which is the importance of a good biochemical assay. The power of fluorescent-labeling and multiphoton microscopy has tended to shift the emphasis in cell biology away from in vitro biochemical studies toward direct observation in living cells. Though this is clearly valuable, it is good to remember how much progress can be made in unraveling the details of a complex system if it can be replicated in such a way that its parts can be identified and their functions studied in relative isolation. The 2012 Lasker Award to Michael Sheetz, James Spudich, and Ronald Vale is a testimony to what can be learned by developing the right assay and following where it leads. Galileo Galilei, after being forced to recant his belief that the Earth moves around the sun, is said to have muttered “Eppur si muove”—“And yet, it moves” —as he was led away to house arrest. It was Galileo, of course, who first used a telescope to observe the Red Planet and later made precise measurements of the changes in the distance of Mars from the Earth to support his claim that the planets revolve around a fixed point that is not the Earth. Curiosity will probably not be fortunate enough to observe a Martian moving past its camera lens, but if we were able to look inside even the most primitive unicellular extraterrestrial organism, the odds are we would see that “and yet, it moves.” Moreover, that movement would be not just the Brownian motion of individual particles but, rather, purposeful movement along specific tracks to specific destinations. And behind the movement will be motors. Sheetz, Spudich, and Vale opened the door to a more detailed understanding of how the motors that power such movement in earthly cells perform this remarkable and essential job."
