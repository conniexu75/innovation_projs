https://openalex.org/W4210664421,"<h2>Summary</h2> The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) contains mutations that mediate escape from antibody responses, although the extent to which these substitutions in spike and non-spike proteins affect T cell recognition is unknown. In this study, we show that T cell responses in individuals with prior infection, vaccination, both prior infection and vaccination, and boosted vaccination are largely preserved to Omicron spike and non-spike proteins. However, we also identify a subset of individuals (∼21%) with a >50% reduction in T cell reactivity to the Omicron spike. Evaluation of functional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell responses confirmed these findings and revealed that reduced recognition to Omicron spike is primarily observed within the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment potentially due to escape from HLA binding. Booster vaccination enhanced T cell responses to Omicron spike. In contrast to neutralizing immunity, these findings suggest preservation of T cell responses to the Omicron variant, although with reduced reactivity in some individuals."

An in-depth comparison of the GC responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in healthy and immunocompromised individuals has not yet been performed due to the challenge of directly probing human lymph nodes. Herein, through a fine-needle aspiration-based approach, we profiled the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in lymph nodes of healthy individuals and kidney transplant recipients (KTXs). We found that, unlike healthy subjects, KTXs presented deeply blunted SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses coupled with severely hindered T follicular helper cell, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-specific memory B cell, and neutralizing antibody responses. KTXs also displayed reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell frequencies. Broadly, these data indicate impaired GC-derived immunity in immunocompromised individuals and suggest a GC origin for certain humoral and memory B cell responses following mRNA vaccination.

This vaccine platform was first licensed for human use during the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Bettini and Locci, 2021Bettini E. Locci M.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development.Nature. 2020; 586: 516-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), and much still needs to be learned about the quality of the immune responses elicited by mRNA vaccines. Most vaccines confer protection by eliciting antigen-specific antibodies (Abs) and memory B cells (MBCs) (Plotkin, 2010Plotkin S.A. Correlates of protection induced by Vaccination.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar; Sallusto et al., 2010Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Araki K. Ahmed R. From vaccines to memory and back.Immunity. 2010; 33: 451-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Abs are secreted by plasma cells and can potentially neutralize pathogens and prevent infections. Equally important are MBCs that act as a second line of defense and give rise to a quick burst of Ab-secreting plasma cells if the pathogens break through the “protective wall” of the pre-existing Abs. Plasma cells and MBCs are commonly generated during germinal center (GC) reactions (Allen et al., 2007Allen C.D.C. Okada T. Cyster J.G.

In GCs, activated B cells first undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) in their immunoglobulin genes. Next, the high-affinity GC B cell clones resulting from the SHM process are positively selected and ultimately differentiate into long-lived plasma cells and MBCs. GC reactions are orchestrated by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, specialized CD4 T cells that deliver a variety of signals shaping the fate of GC B cells (Crotty, 2019Crotty S.

In line with these data, studies characterizing the immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in humans found a robust generation of nAbs and MBCs (Bettini and Locci, 2021Bettini E. Locci M.

Lei T. Thapa M. Chen R.E. Case J.B. et al.SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses.Nature. 2021; 596: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), all published human vaccine studies focused on the analysis of the immune responses measurable in peripheral blood. Hence, a thorough evaluation of the GC reactions driven by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in humans, including their connection with nAbs and MBCs, is still missing. Another question that warrants further investigation is whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines can promote high-quality immune responses in individuals lacking a fully functional immune system, such as solid organ transplant recipients (SOTs). Immunosuppressant (IS) drugs administered to SOTs can cause a global immune system dysfunction spanning from defective antigen-presenting cell differentiation, maturation, and migration (Chen et al., 2004Chen T.

Some studies suggested that a fraction of SOTs can generate detectable SARS-CoV-2-binding Ab titers, whereas others indicated that SOTs completely fail to produce B cell responses and Abs to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. A common denominator, however, is the heavily curtailed nAb production in SOTs following immunization. Although the evidence from studies conducted with blood samples hints at crippled GC formation, the exploration of GC responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in SOTs remains uncharted territory. Herein, by deploying a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) approach (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2020Havenar-Daughton C. Newton I.G. Zare S.Y. Reiss S.M. Schwan B. Suh M.J. Hasteh F. Levi G. Crotty S. Normal human lymph node T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells accessed via fine needle aspirations.J. Immunol. Methods. 2020; 479: 112746Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we evaluated the GC responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in draining LNs of healthy donors (HDs) and kidney transplant recipients (KTXs) and assessed their connection to humoral and MBC responses. Our study uncovered a potent elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (Full S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific GC B cells localized in vaccine-draining LNs upon primary immunization of healthy individuals, which was further enhanced by a second vaccine dose. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses were associated with a robust induction of Tfh cells, class-switched RBD-specific MBCs and nAbs. These findings were in stark contrast to a profound impairment of the GC responses in KTXs, which was coupled to a nearly abolished RBD-specific memory B cell response and nAb formation, and opposed to a measurable generation of class-switched S-specific MBCs binding Full S outside the RBD region. Overall, this study shows that in individuals with an intact immune system, class-switched RBD-specific MBCs and nAbs are induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and might have a GC origin. Conversely, these responses are not efficiently generated following vaccination in individuals receiving IS drugs. This work has important implications for guiding future studies aimed at unraveling human immune responses after vaccination and for supporting the decision to perform additional booster immunizations against SARS-CoV-2 in people with a compromised immune system. GC B cells and Tfh cells are only present in lymphoid tissues and cannot be studied in blood (Vella et al., 2019Vella L.A. Buggert M. Manne S. Herati R.S. Sayin I. Kuri-Cervantes L. Bukh Brody I.B. O’Boyle K.C. Kaprielian H. Giles J.R. et al.T follicular helper cells in human efferent lymph retain lymphoid characteristics.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129: 3185-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Hence, we conducted a human study where lymphoid tissue immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were probed in healthy individuals via FNA. The FNA approach has been successfully used to track GC B cell responses to vaccination in humans (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2020Havenar-Daughton C. Newton I.G. Zare S.Y. Reiss S.M. Schwan B. Suh M.J.

In total, 15 HDs (23–76 years old) were enrolled in this study prior to vaccination with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (Table S1). FNA samples were collected two weeks after the first immunization (V2: day 14+/−2) and eight days after the second immunization (V3: day 8+/−2) (Figure 1A). Matched blood samples were also obtained at the same time points and before vaccination (V1). Axillary draining LNs from the same arm where the vaccines were administered were visualized by ultrasound to guide the FNA procedure (Figure 1B). In HDs, the number of live cells recovered from FNAs ranged from 0.3 to 40 × 106 cells. A 23-parameter flow cytometry assay was performed on FNA samples to profile the immune responses induced by vaccination. GC B cells were defined as class-switched B cells co-expressing CD38, low-intermediate levels of CD27 and BCL6 (Figure 1C and S1A). Pre-pandemic tonsil samples, which are highly enriched in GCs, and putative quiescent cadaveric LNs from SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination elicited detectable GC B cell responses after primary immunization, which were further enhanced by the booster vaccination (Figure 1C). The increase in GC B cell frequencies was measurable when the responses were evaluated following a paired (11 individuals) or an orthogonal (15 individuals) analysis approach (Figures 1D and S1B). No correlation between age and GC B cell frequencies was observed (Figure S1C). Next, SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells were stratified into those binding fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 Full S tetrameric probes within (Full S+ RBD+) or outside (Full S+ RBD−) of the RBD region, while failing to bind an irrelevant tetrameric probe (influenza hemagglutinin, HA) (Figures 1E and S1A). The specificity of the probes is indicated by the lack of Full S- and RBD-specific GC B cells in pre-pandemic tonsils (Figure 1E). Overall, a boost in both Full S+ RBD− and RBD+ GC B cell frequencies following the second vaccine dose was observed (Figures 1F and S1D). Similar to total GC B cells, SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells did not correlate with age (Figure S1E). Next, to determine if mRNA vaccine-induced GC responses were detectable in nondraining LNs, we collected contralateral axillary LNs, which do not directly drain the mRNA vaccines from the injection site, after the booster immunization (n = 4). When compared with the matched draining (ipsilateral) LNs, the contralateral LNs displayed a trend for lower frequencies of GC B cells (Figures 1G and 1H), which were not SARS-CoV-2-specific (Figures 1I and 1J). Overall, these data demonstrate that in immunocompetent subjects, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines efficiently elicit antigen-specific GC B cell responses that are enhanced by a booster immunization and localized in the ipsilateral draining LNs.Figure S1GC B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are detectable in vaccine-draining LNs of HDs, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative flow cytometry gating strategy for defining GC B cells (CD19+CD4−CD8−IgM−IgD−CD38+CD27lo/intBCL6+), SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells (CD19+CD4−CD8−IgM−IgD−CD38+CD27lo/intBCL6+HA−S+RBD+/−), and class-switched MBCs (CD19+CD4−CD8−IgM−IgD−CD38−CD27+).(B) Quantification of GC B cells from draining LNs of HDs.

By enabling the selection of high-affinity GC B cells and curbing the magnitude of GC reactions, Tfh cells modulate affinity maturation in infection and vaccination (Crotty, 2019Crotty S.

We measured the frequency of GC Tfh cells (referred to as Tfh cells) defined by the signature markers CXCR5 and PD-1 (Figures 2A and S2A). Expression of the lineage-defining transcription factor BCL6 confirmed the identity of this population as Tfh cells (Figure 2B). Negligible Tfh cell frequencies were found in quiescent LNs from cadaveric donors (Figure S2B) and the contralateral LNs of vaccinees (Figure 2A), in contrast to a more abundant Tfh cell presence in tonsils (Figure S2B). The frequencies of Tfh cells in ipsilateral LNs of vaccinated HDs had a trend for higher values than that in contralateral LNs (p = 0.056, Figure 2C) and increased after the second vaccine dose (Figures 2D and S2C). Tfh cells are a functionally heterogenous population that, in humans, is functionally stratified by chemokine receptor expression (Ueno, 2016Ueno H.

We found that hyperexcitable hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/OX) neurons drive sleep fragmentation during aging. In aged mice, Hcrt neurons exhibited more frequent neuronal activity epochs driving wake bouts, and optogenetic activation of Hcrt neurons elicited more prolonged wakefulness. Aged Hcrt neurons showed hyperexcitability with lower KCNQ2 expression and impaired M-current, mediated by KCNQ2/3 channels. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed adaptive changes to Hcrt neuron loss in the aging brain. Disruption of Kcnq2/3 genes in Hcrt neurons of young mice destabilized sleep, mimicking aging-associated sleep fragmentation, whereas the KCNQ-selective activator flupirtine hyperpolarized Hcrt neurons and rejuvenated sleep architecture in aged mice. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism underlying sleep instability during aging and a strategy to improve sleep continuity."
https://openalex.org/W4213416297,"Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are innate immune effectors that contribute to host defense. Whether ILC3 functions are stably modified after pathogen encounter is unknown. Here, we assess the impact of a time-restricted enterobacterial challenge to long-term ILC3 activation in mice. We found that intestinal ILC3s persist for months in an activated state after exposure to Citrobacter rodentium . Upon rechallenge, these “trained” ILC3s proliferate, display enhanced interleukin-22 (IL-22) responses, and have a superior capacity to control infection compared with naïve ILC3s. Metabolic changes occur in C. rodentium –exposed ILC3s, but only trained ILC3s have an enhanced proliferative capacity that contributes to increased IL-22 production. Accordingly, a limited encounter with a pathogen can promote durable phenotypic and functional changes in intestinal ILC3s that contribute to long-term mucosal defense."

However, the problem of how best to characterize ancestral relationships from the totality of human genomic variation remains unsolved. Here, we address this challenge with nonparametric methods that enable us to infer a unified genealogy of modern and ancient humans. This compact representation of multiple datasets explores the challenges of missing and erroneous data and uses ancient samples to constrain and date relationships. We demonstrate the power of the method to recover relationships between individuals and populations as well as to identify descendants of ancient samples.

In mammals, telomerase recruitment to telomeres is mediated by TPP1, which assembles as a heterodimer with POT1. We report structures of DNA-bound telomerase in complex with TPP1 and with TPP1-POT1 at 3.2- and 3.9-angstrom resolution, respectively. Our structures define interactions between telomerase and TPP1-POT1 that are crucial for telomerase recruitment to telomeres. The presence of TPP1-POT1 stabilizes the DNA, revealing an unexpected path by which DNA exits the telomerase active site and a DNA anchor site on telomerase that is important for telomerase processivity. Our findings rationalize extensive prior genetic and biochemical findings and provide a framework for future mechanistic work on telomerase regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4213456029,"Background Emerging variants of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed over 3000 lives in Nigeria and vaccination remains a means of reducing the death toll. Despite ongoing efforts by the government to ensure COVID-19 vaccination of most residents to attain herd immunity, myths and beliefs have adversely shaped the perception of most Nigerians, challenging the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. This study aimed to assess the factors influencing the awareness, perception, and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine among Nigerian adults. Methods A cross-sectional online nationwide study was conducted from April to June 2021 among Nigerian adult population using the snowballing method. Descriptive analysis was used to summarise the data. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify the predictors of COVID-19 uptake among the respondents. A p value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 1058 completed forms were analysed and 63.9% were females. The mean age was 40.8 years±12.2 years. Most of the respondents (740; 69.5%) had satisfactory awareness of the vaccination exercise. The media was the main source of information. Health workers reported higher level of awareness (aOR = 1.822, 95% CI: 1.388–2.524, p&lt;0.001). Respondents that are Christians and Muslims had better awareness compared to the unaffiliated (aOR = 6.398, 95% CI: 1.918–21.338, P = 0.003) and (aOR = 7.595, 95% CI: 2.280–25.301, p&lt;0.001) respectively. There is average score for perception statements (566; 53.2%) towards COVID-19 vaccination. Close to half of the respondents (44.2%) found the short period of COVID-19 production worrisome. Majority of the respondents were willing to get the vaccine (856; 80.9%). Those without a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 had a lower willingness to get vaccinated (aOR = 0.210 (95% CI: 0.082–0.536) P = 0.001). Conclusion The study revealed a high level of awareness, willingness to receive the vaccine and moderate perception towards the vaccination activities. Influencing factors that significantly affects awareness were religion, occupation, education and prior diagnosis of COVID-19; for perception and willingness—occupation, and prior diagnosis of the COVID-19 were influencing factors."

However, identifying the evolutionary impacts of human activities is challenging because of a lack of temporal data and limited knowledge of the genetic basis of most traits. Here, we identify the drivers of evolution toward maturity at an earlier age in Atlantic salmon through two types of fisheries-induced evolution acting in opposing directions: an indirect effect linked with harvest of a salmon prey species (capelin) at sea (selection against late maturation) and a direct effect due to net fishing in rivers (selection against early maturation). Because capelin are harvested as an aquaculture feed protein source, we hereby determine an indirect path by which salmon aquaculture may influence wild salmon populations."

In a typical lasing arrangement, the transverse spatial profile of a laser mode tends to remain self-similar throughout the entire cavity. Going beyond this paradigm, we demonstrate here how to shape a spatially evolving mode such that it faithfully settles into a pair of bi-orthogonal states at the two opposing facets of a laser cavity. This was achieved by purposely designing a structure that allows the lasing mode to encircle a non-Hermitian exceptional point while deliberately avoiding non-adiabatic jumps. The resulting state transfer reflects the unique topology of the associated Riemann surfaces associated with this singularity. Our approach provides a route to developing versatile mode-selective active devices and sheds light on the interesting topological features of exceptional points."

With the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in the use of telemedicine to connect patients and healthcare providers, which has been made possible by mobile health (mHealth) applications. The goal of this study was to compare the satisfaction of patients with telemedicine among mHealth users and non-users. This was a survey-based study that included outpatients from Abu Dhabi. The association between patient satisfaction with telemedicine and use of mHealth technologies was described using regression models. This study included a total of 515 completed responses. The use of mHealth application was significantly associated with ease of booking telemedicine appointments (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.63-4.18; P < .001), perception of similarity of quality of care between telemedicine consultations and in-person visits (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.26-2.61; P = .001), and preference for using telemedicine applications over in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.12-2.72; P = .015).

In the brain, ACE is especially abundant in striatal tissue, but the function of ACE in striatal circuits remains poorly understood. We found that ACE degrades an unconventional enkephalin heptapeptide, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, in the nucleus accumbens of mice. ACE inhibition enhanced µ-opioid receptor activation by Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, causing a cell type–specific long-term depression of glutamate release onto medium spiny projection neurons expressing the Drd1 dopamine receptor. Systemic ACE inhibition was not intrinsically rewarding, but it led to a decrease in conditioned place preference caused by fentanyl administration and an enhancement of reciprocal social interaction. Our results raise the enticing prospect that central ACE inhibition can boost endogenous opioid signaling for clinical benefit while mitigating the risk of addiction."
https://openalex.org/W4213451843,"By assessing plant species composition and distribution in biodiversity hotspots influenced by environmental gradients, we greatly advance our understanding of the local plant community and how environmental factors are affecting these communities. This is a proxy for determining how climate change influences plant communities in mountainous regions (""space-for-time"" substitution). We evaluated plant species composition and distribution, and how and which environmental variables drive the plant communities in moist temperate zone of Manoor valley of Northwestern Himalaya, Pakistan. During four consecutive years (2015-2018), we sampled 30 sampling sites, measuring 21 environmental variables, and recording all plant species present in an altitudinal variable range of 1932-3168 m.a.s.l. We used different multivariate analyses to identify potential plant communities, and to evaluate the relative importance of each environmental variable in the species composition and distribution. Finally, we also evaluated diversity patterns, by comparing diversity indices and beta diversity processes. We found that (i) the moist temperate zone in this region can be divided in four different major plant communities; (ii) each plant community has a specific set of environmental drivers; (iii) there is a significant variation in plant species composition between communities, in which six species contributed most to the plant composition dissimilarity; (iv) there is a significant difference of the four diversity indices between communities; and (v) community structure is twice more influenced by the spatial turnover of species than by the species loss. Overall, we showed that altitudinal gradients offer an important range of different environmental variables, highlighting the existence of micro-climates that drive the structure and composition of plant species in each micro-region. Each plant community along the altitudinal gradient is influenced by a set of environmental variables, which lead to the presence of indicator species in each micro-region."

The proposed approach was able to efficiently and accurately detect PD as well as distinguish subjects with PD on medications from subjects who are off medication. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize the features based on which the approach provided the predictions. A significantly high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and Weighted Kappa Score up to 99.9% were achieved and the visualization of the regions in the Wavelet images that contributed to the deep-learning approach decisions was provided. The proposed framework can then serve as an effective computer-aided diagnostic tool that will support physicians and scientists in further understanding the nature of PD and providing an objective and confident opinion regarding the clinical diagnosis of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4213427712,"Introduction A continuum of maternal care approach can reduce gaps and missed opportunities experienced by women and newborns. We determined the level of coverage and factors associated with the continuum of maternal care in Uganda. Methods We used weighted data from the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) 2016. We included 10,152 women aged 15 to 49 years, who had had a live birth within five years preceding the survey. Stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used to select participants. Continuum of maternal care was considered when a woman had at least four antenatal care (ANC) visits, had delivered in a health facility and they had at least one postnatal check-up within six weeks. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with completion of the continuum of maternal care using SPSS version 25. Results The level of coverage of complete continuum of maternal care was 10.7% (1,091) (95% CI: 10.0–11.2). About 59.9% (6,080) (95% CI: 59.0–60.8) had four or more antenatal visits while 76.6% (7,780) (95% CI: 75.8–77.5) delivered in a health facility and 22.5% (2,280) (95% CI: 21.5–23.2) attended at least one postnatal care visit within six weeks. The following factors were associated with continuum of maternal care; initiating ANC in the first trimester (AOR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.23–1.79), having secondary level of education (AOR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.15–2.22) and tertiary level of education (AOR 2.08 95% CI: 1.38–3.13) compared to no formal education, being resident in Central Uganda (AOR 1.44, 95% CI:1.11–1.89), Northern Uganda (AOR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06–1.71) and Western Uganda (AOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45–0.82) compared to Eastern Uganda, and exposure to newspapers and magazines. Conclusion The level of coverage of the complete continuum of maternal care was low and varied across regions. It was associated with easily modifiable factors such as early initiation of ANC, exposure to mass media and level of education. Interventions to improve utilisation of the continuum of maternal care should leverage mass media to promote services, especially among the least educated and the residents of Western Uganda."

https://openalex.org/W4213433855,"Many preventive approaches in dentistry aim to improve oral health through behavioural instruction or intervention concerning oral health behaviour. However, it is still unknown which factors have the highest impact on oral health behaviours, such as toothbrushing or regular dental check-ups. Various external and internal individual factors such as education, experience with dentists or influence by parents could be relevant. Therefore, the present observational study investigated the influence of these factors on self-reported oral heath behaviour. One hundred and seventy participants completed standardized questionnaires about dental anxiety (Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS), and dental self-efficacy perceptions (dSEP)). They also answered newly composed questionnaires on oral hygiene behaviours and attitudes, current and childhood dental experiences as well as parental oral hygiene education and care. Four independent factors, namely attitude towards oral hygiene, attitude towards one’s teeth, sense of care and self-inspection of one’s teeth were extracted from these questionnaires by rotating factor analysis. The results of the questionnaires were correlated by means of linear regressions. Dental anxiety was related to current negative emotions when visiting a dentist and negative dental-related experiences during childhood. High DAS scores, infantile and current negative experiences showed significant negative correlations with the attitude towards oral hygiene and one’s teeth. Dental anxiety and current negative dental experiences reduced participants’ dental self-efficacy perceptions as well as the self-inspection of one’s teeth. While parental care positively influenced the attitude towards one’s teeth, dental self-efficacy perceptions significantly correlated with attitude towards oral hygiene, self-inspection of one’s teeth and parental care. Dental anxiety, dental experiences, parents’ care for their children’s oral hygiene and dental self-efficacy perceptions influence the attitude towards oral hygiene and one’s own oral cavity as well as the autonomous control of one’s own dental health. Therefore, oral hygiene instruction and the development of patient-centred preventive approaches should consider these factors."
https://openalex.org/W4226067350,"Genetically regulated gene expression has helped elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying complex traits. Improved high-throughput technology allows similar interrogation of the genetically regulated proteome for understanding complex trait mechanisms. Here, we used the Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Multi-omics pilot study, which comprises data from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), to optimize genetic predictors of the plasma proteome for genetically regulated proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in diverse populations. We built predictive models for protein abundances using data collected in TOPMed MESA, for which we have measured 1,305 proteins by a SOMAscan assay. We compared predictive models built via elastic net regression to models integrating posterior inclusion probabilities estimated by fine-mapping SNPs prior to elastic net. In order to investigate the transferability of predictive models across ancestries, we built protein prediction models in all four of the TOPMed MESA populations, African American (n = 183), Chinese (n = 71), European (n = 416), and Hispanic/Latino (n = 301), as well as in all populations combined. As expected, fine-mapping produced more significant protein prediction models, especially in African ancestries populations, potentially increasing opportunity for discovery. When we tested our TOPMed MESA models in the independent European INTERVAL study, fine-mapping improved cross-ancestries prediction for some proteins. Using GWAS summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, which comprises ∼50,000 Hispanic/Latinos, African Americans, Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Native Americans, we applied S-PrediXcan to perform PWAS for 28 complex traits. The most protein-trait associations were discovered, colocalized, and replicated in large independent GWAS using proteome prediction model training populations with similar ancestries to PAGE. At current training population sample sizes, performance between baseline and fine-mapped protein prediction models in PWAS was similar, highlighting the utility of elastic net. Our predictive models in diverse populations are publicly available for use in proteome mapping methods at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4837327."
https://openalex.org/W4213428705,"Background Cervical cancer (CC) is the 4 th most prevalent cancer among females globally. In Ethiopia, around 7,095 new CC cases are diagnosed every year and it is the second common cause of cancer deaths in women. There is limited evidence on survival status as well as about predictors of time to death among CC patients in Ethiopia. Thus, this study investigated the five-year survival status and predictors of time to death among CC patients who had been admitted at Tikur Anbesa specialized Hospital (TASH) from 2014–2019. Methods Facility-based, retrospective-cohort study was conducted at Tikur Anbesa specialized Hospital among 348 patients from June 2014 to June 2019. A systematic random sampling method was employed to select the study participants. Data were extracted from the patient card, and through phone calls. The data was collected using the android version CS-Entry tool. Data was analyzed by SPSS version 23. Kaplan and Meier’s method was used to estimate survival functions and Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis was carried out in order to identify the independent predictors of time to death. Results The overall incidence of death was 31 per 100 person-years of follow up. The median (IQR) follow-up time of the entire cohorts was 18.55 (8.96–49.65) months. The independent predictors for time to death included; age older than 50 years [AHR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.9], late stage of CC at diagnosis [AHR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.7–2.9], No CC treatment [AHR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.5–3.1] and HIV positive [AHR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4–3.8]. Conclusion and recommendation The death rate of CC patients was high. The significant predictors associated with shorten time to death of CC patients were older age, advanced cancer stage at diagnosis, HIV infection and not receiving cancer treatment. Therefore, improving early detection and initiation of treatment for all CC patients is necessary in order to improve patient’s survival status. The government needs to strengthen the routine CC screening programs to address high-risk women such as elderly and HIV positive women in Ethiopia."

A subgroup of the RWD cohort with the same inclusion criteria as the PROGNOSIS trial (RWD prediction only, n = 99) was also included. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was measured using fully automated Elecsys® sFlt-1 and PlGF immunoassays (cobas e analyser; Roche Diagnostics). A similar proportion of women in the RWD and PROGNOSIS cohorts experienced preeclampsia (14.95% vs. 13.79%; p = 0.7938); a smaller proportion of women in the RWD prediction only cohort experienced preeclampsia versus PROGNOSIS (6.06%; p = 0.0526). In women with preeclampsia, median gestational age at delivery (weeks) was comparable in the RWD and PROGNOSIS cohorts (34.0 vs. 34.3, p = 0.5895), but significantly reduced in the RWD prediction only cohort versus PROGNOSIS (27.1, p = 0.0038). sFlt-1/PlGF ratio at baseline visit was not statistically significantly different for the RWD and PROGNOSIS cohorts, irrespective of preeclampsia outcome. Hospitalisations for confirmed preeclampsia were significantly shorter in the RWD cohort versus PROGNOSIS (median 1 vs. 4 days, p = 0.0093); there was no significant difference between RWD prediction only and PROGNOSIS (3 days, p = 0.9638). All-cause hospitalisations were significantly shorter in the RWD (median 1 day; p<0.0001) and RWD prediction only (1 day; p<0.0001) cohorts versus PROGNOSIS (3 days).This study supports the findings of previous studies, showing that routine clinical use of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio may result in shorter duration of hospitalisations, with potential economic benefits."

Treatment options for GBM include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy; however, the clinical outcomes are poor, with a high rate of recurrence. An increasing number of studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) serve important roles in several types of cancer. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was utilized to identify the differentially expressed circRNAs and their biological functions. Then, we detected the circular RNA bifunctional apoptosis regulator (circBFAR) was significantly increased in three GEO datasets. However, the role of circBFAR has not been reported in GBM. In this study, the expression of circBFAR was significantly increased both in GBM tissues or cell lines and was negatively correlated with overall survival in patients with GBM. Knockdown of circBFAR inhibited proliferation and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Increased expression of circBFAR resulted in a reduction of miR-548b expression in glioma cells. A luciferase reporter and RIP assay indicated that miR-548b was a direct target of circBFAR, and miR-548b may negatively regulate the expression of FoxM1. Rescue experiments showed that overexpression of FoxM1 could counter the effect of circBFAR silencing on the proliferation and invasion of glioma cell lines. Moreover, we identified that circBFAR regulates FoxM1 by interacting with miR-548b in glioma cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that a circBFAR/miR-548b/FoxM1 axis regulates the development of GBM and highlights potentially novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W4213433616,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental condition that begins in infancy or earlier and lasts through the individual's lifetime. The aetiology and mechanisms of ASD are not yet fully understood, and current treatment comprises mainly education and rehabilitation, without significant improvement in the core symptoms. Recent studies suggest that microbiota change in children with ASD after the ingestion of probiotics may improve the balance of microbiota and thus ASD symptoms.The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the symptoms of children with ASD and the possible mechanisms involved.This is a prospective controlled trial. A total of 160 children with ASD will be stratified and allocated to placebo and probiotics groups randomised according to the severity of their ASD symptoms. The probiotics group will be given probiotics supplements orally twice a day for 3 months and the control group will be given a placebo at the same amount, in addition to the baseline therapy of education and rehabilitation. All the children will be evaluated systematically by using different scales, questionnaires before, during, and after 3 months' treatment, as well as 3 months after discontinuation. The potential impact of probiotics on immunity and inflammation, metabolism, and metagenome will also be investigated.Our previous study showed that the abundance of intestinal flora was greatly different in children with ASD, and that Bifidobacterium was associated with the severity of ASD. In the present study, we will investigate the impact of probiotics supplementation on the symptoms of Children with ASD, with the purpose of evaluating the possible therapeutic effects of additives on ASD and of providing a reference for clinical treatment. The results will help to disclose as yet unknown relationship between probiotics and ASD.This study has been registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-2000037941)."
https://openalex.org/W4213412989,"Hospice care is a multidisciplinary approach that focused on patients' quality of life, and nurses allocate more of their time with patients and patients' families than those nurses working in other disciplines. Nurses' knowledge of and attitudes toward hospice care can affect the quality of hospice care. At present, China's hospice care institutions are suffering from an obvious shortage of nursing staff. Since clinical nurses are the main force behind the future provision of hospice care, their knowledge of, attitudes and willingness to practice can greatly promoted the growth of hospice care, however, available data on clinical nurses' willingness to practice hospice care are limited.A cross-sectional descriptive study design was employed to collect data from 1833 nurses working in tertiary or secondary general hospitals in Guangxi, China. We examined nurses' demographic characteristics and scores on the Chinese version of the hospice care knowledge scale, the Chinese version of the Bradley Attitude Assessment Questionnaire, and a brief quiz concerning their willingness to practice hospice care in the future. Descriptive, single factor, multiple regression analyses and logistic regression analyses were used for data analysis.Nurses displayed moderate mean scores for both knowledge of and attitudes, and only 505 (27.5%) nurses expressed their willingness to practice hospice care, 1329 (72.5%) of nurses sampled expressed their unwillingness or uncertainty. Multivariate regression analyses showed that education, professional qualification, monthly income, whether they had been trained in hospice care, and willingness to practice hospice care were the main influencing factors of knowledge; education, whether they lived with someone aged >60 years, and whether they had been trained in hospice care were main factors influencing attitudes. Additionally, logistic regression analyses showed that hospice care knowledge, whether they had been trained in hospice care, and whether they had clinical experience affected the nurses' willingness to practice hospice care.This study highlighted a knowledge gap and moderate attitudes toward hospice care among nurses, and most nurses did not prefer to practice hospice care. Having been trained in hospice care was the main common factor of nurses' knowledge of, attitudes toward, and willingness to practice hospice care in the future, indicating the necessity to provide nurses with more targeted hospice care training."
https://openalex.org/W4213444127,"Survival analysis following oncological treatments require specific analysis techniques to account for data considerations, such as failure to observe the time of event, patient withdrawal, loss to follow-up, and differential follow up. These techniques can include Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses. However, studies do not always report overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), or cancer recurrence using hazard ratios, making the synthesis of such oncologic outcomes difficult. We propose a hierarchical utilization of methods to extract or estimate the hazard ratio to standardize time-to-event outcomes so that study inclusion into meta-analyses can be maximized. We also provide proof-of concept results from a statistical analysis that compares OS, DFS, and cancer recurrence for robotic surgery to open and non-robotic minimally invasive surgery. In our example, use of the proposed methodology would allow for the increase in data inclusion from 108 hazard ratios reported to 240 hazard ratios reported or estimated, resulting in an increase of 122%. While there are publications summarizing the motivation for these analyses, and comprehensive papers describing strategies to obtain estimates from published time-dependent analyses, we are not aware of a manuscript that describes a prospective framework for an analysis of this scale focusing on the inclusion of a maximum number of publications reporting on long-term oncologic outcomes incorporating various presentations of statistical data."
https://openalex.org/W4213445053,"Aberrant DNA methylation acts epigenetically to skew the gene transcription rate up or down, contributing to cancer etiology. A gap in our understanding concerns the epigenomics of stagewise cancer progression. In this study, we have developed a comprehensive computational framework for the stage-differentiated modelling of DNA methylation landscapes in colorectal cancer (CRC).The methylation β-matrix was derived from the public-domain TCGA data, converted into M-value matrix, annotated with AJCC stages, and analysed for stage-salient genes using an ensemble of approaches involving stage-differentiated modelling of methylation patterns and/or expression patterns. Differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified using a contrast against controls (adjusted p-value <0.001 and |log fold-change of M-value| >2), and then filtered using a series of all possible pairwise stage contrasts (p-value <0.05) to obtain stage-salient DMGs. These were then subjected to a consensus analysis, followed by matching with clinical data and performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to evaluate the impact of methylation patterns of consensus stage-salient biomarkers on disease prognosis.We found significant genome-wide changes in methylation patterns in cancer cases relative to controls agnostic of stage. The stage-differentiated models yielded the following consensus salient genes: one stage-I gene (FBN1), one stage-II gene (FOXG1), one stage-III gene (HCN1) and four stage-IV genes (NELL1, ZNF135, FAM123A, LAMA1). All the biomarkers were significantly hypermethylated in the promoter regions, indicating down-regulation of expression and implying a putative CpG island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) manifestation. A prognostic signature consisting of FBN1 and FOXG1 survived all the analytical filters, and represents a novel early-stage epigenetic biomarker / target.We have designed and executed a workflow for stage-differentiated epigenomic analysis of colorectal cancer progression, and identified several stage-salient diagnostic biomarkers, and an early-stage prognostic biomarker panel. The study has led to the discovery of an alternative CIMP-like signature in colorectal cancer, reinforcing the role of CIMP drivers in tumor pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W4213332309,"Tannins are secondary metabolites that are enriched in the bark, roots, and knots in trees and are known to hinder microbial attack. The biological degradation of water-soluble gallotannins, such as tannic acid, is initiated by tannase enzymes (EC 3.1.1.20), which are esterases able to liberate gallic acid from aromatic-sugar complexes. However, only few tannases have previously been studied in detail. Here, for the first time, we biochemically and structurally characterize three tannases from a single organism, the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium butyricum, which inhabits both soil and gut environments. The enzymes were named CbTan1-3, and we show that each one exhibits a unique substrate preference on a range of galloyl ester model substrates; CbTan1 and 3 demonstrated preference toward galloyl esters linked to glucose, while CbTan2 was more promiscuous. All enzymes were also active on oak bark extractives. Furthermore, we solved the crystal structure of CbTan2 and produced homology models for CbTan1 and 3. In each structure, the catalytic triad and gallate-binding regions in the core domain were found in very similar positions in the active site compared with other bacterial tannases, suggesting a similar mechanism of action among these enzymes, though large inserts in each enzyme showcase overall structural diversity. In conclusion, the varied structural features and substrate specificities of the C. butyricum tannases indicate that they have different biological roles and could further be used in development of new valorization strategies for renewable plant biomass."
https://openalex.org/W4213415931,"Interactions between interleukin (IL)-8 and its receptors, CXCR1, and CXCR2, serve crucial roles in inflammatory conditions and various types of cancers. Inhibition of this signaling pathway has been exploited as a promising strategy in treating these diseases. However, most studies only focused on the design of allosteric antagonists-bound receptors on the intracellular side of IL-8 receptors. Recently, the first cryo-EM structures of IL-8-CXCR2-Gi complexes have been solved, revealing the unique binding and activation modes of the endogenous chemokine IL-8. Hence, we set to identify small molecule inhibitors for IL-8 using critical protein-protein interaction between IL-8 and CXCR2 at the orthosteric binding site. The pharmacophore models and molecular docking screened compounds from DrugBank and NCI databases. The oral bioavailability of the top 23 ligands from the screening was then predicted by the SwissAMDE tool. Molecular dynamics simulation and free binding energy calculation were performed for the best compounds. The result indicated that DB14770, DB12121, and DB03916 could form strong interactions and stable protein-ligand complexes with IL-8. These three candidates are potential IL-8 inhibitors that can be further evaluated by in vitro experiments in the next stage."

While issues of sexual violence have been documented in the South Asian American community, little is known on its impact among LGB+ individuals. This study explores the experience of sexual violence, related attitudes, and mental health outcomes among LGB+ South Asian Americans. A community-informed online survey of 18–34-year-old South Asian Americans living near the New York State region, recruited from online social media platforms, was conducted. Study design, implementation, and evaluation occurred in partnership with an advisory board of South Asian young adult representatives; data was analyzed both descriptively and through multivariable logistic regression models. Of the 385 participants who reported their sexuality, LGB+ participants comprised 24.1% (n = 93) of the sample. LGB+ participants were more likely to have experienced rape multiple times (17.2% vs. 9.6%) in bivariate analyses, and higher odds of depression (AOR:3.47, 95%CI:1.61–8.17) in adjusted analyses. Overall, LGB+ South Asian Americans displayed a disproportionate burden of sexual violence and depression. Findings identify policy and research pathways to address sexual violence among LGB+ South Asians."

Even though the elder portion of the population is the most severely affected by the COVID-19 disease, the counter-measures introduced so far by governments took into little account the age structure, with restrictions that act uniformly on the population irrespectively of age. In this paper, we introduce a SIRD model with age classes for studying the impact on the epidemic evolution of lockdown policies applied heterogeneously on the different age groups of the population. The proposed model is then applied to age-stratified COVID-19 Italian data. The simulation results suggest that control measures focused to specific age groups may bring benefits in terms of reduction of the overall mortality rate."

This study aims to examine the potato production competitiveness through competitive and comparative analyses as well as evaluating the impacts of government policy on potato production. This study employs Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) to analyse the cross-section data collected from six regencies in Indonesia. Potato production in Indonesia was profitable privately and socially. The highest value of competitive advantage was indicated by PCR value in the dry season in Wonosobo Regency, Central Java Province. The lowest values were found in Bandung Regency. Highest comparative advantage was revealed in Tanah Karo Regency, North Sumatra Province, during the rainy season. Highest comparative advantage was found in Bandung Regency, West Java Province, in the dry season. However, the social profit was lower than the private profit indicating the potato farmers dealt with disincentives due to imperfect market. It implies that increasing domestic potato production will be more profitable rather than import. The policy makers need to evaluate the recent policies on input and output markets as well as the supply chain of potato to cope with imperfect markets in order to increase farmers’ income."

Whether lasting differences exist between infection and vaccination boosted immunity is yet to be known. The aim of this study was to determine how long total anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies due to past infection persist in peripheral blood and whether sex, age or haematological features can influence their lasting.A series of 2421 donations either of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma or whole blood from 1107 repeat donors from January 2020 to March 2021 was analysed. An automated chemiluminescence immunoassay for total antibodies recognizing the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma was performed. Sex, age, blood group, blood cell counts and percentages and immunoglobulin concentrations were extracted from electronic recordings. Blood donation is allowed after a minimum of one-month post symptom's relapse. Donors were 69.7% males and their average age was 46. The 250 donors who had later donations after a positive one underwent further analysis. Both qualitative (positivity) and quantitative (rise or decline of optical density regarding consecutive donations) outcomes were evaluated.In 97.6% of donors with follow-up, anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein N total antibodies remained positive at the end of a follow-up period of 12.4 weeks median time (1-46, SD = 9.65) after the first positive determination. The blood group was not related to antibody waning. Lower lymphocyte counts and higher neutrophils would help predict future waning or decay of antibodies. Most recovered donors maintain their total anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibodies for at least 16 weeks (at least one month must have been awaited from infection resolution to blood donation). The 10 individuals that could be followed up longer than 40 weeks (approximately 44 weeks after symptom's relapse) were all still positive."
https://openalex.org/W4213418589,"Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) is a common prenatally diagnosed cerebellar malformation, characterized by cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, upward rotation of the hypoplastic vermis, and posterior fossa enlargement with torcular elevation. DWM is associated with a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities such as cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments, which cannot be explained solely by cerebellar malformations. Notably, the pathogenesis of these symptoms remains poorly understood. This study investigated whether fetal structural developmental abnormalities in DWM extended beyond the posterior fossa to the cerebrum even in fetuses without apparent cerebral anomalies. Post-acquisition volumetric fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis was performed in 12 fetuses with DWM and 14 control fetuses. Growth trajectories of the volumes of the cortical plate, subcortical parenchyma, cerebellar hemispheres, and vermis between 18 and 33 weeks of gestation were compared. The median (interquartile range) gestational ages at the time of MRI were 22.4 (19.4-24.0) and 23.9 (20.6-29.2) weeks in the DWM and control groups, respectively (p = 0.269). Eight of the 12 fetuses with DWM presented with associated cerebral anomalies, including hydrocephalus (n = 3), cerebral ventriculomegaly (n = 3), and complete (n = 2) and partial (n = 2) agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC); 7 presented with extracerebral abnormalities. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected by microarray analysis in 4 of 11 fetuses with DWM, using amniocentesis. Volumetric analysis revealed that the cortical plate was significantly larger in fetuses with DWM than in controls (p = 0.040). Even without ACC, the subcortical parenchyma, whole cerebrum, cerebellar hemispheres, and whole brain were significantly larger in fetuses with DWM (n = 8) than in controls (p = 0.004, 0.025, 0.033, and 0.026, respectively). In conclusion, volumetric fetal MRI analysis demonstrated that the development of DWM extends throughout the brain during the fetal period, even without apparent cerebral anomalies."

The objective of our study is to examine the association of vitamin D supplementation on leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in healthy postmenopausal women with vitamin D deficiency. The study was designed as a placebo-controlled study to investigate the short-term effects of vitamin D supplementation and seasonal changes on vitamin D related parameters, including 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D parathormone (PTH), Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and telomere length in a cohort of postmenopausal women (n = 102). The group was divided as supplementation (n = 52) and placebo groups (n = 50). All parameters were measured before and after treatment. Serum VDBP levels were measured by ELISA method and VDR , GC (VDBP) gene expressions and relative telomere lengths were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using a quantitative real-time PCR method. The results demonstrate that baseline levels were similar between the groups. After vitamin D supplementation 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, PTH and VDBP levels were changed significantly compared to the placebo group. At the end of the study period, LTL levels were significantly increased in both groups and this change was more prominent in placebo group. The change in GC expression was significant between treatment and placebo groups but VDR expression remained unchanged. Even though the study was designed to solely assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation, LTL was significantly increased in the whole study group in summer months suggesting that LTL levels are affected by sun exposure and seasonal changes rather than supplementation. The study displayed the short-term effect of Vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D, PTH levels, LTL and vitamin D associated gene expressions. The relation between Vitamin D and LTL is not linear and could be confounded by several factors such as the population differences, regional and seasonal changes in sun exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4213445632,"The present study concerns the phenomenon of the co-dependence of value orientations and consumer behaviours. Although the idea of the overall connections between both areas is not new, the article contributes to the knowledge about relations between very specific consumer behaviours and social value orientations among people married or in an informal partnership. Using the obtained data, we examine to what extent the prosocial, reciprocal, and egoistic value orientations coexist with compensative, compulsive, and demonstrative buying. The analysis confirms the hypotheses that representatives of the reciprocal and egoistic orientations show susceptibility to compensative and compulsive buying to a greater extent than persons preferring other value orientations. In addition, the data show co-dependence of the reciprocal value orientation and demonstrative buying, while the prosocial value orientation seems to protect against compulsive buying. According to the regression analysis, this effect disappears if prosocially oriented persons suffer from low self-esteem at the same time being characterised by strong materialism. All hypothesised relations between value orientations and consumer behaviours have been analysed in multidimensional models considering materialism, self-esteem, age, and gender as the main factors of compensative and compulsive buying. The findings come from the 2017 survey based on a statistically representative sample of 1,121 adult Poles who were then married or in an informal partnership. The German Compulsive Buying Indicator and Lange’s Scale of Demonstrative Buying were introduced to measure consumer behaviours."

However, comparative genome analyses are still needed to clarify variation among cultivars and phylogenetic relationships within the family Brassicaceae. Herein, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of broccoli was generated by Illumina sequencing platform to provide basic information for genetic studies and to establish phylogenetic relationships within Brassicaceae. The whole genome was 153,364 bp, including two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,197 bp each, separated by a small single copy (SSC) region of 17,834 bp and a large single copy (LSC) region of 83,136 bp. The total GC content of the entire chloroplast genome accounts for 36%, while the GC content in each region of SSC,LSC, and IR accounts for 29.1%, 34.15% and 42.35%, respectively. The genome harbored 133 genes, including 88 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNAs, and 8 rRNAs, with 17 duplicates in IRs. The most abundant amino acid was leucine and the least abundant was cysteine. Codon usage analyses revealed a bias for A/T-ending codons. A total of 35 repeat sequences and 92 simple sequence repeats were detected, and the SC-IR boundary regions were variable between the seven cp genomes. A phylogenetic analysis suggested that broccoli is closely related to Brassica oleracea var. italica MH388764.1, Brassica oleracea var. italica MH388765.1, and Brassica oleracea NC_0441167.1.

The optimization process aimed at minimizing the size of the prepared ALS-MP nanoconjugates. ALS-MP nanoconjugates' particle size, encapsulation efficiency and the release profile were determined. Cytotoxicity, cell cycle, annexin V staining and caspase 3 analyses on A549 cells were carried out for the optimized formula.The results revealed that the optimized formula was of 134.91±5.1 nm particle size. The novel ALS-MP demonstrated the lowest IC50 (1.3 ± 0.34 μM) in comparison to ALS-Raw (37.6 ± 1.79 μM). Thus, the results indicated that when optimized ALS-MP nanoconjugate was used, the IC50 of ALS was also reduced by half. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of cells in the G2-M phase following the treatment with optimized ALS-MP nanoconjugates.The optimized ALS-MP formula had significantly improved the parameters related to the cytotoxic activity towards A549 cells, compared to control, MP and ALS-Raw."

Therefore, there is a need to develop an efficient survey method that has less impact on the environment. With the advent of technology and the availability of popular filming devices such as smartphones and cameras, intertidal seaweed wet biomass can be surveyed by remote sensing using popular RGB imaging sensors. In this paper, 143 in situ sites of seaweed in the intertidal zone of GouQi Island, ShengSi County, Zhejiang Province, were sampled and biomass inversions were performed. The hyperspectral data of seaweed at different growth stages were analyzed, and it was found that the variation range was small (visible light range < 0.1). Through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Most of the variance is explained in the first principal component, and the load allocated to the three kinds of seaweed is more than 90%. Through Pearson correlation analysis, 24 parameters of spectral features, 9 parameters of texture features (27 in total for the three RGB bands) and parameters of combined spectral and texture features of the images were selected for screening, and regression prediction was performed using two methods: Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT), combined with Pearson correlation coefficients. Compared with the other two models, GBDT has better fitting accuracy in the inversion of seaweed biomass, and the highest R2 was obtained when the top 17, 17 and 11 parameters with strong correlation were selected for the regression prediction by Pearson's correlation coefficient for Ulva australis, Sargassum thunbergii, and Sargassum fusiforme, and the R2 for Ulva australis was 0.784, RMSE 156.129, MAE 50.691 and MAPE 28.201, the R2 for Sargassum thunbergii was 0.854, RMSE 790.487, MAE 327.108 and MAPE 19.039, and the R2 for Sargassum fusiforme was 0.808, RMSE 445.067 and MAPE 28.822. MAE was 180.172 and MAPE was 28.822.

We studied two wild type MTB (cocci and rod-shaped M. bavaricum) in sedimentary environment under exposure to geomagnetic field in the laboratory, zero field and an alternating field whose polarity was switched every 24 hours. The mean concentration of M. bavaricum dropped by ~50% during 6 months in zero field, with no clear temporal trend suggesting an extinction. Cell numbers recovered to initial values within ~1.5 months after the Earth's field was reset. Cocci displayed a larger temporal variability with no evident population changes in zero field. The alternating field experiment produced a moderate decrease of M. bavaricum concentrations and nearby extinction of cocci, confirming the active role of magnetotaxis in sediment and might point to a different magnetotactic mechanism for M. bavaricum which possibly benefited them to survive field reversals in geological periods. Our findings provide a first quantification of magnetotaxis advantage in sedimentary environment."

Identifying pre/perioperative factors that predict postoperative ECD could help improve DMEK outcomes. This retrospective study was conducted with consecutive adult patients with Fuchs-endothelial corneal dystrophy who underwent DMEK in 2015-2019 and were followed for 12 months. Patients underwent concomitant cataract surgery (triple-DMEK) or had previously undergone cataract surgery (pseudophakic-DMEK). Multivariate analyses assessed whether: patient age/sex; graft-donor age; preoperative ECD, mean keratometry, or visual acuity; triple DMEK; surgery duration; surgical difficulties; and need for rebubbling predicted 6- or 12-month ECD in the whole cohort or in subgroups with high/low ECD at 6 or 12 months. The subgroups were generated with the clinically relevant threshold of 1000 cells/mm2. Surgeries were defined as difficult if any part was not standard. In total, 103 eyes (95 patients; average age, 71 years; 62% women) were included. Eighteen eyes involved difficult surgery (14 difficult graft preparation or unfolding cases and four others). Regardless of how the study group was defined, the only pre/perioperative variable that associated significantly with 6- and 12-month ECD was difficult surgery (p = 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.0009). Difficult surgery also associated with longer surgery duration (p = 0.002). Difficult-surgery subgroup analysis showed that difficult graft dissection associated with lower postoperative ECD (p = 0.03). This association may reflect endothelial cell loss due to excessive graft handling and/or an intrinsic unhealthiness of the endothelial cells in the graft that conferred unwanted physical properties onto the graft that complicated its preparation/unfolding."
https://openalex.org/W4213413812,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven its clinical efficacy in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its exact mechanisms and cortical effects continue to be unclear. Subthalamic (STN) DBS acutely modifies auditory evoked responses, but its long-term effect on auditory cortical processing remains ambiguous. We studied with magnetoencephalography the effect of long-term STN DBS on auditory processing in patients with advanced PD. DBS resulted in significantly increased contra-ipsilateral auditory response latency difference at ~100 ms after stimulus onset compared with preoperative state. The effect is likely due to normalization of neuronal asynchrony in the auditory pathways. The present results indicate that STN DBS in advanced PD patients has long-lasting effects on cortical areas outside those confined to motor processing. Whole-head magnetoencephalography provides a feasible tool to study motor and non-motor neural networks in PD, and to track possible changes related to cortical reorganization or plasticity induced by DBS."

https://openalex.org/W4213427792,"The analysis of contingency tables is a powerful statistical tool used in experiments with categorical variables. This study improves parts of the theory underlying the use of contingency tables. Specifically, the linkage disequilibrium parameter as a measure of two-way interactions applied to three-way tables makes it possible to quantify Simpson’s paradox by a simple formula. With tests on three-way interactions, there is only one that determines whether the partial interactions of all variables agree or whether there is at least one variable whose partial interactions disagree. To date, there has been no test available that determines whether the partial interactions of a certain variable agree or disagree, and the presented work closes this gap. This work reveals the relation of the multiplicative and the additive measure of a three-way interaction. Another contribution addresses the question of which cells in a contingency table are fixed when the first- and second-order marginal totals are given. The proposed procedure not only detects fixed zero counts but also fixed positive counts. This impacts the determination of the degrees of freedom. Furthermore, limitations of methods that simulate contingency tables with given pairwise associations are addressed."

We investigated patient and hospital characteristics of major ambulatory surgery encounters for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) vs non-IBD patients.We conducted a cross-sectional study using 2017 Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample. Major ambulatory surgery encounters among patients aged ≥18 years with CD (n = 20,635) or UC (n = 9,894) were compared to 9.4 million encounters among non-IBD patients. Weighted percentages of patient characteristics (age, sex, median household income, primary payers, patient location, selected comorbidities, discharge destination, type of surgeries) and hospital-related characteristics (hospital size, ownership, location and teaching status, region) were compared by IBD status (CD, UC, and no IBD). Linear regression was used to estimate mean total charges, controlling for these characteristics.Compared with non-IBD patients, IBD patients were more likely to have private insurance, reside in urban areas and higher income zip codes, and undergo surgeries in hospitals that were private not-for-profit, urban teaching, and in the Northeast. Gastrointestinal surgeries were more common among IBD patients. Some comorbidities associated with increased risk of surgical complications were more prevalent among IBD patients. Total charges were 9% lower for CD patients aged <65 years (Median: $16,462 vs $18,106) and 6% higher for UC patients aged ≥65 years (Median: $16,909 vs $15,218) compared to their non-IBD patient counterparts.Differences in characteristics of major ambulatory surgery encounters by IBD status may identify opportunities for efficient resource allocation and positive surgical outcomes among IBD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4214497331,"The deep neural network is used to establish a neural network model to solve the problems of low accuracy and poor accuracy of traditional algorithms in screening differentially expressed genes and function prediction during the walnut endocarp hardening stage. The paper walnut is used as the research object to analyze the biological information of paper walnut. The changes of lignin deposition during endocarp hardening from 50 days to 90 days are observed by microscope. Then, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long and Short-term Memory (LSTM) network model are adopted to construct an expression gene screening and function prediction model. Then, the transcriptome and proteome sequencing and biological information of walnut endocarp samples at 50, 57, 78, and 90 days after flowering are analyzed and taken as the training data set of the CNN + LSTM model. The experimental results demonstrate that the endocarp of paper walnut began to harden at 57 days, and the endocarp tissue on the hardened inner side also began to stain. This indicates that the endocarp hardened laterally from outside to inside. The screening and prediction results show that the CNN + LSTM model’s highest accuracy can reach 0.9264. The Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score of the CNN + LSTM model are better than the traditional machine learning algorithm. Moreover, the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) area enclosed by the CNN + LSTM model and coordinate axis is the largest, and the Area Under Curve (AUC) value is 0.9796. The comparison of ROC and AUC proves that the CNN + LSTM model is better than the traditional algorithm for screening differentially expressed genes and function prediction in the walnut endocarp hardening stage. Using deep learning to predict expressed genes’ function accurately can reduce the breeding cost and significantly improve the yield and quality of crops. This research provides scientific guidance for the scientific breeding of paper walnut."
https://openalex.org/W4213422470,"Although the role of an internal model of gravity for the predictive control of the upper limbs is quite well established, evidence is lacking regarding an internal model of friction. In this study, 33 male and female human participants performed a striking movement (with the index finger) to slide a plastic cube-like object to a given target distance. The surface material (aluminum or balsa wood) on which the object slides, the surface slope (-10°, 0, or +10°) and the target distance (25 cm or 50 cm) varied across conditions, with ten successive trials in each condition. Analysis of the object speed at impact and spatial error suggests that: 1) the participants chose to impart a similar speed to the object in the first trial regardless of the surface material to facilitate the estimation of the coefficient of friction; 2) the movement is parameterized across repetitions to reduce spatial error; 3) an internal model of friction can be generalized when the slope changes. Biomechanical analysis showed interindividual variability in the recruitment of the upper limb segments and in the adjustment of finger speed at impact in order to transmit the kinetic energy required to slide the object to the target distance. In short, we provide evidence that the brain builds an internal model of friction that makes it possible to parametrically control a striking movement in order to regulate the amount of kinetic energy required to impart the appropriate initial speed to the object."
https://openalex.org/W4213432536,"Clinical trials represent a critical milestone of translational and clinical sciences. However, poor recruitment to clinical trials has been a long standing problem affecting institutions all over the world. One way to reduce the cost incurred by insufficient enrollment is to minimize initiating trials that are most likely to fall short of their enrollment goal. Hence, the ability to predict which proposed trials will meet enrollment goals prior to the start of the trial is highly beneficial. In the current study, we leveraged a data set extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov that consists of 46,724 U.S. based clinical trials from 1990 to 2020. We constructed 4,636 candidate predictors based on data collected by ClinicalTrials.gov and external sources for enrollment rate prediction using various state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Taking advantage of a nested time series cross-validation design, our models resulted in good predictive performance that is generalizable to future data and stable over time. Moreover, information content analysis revealed the study design related features to be the most informative feature type regarding enrollment. Compared to the performance of models built with all features, the performance of models built with study design related features is only marginally worse ( AUC = 0.78 ± 0.03 vs. AUC = 0.76 ± 0.02). The results presented can form the basis for data-driven decision support systems to assess whether proposed clinical trials would likely meet their enrollment goal."
https://openalex.org/W4213433765,"The concerted action of DNA replication and cell division has been extensively investigated in eukaryotes. Well demarcated checkpoints have been identified in the cell cycle, which provides the correct DNA stoichiometry and appropriate growth in the progeny. In bacteria, which grow faster and less concerted than eukaryotes, the linkages between cell elongation and DNA synthesis are unclear. dTTP, one of the canonical nucleotide-building blocks of DNA, is also used for cell wall biosynthesis in mycobacteria. We hypothesize that the interconnection between DNA and cell wall biosynthesis through dTTP may require synchronization of these processes by regulating dTTP availability. We investigated growth, morphology, cellular dNTP pool, and possible signs of stress in Mycobacterium smegmatis upon perturbation of rhamnose biosynthesis by the overexpression of RmlA. RmlA is a cell wall synthetic enzyme that uses dTTP as the precursor for cross-linking the peptidoglycan with the arabinogalactan layers by a phosphodiester bond in the mycobacterial cell wall. We found that RmlA overexpression results in changes in cell morphology, causing cell elongation and disruption of the cylindrical cell shape. We also found that the cellular dTTP pool is reduced by half in RmlA overexpressing cells and that this reduced dTTP availability does not restrict cell growth. We observed 2-6-fold increases in the gene expression of replication and cell wall biosynthesis stress factors upon RmlA overexpression. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that RmlA, acting to crosslink the nascent layers of the cell wall, localizes throughout the whole cell length in a helical pattern in addition to the cellular pole."
https://openalex.org/W4226162410,"Spatial arrangement of chromosomes is responsible for gene expression in Plasmodium parasites. However, methods for rearranging chromosomes have not been established, which makes it difficult to investigate its role in detail. Here, we report a method for splitting chromosome in rodent malaria parasite by CRISPR/Cas9 system using fragments in which a telomere and a centromere were incorporated. The resultant split chromosomes segregated accurately into daughter parasites by the centromere. In addition, elongation of de novo telomeres were observed, indicating its proper function. Furthermore, chromosome splitting had no effect on development of parasites. Splitting of the chromosome is expected to alter its spatial arrangement, and our method will thus be useful for investigating its biological role related with gene expression."
