https://openalex.org/W2041931011,"Polar solvents often exert a dramatic influence on reactions in solution. Equilibrium aspects of this influence involve differential solvation of reactants compared to the transition state that lead to alteration of the free-energy barrier to reaction. Such effects are well known, and often give rise changes in reaction rates of many orders of magnitude. Less well understood are effects arising from non-equilibrium, dynamical aspects of solvation. During the course of reaction, charge is rapidly redistributed among reactants. How the reaction couples to its solvent environment depends critically on how fast the solvent can respond to these changes in reactant charge distribution. In this article the dynamics of solvation in polar liquids and the influence of this dynamics on electron-transfer reactions are discussed. A molecular picture suggests that polar solvation occurs on multiple time scales as a result of the involvement of different types of solvent motion. A hierarchy of models from a homogeneous continuum model to one incorporating molecular aspects of solvation, combined with computer simulations, gives insight into the underlying dynamics. Experimental measures of solvation dynamics from picosecond and subpicosecond time-dependent Stokes shift studies are compared with the predictions of theoretical models. The implication of these results for electron-transfer reactions in solution are then briefly considered."

The composition of stable isotopes of plant carbon (delta(13)C) was earlier shown to be an excellent indicator of WUE in tomato and other species. It is now reported that delta(13)C can be satisfactorily predicted from three restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), which are genetic markers for discrete DNA sequences within the genome. An additive type of gene action was observed for all three RFLP markers, and for one of them there also was a significant nonadditive component. Combining the delta(13)C and RFLP technologies may aid in identifying genes associated with WUE and in studying mechanisms contributing to WUE. These technologies will also be useful for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2084237411,"The structure of the room-temperature charge density wave (CDW) phase in octahedrally coordinated tantalum disulfide, 1T-TaS2, has been a controversial issue for over 15 years. Large-scale scanning tunneling microscope images of the intralayer structure of this phase exhibit a domain-like pattern defined by a variation in the maximum CDW amplitude. The circular domains, consisting of high-amplitude CDWs, are arranged in a regular hexagonal lattice (period 73+/-3 angstroms) that is rotated relative to the CDWs. In addition, from the analysis of atomic resolution images it was determined that there is a well-defined phase shift between the CDWs in adjacent domains, and that within a domain the CDW superlattice is commensurate with the atomic lattice. These results provide evidence for the hexagonal discommensurate CDW phase in 1T-TaS2 and also suggest an explanation for the long-standing controversy concerning the structure of this phase."
https://openalex.org/W2073691782,"Basal dates of 30,420 years before present (BP) from a limestone cave in the Florentine River valley and 30,840 BP from a sandstone rockshelter in the Shannon River valley on the edge of the central Tasmanian highlands indicate colonization of Tasmania 8,000 years earlier than previously thought. These data indicate that people arrived before the Bassian Bridge was exposed about 23,000 years ago and support evidence that Tasmania and Australia may have been connected intermittently during the past 50,000 years. The dates support earlier suggestions that the Tasmanian inland was an important focus for systematic occupation and exploitation by human groups and dispel a belief that the Aboriginal economy 30,000 years ago was based on littoral, lacustral, and riverine resources. The absence of megafauna at both sites points to their extinction by 30,000 years ago in Tasmania. The people inhabiting Tasmania at this time, together with those at Monte Verde in Chile, were the most southerly humans on Earth."

The discovery of the egg, which was found mixed in with thousands of dinosaur bones rather than in a nest, the pathological multilayering of the eggshell as found in modern and fossil reptilians, and the pliable condition of the eggshell at the time of burial indicate an oviducal retention of the egg at the time of burial."

https://openalex.org/W2030387015,"Air-stirring motors are often viewed with disparagement in the laboratory because of the rather large amount of noise which attends their use. This noise may be traced to four sources: (1) that arising from the turbulent discharge of air fromÂ· the compressed air lines into tubing connecting with the motor; (2) that due to air rushing through the pipes and the connecting tubing; (3) that inherent in the use of an air motor, i.e. bearing noise and the clear tone of audio-frequency which is associated with all turbines; and (4) that resulting from the air rushing out of the small escape ports generally provided in the flat surface on top of the motor. Of these sources, the first and fourth are by far the most important because of both the intensity and the raucous character of the noise arising from them. The devices suggested here have been found very useful in reducing to a very large extent the noise from these two sources. The second and third sources enumerated are of smaller importance, but their contribution to the total noise may be minimized by suitable choice of connective tubing and by judicious oiling."
