https://openalex.org/W2888210778,"An elevated lithium battery Batteries based on lithium metal and oxygen could offer energy densities an order of magnitude larger than that of lithium ion cells. But, under normal operation conditions, the lithium oxidizes to form peroxide or superoxide. Xia et al. show that, at increased temperatures, the formation of lithium oxide is favored, through a process in which four electrons are transferred for each oxygen molecule (see the Perspective by Feng et al. ). Reversible cycling is achieved through the use of a thermally stable inorganic electrolyte and a bifunctional catalyst for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions.

However, recent evidence indicates that behavioral performance fluctuates over time, exhibiting temporal dynamics that closely resemble the spectral features of ongoing, oscillatory brain activity. Therefore, it has been proposed that periodic neuronal excitability fluctuations might shape attentional allocation and overt behavior. However, empirical evidence to support this notion is sparse. Here, we address this issue by examining data from large-scale subdural recordings, using two different attention tasks that track perceptual ability at high temporal resolution. Our results reveal that perceptual outcome varies as a function of the theta phase even in states of sustained spatial attention. These effects were robust at the single-subject level, suggesting that rhythmic perceptual sampling is an inherent property of the frontoparietal attention network. Collectively, these findings support the notion that the functional architecture of top-down attention is intrinsically rhythmic.

A long-standing question in models of sensory perception is whether perception is discrete or continuous (VanRullen, 2016aVanRullen R. Perceptual cycles.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2016; 20: 723-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, VanRullen and Koch, 2003VanRullen R. Koch C. Is perception discrete or continuous?.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2003; 7: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Likewise, it has been debated whether the allocation of “sustained” attention to one cued location is actually sustained or instead waxes and wanes over time (Buschman and Kastner, 2015Buschman T.J. Kastner S. From behavior to neural dynamics: an integrated theory of attention.Neuron. 2015; 88: 127-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These considerations raise the possibility that our seemingly continuous experience of the world is actually constructed from a rapid, sequential sampling of the environment. Given that neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in neural recordings (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G. Draguhn A. Neuronal oscillations in cortical networks.Science. 2004; 304: 1926-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that rhythmic brain activity might support the periodic sampling of the environment (Bishop, 1932Bishop G.H. Cyclic changes in excitability of the optic pathway of the rabbit.Am. J. Physiol. 1932; 103: 213-224Crossref Google Scholar, Varela et al., 1981Varela F.J. Toro A. John E.R. Schwartz E.L.

Is perception discrete or continuous?.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2003; 7: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Hence, endogenous oscillatory brain activity might shape our perception of the world on a rapid timescale (Helfrich and Knight, 2016Helfrich R.F. Knight R.T.

Engel A.K. Spectral fingerprints of large-scale neuronal interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In the past, the functional role of neuronal oscillations has often only been inferred by assessing binary task contrasts, e.g., attend versus non-attend, which integrated activity over longer time windows (Buschman and Kastner, 2015Buschman T.J.

However, in order to establish a direct link between ongoing brain activity and behavior (Thut et al., 2012Thut G. Miniussi C. Gross J. The functional importance of rhythmic activity in the brain.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R658-R663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it is desirable to sample behavioral outcome on a fine-grained temporal scale matching the timescale of endogenous brain activity (VanRullen, 2016aVanRullen R. Perceptual cycles.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2016; 20: 723-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Previous behavioral and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) studies reported evidence for periodicities in bottom-up perception and top-down guided behavior (Fiebelkorn et al., 2013Fiebelkorn I.C.

For example, EEG studies have shown that the detection of a close-to-sensory-threshold target can be linked to neuronal oscillations in the range from 7–10 Hz (Busch and VanRullen, 2010Busch N.A.

Behavioral studies have reported evidence of an “attentional spotlight” mechanism, whereby attention alternately samples two spatial locations at anti-phasic ∼4 Hz rhythms (Busch and VanRullen, 2010Busch N.A.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19204-19209Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether these theta rhythms originate in early visual cortex or elsewhere (Busch and VanRullen, 2010Busch N.A. VanRullen R. Spontaneous EEG oscillations reveal periodic sampling of visual attention.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16048-16053Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, Dugué et al., 2015Dugué L. Marque P. VanRullen R. Theta oscillations modulate attentional search performance periodically.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2015; 27: 945-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and behavioral and M/EEG data lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to resolve the origins of rhythmic sampling during attention (VanRullen, 2016aVanRullen R. Perceptual cycles.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2016; 20: 723-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In particular, it is unclear which anatomical correlates constitute the structural basis for rhythmic sampling in the human brain. Furthermore, it is unresolved how rhythmic sampling is functionally organized and distributed across cortical networks. The limited spatiotemporal resolution of methods employed in previous studies could not resolve whether behavioral periodicities are a direct result of spontaneous, ongoing, oscillatory brain activity, which is generated at the neuronal population level. Finally, it remains unknown if rhythmic sampling results from the inherent functional architecture of cortical networks or if rhythmic sampling is instead task- and context-dependent. In the present study, we address these unanswered questions by combining subdural recordings in humans with two different attention tasks (Egly et al., 1994Egly R. Driver J. Rafal R.D.

Dynamic changes in phase-amplitude coupling facilitate spatial attention control in fronto-parietal cortex.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12: e1001936Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that probed behavioral outcome on a rapid timescale. Electrocorticography (ECoG) provides the spatiotemporal resolution necessary to precisely track the ongoing brain dynamics that influence instantaneous human behavior. We specifically tested the hypothesis that low-frequency oscillations—previously observed in behavioral time courses—are a direct result of periodic excitability fluctuations in the same time range. We predicted that cortical high-frequency band (HFB) activity, a proxy for cortical excitability and population spiking in humans (Rich and Wallis, 2017Rich E.L. Wallis J.D. Spatiotemporal dynamics of information encoding revealed in orbitofrontal high-gamma.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Watson et al., 2017Watson B.O. Ding M.

Neurosci. 2017; (Published online December 18, 2017)https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), is modulated by low-frequency activity. We focused on HFB activity and not evoked narrow-band gamma oscillations (Landau et al., 2015Landau A.N. Schreyer H.M. van Pelt S. Fries P. Distributed attention is implemented through theta-rhythmic gamma modulation.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 2332-2337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), because narrow-band gamma oscillations do not predict local spiking activity or cortical excitability (Ray and Maunsell, 2011Ray S.

We hypothesized that the phase of these low-frequency oscillations would predict behavioral outcomes on a trial-by-trial basis not only in V1 (Dugué et al., 2016Dugué L. Roberts M. Carrasco M.

Oscillatory dynamics in the frontoparietal attention network during sustained attention in the ferret.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2864-2874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We recorded intracranial EEG from a total of 15 pharmaco-resistant epilepsy patients (32.80 years ± 12.63, mean ± SD; 8 female) who underwent pre-surgical monitoring with extensive electrode coverage of frontal and parieto-occipital areas in left and right hemispheres. The participants performed one of two spatial attention tasks, where they were asked to covertly monitor a cued location and indicate the appearance of a target after a variable cue-target delay. This experimental design allowed us to probe whether behavioral performance varied as a function of the cue-target interval. We utilized two different behavioral metrics. In experiment 1, participants (N = 7) performed a target detection task where the target luminance was titrated to perceptual threshold and detection accuracy was measured, while participants in experiment 2 (N = 8) performed a reaction time task where the target was presented above sensory threshold in the cued visual field. In the first experiment, participants performed a variant of an object-based attention task (Fiebelkorn et al., 2013Fiebelkorn I.C. Saalmann Y.B. Kastner S. Rhythmic sampling within and between objects despite sustained attention at a cued location.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 2553-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We cued participants to one of four possible locations (Figure 1A) and asked them to indicate the appearance of a close-to-sensory-threshold target after a variable cue-target-interval (500–1,700 ms). We continuously adjusted the luminance of the target to ensure that participants performed at ∼80% accuracy (75.91% ± 11.80%, mean ± SD; t6 = −0.92, p = 0.3945). We then assessed whether the hit rate varied as a function of the cue-target-interval. We observed strong fluctuations of detection accuracy in the behavioral time course in every participant (Figures 1B, left panel, and S1). In order to test whether these fluctuations exhibited an intrinsic temporal profile, we utilized irregular resampling (Wen and Liu, 2016Wen H. Liu Z. Separating fractal and oscillatory components in the power spectrum of neurophysiological signal.Brain Topogr. 2016; 29: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to separate non-oscillatory 1/f activity from the oscillatory component (Figure 1B, right). Across participants, we found that the behavioral time courses exhibited periodic fluctuations in the theta-band (3.99 Hz ± 0.88 Hz, mean ± SD; Figure 1C), where the observed spectrum exceeded the 1/f estimate (mean + 3SD; p < 0.001; see Figures 1B and S1). We also utilized a more conventional permutation approach, which confirmed that the time courses exhibit a significant oscillation in the theta-band (Z = 2.20 ± 0.55 [mean ± SEM]; combined p < 0.0001; Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, we observed the same effect when a different method for the 1/f correction was utilized (Figure S2C) or the averaging window was decreased to 50 ms. These findings suggest that attention does not sample the cued location continuously but periodically at ∼4 Hz. We hypothesized that the 4 Hz rhythmic sampling that we observed in individual behavioral time courses might be the result of periodic fluctuations in cortical excitability. To test this idea, we analyzed intracranial EEG data from a total of 614 artifact- and epilepsy-free electrodes (Figures 2A and S1) and extracted the high-frequency band (HFB; 70–150 Hz) activity, which has been shown to be a reliable proxy of population spiking activity (Rich and Wallis, 2017Rich E.L. Wallis J.D. Spatiotemporal dynamics of information encoding revealed in orbitofrontal high-gamma.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on an electrode’s response to the cue (0–0.5 s), we classified electrodes into cue-responsive (cue+) or cue-unresponsive (cue−; Figure 2B). We found enhanced HFB activity at cue+ sites during the target interval (0.5–1.7 s; grand-average across subjects; cluster-based permutation test: p = 0.0010, d = 1.55), as well as after target presentation (cluster from 0–0.59 s; p = 0.0010, d = 2.55). Next, we assessed the modulation of HFB during the selection process at cue+ electrodes by contrasting activity at cued and uncued locations. Averaging across trials revealed spatially specific enhanced delay activity prior to the target onset at the cued location (Figure S3A). However, this apparent enhanced delay activity did not reflect what we observed on single trials, where the HFB activity waxed and waned during the cue-target-interval (Figure 2C). In order to test whether the fluctuations in HFB amplitude exhibited rhythmic modulations, we extracted all HFB peaks from the cue-target interval, excluding peaks that reflected cue- or target-evoked activity (i.e., peaks within 0.3 s after cue presentation and before target presentation). Then, we performed peak-triggered averaging of the raw, unfiltered time series. Figure 2D depicts a single electrode example indicating that HFB activity was nested in an ongoing 4 Hz oscillation. In order to quantify this effect, we spectrally decomposed the peak-triggered averages by means of an FFT analysis (±0.5 s) and again compared cue+ and cue− electrodes (see Figure 2E for a single subject example). We found that a theta-band oscillation was present in the peak-triggered averages of cue+ but not of cue− electrodes (Figure 2F; permutation test: p = 0.0110, d = 0.26). In addition, we also tested if this process was spatially selective (Figure S3B). Our results indicate that the modulation of HFB activity by ongoing theta was stronger at the cued than the uncued locations in all subjects. Furthermore, we utilized irregular resampling to confirm the presence of oscillatory theta-band activity (Figure S3C), which was distinct from cortical sources of alpha-band (8–12 Hz) activity (Figure S3D). We also utilized conventional cross-frequency coupling metrics to confirm that this approach reliably detected theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (Figure S4). Taken together, these findings provide evidence that cortical excitability is rhythmically modulated by theta-band oscillations (Canolty et al., 2006Canolty R.T. Edwards E. Dalal S.S. Soltani M. Nagarajan S.S. Kirsch H.E. Berger M.S. Barbaro N.M. Knight R.T. High gamma power is phase-locked to theta oscillations in human neocortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In order to establish a direct link between behavioral fluctuations and ongoing cortical theta-band dynamics, we computed low-frequency phase-resolved behavioral time courses (Figure 3A). We divided the underlying phases of 17 logarithmically spaced frequencies (2–32 Hz) into 50 equally distributed bins and computed the average hit rate for all trials within a 90° window centered on every phase bin. We then calculated the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence of the observed distribution against a uniform distribution (Figure 3A, left) to quantify how strongly the observed distribution was modulated by the phase of the low-frequency activity. We obtained a surrogate distribution by randomly shuffling the condition labels (correct/incorrect; Figure 3A, center and right). This approach allowed us to investigate which phase of a low-frequency oscillation predicted subsequent behavior (Figure 3B) and if such phase modulation occurred differentially at cue+ and cue− electrodes (Figure 3C). We found evidence for enhanced rhythmic sampling at cue+ electrodes in every participant (Figure 3D; permutation test: p = 0.0091, d = 0.62). These findings demonstrate that the phase of ongoing theta-band activity during the cue-target-interval predicted subsequent perception. Notably, this effect was not confounded by differences in low-frequency oscillatory power (Figure S3E) or event-related potentials (Figure S3F). Figure 4A depicts the spatial extent of the observed effects for a single subject (see Figure S5 for data from all participants), highlighting comparable effects between left and right hemispheres. Across subjects, we observed theta-band phase-dependent rhythmic sampling in inferior parietal regions, in the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent superior parietal areas as well as in frontal eye fields (FEF) and adjacent regions in the frontal lobe. These findings indicate that theta-mediated fluctuations in cortical excitability in widespread cortical regions are behaviorally relevant and predict visual detection performance.Figure 4Large-Scale Network Dynamics Underlying Rhythmic Perceptual SamplingShow full caption(A) Left: topographical depiction of rhythmic sampling in one example participant who was implanted with bilateral grids.

(B) Then we calculated seed-based correlations based on the phase-resolved behavioral data, which indicated that parietal and frontal areas exhibit the same preferred phase for optimal behavior. Next, we aimed to assess how different nodes of the frontoparietal network contributed to the functional organization of rhythmic attentional sampling in the human brain. To address this, we employed a seed-based functional connectivity approach, where we defined the electrode with the highest normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence as a seed (Figure 4A, lower right) and computed correlations to all other electrodes (Figure 4B). This approach indicated that distant regions in the frontoparietal network exhibit similar phase-behavior-relationships (see Figures S4C and S5 for data from all subjects). In a second experiment, we investigated whether the observed theta-mediated rhythmic sampling in experiment 1 is a fundamental feature of attention allocation implementation in the frontoparietal network, or if the observed results were task-specific. To accomplish this, we utilized a reaction time task, where subjects only had to monitor two, and not three, spatial locations (Szczepanski et al., 2014Szczepanski S.M. Crone N.E. Kuperman R.A. Auguste K.I. Parvizi J. Knight R.T. Dynamic changes in phase-amplitude coupling facilitate spatial attention control in fronto-parietal cortex.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12: e1001936Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, we presented the informative visual field cue at fixation and not in the periphery. Participants (N = 8) were instructed to maintain fixation and were cued to allocate their attention to either the left or right visual field (Figure 5A). After a variable cue-target-interval (1,000–2,000 ms), the participants had to respond to a target that was embedded among flickering visual distractors. Participants performed this task with high accuracy (hit rate 97.21% ± 1.13%; mean ± SEM) (Szczepanski et al., 2014Szczepanski S.M. Crone N.E. Kuperman R.A. Auguste K.I. Parvizi J. Knight R.T. Dynamic changes in phase-amplitude coupling facilitate spatial attention control in fronto-parietal cortex.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12: e1001936Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to assess the reaction time as a function of the cue-target-interval (Figure 5B). We again separated oscillatory components and 1/f background contributions by means of irregular resampling, as employed in experiment 1, and found that the behavioral time courses in every subject exhibited periodic fluctuations in the theta band that exceeded the 1/f estimate by more than 3 SD (p < 0.001; 4.14 ± 1.34 Hz, mean ± SD; Figures 5C and S6). These findings from two different attention tasks provide strong evidence that human attentional allocation is not evenly distributed across time but fluctuates as a function of endogenous oscillatory brain activity. Thus, rhythmic sampling appears to be a general property of spatial attention regardless of specific task structure. Furthermore, we conducted a control experiment in healthy participants who performed both tasks (Figures S2D–S2F) and found that theta-band dynamics across tasks were significantly correlated, explaining ∼35% of the behavioral variance. To investigate the neural correlates of this behavioral effect, we analyzed intracranial EEG from 758 electrodes (Figure 6A). We extracted the HFB activity and observed enhanced delay activity during the cue-target-interval (1 – 2 s; p = 0.0010, d = 1.05) and after target presentation (cluster from 0–0.77 s; p = 0.0010, d = 1.88), which as in experiment 1 did not reflect single trial dynamics (Figure 6B) but showed strong spatial selectivity for cued than uncued locations (cluster test: p = 0.0010). Peak-triggered averaging and spectral decomposition revealed multiple spectral peaks in the low-frequency range in which the HFB activity was nested (Figure 6C).

https://openalex.org/W2797474345,"The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian Aedes species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV transmission in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV transmission. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic transmission. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV transmission and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV transmission in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics."

Yet there are no known control mechanisms for a fourth fundamental transition—the S/G 2 transition. Saldivar et al. report a switchlike control mechanism that regulates the S/G 2 transition. The checkpoint kinase ATR senses ongoing DNA replication in S phase and represses the mitotic transcriptional network, ensuring that DNA replication in S phase is completed before mitosis.

https://openalex.org/W2888145136,"Researchers around the world have observed the formation of molecularly ordered structures of unknown origin on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts exposed to air and solution. Using a combination of atomic-scale microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that TiO2 selectively adsorbs atmospheric carboxylic acids that are typically present in parts-per-billion concentrations while effectively repelling other adsorbates, such as alcohols, that are present in much higher concentrations. The high affinity of the surface for carboxylic acids is attributed to their bidentate binding. These self-assembled monolayers have the unusual property of being both hydrophobic and highly water-soluble, which may contribute to the self-cleaning properties of TiO2 This finding is relevant to TiO2 photocatalysis, because the self-assembled carboxylate monolayers block the undercoordinated surface cation sites typically implicated in photocatalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2888209032,"Severing to build microtubules Microtubules are essential intracellular polymers, built from tubulin subunits, that establish cell shape, move organelles, and segregate chromosomes during cell division. Vemu et al. show that microtubule-severing enzymes extract tubulin subunits along the microtubule shaft. This nanoscale damage is repaired by the incorporation of free tubulin, which stabilizes the microtubule against depolymerization. When extraction outpaces repair, microtubules are severed, emerging with stabilized ends composed of fresh tubulin. The severed microtubules act as templates for new microtubule growth, leading to amplification of microtubule number and mass. Thus, seemingly paradoxically, severing enzymes can increase microtubule mass in processes such as neurogenesis and mitotic spindle assembly. Science , this issue p. eaau1504"
https://openalex.org/W2888579822,"It takes two to signal The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is important in development, and excessive HH signaling is associated with cancer. Signaling occurs through the G protein–coupled receptor Smoothened. The pathway is repressed by the membrane receptor Patched-1 (PTCH1), and this inhibition is relieved when PTCH1 binds the secreted protein HH. Two recent papers have described structures of HH bound to PTCH1, but surprisingly, each described a different binding epitope on HH. Qi et al. present a cryo–electron microscopy structure that explains this apparent contradiction by showing that a single HH protein uses both of these interfaces to engage two PTCH1 receptors (see the Perspective by Sommer and Lemmon). Functional assays suggest that both interfaces must be bound for efficient signaling. Science , this issue p. eaas8843 ; see also p. 26"

During cortical development, neuronal Dab1 and ApoER2 receptors respond to a guidance cue called reelin. Studying mice, Segarra et al. found that Dab1 and ApoER2 are also expressed in endothelial cells (see the Perspective by Thomas). The integration of reelin signaling in endothelial cells and neurons facilitates the communication between vessels, glia, and neurons that is necessary for the correct positioning of neurons during cortical development. This integration is also important for correct communication at the neurovascular unit required for blood-brain barrier integrity in the mature brain.

More than 100 serotypes are known that exhibit unexplained complex patterns of incidence, from regular cycles to more irregular patterns, and new emergences. Using 15 years of surveillance data from Japan (2000-2014) and a stochastic transmission model with accurate demography, we show that acquired serotype-specific immunity can explain the diverse patterns of 18 of the 20 most common serotypes (including Coxsackieviruses, Echoviruses, and Enterovirus-A71). The remaining two serotypes required a change in viral characteristics, including an increase in pathogenicity for Coxsackievirus-A6, which is consistent with its recent global rise in incidence. On the basis of our findings, we are able to predict outbreaks 2 years ahead of time (2015-2016). These results have implications for the impact of vaccines under development."

Deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 49 methylomes revealed sequence-dependent CpG methylation imbalances at thousands of heterozygous regulatory loci. Such loci are enriched for stochastic switching, which is defined as random transitions between fully methylated and unmethylated states of DNA. The methylation imbalances at thousands of loci are explainable by different relative frequencies of the methylated and unmethylated states for the two alleles. Further analyses provided a unifying model that links sequence-dependent allelic imbalances of the epigenome, stochastic switching at gene regulatory loci, and disease-associated genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2888477870,"Exosomes are secreted nanovesicles which incorporate proteins and nucleic acids, thereby enabling multifunctional pathways for intercellular communication. There is an increasing appreciation of the critical role they play in fundamental processes such as development, wound healing and disease progression, yet because of their heterogeneous molecular content and low concentrations in vivo, their detection and characterization remains a challenge. In this work we combine nano- and microfabrication techniques for the creation of nanosensing arrays tailored toward single exosome detection. Elliptically–shaped nanoplasmonic sensors are fabricated to accommodate at most one exosome and individually imaged in real time, enabling the label-free recording of digital responses in a highly multiplexed geometry. This approach results in a three orders of magnitude sensitivity improvement over previously reported real-time, multiplexed platforms. Each nanosensor is elevated atop a quartz nanopillar, minimizing unwanted nonspecific substrate binding contributions. The approach is validated with the detection of exosomes secreted by MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. We demonstrate the increasingly digital and stochastic nature of the response as the number of subsampled nanosensors is reduced from four hundred to one."
https://openalex.org/W2888379515,"Hyperuricemia is highly prevalent and especially common in subjects with metabolic, cardiovascular and renal diseases. In chronic kidney disease, hyperuricemia is extremely common, and uric acid (UA) excretion relies on gut uricolysis by gut microbiota. Current therapy for lowering serum UA includes drugs that may produce undesired secondary effects. Therefore, this pilot study was designed to evaluate the potential of two probiotic supplements to reduce systemic uric acid concentrations. Secondary objectives were to assess whether the hypouricemic effect related to a therapeutic benefit on the hyperuricemia-induced renal damage and hypertension. Analysis of fecal microbiota was also performed. Groups of 6 rats each were followed for 5 weeks and allocated in the following treatment groups: C = Control; HU-ND = Oxonic acid-induced hyperuricemia (HU) +regular diet; HU-P = HU+placebo; HU-F1 = HU+ probiotics formula 1 and HU-F2 = HU+ probiotics formula 2. We confirmed that oxonic acid-induced hyperuricemia produced hypertension and renal functional and structural changes, along with modest changes in the overall composition of fecal microbiota. Both probiotic-containing diets prevented HU, elevated UA urinary excretion and intrarenal UA accumulation induced by oxonic acid. The hypouricemic effect conferred by probiotic supplementation also prevented the renal changes and hypertension caused by hyperuricemia. However, probiotic treatment did not restore the fecal microbiota. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time the ability of probiotics containing uricolytic bacteria to lower serum uric acid in hyperuricemic animals with beneficial consequences on blood pressure and renal disease. As probiotics supplements are innocuous for human health, we recommend clinical studies to test if probiotic supplements could benefit hyperuricemic individuals."

Its antioxidant property protects skin from inflammation and aging. In our work, a tocotrienol-rich RPO-based nanoemulsion formulation was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) and formulated using high pressure homogenizer. Effect of the concentration of three independent variables [surfactant (5-15 wt%), co-solvent (10-30 wt%) and homogenization pressure (500-700 bar)] toward two response variables (droplet size, polydispersity index) was studied using central composite design (CCD) coupled to RSM. RSM analysis showed that the experimental data could be fitted into a second-order polynomial model and the coefficients of multiple determination (R2) is 0.9115. The optimized formulation of RPO-based nanoemulsion consisted of 6.09 wt% mixed surfactant [Tween 80/Span 80 (63:37, wt)], 20 wt% glycerol as a co-solvent via homogenization pressure (500 bar). The optimized tocotrienol-rich RPO-based nanoemulsion response values for droplet size and polydispersity index were 119.49nm and 0.286, respectively. The actual values of the formulated nanoemulsion were in good agreement with the predicted values obtained from RSM, thus the optimized compositions have the potential to be used as a nanoemulsion for cosmetic formulations."

https://openalex.org/W2888349962,"Participation in HIV cure-related clinical trials that involve antiretroviral treatment (ART) interruption may pose substantial individual risks for people living with HIV (PLHIV) without any therapeutic benefit. As such, it is important that the views of PLHIV are considered in the design of HIV cure research trials. Examining the lived experience of PLHIV provides unique and valuable perspectives on the risks and benefits of HIV cure research. In this study, we interviewed 20 PLHIV in Australia about their knowledge and attitudes toward clinical HIV cure research and explored their views regarding participation in HIV cure clinical trials, including those that involve ART interruption. Data were analysed thematically, using both inductive and deductive coding techniques, to identity themes related to perceptions of HIV cure research and PLHIV's assessment of the possible risks and benefits of trial participation. Study findings revealed interviewees were willing to consider participation in HIV cure research for social reasons, most notably the opportunity to help others. Concerns raised about ART interruption related to the social and emotional impact of viral rebound, including fear of onward HIV transmission and anxiety about losing control. These findings reveal the ways in which PLHIV perspectives deepen our understanding of HIV cure research, moving beyond a purely clinical assessment of risks and benefits in order to consider the social context."

We report here that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a key role in controlling neuron activity–regulated BDNF expression. Using primary cortical cultures, we show that blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibits the BDNF up-regulation that is induced by activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor and that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway stimulates BDNF expression. In vivo, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activated BDNF expression and was required for peripheral pain-induced up-regulation of BDNF in the mouse spine. We also found that conditional deletion of one copy of either Wntless (Wls) or β-catenin by Nestin-Cre–mediated recombination is sufficient to inhibit the pain-induced up-regulation of BDNF. We further show that the Wnt/β-catenin/BDNF axis in the spinal neural circuit plays an important role in regulating capsaicin-induced pain. These results indicate that neuron activity–induced Wnt signaling stimulates BDNF expression in the pain neural circuits.

The kidney is the key organ for magnesium homeostasis, but our understanding of renal magnesium regulation is very limited. Uromodulin (UMOD) is the most abundant urinary protein in humans, and here we report that UMOD has a role in renal magnesium homeostasis. Umod-knockout (Umod−/−) mice excreted more urinary magnesium than WT mice and displayed up-regulation of genes promoting magnesium absorption. The majority of magnesium is absorbed in the thick ascending limb. However, both mouse strains responded similarly to the diuretic agent furosemide, indicating appropriate function of the thick ascending limb in the Umod−/− mice. Magnesium absorption is fine-tuned in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) via the apical magnesium channel transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6). We observed decreased apical Trpm6 staining in the DCT of Umod−/− mice. Applying biotinylation assays and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we found that UMOD enhances TRPM6 cell-surface abundance and current density from the extracellular space. UMOD physically interacted with TRPM6 and thereby impaired dynamin-dependent TRPM6 endocytosis. WT mice fed a low-magnesium diet had an increased urinary UMOD secretion compared with the same mice on a regular diet.

The major organ for regulated Mg2+ homeostasis is the kidney. About 10–25% of the filtered Mg2+ is absorbed in the proximal tubule and 50–70% in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle. In the TAL, the positive lumen potential, generated by the Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter (NKCC2) and the renal outer medullary K+ channel (ROMK), contribute to the paracellular absorption of Mg2+ (26.de Baaij J.H.

In this study, we wanted to analyze the role for UMOD in Mg2+ regulation and investigate the mechanism by which UMOD enhances TRPM6 cell-surface abundance from the extracellular space. Because up-regulation of UMOD mRNA in hypomagnesic mice suggested a role for UMOD in Mg2+ regulation, we studied whether Umod−/− mice excreted more urinary Mg2+ than WT animals. Umod−/− mice had almost twice the urinary Mg2+ compared with WT mice when fed a regular diet (Fig. 1A). Whereas there was no significant difference in serum Mg2+ between WT and Umod−/− mice at baseline (Fig. 1B), Umod−/− mice displayed up-regulated mRNA expression of Trpm6, Hnf1b (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b), Egf, Fxyd2b (Na+-K+-ATPase regulatory protein), and parvalbumin (PV), all of which promote renal Mg2+ absorption (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with a Mg2+-deficient state. It has been proposed that Umod−/− mice have a dysfunctional TAL, as they have a blunted response to furosemide (45.Mutig K. Kahl T. Saritas T. Godes M. Persson P. Bates J. Raffi H. Rampoldi L.

As the majority of Mg2+ is absorbed in the TAL, we tested the TAL of WT and Umod−/− mice for the response to furosemide. At baseline, we detected in 9-month-old Umod−/− mice significantly higher urinary calcium (Ca2+) and Mg2+ excretion (Table 1). However, we found no significant difference between WT and Umod−/− mice in response to furosemide administration regarding urine volume, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), Ca2+, or Mg2+ excretion (Table 1). We also detected appropriate response of the TAL to furosemide in 5-month-old Umod−/− mice (Table S1). As the TAL in Umod−/− mice responded well to furosemide, we wondered about other mechanisms for how UMOD could affect renal Mg2+ regulation. Therefore, we tested whether a lack of apical Trpm6 localization in the DCT contributes to renal Mg2+ wasting in Umod−/− mice. In WT and Umod−/− mice, immunofluorescent staining for the Na+-Cl− cotransporter (Ncc) and calbindin-D28K confirmed correct identification of the DCT (b and c in Fig. 1D). Ncc and calbindin-D28K expression appear similar in WT and Umod−/− animals (b and c versus e and f in Fig. 1D). However, evaluation of Trpm6 staining in the Ncc– and calbindin-D28K–positive tubules revealed less apical Trpm6 abundance in Umod−/− compared with WT mice (a versus d in Fig. 1D), despite an increase in Trpm6 transcript in Umod−/− animals (Fig. 1C). Our data point to the DCT as the responsible nephron segment for urinary Mg2+ wasting in Umod−/− mice and suggest a post-transcriptional mechanism for UMOD regulation of TRPM6.Table 1Urine and serum chemistries of 9-month-old WT and Umod−/− mice at baseline and after furosemide treatmentWTUmod−/−WT + furosemideUmod−/− + furosemideChange in WT after furosemideChange in Umod−/− after furosemide%%Weight (g)41.1 ± 8.639.9 ± 4.338.3 ± 8.238 ± 3.3−9.1 ± 5.5−9.5 ± 4.6Urine volume (μl/h)43.6 ± 16.239.5 ± 13.8621 ± 260$731 ± 233$1363 ± 3081654 ± 396Urinary excretion Na+ (μmol/h)6.4 ± 3.78.1 ± 3.275.9 ± 25.2$98.3 ± 32.8$1143 ± 2631200 ± 186 K+ (μmol/h)11.1 ± 4.210.5 ± 4.537.6 ± 7.5§50.5 ± 10.1$353 ± 186503 ± 155 Ca2+ (μmol/h)0.24 ± 0.120.42 ± 0.1*2.6 ± 0.9$4.12 ± 1.3$1184 ± 3021059 ± 324 Mg2+ (μmol/h)0.67 ± 0.151.45. ± 0.38#7.58. ±3.2§12.74 ± 4.5§1139 ± 182893 ± 174Serum Hct (%)48.4 ± 4.349.8 ± 5.250.5 ± 3.851.2 ± 3.3NDND Na+ (mmol/L)152.3 ± 1.6152.7 ± 2.3NDNDNDND K+ (mmol/liter)4.92 ± 0.25.05 ± 0.6NDNDNDND Ca2+ (mmol/liter)2.68 ± 0.062.74 ± 0.18NDNDNDND Mg2+ (mmol/liter)0.8 ± 0.090.77 ± 0.13NDNDNDND Creatinine (mg/dl)0.066 ± 0.0140.078 ± 0.005NDNDNDND Open table in a new tab First, we determined in HEK293 cells whether UMOD increases TRPM6 mRNA or protein expression. Relative TRPM6 mRNA and protein expression was not enhanced in cells co-transfected with TRPM6 and UMOD compared with control (Fig. 2, A and B). UMOD did not increase total TRPM6 protein abundance at 24, 48, or 72 h (Fig. S1). To study whether UMOD has an effect on TRPM6 channel current density, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with TRPM6 and control or UMOD. Co-expression of TRPM6 and UMOD increased TRPM6 current density significantly by a factor of 4.6 compared with control (Fig. 2, C and D). For the subsequent experiments, UMOD enhanced TRPM6 current density in the range of 1.9–4.7-fold compared with control. This variability is most likely due to different transfection efficiency with each experiment. To test whether UMOD enhances TRPM6 cell-surface abundance, we performed biotinylation assays. TRPM6 cell-surface abundance was about 2.7-fold higher in cells co-transfected with UMOD compared with control plasmid (Fig. 2E). The increase of TRPM6 cell-surface abundance with UMOD was reasonably close to the observed increases in TRPM6 current density recorded for this work. Our data indicate that UMOD increases TRPM6 current density by enhancing the number of channels in the plasma membrane. The majority of UMOD is synthesized in the TAL, whereas TRPM6 is mostly localized in the more distal segment of the DCT (47.Rampoldi L. Scolari F. Amoroso A. Ghiggeri G. Devuyst O.

Using palmitate as a model of lipotoxic diseases and as a substrate for ceramide biosynthesis in human and murine liver cell lines and primary mouse hepatocytes, we found that STARD11-deficient cells release fewer extracellular vesicles. Moreover, STARD11 reciprocally regulated exosome ceramide enrichment and cellular ceramide depletion. We further observed that in STARD11 knockout cells intracellular ceramide accumulates and that this apparent inability to transfer cellular ceramide into extracellular vesicles reduces cellular viability. Using endogenous markers, we uncovered structural and functional colocalization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), STARD11, and multivesicular bodies. This colocalization increased following palmitate treatment, suggesting a functional association that may mediate ceramide trafficking from the ER to the multivesicular body.

https://openalex.org/W2888020275,"Innate immunity in animals including humans encompasses the complement system, which is considered an important host defense mechanism against Aspergillus fumigatus, one of the most ubiquitous opportunistic human fungal pathogens. Previously, it has been shown that the alkaline protease Alp1p secreted from A. fumigatus mycelia degrades the complement components C3, C4, and C5. However, it remains unclear how the fungal spores (i.e. conidia) defend themselves against the activities of the complement system immediately after inhalation into the lung. Here, we show that A. fumigatus conidia contain a metalloprotease Mep1p, which is released upon conidial contact with collagen and inactivates all three complement pathways. In particular, Mep1p efficiently inactivated the major complement components C3, C4, and C5 and their activation products (C3a, C4a, and C5a) as well as the pattern-recognition molecules MBL and ficolin-1, either by directly cleaving them or by cleaving them to a form that is further broken down by other proteases of the complement system. Moreover, incubation of Mep1p with human serum significantly inhibited the complement hemolytic activity and conidial opsonization by C3b and their subsequent phagocytosis by macrophages. Together, these results indicate that Mep1p associated with and released from A. fumigatus conidia likely facilitates early immune evasion by disarming the complement defense in the human host."
https://openalex.org/W2888662092,"Sentiment analysis is widely studied to extract opinions from user generated content (UGC), and various methods have been proposed in recent literature. However, these methods are likely to introduce sentiment bias, and the classification results tend to be positive or negative, especially for the lexicon-based sentiment classification methods. The existence of sentiment bias leads to poor performance of sentiment analysis. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel sentiment bias processing strategy which can be applied to the lexicon-based sentiment analysis method. Weight and threshold parameters learned from a small training set are introduced into the lexicon-based sentiment scoring formula, and then the formula is used to classify the reviews. In this paper, a completed sentiment classification framework is proposed. SentiWordNet (SWN) is used as the experimental sentiment lexicon, and review data of four products collected from Amazon are used as the experimental datasets. Experimental results show that the bias processing strategy reduces polarity bias rate (PBR) and improves performance of the lexicon-based sentiment analysis method."

Among hyper-stimulating mutants, six were altered in genes involved in biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and had lost their O-polysaccharide region, suggesting that the presence of O-antigen impairs the response of PS cells to LPS. Using purified smooth (S) and rough (R) fractions of LPS, we showed that the R-LPS fraction induced a stronger response from PS cells than the smooth LPS fraction. Biological activity of the S-LPS fraction could be restored by the addition of recombinant bovine CD14 (rbCD14), indicating a crucial role of CD14 in the recognition of S-LPS by Mammary Epithelial Cells (MEC). When S-LPS and R-LPS were injected in udder quarters of healthy lactating cows, an inflammation developed in all infused quarters, but the S-LPS induced a more intense pro-inflammatory response, possibly in relation to sizeable concentrations of CD14 in milk. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the O-antigen modulates the pro-inflammatory response of MEC to LPS, that S-LPS and R-LPS trigger different responses of MEC and that these responses depend on the presence of CD14."

Genetic mutations in transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 3 (TRPC3) are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, memory loss, and hypertension. To better understand the conformational changes that regulate TRPC3 function, we solved the cryo-EM structures for the full-length human TRPC3 and its cytoplasmic domain (CPD) in the apo state at 5.8- and 4.0-Å resolution, respectively. These structures revealed that the TRPC3 transmembrane domain resembles those of other TRP channels and that the CPD is a stable module involved in channel assembly and gating. We observed the presence of a C-terminal domain swap at the center of the CPD where horizontal helices (HHs) transition into a coiled-coil bundle. Comparison of TRPC3 structures revealed that the HHs can reside in two distinct positions. Electrophysiological analyses disclosed that shortening the length of the C-terminal loop connecting the HH with the TRP helices increases TRPC3 activity and that elongating the length of the loop has the opposite effect. Our findings indicate that the C-terminal loop affects channel gating by altering the allosteric coupling between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. We propose that molecules that target the HH may represent a promising strategy for controlling TRPC3-associated neurological disorders and hypertension.

The 27 mammalian TRP channels are classified under six subfamilies, TRPC (canonical), TRPM (melastatins), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPA (ankyrin), TRPML (mucolipins), and TRPP (polycystins) based on primary structure similarity (2.Ramsey I.S.

Inherited mutations in TRP channels underlie numerous pathological conditions, such as peripheral neuropathies, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and pulmonary hypertension (3.Nilius B. Owsianik G.

The TRPC ion channels consist of seven members, TRPC1–7. They are further divided into three groups based on sequence similarity and functional analyses: TRPC1/4/5 are activated by Gαq-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, whereas TRPC3/6/7 are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG). TRPC2 is a pseudogene (2.Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. An introduction to TRP channels.Annu. Rev.

A relevant feature of the TRPC subfamily is that its members can form homo- and heterotetramers (4.Bröker-Lai J. Kollewe A. Schindeldecker B. Pohle J. Nguyen Chi V. Mathar I. Guzman R. Schwarz Y.

It regulates neuronal excitability in a circuit essential for behaviors related to motor learning and coordination. Indeed, a gain-of-function mutant in the TRPC3 S4–S5 linker region (T573A) causes abnormal Purkinje cell development and cerebellar ataxia (i.e. inability to coordinate balance, gait, extremities, and eye movements) that facilitates backward ambulation in the moonwalker mouse (9.Becker E.B.

Furthermore, TRPC3 expression is increased in mice with contextual fear memory deficits, suggesting a role for TRPC3 in regulating hippocampal neuron excitability associated with memory function (11.Neuner S.M.

In cardiomyocytes and blood vessels, TRPC3 is an essential component of the cellular mechanisms by which vasoconstrictors regulate blood pressure (12.Di A. Malik A.B. TRP channels and the control of vascular function.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2010; 10 (20060363): 127-13210.1016/j.coph.2009.11.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13.Lichtenegger M.

Vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II, bind to phospholipase C–coupled receptors, increasing the intracellular levels of DAG, which in turn activates TRPC3 (14.Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G.

Upon activation, TRPC3 channels induce membrane depolarization and opening of L-type Ca2+ channels, increasing intracellular Ca2+ and promoting vasoconstriction (15.Xi Q. Adebiyi A. Zhao G. Chapman K.E. Waters C.M. Hassid A. Jaggar J.H. IP3 constricts cerebral arteries via IP3 receptor-mediated TRPC3 channel activation and independently of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release.Circ.

Likewise, in the cerebellum, TRPC3 activation is downstream of metabotropic glutamate receptors whose activation triggers DAG generation (8.Hartmann J. Dragicevic E. Adelsberger H. Henning H.A.

Although DAG is sufficient to activate the channel (14.Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G.

Despite its relevance in the nervous and vascular systems, the TRPC3 gating mechanism remains elusive. Selective compounds for individual TRPC channels are sparse (17.Schleifer H. Doleschal B.

The structures of TRP channels are being extensively investigated using cryo-EM (19.Madej M.G. Ziegler C.M.

Recently, a huge step in structural information has been achieved for the subfamily of TRPC channels with the determination of the cryo-EM structures of TRPC4 (20.Vinayagam D. Mager T. Apelbaum A.

Although these structures shared overall topology, they diverge in the CPD spatial organization. Whether these differences are introduced by preparation methods or represent conformational variations that reflect physiologically relevant states remains to be determined. A TRPC subunit consists of an N terminus formed by four ankyrin repeats, the linker helical domain (LHD; linker helices 1–9), and the pre-S1 elbow. The N terminus is followed by six membrane-spanning helices (S1–S6) and a pore helix connecting to a re-entrant loop that forms the selectivity filter. The TRP helix is immediately adjacent to S6, and the C terminus consists of two α-helices connected by a small linker. Although there are differences in the transmembrane helices that may relate to differences in gating mechanisms among members, the major architectural diversity in the TRP family is their CPDs (23.Azumaya C.M.

The observed structural diversity suggests that the CPD confers subtype-specific function to the receptor, such as serving as an interface for protein interactions and allosteric gating modulation. For instance, the TRPC3 CPD acts as a biological sensor by decoding physiological cues in the intracellular environment to regulate channel function. Importantly, the C terminus contains a calmodulin (CaM)/IP3 receptor–binding site (CIRB) (30.Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Identification of common binding sites for calmodulin and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors on the carboxyl termini of Trp channels.J. Biol.

Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Activation of Trp3 by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors through displacement of inhibitory calmodulin from a common binding domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Moreover, enhanced activity is also observed in an alternatively spliced variant of mouse TRPC3, which lacks the N-terminal half of the CIRB (32.Kim Y. Wong A.C. Power J.M. Tadros S.F. Klugmann M. Moorhouse A.J. Bertrand P.P. Housley G.D. Alternative splicing of the TRPC3 ion channel calmodulin/IP3 receptor-binding domain in the hindbrain enhances cation flux.J.

Collectively, the CPDs have been functionally identified as a locus that modulates TRPC channel gating. Combining structural and functional approaches, our data show that the TRPC3 CPD is a stable module involved in channel assembly and allosteric gating. This domain is made of ankyrin repeats pierced radially by four horizontal helices (HHs) that converge and transition into a coiled-coil bundle. Notably, the CPD structure reveals a domain swap in the center of the tetrameric assembly, highlighting a unique fold for the TRPC subfamily. Functional characterization of mutants demonstrates that TRPC3 activity increases by shortening the length of the connecting loop between the TRP and horizontal helices; conversely, elongating the length of the loop has the opposite effect. Hence, our results support that the C-terminal loop fine-tunes the allosteric coupling between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. To determine the structure of TRPC3, we used the full-length human isoform b with a maltose binding protein (MBP) tag at the N terminus. This construct was expressed in Sf9 cells by infecting them with a recombinant baculovirus. Initially, TRPC3 was solubilized in digitonin and further purified using the synthetic digitonin GDN (the sample referred to as TRPC3GDN hereafter). In the final purification step, TRPC3 migrated as a stable and pure monodisperse species as determined by size-exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), and negative-stain EM (data not shown). Two-dimensional (2D) class averages of TRPC3GDN particles in vitreous ice revealed elements indicative of α-helices in the tetrameric channel (Fig. 1B). We were able to calculate a 3D map by collecting a large data set and using a subset of particles that produced class averages showing well-defined membrane-spanning α-helices in the micelle (Fig. S1A and Table 1). The final EM density map had an overall resolution of 5.8 Å (Fig. S1, C and D). At this resolution, the secondary structures forming the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the CPD are clearly resolved (Fig. 1C). The TMD was surrounded by signals from the detergent micelle (Fig. 1, C and D) that disappeared when the map was viewed using a density threshold that optimally resolves the membrane-spanning α-helices. The channel pore opens into a large chamber inside the CPD located below the TMD (Figs. 1E and S6C). The ions that pass through the channel will enter this chamber and subsequently exit through openings between the LHD and TMD or fenestrations between the ankyrin repeats (Fig. 1E). Overall, TRPC3GDN displays a compact two-tiered architecture when compared with the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4; a channel with similar fold) (27.Autzen H.E. Myasnikov A.G.

In those biochemical conditions, the TRPC6 TMD was flexible and appeared as a diffuse density in the cryo-EM class averages. Conversely, the TRPC6 CPD was well-structured, and by masking out the TMD in the 3D classification using RELION (35.Kimanius D. Forsberg B.O. Scheres S.H. Lindahl E.

We followed the same approach in an attempt to increase the resolution of the TRPC3 CPD. In this preparation, full-length TRPC3 was solubilized in DDM, purified, and reconstituted into PMAL-C8 (referred to as TRPC3PMAL hereafter). TRPC3PMAL migrates as a stable and pure monodisperse species as determined by size-exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The particles of TRPC3PMAL were monodisperse in vitreous ice, and their 2D class averages displayed features corresponding to α-helices in the CPD (Fig. 2B). The TRPC3PMAL TMD was flexible and diffuse in the cryo-EM class averages (Fig. 2B, white arrows) when compared with TRPC3GDN (Fig. 1B). We were able to calculate an EM density map of the TRPC3PMAL CPD at an average resolution of 4.0 Å (Figs. 2C and S2, A–C). The EM density map lacked any characteristic TMD α-helices (Fig. 2D). As expected, the CPD displayed lower resolution at its junction to the flexible TMD (Fig. S2D). The cryo-EM density map is of sufficient quality to build an atomic model of the CPD de novo (Fig. 2, D and E, and Table 1). The CPD model was built from residues Thr37–Glu295 for the N terminus and Thr773–Leu819 for the C terminus. Our model is in agreement with the predicted topology of TRPC3's primary structure (Fig. S3), allowed us to resolve individual polypeptides as well as large side chains (Fig. S4), and resembles the CPD structure of the full-length channel obtained in nanodiscs (22.Tang Q. Guo W. Zheng L. Wu J.X. Liu M. Zhou X. Zhang X. Chen L. Structure of the receptor-activated human TRPC6 and TRPC3 ion channels.Cell Res. 2018; 28 (29700422): 746-75510.1038/s41422-018-0038-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); hence, we consider our structure to be physiologically relevant. The N- and C-terminal segments assemble into a stable tetramer whose global architecture resembles a bowl (Fig. 2, D and E). The N terminus contains four ankyrin repeats (AR1–4) followed by the LHD composed of α-helices (LH1–8). In the C terminus, the HH makes a 100° downward turn and transitions into the vertical helix (VH) through a short linker (Fig. 2F, black arrow). The TRPC3PMAL CPD arrangement is comparable with those observed in TRPA1 (26.Paulsen C.E. Armache J.P. Gao Y. Cheng Y. Julius D.

Notably, the TRPC3PMAL CPD surface potential exhibits a striped distribution as the negative charges in the upper and lower part of the bowl surround a patch of neutral and positive charges (Fig. S5A). In the TRPC6 CPD, the lower half of the domain exhibits an overall negative charge, and the upper half is mainly neutral and positive (23.Azumaya C.M. Sierra-Valdez F. Cordero-Morales J.F.

Methods For 25 non-resolving CSC patients treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), the thickness of retinal layers was assessed on the foveal spectral-domain (SD) OCT scan. Evaluated OCT parameters included the central retinal thickness (CRT), defined as the internal limiting membrane (ILM) to ellipsoid zone (EZ) distance, and the second band thickness (SBT), defined as the EZ to hyperreflective subretinal accumulation distance. Integrity of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and the EZ bands was also determined. These parameters, along with BCVA and CRT measured automatically by SD-OCT device software were obtained before PDT, after PDT, and at final visit. After Bonferroni correction, a p-value <0.007 was considered statistically significant. Results Twenty-five patients could be included at last visit before PDT and first visit after PDT. At final visit, 24 patients could be included, since 1 patients was lost to follow-up. Mean CRT was 112 μm at last visit before PDT, 118 μm at first visit after PDT (p = 0.030), and 127 μm at final visit (p<0.001compared to baseline). Mean SBT was 74 μm, 26 μm (p<0.001 compared to baseline), and 21 μm (p<0.001 compared to baseline), respectively. Mean BCVA in Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters was 79 at baseline, 85 at first visit after PDT (p = 0.005 compared to baseline), and 87 at final visit (p = 0.001 compared to baseline). BCVA had an estimated correlation of β = 0.103 (p = 0.114) with CRT, β = -0.051 (p = 0.014) with SBT, β = 0.615 (p = 0.600) with the integrity of the ELM, and β = 4.917 with the integrity of the EZ (p = 0.001). Conclusions In non-resolving CSC patients treated with half-dose PDT, the CRT increased at final visit in comparison to the last visit before PDT. The continuity of the EZ on SD-OCT was positively correlated with BCVA. We propose that the distance between ILM and EZ should be used as a reliable CRT measurement in non-resolving CSC patients treated with half-dose PDT."

Comparisons of the receptor-bound conformations of AM2/IMD, AM, and a high-affinity CGRP analog revealed differences that may have implications for biased signaling. Guided by the structure, enhanced-affinity AM2/IMD antagonist variants were developed, including one that discriminates the AM1 and AM2 receptors with ∼40-fold difference in affinities and one stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond.

CGRP has highest affinity for the RAMP1:CLR complex, which is designated the CGRP receptor, whereas AM has the highest affinity for the RAMP2:CLR and RAMP3:CLR complexes, which are designated the AM1 and AM2 receptors, respectively. AM2/IMD was initially suggested to be a nonselective agonist (1.Roh J. Chang C.L. Bhalla A. Klein C. Hsu S.Y.

This complex system in which three peptide ligands share a common receptor that is modulated by accessory membrane proteins is a model for accessory protein regulation of GPCR pharmacology. Notably, RAMPs also interact with several other GPCRs (18.Hay D.L. Pioszak A.A. Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs): new insights and roles.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Understanding how the three peptides bind the receptors is especially important considering the phenomenon of signaling bias in which different ligands stabilize distinct receptor conformations to yield different downstream signaling outcomes (23.Wootten D.

Although Gs-mediated cAMP accumulation is commonly used as readout in structure–function studies of these receptors, activation of intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK1/2 also occurs, and these pathways and others have been implicated in the physiological actions of the peptides (3.Holmes D.

Understanding the structural basis of biased signaling may facilitate the design of drugs with desired bias profiles. Significant progress was recently made toward a structural understanding of signaling bias at the class B GLP-1 receptor (26.Lei S. Clydesdale L. Dai A. Cai X. Feng Y. Yang D. Liang Y.L. Koole C.

Calcitonin family peptides are ∼40 amino acids in length, and they have an N-terminal disulfide bond ring structure important for receptor activation followed by a central α-helical region and an unstructured C-terminal region that ends with an amide modification (29.Watkins H.A. Au M. Hay D.L. The structure of secretin family GPCR peptide ligands: implications for receptor pharmacology and drug development.Drug Discov.

Receptor binding follows the class B GPCR two-domain model in which the C-terminal half of the peptide binds the GPCR extracellular domain (ECD), whereas the N-terminal half contacts the 7-transmembrane (7TM) domain and activates the receptor (30.Liang Y.L. Khoshouei M. Radjainia M. Zhang Y. Glukhova A. Tarrasch J. Thal D.M. Furness S.G.B. Christopoulos G. Coudrat T. Danev R. Baumeister W. Miller L.J. Christopoulos A.

N-terminally truncated peptides lacking the disulfide-bonded region are competitive antagonists (31.Chiba T. Yamaguchi A. Yamatani T. Nakamura A. Morishita T. Inui T. Fukase M. Noda T. Fujita T. Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist human CGRP-(8–37).Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256 (2537579): E331-E335PubMed Google Scholar). CGRP(8–37) and AM(22–52) have traditionally been used to distinguish the CGRP and AM1/2 receptors, but we lack antagonists for discriminating the AM1 and AM2 receptors. Studies using the traditional antagonists provided evidence that AM2/IMD signaling in different cell types is mediated by the CGRP and/or the AM receptors depending on the effect (3.Holmes D. Campbell M. Harbinson M. Bell D. Protective effects of intermedin on cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal diseases: comparison with adrenomedullin and CGRP.Curr. Protein Pept.

Additional tools for discriminating the receptors are needed to improve our ability to identify the receptor(s) responsible for a given peptide action. Soluble fusion proteins in which the RAMP1 or RAMP2 ECD was tethered to the CLR ECD by a linker recapitulated the CGRP and AM binding preferences of the full-length CGRP and AM1 receptors (32.Moad H.E. Pioszak A.A. Selective CGRP and adrenomedullin peptide binding by tethered RAMP-calcitonin receptor–like receptor extracellular domain fusion proteins.Protein Sci. 2013; 22 (24115156): 1775-178510.1002/pro.2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of these constructs in complex with C-terminal antagonist fragments of a high-affinity CGRP analog and AM revealed that the two peptides bind a common site on CLR with different conformations and have minimal contact with the RAMPs (33.Booe J.M.

The structures and peptide mutagenesis studies supported a dual mechanism for RAMP function in which allosteric modulation of CLR and distinct RAMP contacts with the peptide C-terminal residue cooperate to determine CGRP and AM selectivity (34.Booe J.M. Warner M.L. Roehrkasse A.M. Hay D.L. Pioszak A.A.

Unfortunately, our understanding of how AM2/IMD binds the receptors and how RAMPs modulate its binding remains limited. Here, we produced recombinant tethered ECD complexes for each of the three receptors and used them to show that AM2/IMD has a unique selectivity profile, preferring the CGRP and AM2 ECD complexes. We determined a high-resolution crystal structure of an antagonist fragment of AM2/IMD bound to the CGRP receptor ECD complex, which revealed a triple β-turn receptor-bound conformation different from those of CGRP and AM. Guided by the structure, we designed novel AM2/IMD antagonists. Our results reveal differences in the receptor binding modes of the three endogenous ligands of the CGRP and AM receptors that have implications for biased signaling, inform development of AM2/IMD-based pharmacological tools and therapeutics, and provide mechanistic insights into RAMP accessory protein modulation of GPCR pharmacology. AM2/IMD has a unique selectivity profile for activation of cAMP signaling at the three RAMP:CLR complexes as compared with CGRP and AM (Fig. 1A), but the basis for this is unclear. We sought to characterize AM2/IMD binding affinity for soluble heterodimeric ECD complexes of the CGRP and AM receptors and compare it with AM and CGRP. In our previous studies examining CGRP and AM binding to tethered RAMP1–CLR and RAMP2–CLR ECD proteins, the fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and folded with a novel disulfide shuffling method (32.Moad H.E.

Attempts to generate a properly folded MBP-RAMP3–CLR ECD fusion protein using this method failed (data not shown). As RAMP3 contains four N-linked glycosylation sites (36.Flahaut M. Pfister C. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. N-Glycosylation and conserved cysteine residues in RAMP3 play a critical role for the functional expression of CRLR/RAMP3 adrenomedullin receptor.Biochemistry. 2003; 42 (12939163): 10333-1034110.1021/bi0347508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as compared with one in RAMP2 and none in RAMP1 (Fig. 1A), we reasoned that the RAMP3 ECD might require N-glycans to fold. We therefore expressed N-glycosylated MBP-RAMP3–CLR ECD as a secreted protein from HEK293T cells using methods we previously used for the calcitonin receptor ECD (37.Aricescu A.R. Lu W. Jones E.Y.

To assemble a complete set of the three tethered ECD complexes with each in their native glycosylation state (Fig. 1B), we similarly expressed the MBP-RAMP1–CLR ECD and MBP-RAMP2–CLR ECD proteins using HEK293T cells. Each of the fusion proteins was purified by immobilized metal-affinity and gel-filtration chromatography, which yielded highly purified proteins (Fig. S1, A and B). Each of the fusion proteins behaved as a monomer on gel filtration chromatography (Fig. S1, C–E). We previously developed a fluorescence polarization/anisotropy (FP) assay to assess peptide binding to tethered RAMP1- and RAMP2–CLR ECD constructs using an FITC-labeled high-affinity AM analogue AM(37–52) S45W/Q50W as probe (34.Booe J.M.

This assay was used to characterize peptide binding at the purified N-glycosylated MBP-RAMP–CLR ECD proteins. In saturation binding experiments, all three constructs exhibited nanomolar affinity for the probe with equilibrium dissociation constants (pKD) determined as 7.23 ± 0.02 (KD ∼59 nm), 7.41 ± 0.04 (KD ∼39 nm), and 8.19 ± 0.04 (KD ∼6.5 nm) for the RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 constructs, respectively (Fig. 2, A–C). We then used a competition assay format to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants (pKI) for unlabeled AM2/IMD(16–47), AM(22–52), and CGRP(8–37) (Fig. 2 (D–F) and Table 1). These traditional antagonist fragments include the C-terminal ECD-binding region and the central α-helical region that contacts the CLR 7TM domain, but they lack the N-terminal disulfide-bonded portion required for 7TM domain activation (Fig. 1C). CGRP(8–37) bound the RAMP1 construct with an affinity (KI ∼10 μm) 4-fold stronger than the RAMP3 construct (KI ∼40 μm), and no binding was detected at the RAMP2 construct. AM(22–52) bound the RAMP2 and RAMP3 constructs equally well, with KI values (∼5–6 μm) ∼18-fold stronger than at the RAMP1 construct (KI ∼100 μm). AM2/IMD(16–47) had similar affinities for the RAMP1 and RAMP3 constructs (KI values ∼2–3 μm) that were ∼5–8-fold stronger than at the RAMP2 construct (KI ∼14 μm).Table 1Summary of FP competition binding of C-terminal peptide fragments to MBP-RAMP–CLR ECD fusion proteinsPeptidepKI ± S.E.

GATA4 is one of the transcriptional regulatory factors, which regulates the development of endoderm-derived organs, including heart and gut. GATA4 may act as a putative tumor suppressor gene. However, the role of GATA4 in pancreatic carcinogenesis is not yet clarified. This study showed that GATA4 was highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues, and its expression level was positively related to the grade of pathological differentiation, suggesting that it may contribute to the progression of pancreatic neoplasia. Ectopic expression of GATA4 gene reduced cell viability and interference of GATA4 expression significantly increased the colony formation ability of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, GATA4 inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mice. Agilent expression microarray profiling analysis indicated that the genes with significant levels of differential expression in GATA4 over-expressing cells were enriched in the cell differentiation process. Analysis of KEGG signaling pathway demonstrated that the regulated genes were partially enriched in MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Re-expression of GATA4 up-regulated P53 gene expression. Our data indicate that GATA4 gene might play a role in cell proliferation and differentiation during the progression of pancreatic cancer."

We validated multiphase flat-detector CTA (mpFDCTA) for collateral imaging in patients undergoing endovascular stroke treatment. Materials and methods Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patient data, including mpFDCTA shortly followed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), in the setting of acute ICA- or MCA-occlusions were analyzed. An independent core lab scored mpFDCTA with an established collateral scale and separately graded American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology (ASITN) collateral score on DSA, blind to all other data. Results 24 consecutive cases (age 76.7 ± 7.3 years; 58.3% women; baseline NIHSS median 17 (4–23)) of acute ICA- or MCA-occlusion were analyzed. Time from mpFDCTA to intracranial DSA was 23.04 ± 7.6 minutes. Median mpFDCTA collateral score was 3 (0–5) and median DSA ASITN collateral score was 2 (0–3), including the full range of potential collateral grades. mpFDCTA and ASITN collateral score were strongly correlated (r = 0.86, p<0.001). mpFDCTA provided more complete collateral data compared to selective DSA injections in cases of ICA-occlusion. ROC analyses for prediction of clinical outcomes revealed an AUC of 0.76 for mpFDCTA- and 0.70 for DSA ASITN collaterals. Conclusions mpFDCTA in the angiography suite provides a validated measure of collaterals, offering distinct advantages over conventional angiography. Direct patient transfer to the angiography suite and mpFDCTA collateral grading provides a novel and reliable triage paradigm for acute ischemic stroke."

However, none of them are covered by Taiwan National Health Insurance due to the fact that they are expensive, and there is a lack of clinical evidence as to their effectiveness.This study was aimed toward an exploration of clinical experiences with use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, including indications, prescription types, drug effectiveness, adverse drug event types, and incidence, all of which shall serve as references for future clinical drug use.This is a retrospective study focusing on three immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab), which are available for cancer treatment in Taiwan. We collected data from medical records for the period from January 1st, 2015 to January 12th, 2017 at National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH), a medical center in southern Taiwan, and recorded these cases until May 31st, 2017. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and adverse drug reaction odds ratios were analyzed using a chi-square analysis.The 50 patients under consideration in this study had used any one of the immune checkpoint inhibitors in NCKUH. Non-small cell lung cancer (n = 24, 48%) accounted for the highest percentage, followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 4, 8%). The median OS was not reached, and the PFS for all immunotherapies was 4.9 months. The median OS period and PFS for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were 13 and 4.9 months, respectively, which were similar to those in many clinical trials. For NSCLC patients, the OS and PFS were only 0.63 and 1.37 months for squamous cell type NSCLC, and for patients who were PD-L1 negative, the OS and PFS were only 11.53 and 2.6 months, respectively. The most common adverse events in this study included fatigue (42%), rashes (22%), nausea (20%), and fever (20%), while one patient developed severe deep venous thrombosis and tissue inflammation, which was not confirmed in previous clinical trials.The histological subtype, the intensity of the PD-L1 expression, and the timing of treatment affected the NSCLC therapeutic results. It is recommended that clinical tests be conducted in order to enhance therapeutic effectiveness.

https://openalex.org/W2888665287,"The cumulative and match/mismatch hypotheses of stress are still under discussion regarding the effects of early life stress (ELS) on the vulnerability or resilience to psychopathology. In this context, an additional stress in later life (second hit) often leads to stress-related disorders that frequently include comorbid pain states. We previously observed that maternal separation (MS), a model of ELS, reduces vulnerability to neuropathic and inflammatory pain in rats. In the present study, we investigated the effects of an additional later stressor on the vulnerability to inflammatory pain. Sprague Dawley pups were divided into 4 groups: controls (CON, no stress), MS, social stress (SS) and MS+SS. At young adult age (from 7 to 15 weeks), stress- as well as pain-related parameters were evaluated prior and during 21 days following the induction of paw inflammation with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Finally spinal glutamatergic transmission, immunocompetent cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors were examined using qPCR. None of the stress conditions had a significant impact on corticosterone levels and anhedonia. In the forced swim test, MS and SS displayed increased passive coping whereas the combination of both stressors revoked this effect. The different stress conditions had no influence on basal mechanical thresholds and heat sensitivity. At 4 days post-inflammation all stress groups displayed lower mechanical thresholds than CON but the respective values were comparable at 7, 10, and 14 days. Only on day 21, MS rats were more sensitive to mechanical stimulation compared to the other groups. Regarding noxious heat sensitivity, MS+SS animals were significantly less sensitive than CON at 10 and 21 days after CFA-injection. qPCR results were mitigated. Despite the finding that stress conditions differentially affected different players of glutamatergic transmission, astrocyte activity and NGF expression, our biochemical results could not readily be related to the behavioral observations, precluding a congruent conclusion. The present results do neither confirm the cumulative nor corroborate or disprove the match/mismatch hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2888633637,"Introduction Preeclampsia is a major health problem in human pregnancy, severely complicating 5–8% of all pregnancies. The emerging molecular mechanism is that conditions like hypoxic stress trigger the release of placental messengers into the maternal circulation, which causes preeclampsia. Our objective was to develop an in vitro model, which can be used to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of preeclampsia and which might be used to find a remedy. Methods Human non-complicated term placentas were collected. Placental explants were subjected to severe hypoxia and the conditioned media were added to chorionic arteries that were mounted into a myograph. Contractile responses of the conditioned media were determined, as well as effects on thromboxane-A2 (U46619) induced contractility. To identify the vasoactive compounds present in the conditioned media, specific receptor antagonists were evaluated. Results Factors released by placental explants generated under severe hypoxia induced an increased vasoconstriction and vascular contractility to thromboxane-A2. It was found that agonists for the angiotensin-I and endothelin-1 receptor released by placental tissue under severe hypoxia provoke vasoconstriction. The dietary antioxidant quercetin could partially prevent the acute and sustained vascular effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Discussion Both the acute vasoconstriction, as well as the increased contractility to U46619 are in line with the clinical vascular complications observed in preeclampsia. Data obtained with quercetin supports that our model opens avenues for e.g. nutritional interventions aimed at treating or preventing preeclampsia."

Our objective was to examine the influence of RA on in vitro development of follicles enclosed within domestic cat ovarian tissues. Ovarian cortices from 9 prepubertal and 13 adult cats were incubated for 7 d in medium containing 0 (control), 1 or 5 μM RA and then analyzed for viability. Cortices from additional three animals of each age group were cultured in the same condition and follicle morphology, stage and size were histologically evaluated. In a separate study, cortices from 14 donors (7 prepubertal; 7 adult cats) were incubated in 0 or 5 μM RA for 7 d and assessed for (1) MMP1, 2, 3, 7, 9 and TIMP1 expression by qPCR and (2) protein expression of MMP9 by immunohistochemistry. Donor age did not influence follicle response to RA. Collective data from both age groups revealed that percentages of primordial follicles in 5 μM RA treatment were lower (P < 0.05; 40.5 ± 4.5%) than in fresh cortices (66.7 ± 5.3%) or controls (60.1 ± 4.0%) with 1 μM-RA treatment producing intermediate (56.3 ± 4.0%) results. Proportion of primary follicles in 5 μM RA (21.7 ± 3.3%) was higher than in fresh cortices (4.9 ± 2.9%) and controls (9.0 ± 2.8%) with 1 μM-RA treatment producing an intermediate value (13.8 ± 2.0%). Furthermore, proportion of secondary follicles increased after 7 d in the presence of 5 μM RA (9.5 ± 2.7%) compared to other groups (fresh, 1.9 ± 0.8%; control, 2.6 ± 1.1%; 1 μM RA, 2.5 ± 0.2%). MMP9 transcript and protein were upregulated, whereas MMP7 mRNA was suppressed by 5 μM-RA treatment compared to fresh counterparts. RA did not impact MMP1, 2, 3, 13 or TIMP1 expression. In summary, RA activated cat primordial follicle growth likely via a mechanism related to upregulation of MMP9 and down-regulation of MMP7 transcripts."

Using HEK293T and HeLa cell lines, we provide evidence that RASSF7 destabilizes the c-Myc protein by promoting Cullin4B-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, RASSF7 competed with MYC-associated factor X (MAX) in the formation of a heterodimeric complex with c-Myc and attenuated its occupancy on target gene promoters to regulate transcription. Consequently, RASSF7 inhibited c-Myc–mediated oncogenic transformation, and an inverse correlation between the expression levels of the RASSF7 and c-Myc genes was evident in human cancers. Furthermore, we found that RASSF7 interacts with c-Myc via its RA and leucine zipper (LZ) domains and LZ domain peptide is sufficient to inhibit c-Myc function, suggesting that this peptide might be used to target oncogenic c-Myc. These results unveil that RASSF7 and c-Myc are functionally linked in the control of tumorigenesis and open up potential therapeutic avenues for targeting the “undruggable” c-Myc protein in a subset of human cancers. c-Myc is a proto-oncogene controlling expression of multiple genes involved in cell growth and differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2888268373,"Background In national samples drawn from the USRDS, female patients utilize the hospital ED and inpatient services at a higher rate than their male counterparts and have a higher rate of re-hospitalization. We wanted to explore the association of sex with avoidable ED visits made by a cohort of patients on hemodialysis in a mostly minority, lower socioeconomic status (SES), population in the Bronx to test the applicability of the USRDS findings. Methods We used Montefiore’s clinical database to build a cohort of patients on hemodialysis with a first ED visit between 2013 and 2017. All ED visits after the index ED visit and those within one year prior to the index visit were recorded. None of the ED visits resulted in a hospitalization and were thus labeled “avoidable”. Bivariate analysis tested the association of demographic and clinical variables with sex. We used negative binomial regression to test the association of each variable with avoidable ED visit count. The multivariate model used negative binomial regression with avoidable ED visit count as outcome and sex as the exposure variable and included ancestral variables age and race. Potential mediators were added to the model to measure their effects on the association of sex with avoidable ED visits. Results Four thousand six hundred and seventy three subjects on hemodialysis were identified as having at least one avoidable ED visit, in the period of 2013–2017 at one of four ED sites affiliated with Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. Over 5 years (2012–2017), the median number of ED visits made by the study sample was 4 (25–75% IQR: 2–8). Female patients on hemodialysis in our cohort were older, more commonly black, had lower SES scores, less commonly had commercial insurance and were less commonly married than their male counterparts. Female sex was not significantly associated with a higher rate of avoidable ED visits in the total cohort.(1.053(0.99–1.12) Female sex was significantly associated with outcome in non-Hispanic whites only and in those subjects younger than 44 years old.(IRR 1.30(1.06–1.69), 1.17(1.00–1.38) in non-Hispanic White and younger age group, respectively.) Marital status, SES and hemoglobin levels possibly mediated the association of sex and outcome in our population. (>25% change in the coefficient for sex with respect to outcome when variable added to the model). Conclusion In this single center study of a lower-socioeconomic status, mostly minority dialysis population, the association of female sex with avoidable ED visits was not significant. These results suggest the association of sex with hospitalization outcomes, described by national datasets that determine quality indicators, are not consistent across different types of populations with some mediation possible by SES and marital status in poorer neighborhoods."
https://openalex.org/W2888766295,"Atypical Shigella flexneri Z variant, that agglutinate with E1037 group factor specific monoclonal antisera against Shigella flexneri IV-I but not with other group or type specific antisera, has continuously being isolated in Bangladesh since 1997. Later this serotype has been reported in Indonesia, China and Argentina. Despite being a provisional serotype, continuous isolation of these strains in diverse geographical regions implicated a great necessity to study the overall characteristics of these strains. Therefore, we extensively characterized S. flexneri Z strains using various phenotypic and molecular tools.Of 3569 S. flexneri isolated between 1997 and 2015, 95 strains were identified as S. flexneri Z using a panel of polyvalent absorbed antisera and monoclonal antisera of S. flexneri (MASF). Of them, randomly selected 65 strains were molecular O-serotyped using multiplex PCR and characterized using different phenotypic and molecular techniques (i.e.biotyping, plasmid profile, virulence marker and PFGE) to determine relationship with other subserotypes of S. flexneri.All these atypical S. flexneri Z strains were agglutinated with MASF B and IV-I antisera. Concordantly, these strains were positive to opt-gene, responsible for MASF IV-I sero-positive phenotype. However, molecular O-serotyping of all 65 strains could not differentiate between Z and Yb giving similar amplification products (wzx1-5 and opt). Contrarily, MASF based serotypic scheme distinguished among Z and Yb as well as Ya. All these S. flexneri Z showed typical biochemical reaction of S. flexneri, harboured a 140 MDa virulence plasmid and virulence markers namely ipaH, ial, sen, sigA and sepA genes. Along with the virulence plasmid, small plasmids (2.6, 1.8 and 1.6 MDa) were present as core plasmid. Moreover, a middle ranged plasmid and a 4.0 MDa sized plasmid were observed in 65% and 20% strains, respectively. Analysis of PFGE on XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA of Bangladeshi strains showed that S. flexneri Z had a close relatedness with Ya and Yb but completely different than the strains of Xa, Xb, 2a and 2b. This observation was found to be unequivocal while the overall result of biotyping, plasmid profile, and virulence factors was compared. Therefore, we conclude that these atypical serotype Z isolated in Bangladesh had a clonal relationship with Ya and Yb of Bangladesh and the opt gene played an important role in serotypic switching among them. Current serotyping scheme of S. flexneri strains fails to place many such atypical strains (1c, 1c+6, 1d, type 4, and 4c) including S. flexneri Z isolated from different parts of the world. Therefore, an updated serotyping scheme for identification of subserotypes of S. flexneri has been proposed to avoid multiple naming of the same subserotype having similar agglutination pattern."

Previous studies on related trait differences yielded genetic and environmental contributions. However, focusing on adult samples, classical twin designs, and convenience samples often restricts parameter estimation and generalizability, and limits the understanding of age differences. We investigated sources of variance in POP, SOP, and PI in late adolescence and early adulthood with an extended twin family design (ETFD). We analyzed data from over 2,000 representative German twin families. Individual environments not shared by family members reflected the major source of variance for all variables, but genetic influences were also pronounced. Genetic effects were mostly higher for young adults, whereas effects of twins’ shared environment were significant in adolescence. Our study deepens the understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping differences in young persons’ integration in society."
https://openalex.org/W2888712454,"Introduction Low urine pH (UpH) and high serum uric acid are considered evidence of metabolic disorders. The effect of low UpH on the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is less clear than that of high serum uric acid. We investigated the association between low UpH on the development of MetS and its components: central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and dysglycemia. Methods Two studies were conducted based on 2 datasets. The cross-sectional study included 14,511 subjects aged 19–80 years, based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2013–2015. The retrospective cohort study included 3,453 subjects aged 19–80 years without MetS at the first checkup, who underwent at least 3 health checkups at a single tertiary hospital between 2011 and 2017. UpH was measured using an automatic urine analyzer in the range of 5.0–9.0 at first visit. Results In the cross-sectional study, low UpH (= 5.0) was associated with the prevalence of MetS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.480, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.334–1.643, p<0.001), particularly central obesity, dyslipidemia, and dysglycemia (OR ranges 1.282–1.422, p<0.001, all). In the retrospective cohort study, compared with the highest UpH subgroup, the lowest UpH subgroup (= 5.0) was associated with higher risk of MetS development (hazard ratio = 1.394, 95% CI 1.096–1.772, p = 0.007). The incident risk of MetS increased from the highest to lowest UpH subgroups (p for trend = 0.020), among which dyslipidemia and dysglycemia increased (p for trend <0.01, all). Conclusion Low UpH can be used as a surrogate marker of MetS and affects the development of MetS, associative with the increase of dyslipidemia and dysglycemia in those without MetS. If UpH is ≤5.0, efforts to prevent metabolic disorders are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2888501593,"The purpose of this study is to explore donor relatives' experiences of the medical interventions enabling organ donation, as well as to examine the donor relatives' attitudes towards donating their own organs, and whether or not their experiences have influenced their own inclination to donate.The experiences of donor relatives were explored via in-depth interviews. The interviews covered every step from the deceased family member being struck by a severe bleeding in the brain till after the organ recovery, including the medical interventions enabling organ donation. The interviews were analysed through qualitative and quantitative content analysis.Brain death and organ donation proved to be hard to understand for many donor relatives. The prolonged interventions provided after death in order to enable organ donation misled some relatives to believe that their family member still was alive. In general, the understanding for what treatment aimed at saving the family member and what interventions aimed at maintaining organ viability was low. However, most donor relatives were either inspired to, or reinforced in their willingness to, donate their own organs after having experienced the loss of a family member who donated organs.There is a need for greater transparency regarding the whole chain of events during the donation process. Yet, having experienced the donation process closely did not discourage the donor relatives from donating their own organs-but rather inspired a willingness to donate. This indicates an acceptance of the medical procedures necessary in order to enable organ donation after death."
https://openalex.org/W2888220285,"The neural substrate of cognitive reappraisal has been well-mapped. Individuals who successfully downregulate negative affect (NA) by reshaping their thoughts about a potentially emotional situation show augmented activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with attenuated activity in the amygdala. We performed functional neuroimaging with experience sampling to determine whether individual differences in brain activation correspond to differences in real-life NA. While being scanned, 69 female students (aged 18-25 years) were asked to perform a cognitive reappraisal task. In addition, repeated assessments (5/day, 14 days) of affect and minor events in real-life were conducted. Individual t-maps were created for an instructed downregulation contrast (downregulate negative-attend negative) and an uninstructed regulation contrast (attend negative-attend neutral). Mean beta values were extracted from a priori defined regions of interest in the bilateral amygdala and PFC and were correlated with three daily life NA measures: baseline (mean) NA, NA variability, and NA reactivity to negative events. Only one out of twelve correlations for the amygdalae was nominally significant, which did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. PFC activation in the instructed and uninstructed regulation contrasts explained approximately 10% of the variance in NA reactivity; stronger recruitment during the attend-negative condition was correlated with lower reactivity levels. The degree to which individuals spontaneously engage frontal clusters may be a critical aspect of real-life emotional reactivity. The findings of this study provide a partial external validation of the cognitive reappraisal task, suggesting that frontal brain activation during implicit task conditions may have the strongest connection with real-life behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2888541995,"With recent developments of data technology in biomedicine, factor data such as diagnosis codes and genomic features, which can have tens to hundreds of discrete and unorderable categorical values, have emerged. While considered as a fundamental problem in statistical analyses, the estimation of probability distribution for such factor variables has not studied much because the previous studies have mainly focused on continuous variables and discrete factor variables with a few categories such as sex and race. In this work, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian procedure to estimate the probability distribution of factors with many categories. The proposed method was demonstrated through simulation studies under various conditions and showed significant improvements on the estimation errors from the previous conventional methods. In addition, the method was applied to the analysis of diagnosis data of intensive care unit patients, and generated interesting medical hypotheses. The overall results indicate that the proposed method will be useful in the analysis of biomedical factor data."

Cover stories offer a look at the process behind the art on the cover: who made it, how it got made, and why. 

As described in [a Report in this week’s issue][2], an unusual geometric property arises in a bilayer graphene structure in which one layer is rotated 30° degrees with respect to the other. Tiles of triangles, rhombuses, and squares can be mapped over this grid in a pattern called Stampfli tiling. While looking at a figure from this Report ([Fig. 1][3]), I thought, “No problem. I’ll fire up Illustrator, draw the three different shapes, and get to work.” It did not take me long to discover, however, that this tiling is not as trivial as it first appeared. Nervous excitement (read: mild panic) set in as I realized that I could not determine the pattern. I needed more information and leapt to the internet. That is when the fascinating and beautiful world of tiling opened up to me.

The structure of a single layer of graphene is a periodic, hexagonal grid. But when a second hexagonal grid rotated by 30° is placed atop the other, a more complex, quasi-periodic grid is created. This quasi-periodicity is the reason I could not see a repeatable unit. Rhombuses, squares, and triangles appear when one connects the points at the centers of every polygon of the double-hex grid ([Fig. 2][4]). This is virtually impossible for a human to do accurately. Thus, it is necessary to write an algorithm that generates the tiles.

![Fig. 2][1] 

Fig. 2 
The double-hex grid is shown in black and gray. The “dual”—that is, the grid created by connecting the centers of polygons that arise from the intersection of the grids—is shown in red. The lines have to be adjusted to produce a tiling with squares, rhombuses, and equilateral triangles.

I learned all of this and more from a blog I found, written by none other than the namesake of this tiling himself: Peter Stampfli. I reached out to Peter to thank him and ask to use the Processing code he generously makes available to generate the tiling. Excited to have connected with an early pioneer of generative art, I asked Peter if he would share some insight into his interesting career and what he is working on these days.

My grandfather, Oskar Stampfli, taught me about Platonic solids and tilings of the plane when I was about 10 years old. It was fascinating, and I subsequently became interested in geometry and symmetric images. Later, when studying mathematics and physics at the ETH Zurich, I read the “Mathematical Games” column of Martin Gardner and Douglas Hofstadter in Scientific American and thus discovered the beauty of fractals, self-similar images, and the geometric art of M. C. Escher. I tried to create my own images and even built a “home-brew” computer. But this was the 1970s, and the capabilities of my computer were much too limited to accomplish anything significant.

In the 1980s, I was working at the Freie Universitat Berlin. The quasi-periodic Penrose tiling had been discovered, which was very exciting. Hans-Ude Nissen of the ETH Zurich showed me his images of a quasi-periodic structure of 12-fold rotational symmetry in Ni-Cr particles. I noted that we could superpose two periodic hexagonal lattices to create a new quasi-periodic tiling with this symmetry. You can see it on the current cover of Science . But this work had more scientific than artistic value, because again my equipment was very limited.

After encountering this hurdle, I became frustrated and didn’t try to create images with a computer for a long time. Instead, I took to drawing on paper (see a sampling of my sketches in [Figs. 3][5] and [4][6]), thinking about tilings, and dreaming about really powerful computers. I collected books on geometry, such as The Symmetries of Things by John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss. Although I admired the images, I noted that I didn’t really understand their geometry if I couldn’t reproduce them. Being able to manipulate and modify these images would have been very helpful. However, this is very difficult to do on paper.

Around 2010, I noted that our home computers finally had all of the capabilities I needed. Additionally, I had access to Processing, a programming language that makes it easy to create images. So I had a new start. I begun creating tilings and publishing them in my blog . I felt that it would not be enough to simply show the final tilings and discuss how they were made. This would leave a big gap: the computer code needed to create the images. Because this code is quite complicated, I decided to publish it in my blog as well. Thus, the tilings became open source. Now others can more easily do their own experiments with these software tools and gain a better understanding of the tiling geometry. Also, I hoped that they would create more interesting images than I do! An excellent example is this week’s Science cover image, done by Val Altounian. 

Apart from tilings, I create images using fractals and other ideas. Currently, I am programming kaleidoscopes that create periodic images in curved space. All rotational symmetries become possible, such as the fivefold rotational symmetry of a decoration of a sphere with icosahedral symmetry. For more details, have a look at my new site . In particular, it contains a kaleidoscope browser application ([Fig. 5][7]) that you can use to create your own images. At the time being, it is not fully touch-enabled, so you should use it on a laptop or desktop computer.

I think that creating images with the computer is much more rewarding than playing computer games. Have a go at it—my code repository might be helpful.

https://openalex.org/W2888450774,"People living with HIV infection (PLWHIV) in Sub-Saharan Africa cope with an increasing workload of care (doctor visits, lab tests, medication management, refills, etc.) in a context of poor health service organization. We aimed to describe the workload of care for PLWHIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and assess to what extent simple adjustments in care organization could reduce this workload of care.Adult PLWHIV under antiretroviral treatment for at least 1 year were recruited in three centers (two public, one private) in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Using methods inspired from sociology, we precisely described all health-related activities (HRAs) performed by patients, in 1 month, in terms of time, money and opportunity costs. Then, we assessed the theoretical avoidable workload of care if patients' visits and tests had been grouped on the same days.We enrolled 476 PLWHIV in the study. Patients devoted 6.7 hours (SD = 6.3), on average, in HRAs per month and spent 5% (SD = 11) of their monthly revenue, on average, on health activities. However, we found great inter-patient heterogeneity in the mixture of activities performed (managing medications; dietary recommendations; visits, tests, support groups; administrative tasks; etc.) and their time allocation, temporal dispersion and opportunity costs (personal, familial, social or professional costs). For 22% of patients, grouping activities on the same days could reduce both time and cost requirements by 20%.PLWHIV in Côte d'Ivoire have a heavy workload of care. Grouping visits and tests on the same days may be a simple and feasible way to reduce patients' investment of time and money in their care."

I felt some pressure to head straight home after the conference I had attended at the last-minute request of my major research funder. But I had traveled halfway around the world to be there, in Morocco. I did not want to miss the opportunity to explore. So I headed to the mountains for 2 days of therapeutic hiking. As I marveled at the sunrise and the view from the icy summit of Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa, my addled mind calmed. Re-energized, I knew that I could cope with the work that waited for me upon my return.

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

It was almost 20 years ago that I learned how important it is for me to carve out time to escape to the mountains. I had finished my Ph.D., studying soil and water conservation in Honduras, but I wasn't sure what career direction I wanted to take. So, I decided to act on a dream I had been nursing for a few years, since my mom showed me a magazine article about a potter who had cycled from Los Angeles, California, to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego in Argentina. I figured that I could combine cycling with research for a book on Andean agriculture while I worked out my next career step.

My partner and I spent 12 months cycling from Tierra del Fuego to Ecuador, battling ferocious winds in Patagonia, gasping for air as we inched up mountains in Peru, and rejoicing as the rain became deliciously warmer during the descent from Quito to the Ecuadorian Amazon. Along the way, I learned a fundamental lesson: Being outdoors inspires me, and the beauty of my surroundings combined with physical exertion helps me think broadly and distill my ideas.

During the cycling trip, I found the clarity I needed to figure out my next career move. Talking with farmers we met along the way, from shepherds in Patagonia to potato producers in Ecuador, I learned that their biggest challenge was selling their produce. I decided to broaden my focus from land management to improving farmers' access to markets. My new interest led to working for a nongovernmental organization and eventually conducting agricultural research at international nonprofit organizations, which is what I do now. And my partner and I did eventually publish a book on Andean agriculture.

I recognize that times have changed since I embarked on my cycling adventure, and that researchers today face onerous pressures to publish and get funding. But the pressure cooker that we now live in makes it even more important for researchers at all career stages to find ways to escape from the grind, even if only for a few hours, and seek inspiration. For some, like me, that may come from being active in the outdoors. Others may find their outlet in music, reading, crafts, or any number of varied activities. The key is to find your source of inspiration and nurture it.

In my case, cycling has given way to long-distance running and hiking. Some things, however, have not changed. I still find that the ideas for many research articles have come to me while surrounded by snow-capped peaks, or even on urban streets on early morning runs. When I'm home, I make sure to head to the hills, at least for a few hours every weekend. I always travel with my running shoes, and occasionally with my hiking boots. And when I find myself straying from this routine and forgetting the nourishment I get from being active in the outdoors, as I nearly did during that conference trip a few years ago, I remind myself of the words of Scottish-American naturalist John Muir: “Wildness is a necessity.”
