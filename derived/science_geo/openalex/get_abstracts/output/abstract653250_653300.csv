https://openalex.org/W3032034316,"Structural variants (SVs) rearrange large segments of DNA1 and can have profound consequences in evolution and human disease2,3. As national biobanks, disease-association studies, and clinical genetic testing have grown increasingly reliant on genome sequencing, population references such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)4 have become integral in the interpretation of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)5. However, there are no reference maps of SVs from high-coverage genome sequencing comparable to those for SNVs. Here we present a reference of sequence-resolved SVs constructed from 14,891 genomes across diverse global populations (54% non-European) in gnomAD. We discovered a rich and complex landscape of 433,371 SVs, from which we estimate that SVs are responsible for 25-29% of all rare protein-truncating events per genome. We found strong correlations between natural selection against damaging SNVs and rare SVs that disrupt or duplicate protein-coding sequence, which suggests that genes that are highly intolerant to loss-of-function are also sensitive to increased dosage6. We also uncovered modest selection against noncoding SVs in cis-regulatory elements, although selection against protein-truncating SVs was stronger than all noncoding effects. Finally, we identified very large (over one megabase), rare SVs in 3.9% of samples, and estimate that 0.13% of individuals may carry an SV that meets the existing criteria for clinically important incidental findings7. This SV resource is freely distributed via the gnomAD browser8 and will have broad utility in population genetics, disease-association studies, and diagnostic screening."
https://openalex.org/W3017326172,"Intestinal health relies on the immunosuppressive activity of CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells1. Expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 defines this lineage, and can be induced extrathymically by dietary or commensal-derived antigens in a process assisted by a Foxp3 enhancer known as conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1)2-4. Products of microbial fermentation including butyrate facilitate the generation of peripherally induced Treg (pTreg) cells5-7, indicating that metabolites shape the composition of the colonic immune cell population. In addition to dietary components, bacteria modify host-derived molecules, generating a number of biologically active substances. This is epitomized by the bacterial transformation of bile acids, which creates a complex pool of steroids8 with a range of physiological functions9. Here we screened the major species of deconjugated bile acids for their ability to potentiate the differentiation of pTreg cells. We found that the secondary bile acid 3β-hydroxydeoxycholic acid (isoDCA) increased Foxp3 induction by acting on dendritic cells (DCs) to diminish their immunostimulatory properties. Ablating one receptor, the farnesoid X receptor, in DCs enhanced the generation of Treg cells and imposed a transcriptional profile similar to that induced by isoDCA, suggesting an interaction between this bile acid and nuclear receptor. To investigate isoDCA in vivo, we took a synthetic biology approach and designed minimal microbial consortia containing engineered Bacteroides strains. IsoDCA-producing consortia increased the number of colonic RORγt-expressing Treg cells in a CNS1-dependent manner, suggesting enhanced extrathymic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3030414242,"More than three quarters of the baryonic content of the Universe resides in a highly diffuse state that is difficult to observe, with only a small fraction directly observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Censuses of the nearby Universe have used absorption line spectroscopy to observe these invisible baryons, but these measurements rely on large and uncertain corrections and are insensitive to the majority of the volume, and likely mass. Specifically, quasar spectroscopy is sensitive either to only the very trace amounts of Hydrogen that exists in the atomic state, or highly ionized and enriched gas in denser regions near galaxies. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich analyses provide evidence of some of the gas in filamentary structures and studies of X-ray emission are most sensitive to gas near galaxy clusters. Here we report the direct measurement of the baryon content of the Universe using the dispersion of a sample of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), thus utilizing an effect that measures the electron column density along each sight line and accounts for every ionised baryon. We augment the sample of published arcsecond-localized FRBs with a further four new localizations to host galaxies which have measured redshifts of 0.291, 0.118, 0.378 and 0.522, completing a sample sufficiently large to account for dispersion variations along the line of sight and in the host galaxy environment to derive a cosmic baryon density of $\Omega_{b} = 0.051_{-0.025}^{+0.021} \, h_{70}^{-1}$ (95% confidence). This independent measurement is consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis values."

Dialogue between stromal, vascular, and tissue-specific cells is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Aside from providing nutrition, growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM), and hormones, three-dimensional (3D) biophysical interactions with stromal cells are also necessary to ensure proper organ function. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can differentiate into all cell types of the body (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

We hypothesized that the absence of tissue-specific stromal and vascular cells may contribute to maturation failure and here used the heart as an exemplar to examine the effect of cardiac stromal cells on hiPSC-cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). The adult heart contains 30% contractile CMs, the remaining non-CM fraction being cardiac endothelial cells (ECs), vascular stromal cells, and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) (Pinto et al., 2016Pinto A.R.

T-tubules normally develop postnatally to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis, excitation-contraction coupling, and electrical activity of the heart (Brette and Orchard, 2007Brette F. Orchard C. Resurgence of cardiac t-tubule research.Physiology (Bethesda). 2007; 22: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, EHTs require specific expertise, specialized apparatus, gelation substrates, and analysis tools (Mathur et al., 2015Mathur A. Loskill P. Shao K. Huebsch N. Hong S. Marcus S.G. Marks N. Mandegar M. Conklin B.R. Lee L.P. Healy K.E. Human iPSC-based cardiac microphysiological system for drug screening applications.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and are thus complex solutions for most academic laboratories and pharma applications. Moreover, monotypic cell configurations do not recapitulate how stromal or vascular cells might affect the behavior of CMs and mediate disease or drug-induced phenotypes. Here, we addressed these issues by generating multicell-type 3D cardiac microtissues (MTs) starting with just 5,000 cells. We demonstrated previously that hiPSC-ECs derived from cardiac mesoderm affect hiPSC-CMs in 3D MTs (Giacomelli et al., 2017bGiacomelli E. Bellin M. Sala L. van Meer B.J. Tertoolen L.G.J. Orlova V.V.

CFs mainly originate from the epicardium (Tallquist and Molkentin, 2017Tallquist M.D. Molkentin J.D. Redefining the identity of cardiac fibroblasts.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2017; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the outer epithelium covering the heart. They play crucial roles in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology (Furtado et al., 2016Furtado M.B. Nim H.T. Boyd S.E. Rosenthal N.A.

Fibroblast-myocyte coupling in the heart: potential relevance for therapeutic interventions.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2016; 91: 238-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CFs have also been implicated in contractility of hiPSC-CMs in 3D self-assembled (scaffold-free) MTs composed of hiPSC-CMs, primary human cardiac microvasculature ECs, and primary human CFs (Pointon et al., 2017Pointon A. Pilling J. Dorval T. Wang Y. Archer C. Pollard C. From the cover: high-throughput imaging of cardiac microtissues for the assessment of cardiac contraction during drug discovery.Toxicol. Sci. 2017; 155: 444-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MTs have to date only been generated using primary stromal cells, which impacts reproducibility and supply. By replacing primary ECs and CFs with hiPSC counterparts, we generated thousands of scaffold-free miniaturized cardiac MTs (CMECFs) containing all cellular components in defined ratios and observed enhanced hiPSC-CM maturation. We demonstrated that CFs, expressing connexin 43 (CX43) gap junction protein, were most effective in supporting hiPSC-CM maturation, and this was mediated by cyclic AMP (cAMP). Skin fibroblasts (SFs), which do not express CX43, and CFs in which CX43 was knocked down were unable to couple to hiPSC-CMs and did not improve maturation. Single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that signals from both cardiac ECs and CFs likely contributed to increasing intracellular cAMP in hiPSC-CMs and this was recapitulated by adding dibutyryl (db) cAMP, a cell-permeable analog of cAMP. MTs in which control CFs were replaced by hiPSC CFs carrying a mutation in the desmosomal protein PKP2 that causes arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) strikingly showed CX43 reduction and cardiac arrhythmic behavior despite the CMs being healthy. This illustrates that CFs are crucial in controlling adjacent CM behavior and that CFs were integral contributors to the ACM phenotype. Epicardial cells (EPIs) contribute more than 80% of CFs in the heart (Tallquist and Molkentin, 2017Tallquist M.D. Molkentin J.D. Redefining the identity of cardiac fibroblasts.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2017; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To generate CFs, we first differentiated hiPSC lines into EPIs, as previously described (Guadix et al., 2017Guadix J.A. Orlova V.V. Giacomelli E. Bellin M. Ribeiro M.C. Mummery C.L. Pérez-Pomares J.M. Passier R. Human pluripotent stem cell differentiation into functional epicardial progenitor cells.Stem Cell Reports. 2017; 9: 1754-1764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). EPIs emerged with typical epithelial cobblestone-like morphology reaching confluence on day 12 of differentiation (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence (IF) confirmed nuclear expression of WT1 and TBX18 (Figure 1B). To induce CF differentiation, hiPSC-EPIs were dissociated on day 12 and re-plated in medium with basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) (10 ng/mL) for 8 days, refreshing on day 13 and every 2 days thereafter (Figure 1A). Cells became typically mesenchymal (Figure 1A). On day 21, hiPSC-CFs were expanded for an additional 8 days in FGM3 medium. IF confirmed the EPI-to-CF transition (Figure 1B), with downregulation of WT1 and TBX18 and expression of collagen type alpha1 (COL1A1). By day 29, hiPSC-CFs expressed multiple fibroblast genes (GJA1, ITGA4, COL1A1, COL1A2, and POSTN) and reduced WT1 and TBX18 (Figure 1C). The differentiation protocol was robust and reproducible in three independent hiPSC lines (Figures 1B and 1C); all hiPSC-CFs exhibited similar mRNA and protein marker expression and were more similar to adult CFs (ACFs) than to SFs, which were characterized by negligible expression of the gap junction protein CX43 (GJA1 gene) and high expression of collagen markers (COL1A1 and COL1A2; Figures 1B and 1C). Principal-component (PC) analysis of whole-transcriptome RNA-seq of hiPSC-CMs, primary human fetal-ECs (huF-ECs) and hiPSC-cardiac ECs (Giacomelli et al., 2017aGiacomelli E. Bellin M. Orlova V.V. Mummery C.L. Co-differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells from cardiac mesoderm provides a three-dimensional model of cardiac microtissue.Curr. Protoc. Hum. Genet. 2017; 95: 21.9.1-21.9.22Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), SFs, hiPSC-EPIs, and primary human ACFs, huF-CFs, and hiPSC-CFs confirmed striking genome-wide expression correspondence between primary human cardiac cells and their hiPSC-derived equivalents (Figure 1D). Hierarchical clustering of cell-lineage-specific signature genes identified gene clusters upregulated in each of the different cell types (Figure 1E). Gene Ontology (GO) terms for heart and vasculature development, cell junction organization, and collagen metabolic process were associated with hiPSC-CMs, ECs, EPIs, and CFs, respectively (Figure 1F; Table S1). The data thus showed shared cellular identities between primary cardiac cells and their hiPSC-derived equivalents and distinct differences between each cell subtype. Given their distinct identities, we used hiPSC-derived cardiac cells to form 3D MTs containing hiPSC-CMs and hiPSC-cardiac ECs, derived as previously from a common cardiac mesoderm precursor (MT-CMEC; termed here CMECs; Giacomelli et al., 2017aGiacomelli E.

These were hiPSC-CFs (CMECFs), ACFs (CMEC ACFs) and adult SFs (CMEC SFs; Figure 2A). MTs were aggregated as spheroids from 5,000 cells in V-bottom 96-well microplates, refreshed every 3 days with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (CMECs), FGF2 (CMFs), or VEGF and FGF2 (CMECFs, CMEC ACFs, and CMEC SFs) and cultured for 21 days. We first examined overall morphology and cellular architecture by IF for CM (cardiac troponin I; TNNI), EC (CD31), and fibroblast (COL1A1) markers (Figure S1A) using a computational framework developed in house for 3D semi-automated image processing and segmentation. MTs containing fibroblasts were similar in size and total cell number (Figure S1B), whereas CMECs were smaller, containing fewer cells despite the same input cell number. The percentages of the different cell types (Figure S1C) were comparable among MT groups and reflected the input used for MT formation. Although relatively more COL1A1+ cells were found in CMEC SFs (Figure S1C), the percentage of proliferating cells over time remained low in all MT groups with few or no Ki-67+COL1A1+ cells (Figures S1D and S1E). Time-lapse videos of CMEC and CMECF formation showed that CMECFs formed faster and were rapidly more compact than CMECs, suggesting that fibroblasts facilitated aggregation, likely through enhanced cell-cell adhesion (data not shown). Average distance between nuclei indicated that nuclei were indeed more densely packed in MTs containing CFs and ECs than in CMECs (Figure S1F). CM nuclei in CF-containing MTs were larger than in other MT groups (Figure S1G), suggesting that hypertrophy associated with maturation had been initiated. We next examined salient features of adult CM function, namely (ultra)structure, electrophysiology, and mechanical contraction. Immunostaining for cardiac sarcomeric proteins TNNI and actinin alpha-2 (ACTN2) in MTs revealed better sarcomere development and organization in MTs containing CFs than in CMECs and CMEC SFs from three independent hiPSC lines, as indicated by sarcomere alignment index and length (Figures 2B, 2F, and S2A–S2C). This was confirmed by IF on CMs from dissociated MTs (Figures 2C and 2G) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figures 2D and 2H). TEM also showed more mature hiPSC-CM ultrastructure in CMECFs, including the presence of caveolae, elongated and enlarged mitochondria with complex cristae, and elongated tubular myofibrils consisting of well-organized sarcomeres with regular Z-lines, I-bands, and H-zones; M-lines and T-tubule-like structures (Eisner et al., 2017Eisner D.A.

Res. 2017; 121: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) were also visible (Figures 2E and S2D). Comparison of bulk- and sc-RNA-seq with published datasets showed that CMs in CMECFs clustered closely to adult human CMs, whereas CMs in 2D and in CMECs clustered separately as immature cells (Figure 3A). scRNA-seq analysis of CMs in 2D versus CMECFs confirmed enhanced CM structural maturation in CMECFs, with increased expression of key cardiac sarcomeric genes TNNT2, MYL2, MYL3, MYL4, TNNI1, TNNI3, DES, and also TCAP, important for sarcomere assembly and T-tubule structure and function in the mammalian heart (Ibrahim et al., 2013Ibrahim M.

Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq confirmed that MTs containing hiPSC-CFs were globally more similar to CMEC ACFs than CMEC SFs (Figure 3C). Of note, least biological variability was observed when MTs were entirely hiPSC derived (Figure 3C). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between hiPSC-CMs, CMECs, CMECFs, CMEC ACFs, and CMEC SFs (Figure S3E). Unsupervised clustering of DEGs identified genes most similarly expressed; this resulted in 8 distinct gene clusters (Figure S3F). CMECFs and CMEC ACFs showed common molecular signatures characterized by genes upregulated in cluster 5 (Figure 3D; Table S3), which were not upregulated in CMEC SFs. GO analysis showed enrichment in terms for heart contraction, cardiac conduction, regulation of membrane potential, cardiac muscle cell development, regulation of the force of heart contraction, and regulation of ion transmembrane function (Figure 3E; Table S3). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the pathway “adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes” was enriched among genes commonly upregulated in CMECFs and CMEC ACFs (cluster 5; Figure 3F; Table S3). Heatmaps of genes associated with GO terms of heart contraction and regulation of ion transmembrane transport and KEGG pathway adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes (Figures 3G–3I) showed higher expression of sarcomere proteins, ion channels, and adrenergic receptors in CMECFs and CMEC ACFs compared to CMECs and CMEC SFs. These findings suggested that both adult- and hiPSC-CFs promote maturation of hiPSC-CMs in MTs such that they display multiple postnatal features. To determine whether structural maturation was accompanied by electrical maturation, we measured action potentials (APs) in CMs from dissociated MTs using patch-clamp electrophysiology (Figures 4A–4D and S4A). hiPSC-CMs from CMECFs and CMEC ACFs clearly showed similar and improved electrophysiological maturity than hiPSC-CMs from CMECs, CMFs, and CMEC SFs, with many CMs exhibiting fast transient repolarization after the AP peak (referred to as an AP “notch”; Figures 4A and 4B), reflecting expression of the typical transient outward potassium current (Ito), in agreement with upregulation of Ito genes KCND3 and KCNA4 (Figure 3H); moreover, they had more negative resting membrane potentials (RMP), increased AP amplitudes and prolonged AP duration at 90% of the repolarization (APD90) (Figure 4C), although upstroke velocity was increased in all fibroblast-containing MTs compared to CMECs (Figure 4D). These differences between CMECFs and CMECs were confirmed by sharp electrode electrophysiology on whole MTs (Figures S4B and S4C). Incidentally, sharp electrodes detected cells with AP profiles similar to those reported previously as resulting from heterocellular coupling between CMs and CFs (Klesen et al., 2018Klesen A.

https://openalex.org/W3030556878,"A key goal of whole-genome sequencing for studies of human genetics is to interrogate all forms of variation, including single-nucleotide variants, small insertion or deletion (indel) variants and structural variants. However, tools and resources for the study of structural variants have lagged behind those for smaller variants. Here we used a scalable pipeline1 to map and characterize structural variants in 17,795 deeply sequenced human genomes. We publicly release site-frequency data to create the largest, to our knowledge, whole-genome-sequencing-based structural variant resource so far. On average, individuals carry 2.9 rare structural variants that alter coding regions; these variants affect the dosage or structure of 4.2 genes and account for 4.0-11.2% of rare high-impact coding alleles. Using a computational model, we estimate that structural variants account for 17.2% of rare alleles genome-wide, with predicted deleterious effects that are equivalent to loss-of-function coding alleles; approximately 90% of such structural variants are noncoding deletions (mean 19.1 per genome). We report 158,991 ultra-rare structural variants and show that 2% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale structural variants, nearly half of which are balanced or complex rearrangements. Finally, we infer the dosage sensitivity of genes and noncoding elements, and reveal trends that relate to element class and conservation. This work will help to guide the analysis and interpretation of structural variants in the era of whole-genome sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W3016425662,"The gut of healthy human neonates is usually devoid of viruses at birth, but quickly becomes colonized, which—in some cases—leads to gastrointestinal disorders1–4. Here we show that the assembly of the viral community in neonates takes place in distinct steps. Fluorescent staining of virus-like particles purified from infant meconium or early stool samples shows few or no particles, but by one month of life particle numbers increase to 109 per gram, and these numbers seem to persist throughout life5–7. We investigated the origin of these viral populations using shotgun metagenomic sequencing of virus-enriched preparations and whole microbial communities, followed by targeted microbiological analyses. Results indicate that, early after birth, pioneer bacteria colonize the infant gut and by one month prophages induced from these bacteria provide the predominant population of virus-like particles. By four months of life, identifiable viruses that replicate in human cells become more prominent. Multiple human viruses were more abundant in stool samples from babies who were exclusively fed on formula milk compared with those fed partially or fully on breast milk, paralleling reports that breast milk can be protective against viral infections8–10. Bacteriophage populations also differed depending on whether or not the infant was breastfed. We show that the colonization of the infant gut is stepwise, first mainly by temperate bacteriophages induced from pioneer bacteria, and later by viruses that replicate in human cells; this second phase is modulated by breastfeeding. The infant gut is colonized first by temperate bacteriophages induced from pioneer bacteria and later by viruses that replicate in human cells, the populations of which are modulated by breastfeeding."

Here we report three key findings regarding the assessment of candidate drug targets using human loss-of-function variants. First, even essential genes, in which loss-of-function variants are not tolerated, can be highly successful as targets of inhibitory drugs. Second, in most genes, loss-of-function variants are sufficiently rare that genotype-based ascertainment of homozygous or compound heterozygous 'knockout' humans will await sample sizes that are approximately 1,000 times those presently available, unless recruitment focuses on consanguineous individuals. Third, automated variant annotation and filtering are powerful, but manual curation remains crucial for removing artefacts, and is a prerequisite for recall-by-genotype efforts. Our results provide a roadmap for human knockout studies and should guide the interpretation of loss-of-function variants in drug development."

https://openalex.org/W3027643549,"Most proteins associate into multimeric complexes with specific architectures1,2, which often have functional properties such as cooperative ligand binding or allosteric regulation3. No detailed knowledge is available about how any multimer and its functions arose during evolution. Here we use ancestral protein reconstruction and biophysical assays to elucidate the origins of vertebrate haemoglobin, a heterotetramer of paralogous α- and β-subunits that mediates respiratory oxygen transport and exchange by cooperatively binding oxygen with moderate affinity. We show that modern haemoglobin evolved from an ancient monomer and characterize the historical 'missing link' through which the modern tetramer evolved-a noncooperative homodimer with high oxygen affinity that existed before the gene duplication that generated distinct α- and β-subunits. Reintroducing just two post-duplication historical substitutions into the ancestral protein is sufficient to cause strong tetramerization by creating favourable contacts with more ancient residues on the opposing subunit. These surface substitutions markedly reduce oxygen affinity and even confer cooperativity, because an ancient linkage between the oxygen binding site and the multimerization interface was already an intrinsic feature of the protein's structure. Our findings establish that evolution can produce new complex molecular structures and functions via simple genetic mechanisms that recruit existing biophysical features into higher-level architectures."
https://openalex.org/W3098514848,"Abstract Molecular spectroscopy offers opportunities for the exploration of the fundamental laws of nature and the search for new particle physics beyond the standard model 1–4 . Radioactive molecules—in which one or more of the atoms possesses a radioactive nucleus—can contain heavy and deformed nuclei, offering high sensitivity for investigating parity- and time-reversal-violation effects 5,6 . Radium monofluoride, RaF, is of particular interest because it is predicted to have an electronic structure appropriate for laser cooling 6 , thus paving the way for its use in high-precision spectroscopic studies. Furthermore, the effects of symmetry-violating nuclear moments are strongly enhanced 5,7–9 in molecules containing octupole-deformed radium isotopes 10,11 . However, the study of RaF has been impeded by the lack of stable isotopes of radium. Here we present an experimental approach to studying short-lived radioactive molecules, which allows us to measure molecules with lifetimes of just tens of milliseconds. Energetically low-lying electronic states were measured for different isotopically pure RaF molecules using collinear resonance ionisation at the ISOLDE ion-beam facility at CERN. Our results provide evidence of the existence of a suitable laser-cooling scheme for these molecules and represent a key step towards high-precision studies in these systems. Our findings will enable further studies of short-lived radioactive molecules for fundamental physics research."

Ample studies on wildfire detection and severity mapping are available but what remains a challenge is the accurate mapping of burnt areas in heterogenous landscapes. In this study, we tested which spectral bands contributed most to burnt area detection when using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 multispectral sensors in two study sites. Post-fire Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8 images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. We found out that, the NIR, Red, Red-edge and Blue spectral bands contributed most to burned area detection when using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A. We found out that, Landsat 8 had a higher classification accuracy (OA = 0.92, Kappa = 0.85 and TSS = 0.84)) in study site 1 as compared to Sentinel-2 (OA = 0.86, Kappa = 0.74 and TSS = 0.76). In study site 2, Sentinel-2 had a slightly higher classification accuracy (OA = 0.89, Kappa = 0.67 and TSS = 0.64) which was comparable to that of Landsat 8 (OA = 0.85, Kappa = 0.50 and TSS = 0.41).

Results showed that almost half (k = 224) of all sampled primary effect sizes could not be reproduced based on the reported information in the meta-analysis, mostly because of incomplete or missing information on how effect sizes from primary studies were selected and computed. Overall, this led to small discrepancies in the computation of mean effect sizes, confidence intervals and heterogeneity estimates in 13 out of 33 meta-analyses.

https://openalex.org/W3021537670,"After severe brain injury, it can be difficult to determine the state of consciousness of a patient, to determine whether the patient is unresponsive or perhaps minimally conscious1, and to predict whether they will recover. These diagnoses and prognoses are crucial, as they determine therapeutic strategies such as pain management, and can underlie end-of-life decisions2,3. Nevertheless, there is an error rate of up to 40% in determining the state of consciousness in patients with brain injuries4,5. Olfaction relies on brain structures that are involved in the basic mechanisms of arousal6, and we therefore hypothesized that it may serve as a biomarker for consciousness7. Here we use a non-verbal non-task-dependent measure known as the sniff response8–11 to determine consciousness in patients with brain injuries. By measuring odorant-dependent sniffing, we gain a sensitive measure of olfactory function10–15. We measured the sniff response repeatedly over time in patients with severe brain injuries and found that sniff responses significantly discriminated between unresponsive and minimally conscious states at the group level. Notably, at the single-patient level, if an unresponsive patient had a sniff response, this assured future regaining of consciousness. In addition, olfactory sniff responses were associated with long-term survival rates. These results highlight the importance of olfaction in human brain function, and provide an accessible tool that signals consciousness and recovery in patients with brain injuries. Odorant-dependent sniff responses predicted the long-term survival rates of patients with severe brain injury, and discriminated between individuals who were unresponsive and in minimally conscious states."
https://openalex.org/W3030366785,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor outcomes associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which silences transcription through trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and has emerged as an important therapeutic target with inhibitors targeting its methyltransferase activity under clinical investigation. Here, we show that EZH2 has a non-catalytic and PRC2-independent role in stabilizing DDB2 to promote nucleotide excision repair (NER) and govern cisplatin resistance in SCLC. Using a synthetic lethality screen, we identified important regulators of cisplatin resistance in SCLC cells, including EZH2. EZH2 depletion causes cellular cisplatin and UV hypersensitivity in an epistatic manner with DDB1–DDB2. EZH2 complexes with DDB1–DDB2 and promotes DDB2 stability by impairing its ubiquitination independent of methyltransferase activity or PRC2, thereby facilitating DDB2 localization to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer crosslinks to govern their repair. Furthermore, targeting EZH2 for depletion with DZNep strongly sensitizes SCLC cells and tumors to cisplatin. Our findings reveal a non-catalytic and PRC2-independent function for EZH2 in promoting NER through DDB2 stabilization, suggesting a rationale for targeting EZH2 beyond its catalytic activity for overcoming cisplatin resistance in SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3031393202,"Bite marks provide direct evidence for trophic interactions and competition in the fossil record. However, variations in paleoecological dynamics, such as trophic relationships, feeding behavior, and food availability, govern the frequency of these traces. Theropod bite marks are particularly rare, suggesting that members of this clade might not often focus on bone as a resource, instead preferentially targeting softer tissues. Here, we present an unusually large sample of theropod bite marks from the Upper Jurassic Mygatt-Moore Quarry (MMQ). We surveyed 2,368 vertebrate fossils from MMQ in this analysis, with 684 specimens (28.885% of the sample) preserving at least one theropod bite mark. This is substantially higher than in other dinosaur-dominated assemblages, including contemporaneous localities from the Morrison Formation. Observed bite marks include punctures, scores, furrows, pits, and striations. Striated marks are particularly useful, diagnostic traces generated by the denticles of ziphodont teeth, because the spacing of these features can be used to provide minimum estimates of trace maker size. In the MMQ assemblage, most of the striations are consistent with denticles of the two largest predators known from the site: Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus. One of the bite marks suggests that a substantially larger theropod was possibly present at the site and are consistent with large theropods known from other Morrison Formation assemblages (either an unusually large Allosaurus or a separate, large-bodied taxon such as Saurophaganax or Torvosaurus). The distribution of the bite marks on skeletal elements, particularly those found on other theropods, suggest that they potentially preserve evidence of scavenging, rather than active predation. Given the relative abundances of the MMQ carnivores, partnered with the size-estimates based on the striated bite marks, the feeding trace assemblage likely preserves the first evidence of cannibalism in Allosaurus."

High-throughput screening can greatly facilitate the discovery of drugs for these targets.

These condensates are assembled via phase separation driven by multivalent interactions (17Banani S.F. Lee H.O. Hyman A.A. Rosen M.K.

Generally, the constituents of various condensates are divided into two groups: one group is composed of scaffolds, which are essential for the assembly of these condensates and the other group is composed of clients, which are dispensable for the formation of the condensates but can partition into these condensates via direct or indirect binding to the scaffolds (19Banani S.F. Rice A.M. Peeples W.B. Lin Y. Jain S. Parker R. Rosen M.K. Compositional control of phase-separated cellular bodies.Cell. 2016; 166 (27374333): 651-66310.1016/j.cell.2016.06.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Inspired by the scaffold-client model, we explored the possibility of using a similar architecture to implement a system for assaying modification-dependent and -independent biomolecular interactions, which can be used for efficient discovery of drugs targeting these biomolecular interactions and the associated enzymes. Our system consists of two parts: 1) the scaffold, which drives the formation of phase-separated condensates, and 2) the biomolecular interaction of interest. One interacting partner is fused with the scaffold to generate a composite scaffold and hence is automatically enriched in the condensates, and the other partner (defined as the client) is recruited to the condensates via specific interactions. For visualization, the composite scaffold and the client are labeled with different fluorescent probes such as GFP and mCherry. Thus, the biomolecular interaction of interest is assessed by the enrichment of the mCherry-fused client within the GFP-labeled phase-separated condensates. This strategy is called phase-separated condensate-aided enrichment of biomolecular interactions in test tubes (CEBIT). CEBIT can also be tailored to measure the activities of enzymes modifying biomolecules. We extensively validated CEBIT using some representative protein–protein interaction pairs. Subsequently, we tailored CEBIT to probe molecular modifications and the associated enzymes. CEBIT is very amenable for high-throughput screening. Using the MDM2/p53 interaction and the SUV39H1-mediated histone 3 lysine 9 methylation reaction as two test cases, we successfully identified inhibitors of the MDM2/p53 interaction and of SUV39H1 from a commercial compound library. CEBIT is a simple and versatile method, which will have many applications in basic and translational research. First, we sought to establish some multivalent scaffolds that can robustly drive the formation of condensates via phase separation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that interactions between linear and/or dendrimeric (branched) multivalent modular proteins can result in phase separation (18Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein SmF is known to form a stable tetradecameric (referred to as 14-meric for simplicity hereafter) complex upon expression alone in bacteria (23Collins B.M. Cubeddu L. Naidoo N. Harrop S.J. Kornfeld G.D. Dawes I.W. Curmi P.M. Mabbutt B.C. Homomeric ring assemblies of eukaryotic Sm proteins have affinity for both RNA and DNA: crystal structure of an oligomeric complex of yeast SmF.J. Biol.

We tested whether it was possible to reliably achieve dendrimeric multivalence of various domains/motifs when they were fused to SmF. We created two fusion proteins, one with GFP fused to the C terminus of SmF (SmF-GFP) and the other with the second Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of human NCK1 fused to the C terminus of SmF-GFP (SmF-GFP-SH3). Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis indicated that SmF-GFP also formed a 14-meric complex in solution, and further fusion of a SH3 domain to SmF-GFP did not alter the 14-meric status (Fig. 1a). Therefore, we concluded that SmF is a robust 14-meric protein for multimerizing protein domains/motifs. Similarly, we investigated the Bacillus subtilis protein Hfq (BsHfq), which is known to form a stable hexameric complex (24Tatsuhiko S. Seiki B. Mai F. Gota K. Takashi K. Kouji N. Crystal structure of Hfq from Bacillus subtilis in complex with SELEX-derived RNA aptamer: insight into RNA-binding properties of bacterial Hfq.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 1856-186710.1093/nar/gkr892Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We confirmed that BsHfq can reliably achieve dendrimeric multivalence of fused domains/motifs (Fig. S1). Next, we investigated whether multimerized protein–protein interaction pairs, created by fusion to SmF, could mediate phase separation. We selected three model interaction pairs: 1) the second SH3 domain of human NCK1 and the proline-rich motif (abbreviated to PRM) of DLGAP2 (18Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S. Chen B. Guo L.

Li T. Rupasinghe C. Paredes A. Caspers N. Spaller M.R. A thermodynamic ligand binding study of the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) from the mammalian neuronal protein PSD-95.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (17474715): 6340-635210.1021/bi062088kCrossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); and 3) SUMO3 and the SUMO3 interacting motif (abbreviated to SIM) (19Banani S.F. Rice A.M. Peeples W.B. Lin Y. Jain S. Parker R. Rosen M.K. Compositional control of phase-separated cellular bodies.Cell. 2016; 166 (27374333): 651-66310.1016/j.cell.2016.06.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In each interaction pair, one partner was fused to SmF-GFP and the other was fused to SmF-mCherry (Fig. 1b). The resulting proteins are abbreviated as (g/mDOMAIN/MOTIF NAME)14 for simplicity, in which g/m stands for GFP/mCherry and the subscript 14 represents the 14-meric status of the protein complexes. We carried out cross-mixing reactions between (gSH3)14, (gPDZ)14, or (gSUMO3)14 and (mPRM)14, (mPV)14, or (mSIM)14. All three cognate multivalent protein–protein interaction pairs, but not the noninteracting pairs, gave rise to marked phase separation (Fig. 1b). We next carried out phase-separation assays of (gSH3)14 and (mPRM)14 at 1:1 molar ratio over a large module concentration range, 100 nm to 10 μm. Numerous droplets formed at module concentrations as low as 100 nm (Fig. 1c). We further fused all binary combinations of the three modules, SH3, PDZ, and SUMO3, to the C terminus of SmF-GFP to yield six composite scaffolds, in which two different interacting domains are present in two different orders (Fig. 1d). Cross-mixing the six proteins with (mPRM)14, (mPV)14, or (mSIM)14 showed that phase separation occurs as long as and only if a cognate multivalent protein–protein interaction pair is present (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that the presence of a noncognate binding module does not appreciably affect the ability of multivalent cognate protein–protein interaction pairs to drive phase separation. Collectively, these data further revealed the robustness of SmF as a scaffold to multimerize protein–protein interaction pairs for inducing phase separation. As revealed by Banani et al. (19Banani S.F. Rice A.M. Peeples W.B. Lin Y. Jain S. Parker R. Rosen M.K. Compositional control of phase-separated cellular bodies.Cell. 2016; 166 (27374333): 651-66310.1016/j.cell.2016.06.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) clients are recruited into scaffold-induced condensates by interacting with free binding sites on the scaffolds. We wondered whether this principle could be used to study biomolecular interactions of interest. To test this, we used (gSH3-PDZ)14 (abbreviation for SmF-GFP-SH3-PDZ, Fig. 2a) and (gPRM)14 to drive phase separation, presumably via the multivalent SH3/PRM interaction, and we simultaneously used the mCherry-fused PDZ ligand, KKETPV (abbreviated to mPV, Fig. 2a), as a client to assess the interaction between PDZ and KKETPV (Fig. 2a). (gSH3-PDZ)14 and (gPRM)14 formed green condensates (Fig. 2b, lower panels). mPV was recruited into these droplets, as shown by the enriched mCherry signal (Fig. 2b, upper left panel). To test whether the recruitment is reversible, we used a peptide, KKETAV, which has a higher affinity for PDZ than KKETPV (25Saro D. Li T. Rupasinghe C. Paredes A. Caspers N. Spaller M.R. A thermodynamic ligand binding study of the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) from the mammalian neuronal protein PSD-95.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (17474715): 6340-635210.1021/bi062088kCrossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), to compete with mPV. The enrichment of mPV was gradually reduced by increasing concentrations of the competing peptide (Fig. 2b, red), which was confirmed by quantification of the mCherry signal in the green droplets (Fig. 2c). These results indicated that mPV was recruited into the condensates via binding to PDZ. FKBP/FRB is a well-characterized high-affinity interaction that is mediated by rapamycin (26Banaszynski L.A. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J. Characterization of the FKBP-rapamycin-FRB ternary complex.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127 (15796538): 4715-472110.1021/ja043277yCrossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We wondered whether our system can assay similar interactions. We generated a composite scaffold (gSH3-FKBP)14 (abbreviation for SmF-GFP-SH3-FKBP) and the corresponding client mFRB (abbreviation for mCherry-FRB) (Fig. 2d). (gSH3-FKBP)14 readily underwent phase separation with (gPRM)14. Additionally, in the presence of increasing concentrations of rapamycin, but not the negative control ampicillin, recruitment of mFRB into the green droplets increased in parallel, as indicated by the enhanced mCherry signal (Fig. 2, e and f). Subsequently we focused on two well-known cancer-related targets, MDM2 and XIAP. MDM2, an endogenous inhibitor of the tumor suppressor protein p53, binds to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 and mediates its degradation (27Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain.Science. 1996; 274 (8875929): 948-95310.1126/science.274.5289.948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 28Wang S.

Med. 2017; 7: a02624510.1101/cshperspect.a026245Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). XIAP is a suppressor of the proapoptotic protein caspase-9. The suppression is alleviated by the binding of Smac to the Bir3 domain of XIAP (29Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Structural basis for binding of Smac/DIABLO to the XIAP BIR3 domain.Nature. 2000; 408 (11140637): 1004-100810.1038/35050006Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Importantly, potent inhibitors of the MDM2/p53 interaction and the Smac/XIAP interaction have been developed (3Flygare J.A. Beresini M. Budha N. Chan H. Chan I.T. Cheeti S. Cohen F. Deshayes K.

We chose the two interactions to assess the feasibility of using CEBIT for drug discovery. The MDM2-binding region of p53 was fused with (gSH3)14 to generate the composite scaffold (gSH3-p53)14 and MDM2 was labeled with mCherry (abbreviated to mMDM2) as the client (Fig. 2g). (gSH3-p53)14 readily underwent phase separation with (gPRM)14 (Fig. 2h, green channels). As the concentration of mMDM2 increased, its enrichment in the green condensates was significantly increased. This enrichment was significantly reduced by two potent MDM2 inhibitors, MI773 and RG7388 (Fig. 2, h and i). Similarly, the XIAP-binding region of Smac was fused to the N terminus of SmF-SH3 to generate (Smac-SH3)14 (abbreviated for Smac-SmF-SH3) as a composite scaffold, and the Bir3 domain of XIAP was tagged by SNAP as the client (Fig. S2a). Phase separation of (Smac-SH3)14 and (gPRM)14 formed green droplets, into which SNAP-surface 546-labeled SNAP-XIAP was recruited (Fig. S2b). This recruitment was blocked by the XIAP inhibitor GDC-0152 (Fig. S2, b and c). Taken together, these data demonstrate that CEBIT is competent for studying various protein–protein interactions by conjugating one member of the target pairs to a phase-separated scaffold and the other to a fluorescent tag as the client. Next, we asked whether CEBIT can be used in high-throughput screening for drug discovery. We tested the effects of compounds in a commercial library on the MDM2/p53 interaction with the above established assay (Fig. 2, g–i). The library contains 2148 compounds, including five known inhibitors of MDM2/p53, Nutlin-3, Nutlin-3a, Nutlin-3b, YH239-EE, and MI773. The activity of each compound was determined by assessing the enrichment of mMDM2 in the p53-containing droplets. Most compounds did not inhibit the recruitment of mMDM2. However, all five known MDM2 inhibitors (Fig. 3a, 5 red dots) significantly reduced the mCherry signal and were the most effective inhibitors among all the compounds tested. Treatment with the five known inhibitors resulted in mCherry signals well over 4 S.D. below the mean, which indicates that the screening process is effective. In addition, we found another compound, VER (abbreviation of VER155008, Fig. 3a, green dot), which also attenuated mMDM2 enrichment, suggesting that it is a potential novel MDM2/p53 inhibitor. Fluorescence images confirmed that these inhibitors decreased the enrichment of mMDM2 in the phase-separated droplets (Fig. 3b). The Z factor is a critical quality control parameter for high-throughput screening assays and it was 0.52 for our screen (Fig. 3a), which suggests that our assay is suitable for high-throughput screening (32Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4 (10838414): 67-7310.1177/108705719900400206Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar). An improved Z value (Z' = 0.72) was obtained when we evaluated the enrichment of MDM2-SNAP–labeled with SNAP-Surface 546 in the droplets with a microplate reader after removal of the surrounding bulk solution (Fig. S3). Detailed dose-response analysis confirmed the inhibitory activities of these screening hits (Fig. 3c and Fig. S4). Next, a competitive fluorescence polarization (FP) assay using a high affinity fluorescent probe (33Czarna A. Popowicz G.M. Pecak A. Wolf S. Dubin G. Holak T.A. High affinity interaction of the p53 peptide-analogue with human Mdm2 and Mdmx.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8 (19305137): 1176-118410.4161/cc.8.8.8185Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was performed to confirm the inhibitory effect of the newly identified compound VER on the MDM2/p53 interaction. Two known MDM2 inhibitors, MI773 and Nutlin-3b, were used as controls. The control inhibitors caused an apparent decrease in polarization as their concentration increased, but VER failed to do so (Fig. 3d). The observation that CEBIT, but not fluorescence polarization, detected the inhibitory effect of VER on the MDM2/p53 interaction suggested that the former technique is more sensitive than the latter in this experimental setting. Collectively, these data revealed that CEBIT has the potential for drug discovery via high-throughput screening. Regulated chemical modifications, including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, of various biomacromolecules, such as proteins, RNAs, and DNAs, are extremely important for all aspects of biology. Aberrant modifications and the associated enzymes are attractive therapeutic targets. However, efficient high-throughput screening assays that are generally applicable to the discovery of drugs modulating these enzymes are still lacking. These modifications can often be recognized by specific effector proteins via their reader domains. We postulated that CEBIT can be adopted for examining these modifications and hence the activities of the associated modifying enzymes. Our strategy is to confine specific reader domains in phase-separated condensates via fusion to the scaffold and use the modification-dependent recruitment of cognate substrates as the readout for the enzymatic activities of interest. Here we used methylation of biomacromolecules (proteins, RNAs, and DNAs) as examples to test our idea. Protein lysine methylation plays important roles in various biological pathways. For example, methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) is a hallmark of heterochromatin in cells. We wonder whether this modification can be detected with CEBIT. To this end, we fused the human HP1β chromo domain (CD), a well-known reader domain of H3K9me (34Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T.

https://openalex.org/W3029621432,"Marine microbial plankton hold high structural and functional diversity, however, high-resolution data are lacking in a large part of the Global Ocean, such as in subpolar areas of the SW Atlantic. The Burdwood Bank (BB) is a submerged plateau (average depth 100 m) that constitutes the westernmost segment of the North Scotia Ridge (54°-55°S; 56°-62°W). The BB hosts rich benthic biodiversity in low chlorophyll waters of the southern Patagonian Shelf, Argentina, declared Namuncurá Marine Protected Area (NMPA) in 2013. So far, the pelagic microorganisms above the bank have not been described. During austral summer 2016, we assessed the microbial plankton (0.2-200 μm cell size) biomass and their taxonomical and functional diversity along a longitudinal transect (54.2-55.3°S, 58-68°W) from the Beagle Channel (BC) to the BB, characterized by contrasting hydrography. Results displayed a marked zonation in the composition and structure of the microbial communities. The biomass of phytoplankton >5 μm was 28 times higher in the BC, attributed mainly to large diatom blooms, than in oceanic waters above the BB, where the small coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and flagellates <10 μm dominated. In turn, the biomass of microheterotrophs above the BB doubled the biomass in the BC due to large ciliates. Notably, toxic phytoplankton species and their phycotoxins were detected, in particular high abundance of Dinophysis acuminata and pectenotoxins above the bank, highlighting their presence in open subpolar regions. Picophytoplankton (<2 μm), including Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, were remarkably important above the BB, both at surface and deep waters (up to 150 m). Their biomass surpassed by 5 times that of phytoplankton > 5 μm, emphasizing the importance of small-sized phytoplankton in low chlorophyll waters. The homogeneous water column and high retention above the bank seem to favor the development of abundant picophytoplankton and microzooplankton communities. Overall, our findings unfold the plankton configuration in the Southern Patagonian Shelf, ascribed as a sink for anthropogenic CO2, and highlight the diverse ecological traits that microorganisms develop to adjust their yield to changing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3030611233,"Background Excess weight can increase absenteeism of workers and can have a negative influence on their productivity. Current evidence on this association is mostly based on cross-sectional data and there is little evidence concerning the longitudinal relationship between obesity, and disability with workplace absenteeism. Further, gender differences in this association have often ignored in the existing literature. Objectives This study aims to examine gender differences in the longitudinal association between obesity, and disability with absenteeism in the workplace. Methods Data from thirteen waves (2006 to 2018) of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey were pooled, resulting in 117,769 observations for 19,851 adult employees. The Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression model was deployed to investigate the links between obesity, and disability with workplace absenteeism for the total sample and stratified by gender. Results The findings showed that overweight (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR]: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–1.47), obesity (IRR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.12–1.64) and disability (IRR: 2.83, 95% CI: 2.36–3.38) were associated with prolonged workplace absenteeism irrespective of gender. This study found that the multiplicative interaction between weight status and gender is significantly associated with absenteeism. The results reveal that the rate of absenteeism was 2.79 times (IRR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.96–3.97) and 1.73 times (IRR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.20–2.48) higher among overweight and obese women than male counterparts, respectively. Moreover, this study found that the weight status of male workers is not associated with absenteeism. However, disability (IRR: 3.14, 95% CI: 2.43–4.05) is positively associated with longer days of absence among male workers. Finally, the study results showed that the rate of absenteeism is 1.82 (IRR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.36–2.44), 1.61 (IRR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.21–2.13), and 2.63 (IRR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.99–3.48) times higher among overweight, obese, and female workers with a disability, respectively, compared with their lower weight counterparts. Conclusions Workplace absenteeism is significantly associated with overweight and obesity among Australian workers. An active workplace health promotion program is very important for weight management of overweight and obese workers and thus to reduce workplace absenteeism.

On the one hand, these targets may be linked to unwanted side effects, but on the other, they may achieve a combined desired effect (polypharmacology) or represent multiple diseases (drug repositioning). With the growth of 3D structures of drug-target complexes, it is today possible to study drug promiscuity at the structural level and to screen vast amounts of drug-target interactions to predict side effects, polypharmacological potential, and repositioning opportunities. Here, we pursue such an approach to identify drugs inactivating B-cells, whose dysregulation can function as a driver of autoimmune diseases. Screening over 500 kinases, we identified 22 candidate targets, whose knock out impeded the activation of B-cells. Among these 22 is the gene KDR, whose gene product VEGFR2 is a prominent cancer target with anti-VEGFR2 drugs on the market for over a decade. The main result of this paper is that structure-based drug repositioning for the identified kinase targets identified the cancer drug ibrutinib as micromolar VEGFR2 inhibitor with a very high therapeutic index in B-cell inactivation. These findings prove that ibrutinib is not only acting on the Bruton's tyrosine kinase BTK, against which it was designed. Instead, it may be a polypharmacological drug, which additionally targets angiogenesis via inhibition of VEGFR2. Therefore ibrutinib carries potential to treat other VEGFR2 associated disease. Structure-based drug repositioning explains ibrutinib's anti VEGFR2 action through the conservation of a specific pattern of interactions of the drug with BTK and VEGFR2. Overall, structure-based drug repositioning was able to predict these findings at a fraction of the time and cost of a conventional screen."

Bacterial repeats in toxin (RTX) cytolysins form a prominent group of proteins that are synthesized as inactive protoxins and undergo posttranslational acylation on ε-amino groups of two internal conserved lysine residues by co-expressed toxin-activating acyltransferases. Here, we investigated how the chemical nature, position, and number of bound acyl chains govern the activities of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA), Escherichia coli α-hemolysin (HlyA), and Kingella kingae cytotoxin (RtxA). We found that the three protoxins are acylated in the same E. coli cell background by each of the CyaC, HlyC, and RtxC acyltransferases. We also noted that the acyltransferase selects from the bacterial pool of acyl–acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) an acyl chain of a specific length for covalent linkage to the protoxin. The acyltransferase also selects whether both or only one of two conserved lysine residues of the protoxin will be posttranslationally acylated. Functional assays revealed that RtxA has to be modified by 14-carbon fatty acyl chains to be biologically active, that HlyA remains active also when modified by 16-carbon acyl chains, and that CyaA is activated exclusively by 16-carbon acyl chains. These results suggest that the RTX toxin molecules are structurally adapted to the length of the acyl chains used for modification of their acylated lysine residue in the second, more conserved acylation site.

Similarly, the heterologously HlyC- or CyaC-activated Pasteurella hemolytica leukotoxin LktA exhibited the same activity and target cell specificity as the LktA activated by its cognate LktC acyltransferase. Nevertheless, the activation was not reciprocal, as the LktC-activated HlyA and CyaA produced in E. coli were neither hemolytic nor cytotoxic (26Forestier C. Welch R.A. Nonreciprocal complementation of the hlyC lktC genes of the Escherichia coli hemolysin and Pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin determinants.Infect.

However, it has not been determined why some RTX protoxins are efficiently cross-activated by heterologous acyltransferases and some are not. Here, we analyzed the activation of the CyaA, HlyA, and RtxA toxins, each acylated by one of the three CyaC, HlyC, or RtxC acyltransferases and produced in the same E. coli cell background, so as to eliminate the potential impact of differences in acyl-ACP pool composition of the original producer bacteria. The results reveal that it is the RTXC acyltransferase enzyme that selects the type of the acyl chain of adapted length that is covalently linked to the proRTXA protein, and the acyltransferase also selects whether a single lysine residue or both modification sites of proRTXA will be posttranslationally acylated, thereby conferring the biological activity on the RTX toxin. To test the acyl residue and acylation site selectivity of the three homologous RTX toxin–activating acyltransferases, we produced the nine pairwise combinations of the three protoxins proCyaA, proHlyA, and proRtxA with the three acyltransferase enzymes CyaC, HlyC, and RtxC, respectively, in the same E. coli cell background. For this purpose, the expression signals of the pT7CACT1 plasmid for production of CyaC-activated CyaA toxin (28Osicka R. Osicková A. Basar T. Guermonprez P. Rojas M. Leclerc C. Sebo P.

The cyaC ORF in pT7CACT1 was replaced from start to stop codon by the coding sequences of the hlyC or rtxC genes, and the cyaA ORF was replaced by hlyA- or rtxA-coding sequences, respectively (Fig. 1A). In addition, the hlyA and rtxA genes were fused in frame at the 3′ terminus to a sequence encoding a double-hexahistidine purification tag. The obtained set of nine constructs was used to produce the nine resulting RTXC-acylated RTXA toxins in E. coli BL21 cells. These were purified close to homogeneity from urea-solubilized inclusion bodies by affinity chromatography on calmodulin-Sepharose (CyaA proteins) or Ni-NTA agarose (HlyA and RtxA proteins) (Fig. 1B). To analyze the acylation pattern of the nine RTXA variants, digests of the purified proteins were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (LC FT-ICR MS). As summarized in Table 1, the CyaACyaC toxin activated by its cognate acyltransferase CyaC exhibited a predominant acylation with palmitoyl (C16:0) and palmitoleyl (C16:1) chains at the Lys-860 (∼66%) and Lys-983 (∼88%) residues. A small proportion of the CyaACyaC molecules was also modified by myristoyl (C14:0) and octadecenoyl (C18:1) chains linked to the Lys-860 (∼3%) and Lys-983 (∼11%) residues (Table 1). Only ∼31% of the Lys-860 residues remained unacylated by CyaC, whereas the Lys-983 residue of CyaACyaC was acylated nearly completely (∼99%). In contrast, when proCyaA was produced in the presence of HlyC or RtxC, only minimal (1% in CyaAHlyC) or no (0% in CyaARtxC) acylation of the Lys-860 residue in the first acylation site of CyaA was detected (Table 1). Hence, the heterologous acyltransferases recognized the first acylation site of CyaA (Fig. 1C) with negligible efficacy. In contrast, the second acylation site of CyaA (Fig. 1C) was well-recognized by HlyC and RtxC acyltransferases that efficiently acylated its Lys-983 residue. However, the HlyC and RtxC selected almost exclusively the shorter myristoyl (C14:0) and hydroxymyristoyl (C14:0-OH) chains (∼77% in CyaAHlyC and ∼85% in CyaARtxC) for modification of the Lys-983 residue of CyaA (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab As further documented in Table 1, the HlyAHlyC toxin was efficiently modified by its cognate acyltransferase HlyC with the C14:0 and C14:0-OH acyl chains at the Lys-564 (∼84%) and Lys-690 (∼93%) residues. Only a small proportion of the HlyAHlyC molecules was acylated with the C12:0, C12:0-OH, C16:0, and C16:1 chains (∼6% at Lys-564 and 7% at Lys-690) or remained unacylated at the Lys-564 residue (∼10%) (Table 1). The C14:0 and C14:0-OH chains were also the major acyl groups attached to the Lys-564 (∼26%) and Lys-690 (∼95%) residues, when HlyA was modified by the heterologous acyltransferase RtxC (Table 1). However, RtxC modified the first acylation site of HlyA with lower efficiency than HlyC, and ∼73% of the Lys-564 residues remained unacylated (Table 1). In contrast, the heterologous acyltransferase CyaC acylated the Lys-690 residues of the HlyA molecules almost exclusively with the C16:0 and C16:1 (∼90%) acyl chains and partially with C18:1 (∼10%), whereas the Lys-564 residues were partially modified with the C16:0 and C16:1 acyl groups (∼7%) or remained unacylated (∼93%). Finally, the RtxA cytotoxin was efficiently modified by its cognate acyltransferase RtxC and also by the heterologous acyltransferase HlyC at the Lys-689 residue with the C14:0 and C14:0-OH acyl chains (∼91% in RtxARtxC and ∼96% in RtxAHlyC) (Table 1). In contrast, the heterologous acyltransferase CyaC predominantly acylated the Lys-689 residue of RtxA with the C16:0 and C16:1 acyl groups (∼89%) (Table 1). On the other hand, the Lys-558 residue of the RtxA variants was only residually modified with the C14:0 and C14:0-OH chains (∼2% in RtxARtxC and ∼3% in RtxAHlyC) or remained completely unacylated (RtxACyaC) (Table 1). All of these results demonstrated that the different RTXC acyltransferases exhibit a varying selectivity for acyls of various lengths. CyaC selected from the E. coli acyl-ACP pool almost exclusively the C16:0 and C16:1 acyl chains for acylation of the cognate proCyaA or of the heterologous proHlyA and proRtxA substrates. In contrast, the HlyC and RtxC acyltransferases selected nearly exclusively the shorter C14:0 and C14:0-OH chains for acylation of all three proRTXA substrates (Table 1). This reveals that it is the RTXC acyltransferase enzyme that selects the length of the acyl chain that it transfers to the RTXA substrate protein. Moreover, the data showed that the RTXC enzymes promiscuously and quite efficiently recognize and modify the second, more conserved acylation sites (Fig. 1C) of heterologous proRTXA substrates, whereas the recognition and acylation of the first acylation sites in heterologous proRTXA substrates was nil or inefficient. The set of nine toxins with defined numbers and lengths of attached acyl chains enabled us to assess how the single or double acylation and the length of the attached acyl chains affect the biological activities of these proteins. For the three differently acylated CyaA variants, we first determined their capacity to bind, penetrate, and lyse sheep erythrocytes, respectively, using red blood cells as surrogate target cells lacking the CyaA receptor CR3. As documented in Fig. 2A, compared with double acylation of the CyaACyaC protein by predominantly the C16:0 and/or C16:1 chains, monoacylation of the Lys-983 residue by predominantly the C14:0 or C14:0-OH chains reduced the relative capacity of CyaAHlyC (by ∼62%) and CyaARtxC (by ∼70%) to bind erythrocytes. The modification by the C14 acyls decreased even more the relative cell-invasive capacity of both toxin variants (by ∼94%) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, at the rather high concentration of 10 µg/ml that was used, the CyaAHlyC and CyaARtxC proteins were unable to provoke any lysis of erythrocytes over time, whereas complete erythrocyte lysis was provoked by the same amount of CyaACyaC within 5 h of incubation (Fig. 2B). The relative AC-translocating and lytic capacities of the CyaAHlyC and CyaARtxC proteins remained low even when their input concentration was increased 2.5-fold over that of CyaACyaC to achieve binding of equal amounts of the three CyaA variants to erythrocyte cells (Fig. 2, C and D). The C14:0 or C14:0-OH monoacylated CyaAHlyC and CyaARtxC toxins bound with a reduced capacity (∼53 and ∼60% of CyaACyaC binding) also to mouse J774A.1 macrophages that express the CyaA receptor CR3 (Fig. 2E). However, the binding of CyaAHlyC and CyaARtxC to J774A.1 cells was CR3 receptor–specific, as it could be blocked by the competing antibody M1/70 that binds the CD11b subunit of CR3 (29Guermonprez P.

Nevertheless, compared with the C16 biacylated CyaACyaC, the C14 monoacylated CyaAHlyC and CyaARtxC proteins were strongly impaired in their capacity to translocate the AC domain into the cytosol of J774A.1 cells to elevate the intracellular cAMP levels (Fig. 2F). This functional defect on J774A.1 cells was most likely not due to the lack of acylation of the Lys-860 residue of the CyaAHlyC and CyaARtxC toxins, as a CyaA-K860R mutant acylated by CyaC only on the Lys-983 residue (17Masin J. Basler M. Knapp O. El-Azami-El-Idrissi M. Maier E. Konopasek I. Benz R. Leclerc C. Sebo P. Acylation of lysine 860 allows tight binding and cytotoxicity of Bordetella adenylate cyclase on CD11b-expressing cells.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16171390): 12759-1276610.1021/bi050459bCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) exhibited similar capacity to bind (Fig. 2E) and translocate its AC domain (Fig. 2F) into J774A.1 cells as the intact doubly acylated CyaACyaC toxin. Hence, the low cell-invasive activity of the monoacylated CyaAHlyC and CyaARtxC proteins was rather due to the modification of the Lys-983 residue by the shorter C14 acyl chains, which conferred a much lower specific membrane penetration capacity on CyaA than the modification of the Lys-983 residue by the C16 acyl chains. In agreement with the residual cytolytic capacity on erythrocytes, the CyaAHlyC and C"

We analyze an original dataset of 679 ENGOs participating in global environmental conventions in the mid-2010s, and we apply quantitative content analysis to ENGO mission statements to produce an inductive typology of global environmental discourse. Discourse categories are combined with ENGO attribute data to visualize the political topology of this globally-networked ENGO sector. Our results confirm some common assertions and provide new insights. ENGOs are more diverse than conventionally recognized. Quantitative evidence confirms strong North-South disparities in human and financial resources. Four primary discourses are identified: Environmental Management, Climate Politics, Environmental Justice, and Ecological Modernization. We compare our typology to existing literature, where Climate Politics and Environmental Justice are under-appreciated, and we discuss ways to expand on the data and methods of this study. Synoptic empirical ENGO research is essential to accurately understanding the ENGO sector and global environmental politics."
https://openalex.org/W3031967969,"The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel is a heat-activated cation channel that plays a crucial role in ambient temperature detection and thermal homeostasis. Although several structural features of TRPV1 have been shown to be involved in heat-induced activation of the gating process, the physiological significance of only a few of these key elements has been evaluated in an evolutionary context. Here, using transient expression in HEK293 cells, electrophysiological recordings, and molecular modeling, we show that the pore turret contains both structural and functional determinants that set the heat activation thresholds of distinct TRPV1 orthologs in mammals whose body temperatures fluctuate widely. We found that TRPV1 from the bat Carollia brevicauda exhibits a lower threshold temperature of channel activation than does its human ortholog and three bat-specific amino acid substitutions located in the pore turret are sufficient to determine this threshold temperature. Furthermore, the structure of the TRPV1 pore turret appears to be of physiological and evolutionary significance for differentiating the heat-activated threshold among species-specific TRPV1 orthologs. These findings support a role for the TRPV1 pore turret in tuning the heat-activated threshold, and they suggest that its evolution was driven by adaption to specific physiological traits among mammals exposed to variable temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W3032093340,"Antarctic cryptoendolithic communities are self-supporting borderline ecosystems spreading across the extreme conditions of the Antarctic desert and represent the predominant life-form in the ice-free areas of McMurdo Dry Valleys, accounted as the closest terrestrial Martian analogue. Components of these communities are highly adapted extremophiles and extreme-tolerant microorganisms, among the most resistant known to date. Recently, studies investigated biodiversity and community composition in these ecosystems but the metabolic activity of the metacommunity has never been investigated. Using an untargeted metabolomics, we explored stress-response of communities spreading in two sites of the same location, subjected to increasing environmental pressure due to opposite sun exposure, accounted as main factor influencing the diversity and composition of these ecosystems. Overall, 331 altered metabolites (206 and 125 unique for north and south, respectively), distinguished the two differently exposed communities. We also selected 10 metabolites and performed two-stage Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to test them as potential biomarkers. We further focused on melanin and allantoin as protective substances; their concentration was highly different in the community in the shadow or in the sun. These results clearly indicate that opposite insolation selected organisms in the communities with different adaptation strategies in terms of key metabolites produced."

Materials and methods Two clinical fellows, one novice radiology resident, one neurosurgeon, and one orthopedic surgeon, who were unaware of the two qualitative MRI grading systems prior to this study, acquainted themselves with the teaching files. All five observers independently assessed the LCCS grade of 70 patients using T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance images at the L2-3, L3-4, L3-4, and L5-S1 disc levels. Analysis was performed twice at an interval of two months. Results The inter-observer agreement among all five readers was excellent and test-retest reliability was moderate to excellent for both the Schizas and Lee systems. Positive percentage agreements were found to be over 0.8 in almost all observers with relatively narrow 95% confidence limits. Conclusion Both Schizas and Lee MRI grading systems for LCCS are reliable grading systems, and can be used as a learnable method for both clinicians and radiologists."
https://openalex.org/W3030848890,"The rapid decline of a few Emberiza bunting species is increasing conservation concerns, especially in Asia. However, temporal changes in communities and populations of buntings, ones of the most common migratory songbirds in Korea, have not been quantitatively assessed. To understand how the status of buntings has changed over the past 100 years, we collated abundance data from museum collections and bird-banding records between 1910 and 2019. We also used presence–absence data for buntings collected by a nationwide census scheme between 1997 to 2012. Our analysis showed that bunting communities reconstructed from museum-specimen and bird-banding data were not significantly different; however, community composition differed over time. The Meadow (E. cioides), Yellow-throated (E. elegans), Black-faced (E. spodocephala), Rustic (E. rustica) and Chestnut Buntings (E. rutila), which are still common or were once common species, significantly affected the temporal changes in bunting community composition. There were no recent changes in the presence of Rustic and Chestnut Buntings since 1997, but they caused medium-term changes in the bunting community composition, suggesting that there was a sharp to moderate decline in their numbers in the past. The probability of the presence of six bunting species decreased annually, with the most prominent decline in two common breeders, the Meadow (-2.99%/year) and Yellow-throated Buntings (-1.82%/year). This finding suggests that breeding buntings in Korea are under high pressure, as are the migratory buntings. Moreover, despite its recent population decline, the Yellow-throated Bunting was still a major contributor to the community, suggesting that bunting diversity has also been deteriorating while bunting populations are shrinking. Long-term monitoring schemes across their distribution ranges, international cooperation for identifying major threats and key areas of conservation, and law enforcement against illegal hunting and habitat loss are strongly required to mitigate the on-going decline of buntings in Korea and Asia."

Here we describe barcodelet single-cell RNA sequencing (barRNA-seq), which enables systematic exploration of cellular perturbations by tagging individual cells with RNA barcodelets to identify them on the basis of the treatments they receive. We apply barRNA-seq to simultaneously manipulate up to seven developmental pathways and study effects on embryonic stem cell (ESC) germ layer specification and mesodermal specification, uncovering combinatorial effects of signaling pathway activation on gene expression. We further develop a data-driven framework for identifying combinatorial signaling perturbations that drive cells toward specific fates, including several annotated in an existing scRNA-seq gastrulation atlas, and use this approach to guide ESC differentiation into a notochord-like population. We expect that barRNA-seq will have broad utility for investigating and understanding how cooperative signaling pathways drive cell fate acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W3029440469,"In order to cope with the problems of high frequency and multiple causes of mountain fires, it is very important to adopt appropriate technologies to monitor and warn mountain fires through a few surface parameters. At the same time, the existing mobile terminal equipment is insufficient in image processing and storage capacity, and the energy consumption is high in the data transmission process, which requires calculation unloading. For this circumstance, first, a hierarchical discriminant analysis algorithm based on image feature extraction is introduced, and the image acquisition software in the mobile edge computing environment in the android system is designed and installed. Based on the remote sensing data, the land surface parameters of mountain fire are obtained, and the application of image recognition optimization algorithm in the mobile edge computing (MEC) environment is realized to solve the problem of transmission delay caused by traditional mobile cloud computing (MCC). Then, according to the forest fire sensitivity index, a forest fire early warning model based on MEC is designed. Finally, the image recognition response time and bandwidth consumption of the algorithm are studied, and the occurrence probability of mountain fire in Muli county, Liangshan prefecture, Sichuan is predicted. The results show that, compared with the MCC architecture, the algorithm presented in this study has shorter recognition and response time to different images in WiFi network environment; compared with MCC, MEC architecture can identify close users and transmit less data, which can effectively reduce the bandwidth pressure of the network. In most areas of Muli county, Liangshan prefecture, the probability of mountain fire is relatively low, the probability of mountain fire caused by non-surface environment is about 8 times that of the surface environment, and the influence of non-surface environment in the period of high incidence of mountain fire is lower than that in the period of low incidence. In conclusion, the surface parameters of MEC can be used to effectively predict the mountain fire and provide preventive measures in time."
https://openalex.org/W3031020582,"NS5B is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of the hepatitis C virus genome. It is a major target for antiviral drugs including nucleoside analogs, such as the prodrugs mericitabine and sofosbuvir, which get metabolized to 2'-fluoro-2'C-methylcytidine-5'-triphosphate and 2'-fluoro-2'C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate, respectively. These analogs act as chain terminators after they are incorporated during RNA synthesis. Recently, it has been shown that NS5B can efficiently remove chain terminators by a nucleotide-mediated excision reaction that rescues RNA synthesis. In this study, we use transient-state kinetics to understand the efficiency of inhibition for five nucleoside analogs. We show that CTP analogs are readily incorporated into a growing primer by NS5B but are also efficiently excised. In contrast, although UMP analogs are more slowly incorporated, the excision of UMP is slow and inefficient, and modifications to the 2'-carbon of the UTP ribose ring further decreased rates of excision to an undetectable level. Taken together, these data suggest that the clinical effectiveness of sofosbuvir is largely a function of being intractable to nucleotide-mediated excision compared with similar nucleoside analogs."
https://openalex.org/W3032403462,"Reduced retrograde memory performance at the cognitive level and aggregation/deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain at the cellular level are some of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A molecular system that participates in the removal of proteins with an altered conformation is the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). Impairments of the UPS in wild-type (WT) mice lead to defective clearance of Aβ and prevent long-term plasticity of synaptic transmission. Here we show data whereby in contrast to WT mice, the inhibition of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in an animal model of AD by MG132 or lactacystin restores impaired activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and its associative interaction, synaptic tagging and capture (STC) in vitro, as well as associative long-term memory in vivo. This augmentation of synaptic plasticity and memory is mediated by the mTOR pathway and protein synthesis. Our data offer novel insights into the rebalancing of proteins relevant for synaptic plasticity which are regulated by UPS in AD-like animal models. In addition, the data provide evidence that proteasome inhibitors might be effective in reinstating synaptic plasticity and memory performance in AD, and therefore offer a new potential therapeutic option for AD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3030561861,"Although having a long history of scrutiny in experimental psychology, it is still controversial whether wilful inner speech (covert speech) production is accompanied by specific activity in speech muscles. We present the results of a preregistered experiment looking at the electromyographic correlates of both overt speech and inner speech production of two phonetic classes of nonwords. An automatic classification approach was undertaken to discriminate between two articulatory features contained in nonwords uttered in both overt and covert speech. Although this approach led to reasonable accuracy rates during overt speech production, it failed to discriminate inner speech phonetic content based on surface electromyography signals. However, exploratory analyses conducted at the individual level revealed that it seemed possible to distinguish between rounded and spread nonwords covertly produced, in two participants. We discuss these results in relation to the existing literature and suggest alternative ways of testing the engagement of the speech motor system during wilful inner speech production."

Here, we sought to determine the role of UT-A1 in the urine-concentrating mechanism in a newly developed UT-A1–knockout mouse model. Phenotypically, daily urine output in UT-A1–knockout mice was nearly 3-fold that of WT mice and 82% of all-UT–knockout mice, and the UT-A1–knockout mice had significantly lower urine osmolality than WT mice. After 24-h water restriction, acute urea loading, or high-protein (40%) intake, UT-A1–knockout mice were unable to increase urine-concentrating ability. Compared with all-UT–knockout mice, the UT-A1–knockout mice exhibited similarly elevated daily urine output and decreased urine osmolality, indicating impaired urea-selective urine concentration.

UT-A1 and UT-A3 are the major urea transporters contributing to the urine concentration confirmed by the UT-A1/A3-KO mice that exhibit a strong urine-concentrating defect. In basal conditions, UT-A1/A3-KO mice urine osmolality (Uosm) is reduced by 70%. Moreover, UT-A1/A3-KO mice were unable to raise their Uosm after 24-h fluid restriction (25Fenton R.A. Chou C.L.

These results highlighted the main role of UT-A1 and UT-A3 in transporting urea from the collecting duct to the deep inner medullary tissue. In 2015, Klein et al. (33Klein J.D. Wang Y. Mistry A.

They found that transgenic expression of UT-A1 alone in mice lacking UT-A1/A3 was sufficient to restore urine-concentrating ability, indicating the prior role of UT-A1 in the urea delivery of inner medulla and in the urine-concentrating mechanism. However, because UT-A1 is mainly expressed in the apical plasma membrane and UT-A3 is expressed in the basolateral plasma membrane of the principle cells at the end of IMCD (13Blount M.A. Klein J.D.

UT-A1–KO mice are a suitable model to determine the role of UT-A1 in intrarenal urea recycling and the urine-concentrating mechanism. Because both UT-A1 and UT-A3 share the same promoter as well as the sequences of the first nine exons in gene Slc14a2, it is difficult to delete UT-A1 without affecting UT-A3. However, there is a unique sequence at the 3′-coding region of UT-A3 that is located in the intron of UT-A1 (8Fenton R.A. Cottingham C.A. Stewart G.S. Howorth A. Hewitt J.A. Smith C.P.

So, we designed an ingenious point synonymous mutation of the consensus splice site of UT-A1 mRNA to disrupt the gene transcription process without any influence on the expression of UT-A3. In this study, we generated an innovative UT-A1-KO mouse model. The phenotypic analysis showed that UT-A1 deficiency led to a severe urea-selective urine-concentrating defect and produced 3-fold daily urine output compared with WT and 82% of all-UT–KO mice. Moreover, UT-A1–KO mice exhibited normal growth, unaffected kidney index, morphology, and electrolyte excretion. Extrarenal phenotype analysis indicated that UT-A1 deletion did not affect blood pressure and had no effect on glycol and lipid metabolism. The experimental results suggest that UT-A1, but not other UTs, plays a predominant role in urea-dependent urine concentration. UT-A1 is an effective diuretic target, and the UT-A1 inhibitors might be developed as potential diuretics without electrolyte disturbance. UT-A1–KO mice were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 system based on the specific structure of UT-A gene Slc14a2 (8Fenton R.A. Cottingham C.A. Stewart G.S. Howorth A. Hewitt J.A. Smith C.P.

Western blotting analysis showed that UT-A1 and UT-A3 were expressed in the renal inner medulla, and UT-A2 was expressed in the renal outer medulla in WT mice. UT-A1 was specifically deleted in the IMCD, UT-A2 and UT-A3 expressions were not affected in UT-A1–KO mice (Fig. 1, B and C). Immunofluorescence confirmed that UT-A1 was completely deleted, UT-A3 expressed in basolateral side of IMCD and UT-A2 expressed in outer medulla were not influenced (Fig. 1D). These results confirmed that UT-A1 was successfully knocked out. Genotype analysis of offspring from breeding of UT-A1-KO heterozygous mice indicated a nearly 1:2:1 fitting to the Mendelian distribution (46 WT, 92 heterozygous, and 41 UT-A1-KO). An analysis of growth by mouse body weight (age, 1–8 weeks) showed no difference between WT and UT-A1–KO mice (data not shown). Kidney index was not obviously different between UT-A1–KO mice, all-UT–KO mice, and WT mice (Fig. 2A). Daily urine output was shown in Fig. 2B. The UT-A1–KO mice exhibited severely polyuria, excreting over three times the urine compared with litter-matched WT mice, which was ∼82% of the all-UT–KO mice (Fig. 2B and Table S1). The average urine osmolality of UT-A1–KO mice was markedly lower than that of WT mice and was similar to all-UT–KO mice (Fig. 2C and Table S1). Urine-concentrating ability was measured in response to 24-h water deprivation. Urine osmolality increased substantially in the WT mice but only slightly in the UT-A1–KO mice, in line with the all-UT–KO mice (Fig. 2C). There was no significant difference in the gross morphology of the kidneys of the two genotypes. Histological examination showed that there was dilatation of collecting ducts in the IM in UT-A1–KO mice on account of polyuria (Fig. 2D). The composition of the aqueous component of the IM was shown in Fig. 2E. Similar to all-UT–KO mice, the IM urea concentration in UT-A1–KO mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice. There was no obvious difference in sodium, potassium, and chloride concentrations between UT-A1–KO mice, all-UT–KO mice, and WT mice (Fig. 2E). Moreover, because of the pivotal role of UT-A1 in the urine concentration mechanism in kidney, we adopted the transcutaneous measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) technology and found that the GFR of UT-A1–KO mice (200.1 ± 88.1 μl/min) was similar to that of WT mice (230.2 ± 77.5 μl/min) (data not shown), suggesting that UT-A1 deletion does not influence glomerular filtration rate and hemodynamics. Osmolality and urea concentration were measured in urine and plasma under basal condition. Urinary urea concentration was significantly low in UT-A1–KO mice, in keeping with all-UT–KO mice. However, plasma urea concentration was similar in UT-A1-KO, all-UT–KO and WT mice. There was no significant difference in plasma sodium, potassium, and chloride concentrations between the three genotypes. Moreover, lipid metabolism was unaffected in the absence of UT-A1 (Table S1). To evaluate the contribution of UT-A1 in the kidney’s capacity to dispose urea overloads, the mice were subjected to an acute modest urea load (∼1/10 of daily urea excretion) as previously described (30Jiang T. Li Y. Layton A.T. Wang W. Sun Y. Li M. Zhou H. Yang B. Generation and phenotypic analysis of mice lacking all urea transporters.Kidney Int. 2017; 91 (27914708): 338-35110.1016/j.kint.2016.09.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the first 2 h after administration of urea load, WT mice significantly increased their urea concentration and urinary osmolality with a modest rise in urinary flow rate, whereas UT-A1–KO mice showed little rise in urinary osmolality and urinary urea concentration with rapidly increased urine flow rate (Fig. 3, A–C). The time course of urea excretion was similar in both UT-A1–KO mice and WT mice (Fig. 3D). After urea excretion returned to basal level (6∼8 h after the load), urinary osmolality and urea concentration in WT mice remained elevated. However, in UT-A1–KO mice, urinary osmolality was only modestly elevated, and urine output declined slightly, indicating that mice could not accumulate urea in the medulla after an acute urea load without UT-A1. Administration of exogenous urea significantly improved the ability of the kidney to concentrate other urinary solutes in WT mice, but this was not observed in UT-A1–KO mice (Fig. 3E). Because of the large urine output in the primary stage, the excretion of non-urea solutes was increased slightly in both WT and UT-A1–KO mice responding to the urea load. The excretion of non-urea solutes was similar in these two genotypes (Fig. 3F). To evaluate the mechanisms by which mice of different genotypes chronically adapt their renal function to different levels of urea excretion, WT and UT-A1–KO mice were fed for 1 week with a diet containing low, normal, or high protein content (10, 20, or 40% casein, as the only source of protein), respectively. Protein intake had a significant influence on urine output, which increased in the two groups with the amount of diet protein. Under different protein content circumstances, the urine flow rate was higher in UT-A1–KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 4A). Urinary osmolality and urea concentration were increased obviously with the amount of diet protein in WT mice but not changed in UT-A1–KO mice (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that the long-term accumulation of urea in the IM was disrupted to a great extent without UT-A1. With each protein content diet, the osmolar excretion and urea excretion were similar in the two groups (Fig. 4, D and E). Non-urea solute excretion elevated along with the higher protein intake, and there was no significant difference between two groups with the same protein content (Fig. 4F). Because the lower blood pressure observed in UT-B-KO and all-UT–KO mice compared with WT mice (30Jiang T. Li Y. Layton A.T. Wang W. Sun Y. Li M. Zhou H. Yang B.

The results showed that diastolic blood pressure (95.3 ± 6.2 mm Hg in UT-A1–KO versus 92.2 ± 7.0 mm Hg in WT), systolic blood pressure (123.1 ± 8.2 mm Hg in UT-A1–KO versus 124.1 ± 9.4 mm Hg in WT), and mean arterial pressure (104.3 ± 6.5 mm Hg in UT-A1–KO versus 102.5 ± 8.4 mm Hg in WT) were all normal in both genotypes, indicating that UT-A1–specific deletion or inhibition would not influence regular blood pressure despite the potent diuresis. UT-A1 and UT-A3 are expressed in the inner medullar collecting duct apical plasma membrane and basolateral plasma membrane, respectively (13Blount M.A. Klein J.D. Martin C.F. Tchapyjnikov D.

Deletion of UT-A1/A3 results in severe urine concentration deficiency and urea-selective diuresis, indicating the significant role of UT-A1 and UT-A3 in the urine-concentrating mechanism. Further study identified that UT-A1 transgenic restoration successfully rescued the urine-concentrating defect in UT-A1/A3-KO mice (33Klein J.D. Wang Y. Mistry A. LaRocque L.M. Molina P.A. Rogers R.T. Blount M.A. Sands J.M. Transgenic restoration of urea transporter A1 confers maximal urinary concentration in the absence of urea transporter A3.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27 (26407594): 1448-145510.1681/ASN.2014121267Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These studies suggest the predominant role of UT-A1 in urine concentrating. The specific UT-A1-KO mouse is a good model to confirm the importance of UT-A1 versus UT-A3 in urea-dependent urine-concentrating mechanism. Generating the UT-A1-KO mouse is a challenging task because the tricky gene structure of Slc14a2 encodes the UT-A1 to UT-A6 proteins simultaneously. It was impossible to generate the UT-A1–KO mice simply by conventional frameshift mutation because the UT-A1 gene structure covers six UT-A members. Based on a small piece of DNA sequence shared for the UT-A3 coding region and UT-A1 splicing site, respectively, we designed an elegant strategy by a point synonymous mutation of consensus splice site nucleotides of UT-A1 to inhibit the splicing process, thereby destroying the integrity of the UT-A1 mRNA transcript and knocking out the UT-A1 protein specifically. However, the protein expression of other UT-As would not be affected by such synonymous mutation. The mouse model with specific UT-A1 deletion was successfully generated and validated by means of functional analysis. Experimental results showed that UT-A1–KO mice exhibited a grossly normal phenotype, except high urine output and low urine-concentrating ability. The inner medullary urea concentration in UT-A1–KO mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice, and no obvious difference was found in sodium, potassium, or chloride concentrations in blood between the two genotypes. By comparing the data from UT-A1-KO and all-UT-KO mice, it is clear that UT-A1 itself sufficiently mediates the urea reabsorption of IM, UT-A3, or other UTs in kidney but could not restore the impaired urine-concentrating mechanism, suggesting UT-A1 as an effective diuretic target. Unlike the all-UT–KO and UT-B-KO mice, UT-A1 deletion had no influence in blood pressure. No change was found in either plasma creatinine or GFR in UT-A1–KO mice, demonstrating that UT-A1 deletion did not influence normal glomerular filtration rate. Importantly, plasma Na+, K+, Cl−, and Ca2+ were similar between UT-A1–KO, all-UT–KO, and WT mice, indicating that deletion of UT-A1 increased urine output without affecting electrolyte metabolism. There appeared no morphological change in the cortex and outer medulla of UT-A1–KO mice, except for the collecting duct dilatation caused by large urine output, similar to all-UT–KO mice. UT-A1–KO mice showed much greater urine output than WT mice and slightly lower urine output than all-UT–KO mice. The reason is that less urea was reabsorbed at the end of IMCD (by UT-A1), and the existence of UT-B and UT-A3 partially contributes to maintain inner medullar urea concentration. Compared with WT mice, neither an acute nor a chronic urea load increased urinary urea concentration and osmolality, indicating that UT-A1–KO mice could not accumulate urea in the IM. These results were highly similar to all-UT–KO mice, suggesting the predominant role of UT-A1 in urea reabsorption and concentration in kidney. With the addition of the new UT-A1-KO model, there are seven models of UT KO mice, including UT-B-KO (27Yang B. Bankir L. Gillespie A. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S.

https://openalex.org/W3032102274,"Although vaccine delivery through the oral route remains the most convenient and safest way for mass immunization purposes, this method is limited by the requirement for large antigen doses and low vaccine efficacy. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBVs) expressing influenza hemagglutinin (A/PR/8/34) and orally delivered a low dose of rBVs to evaluate its vaccine efficacy in mice. Intranasal rBV vaccination was included in the whole experiment for comparison. We found that oral vaccination elicited high levels of virus-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in both serum and mucosal samples (lung, tracheal, intestinal, fecal and vaginal). Surprisingly, complete protection from the lethal influenza challenge was observed, as indicated by reductions in the virus titer, inflammatory cytokine production, body weight change, and enhanced survival. These results suggest that oral delivery of the influenza rBV vaccine induces mucosal and systemic immunity, which protect mice from the lethal influenza virus challenge. Oral delivery of baculovirus vaccines can be developed as an effective vaccination route."

We introduce two central parameters, ‘balance’ and ‘stretch’, that capture their main characteristics, and explore their dynamics by creating visual tools we call ‘balance plots’ and ‘spelling trees’. We discuss how the tools and methods we develop here could be used to study the statistical patterns of mistypings and misspellings and be used as a basis for other linguistic research involving stretchable words, along with the potential applications in augmenting dictionaries, improving language processing, and in any area where sequence construction matters, such as genetics."

https://openalex.org/W3030855401,"Human visual-motor coordination is an essential function of movement control, which requires interactions of multiple brain regions. Understanding the cortical-motor coordination is important for improving physical therapy for motor disabilities. However, its underlying transient neural dynamics is still largely unknown. In this study, we applied an eigenvector-based dynamical network analysis method to investigate the functional connectivity calculated from electroencephalography (EEG) signals under visual-motor coordination task and to identify its meta-stable states dynamics. We first tested this signal processing on a simulated network to evaluate it in comparison with other dynamical methods, demonstrating that the eigenvector-based dynamical network analysis was able to correctly extract the dynamical features of the evolving networks. Subsequently, the eigenvector-based analysis was applied to EEG data collected under a visual-motor coordination experiment. In the EEG study with participants, the results of both topological analysis and the eigenvector-based dynamical analysis were able to distinguish different experimental conditions of visual tracking task. With the dynamical analysis, we showed that different visual-motor coordination states can be distinguished by investigating the meta-stable states dynamics of the functional connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3030023410,"Researchers and clinicians face a significant challenge in keeping up-to-date with the rapid rate of new associations between genetic mutations and diseases. To remedy this problem, this research mined the ClinicalTrials.gov corpus to extract relevant biological insights, produce unique reports to summarize findings, and make the meta-data available via APIs. An automated text-analysis pipeline performed the following features: parsing the ClinicalTrials.gov files, extracting and analyzing mutations from the corpus, mapping clinical trials to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and finding associations between clinical trials and HPO nodes. Unique reports were created for each mutation (SNPs and protein mutations) mentioned in the corpus, as well as for each clinical trial that references a mutation. These reports, which have been run over multiple time points, along with APIs to access meta-data, are freely available at http://snpminertrials.com. Additionally, HPO was used to normalize disease terms and associate clinical trials with relevant genes. The creation of the pipeline and reports, the association of clinical trials with HPO terms, and the insights, public repository, and APIs produced are all novel in this work. The freely-available resources present relevant biological information and novel insights between biomedical entities in a robust and accessible manner, mitigating the challenge of being informed about new associations between mutations, genes, and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3030419310,"We evaluate the impact of a fisheries management program centered on the definition of Fish Conservation Zones on biodiversity, measured as the number of species caught in the last 12 months. Data comes from a set of 32 villages in central Lao PDR, of which half participated in the program, and the remaining are a set of matched control villages. The estimated causal effects are large (an increase between 29 and 32 species) and robust to the potential importance of unmeasured confounders. We also show that initial conditions may matter, as the program seems particularly effective in villages with high probability of participating in the program. These results are particularly important given the paucity of evidence regarding the impact of conservation programs on biodiversity, particularly in the context of freshwater ecosystems. Further directions of research suggested by these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3031902767,"CD4-positive T cells are the main target of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Interferon-γ release assays rely on the fact that T-lymphocytes release this cytokine when exposed to tuberculosis-specific antigens and are useful in testing for latent tuberculosis infection before initiating biologic therapy, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. However, the reliability of interferon-γ release assays in detecting tuberculosis infection among HTLV-1-positive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the use of the T-SPOT.TB assay in HTLV-1-positive RA patients.Overall, 29 HTLV-1-positive RA patients and 87 age- and sex-matched HTLV-1-negative RA patients (controls) were included from the HTLV-1 RA Miyazaki Cohort Study. Results of the T-SPOT.TB assay for latent tuberculosis infection screening were collected from medical records of patients.Approximately 55% of the HTLV-1-positive RA patients showed invalid T-SPOT.TB assay results (odds ratio: 108, 95% confidence interval: 13.1-890, p < 0.0001) owing to a spot count of >10 in the negative controls. HTLV-1 proviral load values were significantly higher in patients with invalid results compared with those without invalid results (p = 0.003).HTLV-1 infection affects T-SPOT.TB assay results in RA patients. Assay results in HTLV-1 endemic regions should be interpreted with caution when screening for latent tuberculosis infection before initiation of biologic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3031639993,"Barriers between islands often inhibit gene flow creating patterns of isolation by distance. In island species, the majority of genetic diversity should be distributed among isolated populations. However, a self-incompatible mating system leads to higher genetic variation within populations and very little between-population subdivision. We examine these two contrasting predictions in Erysimum teretifolium, a rare self-incompatible plant endemic to island-like sandhill habitats in Santa Cruz County, California. We used genome skimming and nuclear microsatellites to assess the distribution of genetic diversity within and among eight of the 13 remaining populations. Phylogenetic analyses of the chloroplast genomes revealed a deep separation of three of the eight populations. The nuclear ribosomal DNA cistron showed no genetic subdivision. Nuclear microsatellites suggest 83% of genetic variation resides within populations. Despite this, 18 of 28 between-population comparisons exhibited significant population structure (mean FST = 0.153). No isolation by distance existed among all populations, however when one outlier population was removed from the analysis due to uncertain provenance, significant isolation by distance emerged (r2 = 0.5611, p = 0.005). Population census size did not correlate with allelic richness as predicted on islands. Bayesian population assignment detected six genetic groupings with substantial admixture. Unique genetic clusters were concentrated at the periphery of the species’ range. Since the overall distribution of nuclear genetic diversity reflects E. tereifolium’s self-incompatible mating system, the vast majority of genetic variation could be sampled within any individual population. Yet, the chloroplast genome results suggest a deep split and some of the nuclear microsatellite analyses indicate some island-like patterns of genetic diversity. Restoration efforts intending to maximize genetic variation should include representatives from both lineages of the chloroplast genome and, for maximum nuclear genetic diversity, should include representatives of the smaller, peripheral populations."
https://openalex.org/W3028700108,"Since patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) often have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, the development of efficient systemic treatment options for MTC is important. Vandetanib and cabozantinib are two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that were recently approved by FDA and EMA for systemic treatment of metastatic MTC. Additionally, since MTC is of a neuroendocrine tumour type, treatment with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. 177Lu-octreotate) is a valid option for patients with MTC. The aim of this study was to investigate the potentially increased therapeutic effect of combining radiation therapy with these TKIs for treatment of MTC in a mouse model. Nude mice carrying patient-derived MTC tumours (GOT2) were treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and/or one of the two TKIs vandetanib or cabozantinib. The tumour volume was determined and compared with that of mock-treated controls. The treatment doses were chosen to give a moderate effect as monotherapy to be able to detect any increased therapeutic effect from the combination therapy. At the end of follow-up, tumours were processed for immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. The animals in the combination therapy groups showed the largest reduction in tumour volume and the longest time to tumour progression. Two weeks after start of treatment, the tumour volume for these mice was reduced by about 70-75% compared with controls. Furthermore, also EBRT and TKI monotherapy resulted in a clear anti-tumour effect with a reduced tumour growth compared with controls. The results show that an increased therapeutic effect could be achieved when irradiation is combined with TKIs for treatment of MTC. Future studies should evaluate the potential of using 177Lu-octreotate therapy in combination with TKIs in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3029361817,"We investigate the determinants of the sign of Research and Development reaction functions of rival firms. Using a two-stage n-firm Cournot competition game, we show that this sign depends on four types of environments in terms of product rivalry and technology spillovers. We test the predictions of the model on the world’s largest manufacturing corporations. Assuming that firms make R&D investments based on the R&D effort of the representative rival company, we develop a dynamic panel data model that accounts for the endogeneity of the decision of the rival firm. Empirical results thoroughly corroborate the validity of the theoretical model."
https://openalex.org/W3032183042,"Characterization of distinct histone methylation and acetylation binding patterns in promoters and prediction of novel regulatory regions remains an important area of genomic research, as it is hypothesized that distinct chromatin signatures may specify unique genomic functions. However, methods that have been proposed in the literature are either descriptive in nature or are fully parametric and hence more restrictive in pattern discovery. In this article, we propose a two-step non-parametric statistical inference procedure to characterize unique histone modification patterns and apply it to analyzing the binding patterns of four histone marks, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H4K20me1, in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. In the first step, we used a functional principal component analysis method to represent the concatenated binding patterns of these four histone marks around the transcription start sites as smooth curves. In the second step, we clustered these curves to reveal several unique classes of binding patterns. These uncovered patterns were used in turn to scan the whole-genome to predict novel and alternative promoters. Our analyses show that there are three distinct promoter binding patterns of active genes. Further, 19654 regions not within known gene promoters were found to overlap with human ESTs, CpG islands, or common SNPs, indicative of their potential role in gene regulation, including being potential novel promoter regions."
