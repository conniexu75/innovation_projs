https://openalex.org/W2359821,"SUMMARY 1. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of acetaldehyde to acetyl phosphate. Inorganic phosphate and DPN participate in the reaction. 2. The oxidation of the aldehyde also occurs in the absence of phosphate or arsenate. 3. The dehydrogenase also catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Warburg, O., and Christian, W., Biochem. Z., 303, 40 (1939). 2. Cori, G.

https://openalex.org/W2033341333,"WE have shown earlier1 that non-nucleated fragments of Amoeba proteus maintain a normal oxygen consumption for as long as ten days; since the removal of the nucleus quickly reduces the uptake of phosphorus-32 by the cytoplasm2, we concluded that the nucleus plays a part in the coupling between oxidations and phosphorylations, possibly by the production of some co-enzyme. Later experiments3 showed, however, that such a simple hypothesis can scarcely be correct, since the adenosine triphosphate content of nucleated and non-nucleated halves remains almost identical for a considerable length of time (twelve days)."

Measurements of light absorption made on intact plastids in the living guard cells of leaves of Rumex patientia, Chrysanthemum maximum and Vicia faba have shown the presence of chlorophylls a and b. Moreover, an active synthesis of carbohydrates in the light is clearly indicated by the diurnal changes of sugars and starch in the epidermis of the leaf."

https://openalex.org/W1977217835,"THIRD-STAGE infective nematode larvæ retain the sheath of the previous stage and, upon ingestion by the host, this is shed to liberate the enclosed individual. Lapage1 showed that ‘Milton’ could induce an artificial ecdysis in the third-stage infective nematode larvæ of sheep. Glaser and Stoll2,3 have reported successful results using a similar ‘Labarraque’ solution. Lapage4 induced ecdysis in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide at pH 9–10 and, apart from the time taken (8–10 days), the process seemed normal. Crofton5 studied the second ecdysis of Trichostrongylus retortaeformis (Zeder) and found that it could be initiated by pepsin and hydrochloric acid at pH 4–5, 60 hr. being required for exsheathment to occur. Stoll6 investigated the ecdysis of the first parasitic stage of Haemonchus contortus (Rudolphi) and reported that it occurred in hypotonic Ringer or Tyrode solutions, the addition of aqueous liver extract being highly beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2060242999,"AN insect, or other biting arthropod, which transmits a micro-organism by its bite must feed at least twice on the host, once to acquire the micro-organism and once to pass it on (except in the rare but possible case of a hereditary infection). Those who are interested in the transmission of the malaria parasite by Anopheles mosquitoes have known for many years that those species of Anopheles which feed on man indoors, or rest indoors after feeding and during the maturation of the eggs, tend to be more effective as transmitters of malaria, because of this close association with the human being. If the mosquito only feeds when it encounters man in the jungle and always rests outside, the chance that the individual mosquito will feed twice on a human being is evidently lessened. The use of the modern residual insecticides (DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons) has led to a more intense study of the feeding and resting habits of adult mosquitoes because these insecticides are applied to a house with the view of making the walls, etc., insecticidal for a long period. The focus of attention has shifted, therefore, during the past ten years, and is now mainly directed upon the behaviour of the adult Anopheles."

The first extract was almost colourless or slightly yellowish in colour; but on further extraction with new portions of methanol the extracts became more and more reddish in colour, and by continuous extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus a dark red solution of haem was obtained."
