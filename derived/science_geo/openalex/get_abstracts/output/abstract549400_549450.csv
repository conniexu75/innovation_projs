https://openalex.org/W2200847231,"Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been described as potential diagnostic biomarkers in cardiovascular disease and in particular, coronary artery disease (CAD). Few studies were undertaken to perform analyses with regard to risk stratification of future cardiovascular events. miR-126, miR-197 and miR-223 are involved in endovascular inflammation and platelet activation and have been described as biomarkers in the diagnosis of CAD. They were identified in a prospective study in relation to future myocardial infarction.The aim of our study was to further evaluate the prognostic value of these miRNAs in a large prospective cohort of patients with documented CAD.Levels of miR-126, miR-197 and miR-223 were evaluated in serum samples of 873 CAD patients with respect to the endpoint cardiovascular death. miRNA quantification was performed using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).The median follow-up period was 4 years (IQR 2.78-5.04). The median age of all patients was 64 years (IQR 57-69) with 80.2% males. 38.9% of the patients presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 61.1% were diagnosed with stable angina pectoris (SAP). Elevated levels of miRNA-197 and miRNA-223 reliably predicted future cardiovascular death in the overall group (miRNA-197: hazard ratio (HR) 1.77 per one standard deviation (SD) increase (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20; 2.60), p = 0.004, C-index 0.78; miRNA-223: HR 2.23 per one SD increase (1.20; 4.14), p = 0.011, C-index 0.80). In ACS patients the prognostic power of both miRNAs was even higher (miRNA-197: HR 2.24 per one SD increase (1.25; 4.01), p = 0.006, C-index 0.89); miRA-223: HR 4.94 per one SD increase (1.42; 17.20), p = 0.012, C-index 0.89).Serum-derived circulating miRNA-197 and miRNA-223 were identified as predictors for cardiovascular death in a large patient cohort with CAD. These results reinforce the assumption that circulating miRNAs are promising biomarkers with prognostic value with respect to future cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W2220600523,"Objective Stripping of the membranes is an established and widely utilized obstetric procedure associated with higher spontaneous vaginal delivery rates, reduced need for formal induction of labor and a lower likelihood of post-term pregnancy. Due to the theoretical concern of bacterial seeding during the procedure many practitioners choose not to sweep the membranes in Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonized patients. We conducted ‘the STRIP-G study’ in order to determine whether maternal and neonatal outcomes are affected by GBS carrier status in women undergoing membrane stripping. Study design We conducted a prospective study in a tertiary referral center, comparing maternal and neonatal outcomes following membrane stripping among GBS-positive, GBS-negative, and GBS-unknown patients. We compared the incidence of composite adverse neonatal outcomes (primary outcome) among the three study groups, while secondary outcome measure was composite adverse maternal outcomes. Results A total of 542 women were included in the study, of which 135 were GBS-positive, 361 GBS-negative, and 46 GBS-unknown status. Demographic, obstetric, and intra-partum characteristics were similar for all groups. Adverse neonatal outcomes were observed in 8 (5.9%), 31 (8.6%), and 2 (4.3%) in the GBS-positive, GBS-negative, and unknown groups, respectively (P = 0.530), (Odds Ratio between GBS-Positive vs. GBS-Negative groups 0.67 (95%, CI = 0.30–1.50)); while composite adverse maternal outcomes occurred in 9 (6.66%), 31 (8.59%), and 5 (10.87%) in the GBS-positive, GBS-negative, and unknown groups, respectively (P = 0.617). Conclusions Antepartum membrane stripping in GBS carriers appears to be a safe obstetrical procedure that does not adversely affect maternal or neonatal outcomes."

This study collected data from a large sample of 3,759 children aged from 8 to 17 years, including 824 who had been left behind by one parent (LBCO), 423 who had been left behind by both parents (LBCB), 568 MC and 1944 NLBC. Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form was used to measure child depression. Parent-Child Relationship Scale (PCRS) and Teacher-Child Relationship Scale (TCRS) were used to measure the quality of parent-child and teacher-child relationships, respectively. The results showed that the prevalence of depression was 10.5% among NLBC, 13.1% among LBCO, 16.1% among LBCB, and 20.1% among MC. Depression was related to parent-child relationship quality and teacher-child relationship quality. Negative parent-child relationship was more relevant to depression than negative teacher-child relationship among LBCB, while negative teacher-child relationship was the most correlated with depression among MC."
https://openalex.org/W2238180874,"Reversible changes in the phosphorylation of reflectin proteins have been shown to drive the tunability of color and brightness of light reflected from specialized cells in the skin of squids and related cephalopods. We show here, using dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and fluorescence analyses, that reversible titration of the excess positive charges of the reflectins, comparable with that produced by phosphorylation, is sufficient to drive the reversible condensation and hierarchical assembly of these proteins. The results suggest a two-stage process in which charge neutralization first triggers condensation, resulting in the emergence of previously cryptic structures that subsequently mediate reversible, hierarchical assembly. The extent to which cyclability is seen in the in vitro formation and disassembly of complexes estimated to contain several thousand reflectin molecules suggests that intrinsic sequence- and structure-determined specificity governs the reversible condensation and assembly of the reflectins and that these processes are therefore sufficient to produce the reversible changes in refractive index, thickness, and spacing of the reflectin-containing subcellular Bragg lamellae to change the brightness and color of reflected light. This molecular mechanism points to the metastability of reflectins as the centrally important design principle governing biophotonic tunability in this system."

Their GTP/GDP cycle is often tightly connected to a membrane/cytosol cycle regulated by the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα). RhoGDIα has been regarded as a housekeeping regulator essential to control homeostasis of Rho proteins. Recent proteomic screens showed that RhoGDIα is extensively lysine-acetylated. Here, we present the first comprehensive structural and mechanistic study to show how RhoGDIα function is regulated by lysine acetylation. We discover that lysine acetylation impairs Rho protein binding and increases guanine nucleotide exchange factor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange on RhoA, these two functions being prerequisites to constitute a bona fide GDI displacement factor. RhoGDIα acetylation interferes with Rho signaling, resulting in alteration of cellular filamentous actin. Finally, we discover that RhoGDIα is endogenously acetylated in mammalian cells, and we identify CBP, p300, and pCAF as RhoGDIα-acetyltransferases and Sirt2 and HDAC6 as specific deacetylases, showing the biological significance of this post-translational modification.

https://openalex.org/W2298796614,"Mcm10 is required for the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication and contributes in some unknown way to the activation of the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase. How Mcm10 is localized to sites of replication initiation is unclear, as current models indicate that direct binding to minichromosome maintenance (MCM) plays a role, but the details and functional importance of this interaction have not been determined. Here, we show that purified Mcm10 can bind both DNA-bound double hexamers and soluble single hexamers of MCM. The binding of Mcm10 to MCM requires the Mcm10 C terminus. Moreover, the binding site for Mcm10 on MCM includes the Mcm2 and Mcm6 subunits and overlaps that for the loading factor Cdt1. Whether Mcm10 recruitment to replication origins depends on CMG helicase assembly has been unclear. We show that Mcm10 recruitment occurs via two modes: low affinity recruitment in the absence of CMG assembly (G1-like) and high affinity recruitment when CMG assembly takes place (S-phase-like). Mcm10 that cannot bind directly to MCM is defective in both modes of recruitment and is unable to support DNA replication. These findings indicate that Mcm10 is localized to replication initiation sites by directly binding MCM through the Mcm10 C terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2237361299,"The epigenetic regulation of spatiotemporal gene expression is crucial for human development. Here, we present whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of a wide variety of histone markers in the brain, heart, and liver of early human embryos shortly after their formation. We identified 40,181 active enhancers, with a large portion showing tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific patterns, pointing to their roles in controlling the ordered spatiotemporal expression of the developmental genes in early human embryos. Moreover, using sequential ChIP-seq, we showed that all three organs have hundreds to thousands of bivalent domains that are marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, probably to keep the progenitor cells in these organs ready for immediate differentiation into diverse cell types during subsequent developmental processes. Our work illustrates the potentially critical roles of tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific epigenomes in regulating the spatiotemporal expression of developmental genes during early human embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2200095290,"States' decisions not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could potentially affect access to care and health status among their low-income residents.The 2010-2012 nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were analyzed in 2015 to compare 9755 low-income adults aged 18-64 years from Medicaid-expanding states with 7455 adults from nonexpanding states. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the differences in access to care, receipt of preventive services, quality of care, attitudes about health and self-reported health status by Medicaid expansion status. The differences in care utilization and medical expenditures between the two groups were examined using a 2-part modeling approach.Compared to their counterparts in Medicaid expansion states, low income adults in the nonexpanding states were more likely to be black and reside in rural areas and were less likely to have a usual source of care (prevalence ratio[PR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval[CI] 0.82-0.91) and recommended preventive services such as dental checkups (PR = 0.86; CI = 0.79-0.94), routine checks (PR = 0.89; CI = 0.83-0.95), flu vaccinations (PR = 0.89; CI = 0.81-0.98), and blood pressure checks (PR = 0.96; CI = 0.94-0.99). They also had less care utilization, fewer prescriptions, and less medical expenditures, but more out-of-pocket expenditures (all p-value <0.05).Low-income adults in Medicaid nonexpanding states, who are disproportionately represented by blacks and rural residents, were worse off for multiple health-related outcomes compared to their counterparts in Medicaid expanding states at the baseline of ACA implementation, suggesting that low income adults residing in nonexpanding states may benefit markedly from the expansion of Medicaid."

Although some human microsomal P450 enzymes can instead accept the second electron from cytochrome b5, for human steroidogenic CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 reductase FMN domain delivers both electrons, and b5 is an allosteric modulator. The structural basis of these key but poorly understood protein interactions was probed by solution NMR using the catalytically competent soluble domains of each protein. Formation of the CYP17A1·FMN domain complex induced differential line broadening of the NMR signal for each protein. Alterations in the exchange dynamics generally occurred for residues near the surface of the flavin mononucleotide, including 87–90 (loop 1), and for key CYP17A1 active site residues. These interactions were modulated by the identity of the substrate in the buried CYP17A1 active site and by b5. The FMN domain outcompetes b5 for binding to CYP17A1 in the three-component system. These results and comparison with previous NMR studies of the CYP17A1·b5 complex suggest a model of CYP17A1 enzyme regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2212148192,"Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) are a significant cause of menstrual disturbance and infertility, but their pathogenesis still remains unclear. Here, we investigated the expression of TGF-β and CCN2 in IUA endometrial tissue by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and qRT-PCR assays, and found the expression of TGF-β and CCN2 in the endometrial tissue of IUA was significantly increased compared to normal endometrium and uterine septum (P<0.01), suggesting that TGF-β and CCN2 may play an important role in the formation of IUA. Moreover, the activity of the NF-κB signaling pathway in endometrial tissue of IUA was also significantly enhanced compared to normal endometrial and uterine septum (P<0.01) and positively correlated with the expression of TGF-β and CCN2, which suggested that TGF-β and CCN2 expression may be involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway using SN50 resulted in the reduced expression of TGF-β in RL95-2 cells, which confirmed the association of the NF-κB signaling pathway and TGF-β in endometrial cells. Additionally, the expression of TGF-β and CCN2 was associated with IUA recurrence, which provides a potential prognostic indictor for IUA. Together, these results demonstrated that TGF-β and CCN2 play an important role in IUA formation, whose mechanism was associated with the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway."

Surprisingly, bone from 10–12-month-old cKO animals was indistinguishable from controls in size, density, and morphology except for a 25% increase in stiffness. cKO SOL exhibited increased expression of Pax7, Myog, Myod1, Notch, and Myh3 and 6-fold more centralized nuclei, characteristics of postnatal regenerating muscle, but only in type I myosin heavy chain-expressing cells. Increased expression of gene pathways mediating EGF receptor signaling, circadian exercise, striated muscle contraction, and lipid and carbohydrate oxidative metabolism were also observed in cKO SOL. This muscle phenotype was not observed in 3-month-old mice. Although Mbtps1 mRNA and protein expression was reduced in cKO bone osteocytes, no differences in Mbtps1 or cre recombinase expression were observed in cKO SOL, explaining this age-related phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2200616451,"We aimed to obtain an in-depth understanding on recent antimicrobial resistance trends and molecular epidemiology trends of S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB).Thirteen academic centres in South Africa were included from June 2010 until July 2012. S. aureus susceptibility testing was performed on the MicroScan Walkaway. Real-time PCR using the LightCycler 480 II was done for mecA and nuc. SCCmec and spa-typing were finalized with conventional PCR. We selected one isolate per common spa type per province for multilocus sequence typing (MLST).S. aureus from 2709 patients were included, and 1231 (46%) were resistant to methicillin, with a significant decline over the three-year period (p-value = 0.003). Geographical distribution of MRSA was significantly higher in Gauteng compared to the other provinces (P<0.001). Children <5 years were significantly associated with MRSA with higher rates compared to all other age groups (P = 0.01). The most prevalent SCCmec type was SCCmec type III (531 [41%]) followed by type IV (402 [31%]). Spa-typing discovered 47 different spa-types. The five (87%) most common spa-types were t037, t1257, t045, t064 and t012. Based on MLST, the commonest was ST612 clonal complex (CC8) (n = 7) followed by ST5 (CC5) (n = 4), ST36 (CC30) (n = 4) and ST239 (CC8) (n = 3).MRSA rate is high in South Africa. Majority of the isolates were classified as SCCmec type III (41%) and type IV (31%), which are typically associated with hospital and community- acquired infections, respectively. Overall, this study reveals the presence of a variety of hospital-acquired MRSA clones in South Africa dominance of few clones, spa 037 and 1257. Monitoring trends in resistance and molecular typing is recommended to detect changing epidemiological trends in AMR patterns of SAB."
https://openalex.org/W2207735435,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia worldwide. The pharmacological activation of nuclear receptors (Liver X receptors: LXRs or Retinoid X receptors: RXR) has been shown to induce overexpression of the ATP-Binding Cassette A1 (ABCA1) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), changes that are associated with improvement in cognition and reduction of amyloid beta pathology in amyloidogenic AD mouse models (i.e. APP, PS1: 2tg-AD). Here we investigated whether treatment with a specific LXR agonist has a measurable impact on the cognitive impairment in an amyloid and Tau AD mouse model (3xTg-AD: 12-months-old; three months treatment). The data suggests that the LXR agonist GW3965 is associated with increased expression of ApoE and ABCA1 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex without a detectable reduction of the amyloid load. We also report that most cells overexpressing ApoE (86±12%) are neurons localized in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In the GW3965 treated 3xTg-AD mice we also observed reduction in astrogliosis and increased number of stem and proliferating cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Additionally, we show that GW3965 rescued hippocampus long term synaptic plasticity, which had been disrupted by oligomeric amyloid beta peptides. The effect of GW3965 on synaptic function was protein synthesis dependent. Our findings identify alternative functional/molecular mechanisms by which LXR agonists may exert their potential benefits as a therapeutic strategy against AD."
https://openalex.org/W2206117476,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) have promise for regenerative medicine due to their auto-renovation and differentiation capacities. Nevertheless, there are several ethical and methodological issues about these cells that have not been resolved. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAEC) have been proposed as source of pluripotent stem cells. Several groups have studied hAEC but have reported inconsistencies about their pluripotency properties. The aim of the present study was the in vitro characterization of hAEC collected from a Mexican population in order to identify transcription factors involved in the pluripotency circuitry and to determine their epigenetic state. Finally, we evaluated if these cells differentiate to cortical progenitors. We analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively the expression of the transcription factors of pluripotency (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 and REX1) by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR in hAEC. Also, we determined the presence of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, E-cadherin, KLF4, TFE3 as well as the proliferation and epigenetic state by immunocytochemistry of the cells. Finally, hAEC were differentiated towards cortical progenitors using a protocol of two stages. Here we show that hAEC, obtained from a Mexican population and cultured in vitro (P0-P3), maintained the expression of several markers strongly involved in pluripotency maintenance (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, TFE3, KLF4, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-60 and E-cadherin). Finally, when hAEC were treated with growth factors and small molecules, they expressed markers characteristic of cortical progenitors (TBR2, OTX2, NeuN and β-III-tubulin). Our results demonstrated that hAEC express naïve pluripotent markers (KLF4, REX1 and TFE3) as well as the cortical neuron phenotype after differentiation. This highlights the need for further investigation of hAEC as a possible source of hPSC."

Grose R. Fibroblast growth factor signalling: from development to cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar). The mammalian FGF signaling is mediated by the interaction of specific secreted FGFs (i.e. FGF1 to FGF10) that work in conjunction with a specialized class of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, the FGF receptors (FGFR1 to FGFR4). Formation of a complex between the dimeric FGFR and its FGF ligand dimer triggers a cascade of intracellular processes relayed by mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) such as Erk1 (official gene name: Mapk3) and Erk2 (Mapk1), PI-3/Akt kinase system, and other kinases. Upon entering the nucleus, Erk1/2 kinases elicit transcription of specific DNA-binding transcription factors and/or their post-translational modifications.

Among these factors, Etv1 and Etv5 are well-established nuclear components of FGF signaling during neural development (16Guillemot F. Zimmer C. From cradle to grave: the multiple roles of fibroblast growth factors in neural development.Neuron. 2011; 71: 574-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The bZIP nuclear oncogene c-Maf encodes an important DNA-binding transcription factor that controls lens fiber cell differentiation through crystallin target genes (17Xie Q. Cvekl A. The orchestration of mammalian tissue morphogenesis through a series of coherent feed-forward loops.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 43259-43271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to the lens, c-Maf regulates T-cell (18Ho I.C. Glimcher L.H. Transcription: tantalizing times for T cells.Cell. 2002; 109: S109-S120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and chondrocyte differentiation (19MacLean H.E. Kim J.I. Glimcher M.J. Wang J. Kronenberg H.M. Glimcher L.H. Absence of transcription factor c-maf causes abnormal terminal differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral bone development.Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of MAF was found in multiple myeloma cells and is a potential therapeutic target to treat this cancer (20Chang H. Qi Q. Xu W. Patterson B. c-Maf nuclear oncoprotein is frequently expressed in multiple myeloma.Leukemia. 2007; 21: 1572-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, a thorough understanding of c-Maf transcriptional control relates not only to the basic question of embryonic development but also for dysregulated gene expression during oncogenesis. Transcriptional control of c-Maf in lens and T cells is just beginning to be understood (21Ise W. Kohyama M. Schraml B.U. Zhang T. Schwer B. Basu U. Alt F.W. Tang J. Oltz E.M. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. The transcription factor BATF controls the global regulators of class-switch recombination in both B cells and T cells.Nature Immunology. 2011; 12: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 22Rani A.

IL-2 regulates expression of C-MAF in human CD4 T cells.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression of c-Maf in the lens is regulated by a 1.3 kb promoter in combination with a 5′-located distal enhancer through autoregulation by c-Maf and direct regulation by Pax6 (17Xie Q. Cvekl A. The orchestration of mammalian tissue morphogenesis through a series of coherent feed-forward loops.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 43259-43271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As this expression system recapitulates endogenous expression of c-Maf in differentiating lens fibers, we hypothesized that the c-Maf promoter/enhancer is regulated through FGF-regulated transcription factors. Up-regulation of c-Maf in the elongating cells of the lens vesicle is followed by expression of αA-crystallin (23Wolf L. Yang Y. Wawrousek E. Cvekl A. Transcriptional regulation of mouse alpha A-crystallin gene in a 148kb Cryaa BAC and its derivates.BMC Dev. Biol. 2008; 8: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To understand the link between FGF signaling, crystallin gene expression, and lens fiber cell differentiation, we identified a 220-bp long FGF-responsive distal enhancer (DCR1) in the mouse Cryaa locus and demonstrated that DCR1 is sufficient for expression of αA-crystallin in the invaginating lens pit and is essential for αA-crystallin up-regulation in differentiating primary lens fiber cells (23Wolf L. Yang Y. Wawrousek E. Cvekl A. Transcriptional regulation of mouse alpha A-crystallin gene in a 148kb Cryaa BAC and its derivates.BMC Dev. Biol. 2008; 8: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Yang Y. Stopka T. Golestaneh N. Wang Y. Wu K. Li A. Chauhan B.K. Gao C.Y. Cveklová K. Duncan M.K. Pestell R.G. Chepelinsky A.B. Skoultchi A.I. Cvekl A. Regulation of αA-crystallin via Pax6, c-Maf, CREB and a broad domain of lens-specific chromatin.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that FGF signaling likely regulates αA-crystallin gene expression by multiple mechanisms that include c-Maf (indirectly) and DCR1 enhancer (directly). Earlier studies in different developmental and cellular systems have identified members of AP-1 (e.g. c-Jun) and Ets (e.g. Etv1 and Etv5, see above) families of transcription factors as primary nuclear effectors of FGF signaling (1Turner N. Grose R. Fibroblast growth factor signalling: from development to cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar, 25Oikawa T. Yamada T. Molecular biology of the Ets family of transcription factors.Gene. 2003; 303: 11-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which target genes are directly regulated by these AP-1 and Ets factors during lens differentiation. Herein, we first examined whether FGF2 could augment c-Maf promoter activity in cultured lens cells. We next identified a critical region (−272/−70) of the c-Maf promoter containing arrays of multiple AP-1 and Ets-binding sites. Similarly, the enhancer of αA-crystallin (DCR1) also harbors these sites. Temporal and spatial analysis of c-Jun, Etv5/ERM, c-Maf, and αA-crystallin expression in mouse embryonic lenses coupled with ChIPs and co-transfection studies support the model of joint regulation of c-Maf by c-Jun and Etv5. Down-regulation of c-Maf and c-Jun proteins, as well as Etv5 mRNAs, was also found in Erk1/2 double conditional lens mutants. The results are summarized in a model comprised of the FGF/FGFR complex, MAPK signaling cascade, nuclear factors c-Jun and Etv5, and c-Maf and Cryaa target genes. A parental 1.3-kb c-Maf promoter-EGFP reporter construct (−494/+866) is described elsewhere (17Xie Q. Cvekl A. The orchestration of mammalian tissue morphogenesis through a series of coherent feed-forward loops.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 43259-43271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A series of three c-Maf promoter deletions generating promoter fragments (Fig. 1) were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) in a pUC57 vector followed by their subcloning into a pEGFP-1 vector (Clontech). The −494/+210 c-Maf promoter fragment and its internal deletion (−272/−70) were also subcloned into a pGL3-luc vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Three copies of FRE (−272/−70) (3xFRE) fused to a minimal E4TATA promoter (26Chauhan B.K. Yang Y. Cveklová K. Cvekl A. Functional interactions between alternatively spliced forms of Pax6 in crystallin gene regulation and in haploinsufficiency.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1696-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were also synthesized by GenScript to generate a plasmid 3xFRE/luc. The mouse αA-crystallin promoter and promoter/DCR1-luciferase constructs are described elsewhere (24Yang Y. Stopka T. Golestaneh N. Wang Y. Wu K. Li A. Chauhan B.K. Gao C.Y. Cveklová K. Duncan M.K.

Primary cultures of embryonic chick lens epithelial cells (DCDMLs) were prepared from E10 chick lenses and plated at 1.2 × 105 cells/well onto laminin-coated 96-well tissue culture plates as previously described (28Le A.C. Musil L.S. Normal differentiation of cultured lens cells after inhibition of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication.Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the absence of serum in M199 medium plus BOTS (2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mg/ml ovotransferrin, 30 nm selenium), penicillin G, and streptomycin (M199/BOTS). One day after plating, DCDML cultures were transfected in M199 medium using Lipofectamine 2000 (GibcoBRL) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Five hours after transfection, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN). Six days later, the cells were solubilized directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled. Equal amounts (10 μg) of total protein were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and the blots were probed with the JL-8 anti-GFP antibody from Clontech (MountainView, CA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and the LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey infrared imaging system (Lincoln, NE). The mutants of Ets binding sites in Cryaa DCR1 enhancer were generated by PCR mutagenesis. For these mutant constructs, primary lens explants were obtained from 3-day-old rat lenses, 2 μg of reporter, and 50 ng of CMV Renilla reference plasmids were transfected with Effecten system (Qiagen) as described elsewhere (29Golestaneh N.

Biol. 2005; 351: 453-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). c-Jun and Etv5 cDNAs in a pCMV6 vector were obtained from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD). Briefly, 0.5 μg of the reporter gene, 800 ng of cDNA plasmids (800 ng pCMV6, 400 ng of c-Jun, and 400 ng of pCMV6, 400 ng of ERM and 400 ng pCMV6, 400 ng of c-Jun and 400 ng of ERM), and 20 ng (MCF-7) or 0.25 ng (αTN4) of Renilla-TK were cotransfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 24-well microplates. Transfection studies of the wild type and mutated DCR1 Cryaa enhancer in 3-day-old rat explants were conducted as described elsewhere (24Yang Y. Stopka T. Golestaneh N. Wang Y. Wu K. Li A. Chauhan B.K. Gao C.Y. Cveklová K. Duncan M.K. Pestell R.G. Chepelinsky A.B. Skoultchi A.I. Cvekl A. Regulation of αA-crystallin via Pax6, c-Maf, CREB and a broad domain of lens-specific chromatin.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used to measure promoter activity. The cells were harvested 36 h after the transfection, and the relative firefly luciferase reporter activities were measured by the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The firefly luciferase activities were normalized by Renilla luciferase as an internal control. The wild type (WT) 1.3-kb c-Maf promoter/EGFP reporter transgenic mouse was generated earlier (17Xie Q. Cvekl A. The orchestration of mammalian tissue morphogenesis through a series of coherent feed-forward loops.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 43259-43271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The EGFP/transgenic reporter construct with deletion of the −272/−70 FGF responsive element (ΔFRE) was generated by subcloning the synthesized fragment described above into a peGFP-1 vector (Clontech). The transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection of fertilized eggs at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) Transgenic Core Facility. EGFP expression was detected by immunofluorescence using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope as described elsewhere (17Xie Q. Cvekl A. The orchestration of mammalian tissue morphogenesis through a series of coherent feed-forward loops.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 43259-43271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Double conditional knock out (DCKO) mice with deletion of Erk1/2 were generated by crossing Le-CRE mice with Erk1−/−; Erk2F/F mice. The detailed procedures to obtain the embryos were described for the Erk2/Mapk1 model earlier (13Upadhya D. Ogata M. Reneker L.W. MAPK1 is required for establishing the pattern of cell proliferation and for cell survival during lens development.Development. 2013; 140: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lens fiber cell differentiation was analyzed in both E12.5 and E13.5 embryos. The Erk1−/−; Erk2F/F littermates with no detectable lens defects served as controls for the double conditional KO (DCKO) mice. For staining of tissues on frozen sections, paraformaldehyde (4%) fixed embryos were cryoprotected with a PBS-buffered 30% sucrose and embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC) for cryosectioning. 8-μm transverse sections were collected, washed with PBS, and incubated for 30 min with Image iT™ FX signal enhancer (Invitrogen). For staining of DCKO Erk1/2 mice tissue, dissected embryos were fixed in 10% formalin overnight. Formalin-fixed embryos were dehydrated through an ethanol gradient. Tissues were processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. Paraffin sections were incubated for 1 h at 60 °C, deparaffinized in xylene three times for 5 min, washed in 100% ethanol twice for 3 min, followed by incubation in 95, 80, and 70% ethanol for 3 min in each step. To retrieve the antigens, the slides were boiled in a 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.9) for 20 min in a vegetable steamer. Slides were cooled for 20 min and washed twice with PBS for 10 min. From this stage, both paraffin and frozen sections were processed using the same procedure. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen, A-11122), rabbit anti-c-Maf (1:2000, Bethyl, A300–613A, or 1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-7866), c-Jun (1:1000, Abcam, ab31419), phospho-c-Jun (1:50, Cell Signaling, cat. 9621), αB-crystallin (1:500, Enzo Life Science, ADI-SPA-223), β- and γ-crystallin antibodies (1:100, 1:50, Santa Cruz 22745 and 22746, respectively), ERM (1:1000, Santa Cruz, sc-22807) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Triton-X100. Antibodies against αA-crystallin (1:500) were described elsewhere (13Upadhya D. Ogata M. Reneker L.W. MAPK1 is required for establishing the pattern of cell proliferation and for cell survival during lens development.Development. 2013; 140: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (1:500, Invitrogen), and with DAPI (1:50000, Invitrogen). Slides were then washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence was visualized by using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope and a Leica SP5 confocal microscope in the AECOM core facility. The intensities of the immunofluorescence signals of c-Maf, c-Jun, and phospho-c-Jun in the E12.5 and E13.5 lens were calculated by percentage of the staining positive cells in whole lens tissue (the number of staining positive cells/total number of lens cells stained by DAPI). The cells were counted three times. Student t-tests were performed by the R-project tool to establish the significance of changes of the protein expression in wild type and DCKO mouse lens. Cryosections (12 μm) of embryos were fixed by 4% PFA at 4 °C for overnight were used for in situ hybridization using standard protocols as described elsewhere (31Liu W. Lagutin O. Swindell E. Jamrich M. Oliver G. Neuroretina specification in mouse embryos requires Six3-mediated suppression of Wnt8b in the anterior neural plate.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3568-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, Digoxin-labeled antisense RNA probes were generated via in vitro transcription using the linearized template plasmids Etv5 (Open Biosystems). Antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer for 40 min prior the use of crystallin-specific antibodies. The c-Maf, c-Jun, ERM, and phospho-c-Jun immunofluorescence signals of control and Erk1/2 DCKO lenses from three sequential slides were measured by Image J software from NIH with a fixed threshold. The tissue areas were selected for measurements were based on the expression pattern in the control lens, and corresponding areas in WT and DCKO lens were analyzed. The software program quantifies the average fluorescence intensity of the selected area in each tissue. Student's t-tests were performed by R-project tool to establish the significance of differences in the intensity of staining between control and DCKO mouse lens as described elsewhere (32Wolf L.

The sequence alignment was conducted using the Institute Pasteur server. Formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was obtained from a pool of 400 mouse newborn lenses (CD1 mouse, Charles River Laboratories, Cambridge, MA).

We show here that TgSkp1 hydroxyproline is modified by a similar pentasaccharide, based on mass spectrometry, and that assembly of the first three sugars is dependent on Toxoplasma homologs of Gnt1 and PgtA. Reconstitution of the glycosyltransferase reactions in extracts with radioactive sugar nucleotide substrates and appropriate Skp1 glycoforms, followed by chromatographic analysis of acid hydrolysates of the reaction products, confirmed the predicted sugar identities as GlcNAc, Gal, and Fuc. Disruptions of gnt1 or pgtA resulted in decreased parasite growth. Off target effects were excluded based on restoration of the normal glycan chain and growth upon genetic complementation. By analogy to Dictyostelium Skp1, the mechanism may involve regulation of assembly of the SCF complex.

https://openalex.org/W2204358229,"Accumulation and retention of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) has been reported within post viral-encephalitic brains, however, the full extent to which these cells modulate neuroinflammation is yet to be elucidated. Here, we used Foxp3-DTR (diphtheria toxin receptor) knock-in transgenic mice, which upon administration of low dose diphtheria toxin (DTx) results in specific deletion of Tregs. We investigated the proliferation status of various immune cell subtypes within inflamed central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Depletion of Tregs resulted in increased proliferation of both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell subsets within the brain at 14 d post infection (dpi) when compared to Treg-sufficient animals. At 30 dpi, while proliferation of CD8+ T-cells was controlled within brains of both Treg-depleted and undepleted mice, proliferation of CD4+ T-cells remained significantly enhanced with DTx-treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated that Treg numbers within the brain rebound following DTx treatment to even higher numbers than in untreated animals. Despite this rebound, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells proliferated at a higher rate when compared to that of Treg-sufficient mice, thus maintaining sustained neuroinflammation. Furthermore, at 30 dpi we found the majority of CD8+ T-cells were CD127hi KLRG1- indicating that the cells were long lived memory precursor cells. These cells showed marked elevation of CD103 expression, a marker of tissue resident-memory T-cells (TRM) in the CNS, in untreated animals when compared to DTx-treated animals suggesting that generation of TRM is impaired upon Treg depletion. Moreover, the effector function of TRM as indicated by granzyme B production in response to peptide re-stimulation was found to be more potent in Treg-sufficient animals. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Tregs limit neuroinflammatory responses to viral infection by controlling cell proliferation and may direct a larger proportion of lymphocytes within the brain to be maintained as TRM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2208153416,"Introduction Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are promising for cartilage regeneration because BMSCs can differentiate into cartilage tissue-producing chondrocytes. Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) is crucial for inducing chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs and is known to signal via Activin receptor-Like Kinase (ALK) receptors ALK5 and ALK1. Since the specific role of these two TGFβ receptors in chondrogenesis is unknown, we investigated whether ALK5 and ALK1 are expressed in BMSCs and whether both receptors are required for chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Materials & Methods ALK5 and ALK1 gene expression in human BMSCs was determined with RT-qPCR. To induce chondrogenesis, human BMSCs were pellet-cultured in serum-free chondrogenic medium containing TGFβ1. Chondrogenesis was evaluated by aggrecan and collagen type IIα1 RT-qPCR analysis, and histological stainings of proteoglycans and collagen type II. To overexpress constitutively active (ca) receptors, BMSCs were transduced either with caALK5 or caALK1. Expression of ALK5 and ALK1 was downregulated by transducing BMSCs with shRNA against ALK5 or ALK1. Results ALK5 and ALK1 were expressed in in vitro-expanded as well as in pellet-cultured BMSCs from five donors, but mRNA levels of both TGFβ receptors did not clearly associate with chondrogenic induction. TGFβ increased ALK5 and decreased ALK1 gene expression in chondrogenically differentiating BMSC pellets. Neither caALK5 nor caALK1 overexpression induced cartilage matrix formation as efficient as that induced by TGFβ. Moreover, short hairpin-mediated downregulation of either ALK5 or ALK1 resulted in a strong inhibition of TGFβ-induced chondrogenesis. Conclusion ALK5 as well as ALK1 are required for TGFβ-induced chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and TGFβ not only directly induces chondrogenesis, but also modulates ALK5 and ALK1 receptor signaling in BMSCs. These results imply that optimizing cartilage formation by mesenchymal stem cells will depend on activation of both receptors."

After five months, the improvement of BCVA remained statistically significant compared with baseline values (p = 0.022); retinal sensitivity improvement was statistically significant for up to four months after the IVOI (p = 0.059). Moreover, central macular thickness significantly decreased for up to four months. Interestingly, PERG and mfERG values did not change significantly for up to four months post-IVOI, but then began to worsen.In eyes with DME, intravitreal dexamethasone implant determined morphological and functional improvement as soon as one month and for up to four months after the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2201301832,"Background Hypertrophic scars are one of the most important complications in surgery due to their cosmetic and functional impairments. Previous studies in tissue fibrotic disorders have shown promising results by inhibiting the biological activity effect of Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1). The aim of the current study was to determine the clinical effect of the inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling in human hypertrophic scars implanted in nude mice by topical application of an inhibitor of TGF-β1 (P144®). Material and Methods A total of 30 human hypertrophic scars were implanted in 60 nude mice. The animals were divided in two groups, group A (placebo) and group B (treatment). Group C (basal) was considered as the preimplanted scar samples and they were not implanted in the nude mice. After the shedding period, topical application of a lipogel containing placebo (group A) or P144 (group B) was daily administered during two weeks. The animals were sacrificed upon completion of the study. Total area, thickness and collagen fibers area were measure and compared across all groups. Immunohistochemistry was also performed in order to quantify collagen type I and type III and elastic fiber expressions present in the dermis. Results Successful shedding was achieved in 83,3% of the xenografts. The mean time for shedding was 35±5.4 days. Statistically significant differences were found in the total area, collagen fibers area and thickness between the groups. Increased elastic fibers and decreased collagen I were found in the P144-treated group compared to the basal group. Conclusion Topical application of an inhibitor of TGF-β1 may promote scar maturation and clinical improvement of hypertrophic scar morphology features in an “in vivo” model in nude mice after two weeks of treatment."

Although the cellular mechanism of IL-15 trans-presentation via IL-15Rα and its importance for IL-15 function have been described, the full effect of the IL-15:IL-15Rα configuration on responding cells is not yet known. We found that trans-presenting IL-15:IL-15Rα in a multivalent fashion on the surface of antigen-encapsulating nanoparticles enhanced the ability of nanoparticle-treated dendritic cells (DCs) to stimulate antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Localization of multivalent IL-15:IL-15Rα and encapsulated antigen to the same DC led to maximal T cell responses. Strikingly, DCs incubated with IL-15:IL-15Rα-coated nanoparticles displayed higher levels of functional IL-15 on the cell surface, implicating a mechanism for nanoparticle-mediated transfer of IL-15 to the DC surface. Using artificial antigen-presenting cells to highlight the effect of IL-15 configuration on DCs, we showed that artificial antigen-presenting cells presenting IL-15:IL-15Rα increased the sensitivity and magnitude of the T cell response, whereas IL-2 enhanced the T cell response only when delivered in a paracrine fashion. Therefore, the mode of cytokine presentation (configuration) is important for optimal immune responses. We tested the effect of configuration dependence in an aggressive model of murine melanoma and demonstrated significantly delayed tumor progression induced by IL-15:IL-15Rα-coated nanoparticles in comparison with monovalent IL-15:IL-15Rα.

https://openalex.org/W2217915050,"The coral reefs at the northernmost tip of Sabah, Borneo will be established under a marine protected area: the Tun Mustapha Park (TMP) by the end of 2015. This area is a passage where the Sulu Sea meets the South China Sea and it is situated at the border of the area of maximum marine biodiversity, the Coral Triangle. The TMP includes fringing and patch reefs established on a relatively shallow sea floor. Surveys were carried out to examine features of the coral reefs in terms of scleractinian species richness, and benthic reef assemblages following the Reef Check substrate categories, with emphasis on hard coral cover. Variation in scleractinian diversity was based on the species composition of coral families Fungiidae (n = 39), Agariciidae (n = 30) and Euphylliidae (n = 15). The number of coral species was highest at reefs with a larger depth gradient i.e. at the periphery of the study area and in the deep South Banggi Channel. Average live hard coral cover across the sites was 49%. Only 7% of the examined reefs had > 75% hard coral cover, while the majority of the reef sites were rated fair (51%) and good (38%). Sites with low coral cover and high rubble fragments are evidence of blast fishing, although the observed damage appeared old. Depth was a dominant factor in influencing the coral species composition and benthic reef communities in the TMP. Besides filling in the information gaps regarding species richness and benthic cover for reef areas that were previously without any data, the results of this study together with information that is already available on the coral reefs of TMP will be used to make informed decisions on zoning plans for conservation priorities in the proposed park."
https://openalex.org/W2215753369,"The clam Macridiscus multifarius with a planktonic larval stage of about 10 days is an ecologically and economically important species in the coastal regions of China. In this study, 3 mt-DNA markers (COI, 12S rRNA, and ND1) were used to investigate the population structure and demography of wild M. multifarius populations in 3 coastal localities of the East China Sea (ZS and ZP populations) and Beibu Gulf in the South China Sea (BH population). Sequences of 685 bp in COI, 350 bp in 12S rRNA, and 496 bp in ND1 were determined. High level and significant FST values were obtained among the different localities on the basis of either COI (FST = 0.100-0.444, p < 0.05) or 12S rRNA (FST = 0.199-0.742, p < 0.05) gene, indicating a high degree of genetic differentiation among the populations. FST values were significant but weak for the ND1 gene because it is highly conservative. The median-joining network suggested an obvious genetic differentiation between ZS and BH populations, and the finding is consistent with the results of our demographic analyses using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean. Our study unraveled the extant population genetic structure of M. multifarius and explained the strong population structure of a species with a short planktonic larval stage species; this information could be useful for fishery management measures, including artificial breeding and conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2215597981,"Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of nerve repellent factors in regulation of the imbalanced innervation of endometriosis. This prospective study aims to explore the role of Sema 3A in regulating aberrant sympathetic innervation in peritoneal and deep infiltrating endometriosis. Ectopic endometriotic lesion were collected from patients with peritoneal endometriosis (n = 24) and deep infiltrating endometriosis of uterosacral ligament (n = 20) undergoing surgery for endometriosis. Eutopic endometrial samples were collected from patients with endometriosis (n = 22) or without endometriosis (n = 26). Healthy peritoneum (n = 13) from the lateral pelvic wall and healthy uterosacral ligament (n = 13) were obtained from patients who had no surgical and histological proof of endometriosis during hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. Firstly, we studied the immunostaining of Sema 3A, Plexin A1 and NRP-1 in all the tissues described above. Then we studied the nerve fiber density (NFD) of endometriosis-associated (sympathetic) nerve and para-endometriotic (sympathetic) nerve by double immunofluorescence staining. Finally we analyzed the relationship between expression of Sema 3A in stromal cells of endometriotic lesion and the aberrant innervation of endometriosis. Semi-quantitative immunostaining demonstrated that (1) Higher immunostaining of Sema 3A were found in the eutopic endometrial glandular epithelial cells from patients with endometriosis (p = 0.041) than those without endometriosis; (2) Sema 3A immunostaining was higher in glandular epithelial cells of peritoneal endometriosis (P<0.001) and deep infiltrating endometriotic lesions of uterosacral ligament (P = 0.028)compared with glandular epithelial cells of the endometrium from women with endometriosis, while its expression in ectopic stormal cells in both groups were significantly lower than that from eutopic endometrium of women without endometirosis (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). NFDs of Anti-TH (+) endometriosis-associated sympathetic nerve of peritoneal endometriosis (p<0.001) and deep endometriosis of uterosacral ligament (p<0.001) were significantly lower than NFDs of para-endometriotic sympathetic nerve. Our results suggest that Sema 3A may contribute to the regulation of aberrant sympathetic innervation in peritoneal and deep infiltrating endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W2221238746,"Previous Studies have mapped putative loci that may probably regulate leukocyte telomere length (LTL). The strongest associations with LTL were reported for SNP rs12696304 and rs16847897 near the non-coding Ribose Nucleic Acid (RNA) molecule component (TERC) of telomerase enzyme on 3q26. It is unclear whether these identified loci coding functional components of telomerase, exert a similar effect on LTL in other populations or influence risk factors of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The present study was performed to: study the influence of TERC polymorphisms on LTL, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), indices of obesity and explore the potential associations with T2DM. 225 T2DM patients and 245 age and sex matched controls were studied. Allelic Discrimination (AD) genotyping was utilized to determine TERC SNPs [rs12696304 and rs16847897]. hTERT, adiponectin, Insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), and LTL were measured. Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were recorded. [CC] genotype of rs16847897 was significantly associated with shorter LTL [OR = 1.6, p = 0.004], lower hTERT levels [OR = 0.4, p = 0.006], higher BMI [OR = 2.2, p = 0.006], larger WC [OR = 23.4, p = 0.007] and hypo-adiponectemia [OR = 0.6, p = 0.006]. [GG] genotype of rs12696304 was also significantly associated with shorter LTL [OR = 1.5, p = 0.004], lower hTERT [OR = 0.7, p = 0.006] but with larger WC[OR = 5.3, p = 0.004]. [CC] genotype of rs16847897 and [GG] genotype of rs12696304 together increased the risk of T2DM significantly [OR = 1.7, p = 0.004]. We provide insights connecting a structure that is critically involved in maintaining genomic stability with obesity and T2DM. Given the central role of telomere length in determining telomere function our findings may expand our understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying age associated conditions such as T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2218162960,"The movement of fluid and solutes across biological membranes facilitates the transport of nutrients for living organisms and maintains the fluid and osmotic pressures in biological systems. Understanding the pressure balances across membranes is crucial for studying fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in living systems, and is an area of active research. In this study, a set of enhanced Kedem-Katchalsky (KK) equations is proposed to describe fluxes of water and solutes across biological membranes, and is applied to analyze the relationship between fluid and osmotic pressures, accounting for active transport mechanisms that propel substances against their concentration gradients and for fixed charges that alter ionic distributions in separated environments. The equilibrium analysis demonstrates that the proposed theory recovers the Donnan osmotic pressure and can predict the correct fluid pressure difference across membranes, a result which cannot be achieved by existing KK theories due to the neglect of fixed charges. The steady-state analysis on active membranes suggests a new pressure mechanism which balances the fluid pressure together with the osmotic pressure. The source of this pressure arises from active ionic fluxes and from interactions between solvent and solutes in membrane transport. We apply the proposed theory to study the transendothelial fluid pressure in the in vivo cornea, which is a crucial factor maintaining the hydration and transparency of the tissue. The results show the importance of the proposed pressure mechanism in mediating stromal fluid pressure and provide a new interpretation of the pressure modulation mechanism in the in vivo cornea."

It is critical to gain insights into fruit ripening and softening to improve apple fruit quality and extend shelf life. In this study, forward and reverse suppression subtractive hybridization libraries were generated from 'Taishanzaoxia' apple fruits sampled around the ethylene climacteric to isolate ripening- and softening-related genes. A set of 648 unigenes were derived from sequence alignment and cluster assembly of 918 expressed sequence tags. According to gene ontology functional classification, 390 out of 443 unigenes (88%) were assigned to the biological process category, 356 unigenes (80%) were classified in the molecular function category, and 381 unigenes (86%) were allocated to the cellular component category. A total of 26 unigenes differentially expressed during fruit development period were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. These genes were involved in cell wall modification, anthocyanin biosynthesis, aroma production, stress response, metabolism, transcription, or were non-annotated. Some genes associated with cell wall modification, anthocyanin biosynthesis and aroma production were up-regulated and significantly correlated with ethylene production, suggesting that fruit texture, coloration and aroma may be regulated by ethylene in 'Taishanzaoxia'. Some of the identified unigenes associated with fruit ripening and softening have not been characterized in public databases. The results contribute to an improved characterization of changes in gene expression during apple fruit ripening and softening."

It is essential to identify knee and hip osteoarthritis patients with a neuropathic pain profile in order to offer such patients education and additional treatment options besides conventional pain treatment. The painDETECT Questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire developed to discriminate between nociceptive and neuropathic pain. This questionnaire was modified to fit patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the modified painDETECT Questionnaire to the Dutch language and to provide a modified version to fit patients with hip osteoarthritis. Reliability for internal consistency, repeatability and floor and ceiling effects were subsequently assessed. A total of 278 patients were included in the reliability study and 123 patients in the repeatability analysis. The Dutch modified painDETECT Questionnaire shows good internal consistency and small relative measurement errors, represented by a good intraclass correlation coefficient. Absolute measurement error, represented by the Standard Error of Measurement, was acceptable. However, a measurement bias might be present when it comes to repeatability. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a Dutch modified painDETECT Questionnaire to fit hip and knee osteoarthritis patients and to assess internal consistency, reliability and agreement. International guidelines were followed in the translation process and this study has ample sample size with an adequate time interval for repeatability. Based on this study, the Dutch modified painDETECT Questionnaire seems to be fit as a discriminative tool to identify knee and hip osteoarthritis patients with a neuropathic pain profile. Whether it is also suitable as an evaluative tool to record changes over time or after an intervention remains open to further investigation."

Whereas population genetics data for the latter have been released in the last few years, such information is still missing for N. apis. Here we analyze the patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at three single-copy loci (PTP2, PTP3 and RPB1) in a collection of Apis mellifera isolates from all over the world, naturally infected either with N. apis (N = 22) or N. ceranae (N = 23), to provide new insights into the genetic diversity, demography and evolution of N. apis, as well as to compare them with evidence from N. ceranae. Neutral variation in N. apis and N. ceranae is of the order of 1%. This amount of diversity suggests that there is no substantial differentiation between the genetic content of the two nuclei present in these parasites, and evidence for genetic recombination provides a putative mechanism for the flow of genetic information between chromosomes. The analysis of the frequency spectrum of neutral variants reveals a significant surplus of low frequency variants, particularly in N. ceranae, and suggests that the populations of the two pathogens are not in mutation-drift equilibrium and that they have experienced a population expansion. Most of the variation in both species occurs within honey bee colonies (between 62%-90% of the total genetic variance), although in N. apis there is evidence for differentiation between parasites isolated from distinct A. mellifera lineages (20%-34% of the total variance), specifically between those collected from lineages A and C (or M). This scenario is consistent with a long-term host-parasite relationship and contrasts with the lack of differentiation observed among host-lineages in N. ceranae (< 4% of the variance), which suggests that the spread of this emergent pathogen throughout the A. mellifera worldwide population is a recent event."

Trends in HPV-associated cancers in Asia have not been as well described. We describe the epidemiology of potentially HPV-related cancers reported to the Singapore Cancer Registry from 1968-2012. Analysis included 998 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), 183 anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) and 8,019 invasive cervical cancer (ICC) cases. Additionally, 368 anal non-squamous cell carcinoma (ANSCC) and 2,018 non-oropharyngeal head and neck carcinoma (non-OP HNC) cases were included as comparators. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were determined by gender and ethnicity (Chinese, Malay and Indian). Joinpoint regression was used to evaluate annual percentage change (APC) in incidence. OPSCC incidence increased in both genders (men 1993-2012, APC = 1.9%, p<0.001; women 1968-2012, APC = 2.0%, p = 0.01) and was 5 times higher in men than women. In contrast, non-OP HNC incidence declined between 1968-2012 among men (APC = -1.6%, p<0.001) and women (APC = -0.4%, p = 0.06). ASCC and ANSCC were rare (ASR = 0.2 and 0.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively) and did not change significantly over time except for increasing ANSCCs in men (APC = 2.8%, p<0.001). ICC was the most common HPV-associated cancer (ASR = 19.9 per 100,000 person-years) but declined significantly between 1968-2012 (APC = -2.4%). Incidence of each cancer varied across ethnicities. Similar to trends in Western countries, OPSCC incidence increased in recent years, while non-OP HNC decreased. ICC remains the most common HPV-related cancer in Singapore, but Pap screening programs have led to consistently decreasing incidence."

Transient exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers can result in improvement in hypertension. Male rats whose mothers received a low protein diet during the last half of pregnancy were given either vehicle, continuous enalapril (CE) in their drinking water or were given transient enalapril exposure (TE) after weaning at 21 days of age. The TE group had enalapril in their drinking water for 21 days starting from day 21 of life. All rats were studied at 6 months of age. Vehicle treated rats whose mothers were fed a low protein diet were hypertensive, had albuminuria, and demonstrated upregulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system as evidenced by higher urinary angiotensinogen and urinary angiotensin II levels. In low protein rats both continuous and transient exposure to enalapril normalized blood pressure, urinary angiotensinogen and urinary angiotensin II levels at 6 months of age, but only continuous administration of enalapril decreased urinary albumin excretion. These data support the importance of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system in mediating hypertension in programmed rats and transient exposure to enalapril can reprogram the hypertension and dysregulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system."

Our overall goal is to explore whether using stem cells in an aggregate form may be advantageous in these applications. 3D stem cell aggregates hold great promise as they may recapitulate the in vivo skeletal tissue condensation, a property that is not typically observed in 2D culture. We considered two different stem cell sources, human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly cells (hWJCs, currently being used in clinical trials) and rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). The objective of the current study was to compare the influence of cell phenotype, aggregate size, and aggregate number on chondrogenic differentiation in a generic hydrogel (agarose) platform. Despite being differing cell sources, both rBMSC and hWJC aggregates were consistent in outperforming cell suspension control groups in biosynthesis and chondrogenesis. Higher cell density impacted biosynthesis favorably, and the number of aggregates positively influenced chondrogenesis. Therefore, we recommend that investigators employing hydrogels consider using cells in an aggregate form for enhanced chondrogenic performance."
https://openalex.org/W2203139256,"Breast cancer cells generally develop resistance to TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) and, therefore, assistance from sensitizers is required. In our study, we have demonstrated that Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor Bay 61-3606 was identified as a TRAIL sensitizer. Amplification of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by Bay 61-3606 was accompanied by the strong activation of Bak, caspases, and DNA fragmentation. In mechanism of action, Bay 61-3606 sensitized cells to TRAIL via two mechanisms regulating myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1). First, Bay 61-3606 triggered ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Mcl-1 by regulating Mcl-1 phosphorylation. Second, Bay 61-3606 downregulates Mcl-1 expression at the transcription level. In this context, Bay 61-3606 acted as an inhibitor of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) 9 rather than Syk. In summary, Bay 61-3606 downregulates Mcl-1 expression in breast cancer cells and sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2205259920,"The cornea is a complex tissue that must preserve its transparency to maintain optimal vision. However, in some circumstances, damage to the eye can result in neovascularization that impairs vision. This outcome can occur when herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes the immunoinflammatory lesion stromal keratitis (SK). Potentially useful measures to control the severity of SK are to target angiogenesis which with herpetic SK invariably involves VEGF. One such way to control angiogenesis involves the endothelial receptor Robo4 (R4), which upon interaction with another protein activates an antiangiogenic pathway that counteracts VEGF downstream signaling. In this study we show that mice unable to produce R4 because of gene knockout developed significantly higher angiogenesis after HSV-1 ocular infection than did infected wild type (WT) controls. Moreover, providing additional soluble R4 (sR4) protein by subconjunctival administration to R4 KO HSV-1 infected mice substantially rescued the WT phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2218624900,"Background Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have a high prevalence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and individual risk behavior does not fully explain the higher prevalence when compared with other MSM. Using the social-ecological framework, we evaluated individual, social and sexual network, and structural factors and their association with prevalent STIs among Black MSM. Methods The HIV Prevention Trials Network 061 was a multi-site cohort study designed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component intervention for Black MSM in six US cities. Baseline assessments included demographics, risk behavior, and social and sexual network questions collected information about the size, nature and connectedness of their sexual network. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of having any prevalent sexually transmitted infection (gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis). Results A total of 1,553 Black MSM were enrolled in this study. In multivariate analysis, older age (aOR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.49–0.66, p<0.001) was associated with a lower odds of having a prevalent STI. Compared with reporting one male sexual partner, having 2–3 partners (aOR = 1.74; 95% CI 1.08–2.81, p<0.024) or more than 4 partners (aOR = 2.29; 95% CI 1.43–3.66, p<0.001) was associated with prevalent STIs. Having both Black and non-Black sexual partners (aOR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.45–0.99, p = 0.042) was the only sexual network factor associated with prevalent STIs. Conclusions Age and the number and racial composition of sexual partners were associated with prevalent STIs among Black MSM, while other sexual network factors were not. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of the individual, network, and structural factors on prevalent STIs among Black MSM to inform combination interventions to reduce STIs among these men."

Remote ischemic conditioning (rIC) performed as brief intermittent sub-lethal ischemia and reperfusion episodes in a distant organ may protect the kidney against IRI. Here we investigated the renal effects of rIC applied either prior to (remote ischemic preconditioning; rIPC) or during (remote ischemic perconditioning; rIPerC) sustained ischemic kidney injury in rats. The effects were evaluated as differences in creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate, tissue tubular damage marker expression, and potential kidney recovery mediators. One week after undergoing right-sided nephrectomy, rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham (n = 7), ischemia and reperfusion (IR; n = 10), IR+rIPC (n = 10), and IR+rIPerC (n = 10). The rIC was performed as four repeated episodes of 5-minute clamping of the infrarenal aorta followed by 5-minute release either before or during 37 minutes of left renal artery clamping representing the IRI. Urine and blood were sampled prior to ischemia as well as 3 and 7 days after reperfusion. The kidney was harvested for mRNA and protein isolation. Seven days after IRI, the CrCl change from baseline values was similar in the IR (δ: 0.74 mL/min/kg [-0.45 to 1.94]), IR+rIPC (δ: 0.21 mL/min/kg [-0.75 to 1.17], p > 0.9999), and IR+rIPerC (δ: 0.41 mL/min/kg [-0.43 to 1.25], p > 0.9999) groups. Kidney function recovery was associated with a significant up-regulation of phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt), extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2), and heat shock proteins (HSPs) pHSP27, HSP32, and HSP70, but rIC was not associated with any significant differences in tubular damage, inflammatory, or fibrosis marker expression. In our study, rIC did not protect the kidney against IRI. However, on days 3-7 after IRI, all groups recovered renal function. This was associated with pAkt and pERK1/2 up-regulation and increased HSP expression at day 7."

However, due to the increasing severity of urban environmental pollution issues and the development of a resource-saving and environmentally friendly social philosophy, the development of low-carbon and energy-efficient urban transport is required. This paper first defines vehicular trajectories and the calculation of vehicular emissions based on VSP. Next, a regression analysis method is used to quantify the relationship between vehicular emissions and delay, and a traffic signal control model is established to reduce emissions and delay using the enumeration method combined with saturation constraints. Finally, one typical intersection of Changchun is selected to verify the model proposed in this paper; its performance efficiency is also compared using simulations in VISSIM. The results of this study show that the proposed model can significantly reduce vehicle delay and traffic emissions simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W2203668568,"Wild edible plants, ecological foodstuffs obtained from forest ecosystems, grow in natural fields, and their productivity depends on their response to harvesting by humans. Addressing exactly how wild edible plants respond to harvesting is critical because this knowledge will provide insights into how to obtain effective and sustainable ecosystem services from these plants. We focused on bamboo shoots of Sasa kurilensis, a popular wild edible plant in Japan. We examined the effects of harvesting on bamboo shoot productivity by conducting an experimental manipulation of bamboo shoot harvesting. Twenty experimental plots were prepared in the Teshio Experimental Forest of Hokkaido University and were assigned into two groups: a harvest treatment, in which newly emerged edible bamboo shoots were harvested (n = 10); and a control treatment, in which bamboo shoots were maintained without harvesting (n = 10). In the first year of harvesting (2013), bamboo shoot productivities were examined twice; i.e., the productivity one day after harvesting and the subsequent post-harvest productivity (2-46 days after harvesting), and we observed no difference in productivity between treatments. This means that there was no difference in original bamboo shoot productivity between treatments, and that harvesting did not influence productivity in the initial year. In contrast, in the following year (2014), the number of bamboo shoots in the harvested plots was 2.4-fold greater than in the control plots. These results indicate that over-compensatory growth occurred in the harvested plots in the year following harvesting. Whereas previous research has emphasized the negative impact of harvesting, this study provides the first experimental evidence that harvesting can enhance the productivity of a wild edible plant. This suggests that exploiting compensatory growth, which really amounts to less of a decline in productivity, may be s a key for the effective use of wild edible plants."
https://openalex.org/W2205608051,"For metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with controlled extrathoracic disease after systemic treatment, stable or progressive primary lung lesions may cause respiratory symptoms and increase comorbidities. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether aggressive palliative thoracic radiotherapy (RT) can enhance local control and improve the survival for this subgroup of patients.Between March 2006 and December 2014, 56 patients with metastatic NSCLC who had responsive or stable extrathoracic diseases after chemotherapy and/or molecular targets, and received thoracic RT for stable and progressive primary lung lesions were included. RT with a median dose of 55 Gy (range, 40-62 Gy) was administered in 1.8-2.5 Gy fractions to primary lung tumor and regional mediastinal lymph nodes using modern RT technique. Overall survival (OS) from diagnosis, and locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), and survival calculated from radiotherapy (OS-RT) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.There were 37 men and 19 women with a median age of 60 years at diagnosis. The median interval from the diagnosis of metastatic disease to thoracic RT was 8 months. Following thoracic RT, 26 patients (46%) achieved complete or partial response (overall response rate, ORR). Patients with squamous cell carcinoma or poorly-differentiated carcinoma had a higher ORR than those with adenocarcinoma (63% vs. 34%, P = 0.034). EGFR mutations was closely associated with a better ORR (45% vs. 29%, P = 0.284). At a median follow-up time of 44 months, the median OS, LRPFS after RT, and OS-RT were 50 months, 15 months, and 18 months.Radical palliative throractic RT is safe and might be beneficial for primary lung lesions of metastatic NSCLC patients with controlled extrathoracic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2211122514,"Acute inflammation either resolves or proceeds to fibrotic repair that replaces functional tissue. Pro-fibrotic hedgehog signaling and induction of its Gli transcription factor in pericytes induces fibrosis in kidney, but molecular instructions connecting inflammation to fibrosis are opaque. We show acute kidney inflammation resulting from chronic ingestion of the common xenobiotic ethanol initiates Gli1 transcription and hedgehog synthesis in kidney pericytes, and promotes renal fibrosis. Ethanol ingestion stimulated transcription of TGF-ß, collagens I and IV, and alpha-smooth muscle actin with accumulation of these proteins. This was accompanied by deposition of extracellular fibrils. Ethanol catabolism by CYP2E1 in kidney generates local reactive oxygen species that oxidize cellular phospholipids to phospholipid products that activate the Platelet-activating Factor receptor (PTAFR) for inflammatory phospholipids. Genetically deleting this ptafr locus abolished accumulation of mRNA for TGF-ß, collagen IV, and α-smooth muscle actin. Loss of PTAFR also abolished ethanol-stimulated Sonic (Shh) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh) expression, and abolished transcription and accumulation of Gli1. Shh induced in pericytes and Ihh in tubules escaped to urine of ethanol-fed mice. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) is required for ethanol-induced kidney inflammation, and Shh was not present in kidney or urine of mpo-/- mice. Shh also was present in urine of patients with acute kidney injury, but not in normal individuals or those with fibrotic liver cirrhosis We conclude neither endogenous PTAFR signaling nor CYP2E1-generated radicals alone are sufficient to initiate hedgehog signaling, but instead PTAFR-dependent neutrophil infiltration with myeloperoxidase activation is necessary to initiate ethanol-induced fibrosis in kidney. We also show fibrogenic mediators escape to urine, defining a new class of urinary mechanistic biomarkers of fibrogenesis for an organ not commonly biopsied."
https://openalex.org/W2220786029,"Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) belongs to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity. It has not conclusively been established, however, whether its role is pro- or anti-adipogenic.Gene silencing of Coup-tfII in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes resulted in enhanced differentiation into mature adipocytes. This was associated with upregulation of the Notch signaling target gene Hey1. A functional role of Hey1 was confirmed by gene silencing in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, resulting in impaired differentiation. In vivo, de novo fat pad formation in NUDE mice was significantly stimulated following injection of preadipocytes with Coup-tfII gene silencing, but impaired with Hey1 gene silencing. Moreover, expression of Coup-tfII was lower and that of Hey1 higher in isolated adipocytes of obese as compared to lean adipose tissue.These in vitro and in vivo data support an anti-adipogenic role of COUP-TFII via downregulating the Notch signaling target gene Hey1."
https://openalex.org/W2104982161,"In recent years we have witnessed a growth in sequencing yield, the number of samples sequenced, and as a result-the growth of publicly maintained sequence databases. The increase of data present all around has put high requirements on protein similarity search algorithms with two ever-opposite goals: how to keep the running times acceptable while maintaining a high-enough level of sensitivity. The most time consuming step of similarity search are the local alignments between query and database sequences. This step is usually performed using exact local alignment algorithms such as Smith-Waterman. Due to its quadratic time complexity, alignments of a query to the whole database are usually too slow. Therefore, the majority of the protein similarity search methods prior to doing the exact local alignment apply heuristics to reduce the number of possible candidate sequences in the database. However, there is still a need for the alignment of a query sequence to a reduced database. In this paper we present the SW#db tool and a library for fast exact similarity search. Although its running times, as a standalone tool, are comparable to the running times of BLAST, it is primarily intended to be used for exact local alignment phase in which the database of sequences has already been reduced. It uses both GPU and CPU parallelization and was 4-5 times faster than SSEARCH, 6-25 times faster than CUDASW++ and more than 20 times faster than SSW at the time of writing, using multiple queries on Swiss-prot and Uniref90 databases."
https://openalex.org/W2218831092,"RPE65 is the isomerase catalyzing conversion of all-trans-retinyl ester (atRE) into 11-cis-retinol in the retinal visual cycle. Crystal structures of RPE65 and site-directed mutagenesis reveal aspects of its catalytic mechanism, especially retinyl moiety isomerization, but other aspects remain to be determined. To investigate potential interactions between RPE65 and lipid metabolism enzymes, HEK293-F cells were transfected with expression vectors for visual cycle proteins and co-transfected with either fatty acyl:CoA ligases (ACSLs) 1, 3, or 6 or the SLC27A family fatty acyl-CoA synthase FATP2/SLCA27A2 to test their effect on isomerase activity. These experiments showed that RPE65 activity was reduced by co-expression of ACSLs or FATP2. Surprisingly, however, in attempting to relieve the ACSL-mediated inhibition, we discovered that triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACSLs, also potently inhibited RPE65 isomerase activity in cellulo. We found triacsin C to be a competitive inhibitor of RPE65 (IC50 = 500 nm). We confirmed that triacsin C competes directly with atRE by incubating membranes prepared from chicken RPE65-transfected cells with liposomes containing 0–1 μm atRE. Other inhibitors of ACSLs had modest inhibitory effects compared with triascin C. In conclusion, we have identified an inhibitor of ACSLs as a potent inhibitor of RPE65 that competes with the atRE substrate of RPE65 for binding.

The process of vision begins in the photoreceptor outer segments of the retina with absorption of a photon of light by the 11-cis-retinylidene chromophore ligand of photoreceptor visual pigment opsins, such as rhodopsin. This event photoisomerizes the 11-cis-retinal to the all-trans-isomer, thereby activating the rhodopsin to metarhodopsin and initiating the phototransduction pathway that results in transmission of a signal, via retinal interneurons, for central processing in brain visual centers. Upon completion of the phototransduction cascade processes, the all-trans-retinal releases from its Schiff base linkage following decay of metarhodopsin and is reduced to all-trans-retinol and transported to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), 2The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; ACSL, fatty acyl:CoA ligases; atRE, all-trans-retinyl ester; CRALBP, retinaldehyde-binding protein 1; EDYA, 8,11-eicosadiynoic acid; FATPs, SLC27A family fatty acid transport proteins; 2-FPA, 2-fluoropalmitic acid; LRAT, lecithin-retinol acyltransferase. a monolayer epithelium apposed to the photoreceptor outer segments. To regenerate the visual pigment, input of 11-cis-retinal is required. This is provided by enzymatic isomerization in the RPE of the esterified all-trans-retinol in a process termed the visual cycle.

Liposomes containing all-trans-retinyl palmitate were prepared by a modification of a published method (23Nikolaeva O. Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Ma J.X. Purified RPE65 shows isomerohydrolase activity after reassociation with a phospholipid membrane.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phospholipids and the Mini-Extruder device were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Liposome generation was conducted under dim yellow or red lighting. Liposomes were made with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and all-trans-retinyl palmitate (Sigma-Aldrich) at a phospholipid/retinyl palmitate ratio of 120:1. On the basis of pilot experiments, we used a maximal concentration of 1 μm all-trans-retinyl palmitate because concentrations higher than this destabilized the liposomes. For example, to make liposomes containing 1 μm all-trans-retinyl palmitate, 675 μl of 1 mg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 54 μl of 1 mg/ml 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were mixed with 12 μl of 10 mm all-trans-retinyl palmitate, and the mixture was dried under argon. When dry, the mixture was hydrated with 2 ml of 100 mm Bis-Tris propane buffer, pH 8, and placed in a 37 °C water bath for 60 min before being processed into large unilamellar vesicles in the mini extruder device, following the manufacturer's instructions. For liposome-containing RPE65 activity reactions, cell pellets from 30-ml cultures of HEK293-F cells transfected with pVitro2 expressing chicken RPE65/CRALBP and pVitro3-LRAT/retinol dehydrogenase 5 were homogenized in 1.25 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Bis-Tris propane, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche), 0.5% (w/v) essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 2.5% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside (Sigma) with 20 strokes in a Dounce tissue grinder. The homogenates of the transfected HEK293-F cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were removed and used immediately. Reaction mixtures were set up under dim red light, containing 900 μl of transfected HEK293-F supernatant, 100 μl of liposome preparation (containing 0.5, 0.75, or 1 μm all-trans-retinyl palmitate), and 2 μl of triacsin C dilutions (giving final concentrations of 0–2000 nm triacsin C per reaction), mixed, and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. (The 40-min time point was chosen on the basis of pilot time course experiments that showed the reaction to be optimal at 40 min and that it reached a plateau after 40 min.) The reactions were then extracted, saponified, and analyzed for isomeric retinols, as above. Docking simulations were done using the AutoDock Vina program (24Trott O. Olson A.J.

Three-dimensional ligand structures were obtained from the PubChem database where available or made using the PRODRG program (25Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar) from templates submitted to the GlycoBioChem PRODRG2 server and processed to .pdbqt files as recommended by the program. All possible torsions were routinely allowed in these files; however, the program does not allow torsions around double bonds. Two series of dockings were done, one in which the grid box included the entire area of the protein above the seven-bladed propeller structure (“cap”) and a second in which the grid box was restricted to the substrate cleft (“cleft”). A file containing all these parameters and .pdbqt files employed is found in the supplemental Methods. Previous work from other groups has shown that certain members of the SLC27A family—very long chain acyl-CoA synthetases—such as FATP1 and FATP4, inhibit RPE65 activity (13Guignard T.J. Jin M. Pequignot M.O. Li S. Chassigneux Y. Chekroud K. Guillou L. Richard E. Hamel C.P. Brabet P. FATP1 inhibits 11-cis-retinol formation via interaction with the visual cycle retinoid isomerase RPE65 and lecithin:retinol acyltransferase.J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 3178-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whether the inhibition results from direct interaction of these proteins with RPE65 or is due to competition for substrates between RPE65 and FATP1 or 4 is not completely disentangled. To further explore potential interactions of RPE65 with RPE lipid metabolic enzymes, we investigated potential interactions between RPE65 and members of the long chain ACSL superfamily, another group of acyl-CoA synthetases that are unrelated to the SLC27A family but that also catalyze the ligation of CoA to long chain fatty acids. We co-transfected HEK293-F cells with RPE65 and LRAT, and ACSL1, ACSL3, ACSL6, or FATP2 (SLC27A2), all of which we have found to be expressed in bovine RPE, 3W. Samuel, T. Parikh, R. K. Kutty, T. Duncan, C. J. Jaworski, and T. M. Redmond, in preparation. in the presence of 2.5 μm all-trans-retinol, the pro-substrate. FATP2 (SLC27A2) was chosen over FATP1 or FATP4, because it is the most abundant SLC27A family member in bovine or human RPE.3 We found that co-expression of RPE65 and LRAT with any of these fatty acyl synthetases reduces 11-cis-retinol production in transfected HEK293F cells by ∼80% (Fig. 2), compared with control RPE65 and LRAT transfection alone. To explore this effect further, we attempted to reverse the inhibitory effect of ACSLs on retinol isomerization by RPE65 by inhibition of ACSL activity with 10 μm triacsin C. Triacsin C (Fig. 1A) is a well known specific inhibitor of ACSLs at low micromolar levels (16Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Omura S. Inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase by triacsins.Biochim. Biophys.

Surprisingly, however, when we co-transfected ACSL1 along with RPE65, we observed a further reduction in 11-cis-retinol production in the presence of 10 μm triacsin C, from ∼20% to less than 5% of control (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we found that 10 μm triacsin C alone, without co-transfection of ACSL1, also markedly reduced 11-cis-retinol production by RPE65. This finding indicated a direct effect of triacsin C on RPE65 enzymatic activity.FIGURE 3The ACSL inhibitor triacsin C inhibits RPE65 retinol isomerase activity. 11-cis-Retinol production in HEK-293F cells co-transfected with pVitro2 vector co-expressing RPE65 and CRALBP and pVitro3 vector co-expressing LRAT and ACSL1 and incubated with 2.5 μm all-trans-retinol and in the presence or absence of 10 μm triacsin C. 11-cis-Retinol production values are expressed as percentages of RPE65 without ACSL1 + vehicle (DMSO) control (displayed as means ± standard deviations; n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiments in Fig. 3 indicate that triacsin C inhibited RPE65 retinol isomerase activity at or close to micromolar levels. To delineate the functional range, we performed a concentration curve over a 4-order range of concentrations, 0–30 μm in DMSO, of triacsin C in HEK293-F cultures co-transfected with RPE65 + LRAT in the presence of the pro-substrate 2.5 μm all-trans-retinol. The results (Fig. 4A) indicated a biphasic aspect to the inhibition where ∼50% inhibition was achieved by ∼1 μm triacsin C, whereas it took to 30 μm triacsin C to reduce activity a further 40% to achieve 90% inhibition. To more precisely determine the in cellulo IC50 of triacsin C, we incubated HEK293-F cultures co-transfected with RPE65 + LRAT in the presence of 0–2 μm of triacsin C and the pro-substrate 2.5 μm all-trans-retinol. Under these conditions, we found the IC50 of triacsin C to be ∼500 nm (Fig. 4B). Next we wished to determine the mode of inhibition (competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive) of triacsin C on RPE65. We tested the effect of different concentrations of all-trans-retinol on inhibition of RPE65 using a range of 0–2000 nm triacsin C in DMSO. We used a 10-fold range of pro-substrate concentrations—0.79, 2.5, and 7.9 μm all-trans-retinol—for these experiments. The increasing IC50 value seen (Fig. 4C) as all-trans-retinol concentration is increased indicates a competitive mode of inhibition by triacsin C. That RPE65, and not LRAT, is specifically inhibited is shown by the finding that there was no apparent effect on total retinol accumulation in HEK293-F cells treated with 0–2000 nm triacsin C, because totals of all retinol isomers remained relatively constant for each pro-substrate concentration for 0.79–7.9 μm all-trans-retinol after saponification (Table 1). Because retinyl ester accumulation by these cells is a surrogate measure of LRAT activity, this suggests that LRAT activity and atRE accumulation is not affected by triacsin C, further indicating a direct effect on RPE65 activity, rather than an indirect effect via limitation of atRE substrate.TABLE 1Accumulation of retinol in HEK293-F cells treated with triacsin CTotal retinol isomers from saponification of extracted retinoids from cellsTriC0.79 μm2.5 μm7.9 μmnmol0 nm2.6 ± 0.36.6 ± 0.913.5 ± 2.4125 nm2.7 ± 0.27.5 ± 0.613.7 ± 2.4250 nm2.6 ± 0.26.7 ± 1.013.8 ± 3.0500 nm2.6 ± 0.17.0 ± 1.413.3 ± 2.61000 nmNDaND, not done; means ± standard deviations (n ≥ 4).6.8 ± 0.314.0 ± 1.52000 nmND6.4 ± 0.9NDa ND, not done; means ± standard deviations (n ≥ 4). Open table in a new tab Based on its fatty acyl-like structure, we hypothesized that triacsin C competes for binding in the substrate binding cleft of RPE65 with the all-trans-retinyl ester substrate, and so it was imperative to directly measure the putative competition using all-trans-retinyl palmitate rather than indirectly using the pro-substrate all-trans-retinol, as was done in our in cellulo experiments. To evaluate the mechanism of triacsin C inhibition directly, we used the liposome-based assay of Nikolaeva et al. (23Nikolaeva O. Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Ma J.X. Purified RPE65 shows isomerohydrolase activity after reassociation with a phospholipid membrane.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3020-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for presentation of all-trans-retinyl palmitate to RPE65. In our initial experiments, HEK293-F cells were transiently transfected with the pVit2 vector carrying chicken RPE65 and CRALBP, and a membrane fraction was prepared and incubated with the liposomes containing varying concentrations of all-trans-retinyl palmitate. Retinols were extracted without saponification and determined chromatographically. In these assays, we noted a large peak of all-trans-retinol, indicating the presence of an endogenous all-trans-retinyl ester hydrolase activity that was competing with RPE65 for the all-trans-retinyl ester substrate. All attempts to inhibit this activity with specific ester hydrolase inhibitors were unsuccessful. However, if the cells were co-transfected with the pVit3 vector carrying LRAT and retinol dehydrogenase 5, incubation of the microsomal fraction showed no free retinols without saponification, indicating that LRAT was re-esterifying all retinols from both the all-trans-retinyl palmitate hydrolase and RPE65 activities, thus maintaining the substrate concentration, which was confirmed by an increased linearity of the 11-cis-retinol production with time. Therefore, all further experiments were carried out in the presence of LRAT. We used pVitro2/chicken RPE65 transfected HEK293-F cells to provide an enhanced RPE65 isomerase activity relative to use of dog RPE65 for the liposome experiments. In the HEK293-F visual cycle assay, we estimated an ∼35% higher activity for chicken RPE65 isomerase activity compared with dog RPE65 (normalized to dog RPE65 retinol isomerase activity (100 ± 12.1%), and chicken RPE65 activity"
https://openalex.org/W1035306681,"Modeling the effects of anesthetic drugs on brain activity is very helpful in understanding anesthesia mechanisms. The aim of this study was to set up a combined model to relate actual drug levels to EEG dynamics and behavioral states during propofol-induced anesthesia. We proposed a new combined theoretical model based on a pharmacokinetics (PK) model and a neural mass model (NMM), which we termed PK-NMM--with the aim of simulating electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during propofol-induced general anesthesia. The PK model was used to derive propofol effect-site drug concentrations (C(eff)) based on the actual drug infusion regimen. The NMM model took C(eff) as the control parameter to produce simulated EEG-like (sEEG) data. For comparison, we used real prefrontal EEG (rEEG) data of nine volunteers undergoing propofol anesthesia from a previous experiment. To see how well the sEEG could describe the dynamic changes of neural activity during anesthesia, the rEEG data and the sEEG data were compared with respect to: power-frequency plots; nonlinear exponent (permutation entropy (PE)); and bispectral SynchFastSlow (SFS) parameters. We found that the PK-NMM model was able to reproduce anesthesia EEG-like signals based on the estimated drug concentration and patients' condition. The frequency spectrum indicated that the frequency power peak of the sEEG moved towards the low frequency band as anesthesia deepened. Different anesthetic states could be differentiated by the PE index. The correlation coefficient of PE was 0.80 ± 0.13 (mean ± standard deviation) between rEEG and sEEG for all subjects. Additionally, SFS could track the depth of anesthesia and the SFS of rEEG and sEEG were highly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 ± 0.13. The PK-NMM model could simulate EEG activity and might be a useful tool for understanding the action of propofol on brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W2197647967,"Some combinations of musical tones sound pleasing to Western listeners, and are termed consonant, while others sound discordant, and are termed dissonant. The perceptual phenomenon of consonance has been traced to the acoustic property of harmonicity. It has been repeatedly shown that neural correlates of consonance can be found as early as the auditory brainstem as reflected in the harmonicity of the scalp-recorded frequency-following response (FFR). “Neural Pitch Salience” (NPS) measured from FFRs—essentially a time-domain equivalent of the classic pattern recognition models of pitch—has been found to correlate with behavioral judgments of consonance for synthetic stimuli. Following the idea that the auditory system has evolved to process behaviorally relevant natural sounds, and in order to test the generalizability of this finding made with synthetic tones, we recorded FFRs for consonant and dissonant intervals composed of synthetic and natural stimuli. We found that NPS correlated with behavioral judgments of consonance and dissonance for synthetic but not for naturalistic sounds. These results suggest that while some form of harmonicity can be computed from the auditory brainstem response, the general percept of consonance and dissonance is not captured by this measure. It might either be represented in the brainstem in a different code (such as place code) or arise at higher levels of the auditory pathway. Our findings further illustrate the importance of using natural sounds, as a complementary tool to fully-controlled synthetic sounds, when probing auditory perception."
https://openalex.org/W2203393754,"Vitamin D and folate are activated and degraded by sunlight, respectively, and the physiological processes they control are likely to have been targets of selection as humans expanded from Africa into Eurasia. We investigated signals of positive selection in gene sets involved in the metabolism, regulation and action of these two vitamins in worldwide populations sequenced by Phase I of the 1000 Genomes Project. Comparing allele frequency-spectrum-based summary statistics between these gene sets and matched control genes, we observed a selection signal specific to East Asians for a gene set associated with vitamin D action in bones. The selection signal was mainly driven by three genes CXXC finger protein 1 (CXXC1), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). Examination of population differentiation and haplotypes allowed us to identify several candidate causal regulatory variants in each gene. Four of these candidate variants (one each in CXXC1 and RUNX2 and two in LRP5) had a >70% derived allele frequency in East Asians, but were present at lower (20–60%) frequency in Europeans as well, suggesting that the adaptation might have been part of a common response to climatic and dietary changes as humans expanded out of Africa, with implications for their role in vitamin D-dependent bone mineralization and osteoporosis insurgence. We also observed haplotype sharing between East Asians, Finns and an extinct archaic human (Denisovan) sample at the CXXC1 locus, which is best explained by incomplete lineage sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2221058028,"Introduction HIV-1 prevention programs targeting HIV-1 serodiscordant couples need to identify couples that are likely to become pregnant to facilitate discussions about methods to minimize HIV-1 risk during pregnancy attempts (i.e. safer conception) or effective contraception when pregnancy is unintended. A clinical prediction tool could be used to identify HIV-1 serodiscordant couples with a high likelihood of pregnancy within one year. Methods Using standardized clinical prediction methods, we developed and validated a tool to identify heterosexual East African HIV-1 serodiscordant couples with an increased likelihood of becoming pregnant in the next year. Datasets were from three prospectively followed cohorts, including nearly 7,000 couples from Kenya and Uganda participating in HIV-1 prevention trials and delivery projects. Results The final score encompassed the age of the woman, woman’s number of children living, partnership duration, having had condomless sex in the past month, and non-use of an effective contraceptive. The area under the curve (AUC) for the probability of the score to correctly predict pregnancy was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72–0.76). Scores ≥7 predicted a pregnancy incidence of >17% per year and captured 78% of the pregnancies. Internal and external validation confirmed the predictive ability of the score. Discussion A pregnancy likelihood score encompassing basic demographic, clinical and behavioral factors defined African HIV-1 serodiscordant couples with high one-year pregnancy incidence rates. This tool could be used to engage African HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in counseling discussions about fertility intentions in order to offer services for safer conception or contraception that align with their reproductive goals."
https://openalex.org/W2214971591,"The human movement repertoire is characterized by the smooth coordination of several body parts, including arm movements and whole body motion. The neural control of this coordination is quite complex because the various body parts have their own kinematic and dynamic properties. Behavioral inferences about the neural solution to the coordination problem could be obtained by examining the emerging phase relationship and its stability. Here, we studied the phase relationships that characterize the coordination of arm-reaching movements with passively-induced whole-body motion. Participants were laterally translated using a vestibular chair that oscillated at a fixed frequency of 0.83 Hz. They were instructed to reach between two targets that were aligned either parallel or orthogonal to the whole body motion. During the first cycles of body motion, a metronome entrained either an in-phase or an anti-phase relationship between hand and body motion, which was released at later cycles to test phase stability. Results suggest that inertial forces play an important role when coordinating reaches with cyclic whole-body motion. For parallel reaches, we found a stable in-phase and an unstable anti-phase relationship. When the latter was imposed, it readily transitioned or drifted back toward an in-phase relationship at cycles without metronomic entrainment. For orthogonal reaches, we did not find a clear difference in stability between in-phase and anti-phase relationships. Computer simulations further show that cost models that minimize energy expenditure (i.e. net torques) or endpoint variance of the reach cannot fully explain the observed coordination patterns. We discuss how predictive control and impedance control processes could be considered important mechanisms underlying the rhythmic coordination of arm reaches and body motion."
