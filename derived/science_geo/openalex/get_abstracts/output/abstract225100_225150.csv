Several authors (1-4) have described techniques for microradiography, using either a diffraction unit with low voltage or photoelectrons. In our method rabbits -were injected with a radioopaque substance (10% silver iodide, with 3% acacia added) in vivo, and the kidney was removed and fixed in formalin. Sections of 300 tz thickness were then cut. The apparatus used to produce the microradiograph was an ordinary diagnostic x-ray machine with a rotating anode tube. In order to prevent as much of the vibra-. tion from the rotating anode as possible, the end of"
