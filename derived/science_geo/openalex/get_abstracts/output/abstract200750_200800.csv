For this purpose benzidine1,2, o-tolidine2, guaiacol3 and leucomalachite green4 have been employed. However, none of these substances has proved entirely satisfactory. The colours given by benzidine and tolidine fade within minutes5, especially when applied to starch-gel strips, and both reagents give appreciable background staining on paper. Instability of benzidine and guaiacol colours used to detect horse-radish peroxidase after paper electrophoresis has been noted also by Jermyn and Thomas6, who reported that o-anisidine, p-aminodimethylaniline and hydroquinone were even less satisfactory as reagents for the detection of peroxidases. Malachite green, formed from leucomalachite green, is more stable; but we have found the reagent much less sensitive than either benzidine or tolidine."

https://openalex.org/W2037790109,"A CHEMICALLY defined diet is required for determining essential dietary components by the classical deletion procedure. It has proved difficult to rear plant-feeding insects on artificial diets1,2. A method that would permit the determination of essential factors such as amino-acids for insects not reared on chemically defined diets would be useful. In 1952, Steele3 showed that carbon-14 appeared in the non-essential but not in the essential amino-acids when uniformly labelled sucrose-14C was ingested by a mouse. This finding provides the basis for an indirect method of determining which amino-acids are essential in the diet. The present report compares results of the indirect method with those of the classical deletion procedure4 for the blowfly Phormia regina Meig."

https://openalex.org/W2045115375,"IT has been clearly shown that insects contain acetylcholine, cholinesterase and choline acetylase, and the work of Smallman1–3 has done much to evaluate these. Since then, a more specific study of the substrate and enzymes in the conductive tissue of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana L., has shown that acetylcholine occurs most abundantly in the brain and ganglionic tissue of the central nervous system4, that the amount of acetylcholine increases after treatment with anticholinesterases when the nervous system shows intense electrical activity5, and that acetylcholine is found in blood at this time6. These facts are compatible with those found for vertebrates."

As a preliminary attempt to measure the validity of this practice, we have examined the published class of degree gained by current Fellows of the Royal Society who received their first degree from Oxford or Cambridge. Our results are given in Tables 1 and 2. Oxford and Cambridge are listed separately, and in each case the results of those who graduated during the period 1920–39 are given as well as the results for the group as a whole. For the Oxford group the result given is always that gained in the Final Honours School; for the Cambridge group the results given in Table 1 are of the last Tripos taken irrespective of whether it was Part 1 or Part 2, while Table 2 gives the results of an earlier Tripos if one was taken. The figures in brackets represent the actual totals on which the percentages are based."

https://openalex.org/W2027253623,"Cunningham, Catlin and de Garilhe1 were the first to report the occurrence of a calcium-activated nuclease in the culture medium of Micrococcus pyogenes var. aureus. These authors partially purified the enzyme and studied its action on deoxyribonucleic acid. In the complete digest they reported the presence of mononucleoside 3′-phosphates and also oligonucleotides. The latter were not identified except for one dinucleotide, deoxyadenylyl-(3′-5′)-deoxycytidine 3′-phosphate2. Recently, it was further demonstrated that this enzyme, when activated with calcium, hydrolyses ribonucleic acid3."

https://openalex.org/W1966380552,"MOST mammalia have a secondary sex ratio near 100 : 100 with a slight excess for the male sex. As male- and female-determining spermatozoa are being produced in equal numbers, the primary sex ratio would also be 100 : 100, provided that the two kinds of sperms are equally able to fertilize. However, a higher mortality-rate in male than in female embryos has been observed in stages in which the sex may be anatomically recognized1, and is also generally supposed to operate in preceding stages. Based upon this a primary sex-ratio of 150 : 100 has been calculated1 which must imply a higher frequency of successful fertilizations performed by male- rather than by female-determining spermatozoa."

https://openalex.org/W1994720893,THE results reported in this communication were obtained as part of a study related to a condition of silica urolithiasis which had been observed in steers on the Western Ranges of Canada and the United States. Experiments in this laboratory have shown that sheep fed a hay from Western Canada containing 8.28 per cent silica (expressed on air-dry basis) excreted urine with a pH of approximately 5.5. Sheep in the control group that were fed a hay from Eastern Canada containing 0.78 per cent silica excreted urine with a pH of approximately 8.2. Consumption of water and excretion of urine by sheep fed the high-silica hay were about one-half that of the sheep in the control group.

As the importance of vitamin B12 in marine ecology has been emphasized in recent reports2–6, a brief account of the main findings is given in this communication."

https://openalex.org/W1983559538,"THERE is some evidence that aldosterone, besides its potent effects on electrolyte metabolism, also possesses some cortisone-like activity. The data available, however, are rather scanty and somewhat contradictory. In recent years an effect of cortisone and of related hormones has been described which appears to be characteristic for the ‘glucocorticoid’ group of adrenocortical steroids. If given in a daily dose of 1 mgm. per 100 gm. body-weight, cortisone doubles or trebles the survival-time of rats fed a diet containing yeast as the only source of protein without, however, significantly altering the incidence of fatal liver necrosis caused by this deficient diet1,2. Characteristically, this effect of cortisone still occurs if the administration of this hormone is started as late as the last third of the experimental period3. Of the hormones examined so far only cortisone, cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone have significantly prolonged the survival time; progesterone, œstrogen, testosterone, œstrogen plus testosterone, and deoxy-cortone acetate have been without effect (Aterman, K., unpublished work). Corticosterone is now being investigated. In view of the lack of data on the biological actions of aldosterone it was considered of interest to see how its activity would compare with that of cortisone and of deoxycortone acetate in affecting the course of experimental hepatic necrosis."
