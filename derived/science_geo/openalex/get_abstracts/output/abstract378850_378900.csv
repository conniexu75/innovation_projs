https://openalex.org/W2099440512,"Overeating can be compulsive, resembling drug addiction. This paper reports that in rats, developing diet-induced obesity correlates with decreasing sensitivity of the brain's reward system. Knockdown of the striatal dopamine receptor D2 led to rapid loss of reward function and to compulsive overeating undeterred by conditioned aversive foot shocks. We found that development of obesity was coupled with emergence of a progressively worsening deficit in neural reward responses. Similar changes in reward homeostasis induced by cocaine or heroin are considered to be crucial in triggering the transition from casual to compulsive drug-taking. Accordingly, we detected compulsive-like feeding behavior in obese but not lean rats, measured as palatable food consumption that was resistant to disruption by an aversive conditioned stimulus. Striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) were downregulated in obese rats, as has been reported in humans addicted to drugs. Moreover, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of striatal D2Rs rapidly accelerated the development of addiction-like reward deficits and the onset of compulsive-like food seeking in rats with extended access to palatable high-fat food. These data demonstrate that overconsumption of palatable food triggers addiction-like neuroadaptive responses in brain reward circuits and drives the development of compulsive eating. Common hedonic mechanisms may therefore underlie obesity and drug addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2127587930,"Brain inflammation is a major factor in epilepsy, but the impact of specific inflammatory mediators on neuronal excitability is incompletely understood. Using models of acute and chronic seizures in C57BL/6 mice, we discovered a proconvulsant pathway involving high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) release from neurons and glia and its interaction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a key receptor of innate immunity. Antagonists of HMGB1 and TLR4 retard seizure precipitation and decrease acute and chronic seizure recurrence. TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice are resistant to kainate-induced seizures. The proconvulsant effects of HMGB1, like those of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), are partly mediated by ifenprodil-sensitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Increased expression of HMGB1 and TLR4 in human epileptogenic tissue, like that observed in the mouse model of chronic seizures, suggests a role for the HMGB1-TLR4 axis in human epilepsy. Thus, HMGB1-TLR4 signaling may contribute to generating and perpetuating seizures in humans and might be targeted to attain anticonvulsant effects in epilepsies that are currently resistant to drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2061452886,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly implicated in the regulation of metastasis. Despite their potential as targets for anti-metastatic therapy, miRNAs have only been silenced in normal tissues of rodents and nonhuman primates. Therefore, the development of effective approaches for sequence-specific inhibition of miRNAs in tumors remains a scientific and clinical challenge. Here we show that systemic treatment of tumor-bearing mice with miR-10b antagomirs-a class of chemically modified anti-miRNA oligonucleotide-suppresses breast cancer metastasis. Both in vitro and in vivo, silencing of miR-10b with antagomirs significantly decreases miR-10b levels and increases the levels of a functionally important miR-10b target, Hoxd10. Administration of miR-10b antagomirs to mice bearing highly metastatic cells does not reduce primary mammary tumor growth but markedly suppresses formation of lung metastases in a sequence-specific manner. The miR-10b antagomir, which is well tolerated by normal animals, appears to be a promising candidate for the development of new anti-metastasis agents."
https://openalex.org/W1969079198,"The genome of the Périgord black truffle Tuber melanosporum Vittad., a gourmet delicacy that grows symbiotically on the roots of European oak, has been sequenced. This is the largest and most complex fungal genome so far sequenced. The genome is unusually gene-poor, but rich in the mobile genetic elements known as transposons. Comparison with the sequence of Laccaria bicolor, another ectomycorrhizal symbiotic fungus, reveals contrasting gene sets reflecting two different molecular toolkits that have evolved independently to fit the root symbiont lifestyle. Cultivation of the truffle is a complicated process, and most truffles are still harvested from the wild. So the analysis of genetic traits related to fruiting and symbiosis could help boost crop production and make black truffles more widely available. The genome of the black truffle - one of the most popular truffles on the market - has been sequenced. This is the first genome of a symbiotic ascomycete to be analysed. Comparison with the genome of another ectomycorrhizal symbiotic fungus indicates that a genetic predisposition to symbiosis evolved differently in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The study also offers insight into fungal sex and fruiting. The Périgord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) and the Piedmont white truffle dominate today’s truffle market1,2. The hypogeous fruiting body of T. melanosporum is a gastronomic delicacy produced by an ectomycorrhizal symbiont3 endemic to calcareous soils in southern Europe. The worldwide demand for this truffle has fuelled intense efforts at cultivation. Identification of processes that condition and trigger fruit body and symbiosis formation, ultimately leading to efficient crop production, will be facilitated by a thorough analysis of truffle genomic traits. In the ectomycorrhizal Laccaria bicolor, the expansion of gene families may have acted as a ‘symbiosis toolbox’4. This feature may however reflect evolution of this particular taxon and not a general trait shared by all ectomycorrhizal species5. To get a better understanding of the biology and evolution of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, we report here the sequence of the haploid genome of T. melanosporum, which at ∼125 megabases is the largest and most complex fungal genome sequenced so far. This expansion results from a proliferation of transposable elements accounting for ∼58% of the genome. In contrast, this genome only contains ∼7,500 protein-coding genes with very rare multigene families. It lacks large sets of carbohydrate cleaving enzymes, but a few of them involved in degradation of plant cell walls are induced in symbiotic tissues. The latter feature and the upregulation of genes encoding for lipases and multicopper oxidases suggest that T. melanosporum degrades its host cell walls during colonization. Symbiosis induces an increased expression of carbohydrate and amino acid transporters in both L. bicolor and T. melanosporum, but the comparison of genomic traits in the two ectomycorrhizal fungi showed that genetic predispositions for symbiosis—‘the symbiosis toolbox’—evolved along different ways in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes."

https://openalex.org/W2017332009,"Interferon-β (IFN-β) is a mainstay therapy for multiple sclerosis. However, only two thirds of patients respond to therapy, and clinical symptoms worsen in some patients. Chandar Raman and his colleagues show that IFN-β alleviates disease induced by T helper type 1 cells and exacerbates disease induced by T helper type 17 cells in mice. They also show that these effects of IFN-β rely on IFN-γ signaling ( pages 376–377 ). Interferon-β (IFN-β) is the major treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-β in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-β was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (TH1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by TH17 cells. Effective treatment in TH1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In TH17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-β treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-γ. In the absence of IFN-γ signaling, IFN-β therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-β nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-β is proinflammatory in TH17-induced EAE. Moreover, a high IL-17F concentration in the serum of people with RRMS is associated with nonresponsiveness to therapy with IFN-β."

https://openalex.org/W2035145212,"Despite the fact that X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) is one of the main regulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR), the modulators of XBP-1 are poorly understood. Here, we show that the regulatory subunits of phosphotidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p85alpha (encoded by Pik3r1) and p85beta (encoded by Pik3r2) form heterodimers that are disrupted by insulin treatment. This disruption of heterodimerization allows the resulting monomers of p85 to interact with, and increase the nuclear translocation of, the spliced form of XBP-1 (XBP-1s). The interaction between p85 and XBP-1s is lost in ob/ob mice, resulting in a severe defect in XBP-1s translocation to the nucleus and thus in the resolution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These defects are ameliorated when p85alpha and p85beta are overexpressed in the liver of ob/ob mice. Our results define a previously unknown insulin receptor signaling pathway and provide new mechanistic insight into the development of ER stress during obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2075480833,"Hypothalamic neuron circuits regulating energy balance are highly plastic and develop in response to nutrient and hormonal cues. To identify processes that might be susceptible to gestational influences in mice, we characterized the ontogeny of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) cell populations, which exert opposing influences on food intake and body weight. These analyses revealed that Pomc is broadly expressed in immature hypothalamic neurons and that half of embryonic Pomc-expressing precursors subsequently adopt a non-POMC fate in adult mice. Moreover, nearly one quarter of the mature NPY+ cell population shares a common progenitor with POMC+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2103432808,"Previously, we reported germline DNA variants associated with risk of urinary bladder cancer (UBC) in Dutch and Icelandic subjects. Here we expanded the Icelandic sample set and tested the top 20 markers from the combined analysis in several European case-control sample sets, with a total of 4,739 cases and 45,549 controls. The T allele of rs798766 on 4p16.3 was found to associate with UBC (odds ratio = 1.24, P = 9.9 x 10(-12)). rs798766 is located in an intron of TACC3, 70 kb from FGFR3, which often harbors activating somatic mutations in low-grade, noninvasive UBC. Notably, rs798766[T] shows stronger association with low-grade and low-stage UBC than with more aggressive forms of the disease and is associated with higher risk of recurrence in low-grade stage Ta tumors. The frequency of rs798766[T] is higher in Ta tumors that carry an activating mutation in FGFR3 than in Ta tumors with wild-type FGFR3. Our results show a link between germline variants, somatic mutations of FGFR3 and risk of UBC."
https://openalex.org/W2112605568,"Class Ia phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), an essential mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin, is composed of a catalytic (p110alpha or p110beta) and regulatory (p85alphaalpha, p85betaalpha or p55alpha) subunit. Here we show that p85alphaalpha interacts with X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), a transcriptional mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent manner. Cell lines with knockout or knockdown of p85alphaalpha show marked alterations in the UPR, including reduced ER stress-dependent accumulation of nuclear XBP-1, decreased induction of UPR target genes and increased rates of apoptosis. This is associated with a decreased activation of inositol-requiring protein-1alpha (IRE1alpha) and activating transcription factor-6alphaalpha (ATF6alpha). Mice with deletion of p85alpha in liver (L-Pik3r1(-/-)) show a similar attenuated UPR after tunicamycin administration, leading to an increased inflammatory response. Thus, p85alphaalpha forms a previously unrecognized link between the PI3K pathway, which is central to insulin action, and the regulation of the cellular response to ER stress, a state that when unresolved leads to insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1979518536,"Although most inhibitory synapses are homeostatically scaled down after chronic inactivity, Kim et al. report that chronic inactivity specifically strengthens a subset of hippocampal GABAergic synapses that express cannabinoid receptors. This local tuning effect is mediated by enhanced degradation of anandamide, which reduces basal cannabinoid receptor activation, augmenting GABA release probability. When chronic alterations in neuronal activity occur, network gain is maintained by global homeostatic scaling of synaptic strength, but the stability of microcircuits can be controlled by unique adaptations that differ from the global changes. It is not understood how specificity of synaptic tuning is achieved. We found that, although a large population of inhibitory synapses was homeostatically scaled down after chronic inactivity, decreased endocannabinoid tone specifically strengthened a subset of GABAergic synapses that express cannabinoid receptors. In rat hippocampal slice cultures, a 3–5-d blockade of neuronal firing facilitated uptake and degradation of anandamide. The consequent reduction in basal stimulation of cannabinoid receptors augmented GABA release probability, fostering rapid depression of synaptic inhibition and on-demand disinhibition. This regulatory mechanism, mediated by activity-dependent changes in tonic endocannabinoid level, permits selective local tuning of inhibitory synapses in hippocampal networks."
https://openalex.org/W2016373857,"Sesquiterpene lactones are characteristic natural products in Asteraceae, which constitutes ∼8% of all plant species. Despite their physiological and pharmaceutical importance, the biochemistry and evolution of sesquiterpene lactones remain unexplored. Here we show that germacrene A oxidase (GAO), evolutionarily conserved in all major subfamilies of Asteraceae, catalyzes three consecutive oxidations of germacrene A to yield germacrene A acid. Furthermore, it is also capable of oxidizing non-natural substrate amorphadiene. Co-expression of lettuce GAO with germacrene synthase in engineered yeast synthesized aberrant products, costic acids and ilicic acid, in an acidic condition. However, cultivation in a neutral condition allowed the de novo synthesis of a single novel compound that was identified as germacrene A acid by gas and liquid chromatography and NMR analyses. To trace the evolutionary lineage of GAO in Asteraceae, homologous genes were further isolated from the representative species of three major subfamilies of Asteraceae (sunflower, chicory, and costus from Asteroideae, Cichorioideae, and Carduoideae, respectively) and also from the phylogenetically basal species, Barnadesia spinosa, from Barnadesioideae. The recombinant GAOs from these genes clearly showed germacrene A oxidase activities, suggesting that GAO activity is widely conserved in Asteraceae including the basal lineage. All GAOs could catalyze the three-step oxidation of non-natural substrate amorphadiene to artemisinic acid, whereas amorphadiene oxidase diverged from GAO displayed negligible activity for germacrene A oxidation. The observed amorphadiene oxidase activity in GAOs suggests that the catalytic plasticity is embedded in ancestral GAO enzymes that may contribute to the chemical and catalytic diversity in nature.

Terpenoids, derived from isopentenyl diphosphate, are structurally the most diverse class of natural products with many known biological functions and commercial applications (1Gershenzon J. Dudareva N. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). One subclass of terpenoids is sesquiterpene lactone (STL) 3The abbreviations used are: STLsesquiterpene lactoneP450cytochrome P450 monooxygenaseGAOgermacrene A oxidaseAMOamorphadiene oxidaseGASgermacrene A synthaseSCsynthetic completeESIelectrospray ionizationADSamorphadiene synthaseCPRcytochrome P450 reductaseMSmass spectometryGC-MSgas chromatography-MSLC-MSliquid chromatography-MSHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. , characterized by its α-methylene γ-lactone moiety on the 15-carbon core backbone (2Fischer N.H.

Although STLs are found in several plant families including Cupressaceae (3Picman A.K. Biochem. Syst. Ecol. 1986; 14: 255-281Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar), liverwort (4Asakawa Y. Toyota M.

Despite the structural complexities of STLs, the basic backbones of all STLs are constrained to several core skeletons, such as germacranolide, eudesmanolide, guaianolide, and helenanolide (2Fischer N.H. Towers G.H.N. Stafford H.A. Biochemistry of the Mevalonic Acid Pathway to Terpenoids. Plenum Press, New York1990: 161-202Crossref Google Scholar).

Apparently, the chemical diversification of STLs is interlocked with plant speciation in Asteraceae, and hence, the structural features of STLs have been routinely used as chemosystematic markers in Asteraceae (10Seaman F.C.

In addition, several STLs have benefited human health and wellness as anti-inflammatory (e.g. parthenolide), sedative and analgesic (e.g. lactucopicrin), anti-cancer (e.g. thapsigargin), and anti-malarial (e.g. artemisinin) medicines (13Christensen S.B.

Although structural and bioactivity studies of STLs have been extensively performed, the biosynthetic route of STLs remains poorly understood at the molecular level. The proposed biosynthetic route of the simplest STL, costunolide, is depicted in Fig. 1 (19de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. Dalm M.C. de Groot A. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1930-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. Joerink M. de Groot A. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Farnesyl diphosphate is cyclized to C15 hydrocarbon germacrene A by germacrene A synthase (GAS), and subsequently its C12 methyl group undergoes a three-step oxidation reaction to yield the germacrene A acid (germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid). An additional hydroxylation at the C6 position of germacrene A acid facilitates nonenzymatic lactonization of C6 hydroxyl and C12 carboxylic group, yielding costunolide. The costunolide in turn serves as a framework of guaianolides, eudesmanolides, germacranolides, and other STLs by unknown mechanisms. Last, elaborate chemical decorations of STL scaffolds are carried out by P450s and several other modifying enzymes to produce more complex and biologically active STL end products. A number of GAS genes have been isolated and characterized in Asteraceae (21Bennett M.H. Mansfield J.W. Lewis M.J. Beale M.H. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Bertea C.M. Voster A. Verstappen F.W. Maffei M. Beekwilder J. Bouwmeester H.J. Arch. Biochem.

BMC Plant Biol. 2009; 9: 86Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, the biochemical mechanism of germacrene A C12 oxidation and other downstream modifications have not been fully understood. Based on cell-free assays in chicory, it has been proposed that three distinct enzymes, germacrene A C12 hydroxylase (P450), germacrene alcohol dehydrogenase, and germacrene aldehyde dehydrogenase, are involved in the biosynthesis of germacrene A acid in chicory (19de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. Dalm M.C. de Groot A. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1930-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The P450-mediated biosynthesis of costunolide from germacrene A acid has also been demonstrated in chicory extract (20de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. Joerink M. de Groot A. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the corresponding genes responsible for these reactions have not been identified to date. Recently, the biochemical scenario of such three independent enzymes for germacrene A acid synthesis has been challenged by the discovery of multifunctional amorphadiene oxidase (AMO or CYP71AV1), which can catalyze three-step oxidations of amorphadiene to yield artemisinic acid in Asteraceae plant, Artemisia annua (Fig. 1) (25Ro D.K. Paradise E.M. Ouellet M. Fisher K.J. Newman K.L. Ndungu J.M. Ho K.A. Eachus R.A. Ham T.S. Kirby J. Chang M.C. Withers S.T. Shiba Y. Sarpong R. Keasling J.D.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). From the perspective of biochemical evolution, the artemisinic acid biosynthesis is a specific evolutionary event that only occurred in a single modern species, A. annua. It can, therefore, be theorized that the biochemistry of artemisinic acid diverged from the more general germacrene A acid biosynthetic pathway. Comparative analysis of artemisinic acid and germacrene A acid biosynthesis would be an attractive model to understand the adaptive evolution of enzymes in terpenoid metabolism. Germacrene A acid is certainly a necessary chemical for in-depth investigation of STL metabolism in Asteraceae. However, this compound is difficult to obtain because germacrene A acid is a low abundant, transient intermediate in the STL biosynthetic pathway (27de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. de Groot A. Shibata T. Bouwmeester H.J. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the chemical synthesis of terpenoid is difficult to achieve. One report showed that a minute amount (2 mg) of germacrene A acid could be purified from 300 g of costus (Saussurea lappa) (27de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. de Groot A. Shibata T. Bouwmeester H.J. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, microbial de novo production of germacrene A acid using cDNA clones can be a convenient alternative to acquire germacrene A acid. In this report germacrene A oxidase (GAO) isolated from lettuce (Lactuca sativa) was expressed in an engineered yeast to synthesize germacrene A acid de novo. Furthermore, GAO cDNAs were isolated from several other Asteraceae plants representing major subfamilies, including the phylogenetically basal species Barnadesia spinosa. Resulting biochemical data provided evidence that GAO activity is highly conserved in Asteraceae. In addition, the cross-reactivity of GAOs toward amorphadiene highlighted the evolutionary significance of the catalytic plasticity encoded in GAOs. Sequence information at the start and stop codons of LsGAO was obtained from the Compositae Genome Project Data base at the University of California Davis. LsGAO was amplified from the cDNA pool prepared from lettuce leaf by a forward primer, 5′-CGAGGTCTAGAATGGAGCTTTCAATAACCACC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-GCCCTCTAGAGCAAAACTCGGTACGAGTAACAAC-3′. The amplified product was digested by XbaI and ligated into the SpeI site of pESC-Ura plasmid. A. annua cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) in a pESC-Ura plasmid (25Ro D.K. Paradise E.M. Ouellet M.

This plasmid and the previously generated GAS::pESC-Leu plasmid (24Göpfert J.C. Macnevin G. Ro D.K. Spring O. BMC Plant Biol. 2009; 9: 86Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were co-transformed to the EPY300 strain (25Ro D.K. Paradise E.M. Ouellet M. Fisher K.J. Newman K.L. Ndungu J.M. Ho K.A.

For chemical purification purposes, plasmid stability was enhanced by coding three genes in a single plasmid. This was achieved by amplifying the expression cassette of GAS from the GAS::pESC-Leu plasmid by a forward primer, 5′-GTCAATCACTACGTGAGTACGGATTAGAAGCCGCCGA-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-GTCAATGCCGGCCTTCGAGCGTCCCAAAACCT-3′. The amplified product was digested by DraIII and NaeI, and the digested fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites of an empty pESC-Leu2d. This DNA manipulation freed two multiple cloning sites for further cloning. Two expression cassettes for LsGAO and CPR were digested from the LsGAO/CPR::pESC-Ura by PacI and ScaI, and the digested fragment was ligated to the corresponding sites of the newly generated GAS::pESC-Leu2d, resulting in the triple expression plasmid named GAS/LsGAO/CPR::pESC-Leu2d. Bioinformatic analyses identified start and stop codons of chicory and sunflower, and their open reading frame sequences were used to design appropriate primers. The Barnadesia clone ordered from the Arizona Genomics Institute at the University of Arizona encoded a full-length cDNA (clone CCHS24399). For costus SlGAO clone isolation, a 1.4-kb fragment of SlGAO was first obtained from costus cDNA using primers designed at the highly conserved domains of other GAOs. The primer pair used was a forward primer, 5′-ACCGTGGCTCAAAGCTCTCAGTC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-GACTCCCCATAATCGGTCACATGC-3′. Both 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were conducted to determine start and stop codons of SlGAO followed by the recovery of a full-length cDNA. All the isolated GAOs were first cloned to pESC-Leu vector to make translational fusions to the FLAG epitope. For subcloning purposes, HaGAO was amplified using a forward primer, 5′-GCACTAGTATGGAAGTCTCCCTCACCACTTC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-CGATACTAGTGCAAAACTTGGTACAAGCATCAA-3′. SlGAO was amplified using a forward primer, 5′-TAATCTAGAATGGAACTCTCCTTCACCACTTCCATTGC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-TATTCTAGACGAAAACTAGGTACCAGTACCAAATGAGTC-3′. CiGAO was amplified using a forward primer, 5′-ACGTCTAGAATGGAGCTCTCACTCACTACTTCCA-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-ACGTCTAGAGCAAAACTTGGTACGAGTATCAATTCGGT-3′. BsGAO was amplified using a forward primer, 5′-ATATCTAGAACCATGGAACTCACTCTCACCACTTCCC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-ATACTAGTCGAGCAGAGTTGTTAGCAGTCTTGTAAGCTG-3′. The amplified fragments were digested by XbaI or SpeI and cloned into the SpeI site of pESC-Leu vector. The entire open reading frames in fusion with the FLAG epitope were digested by NotI and PacI, and the LsGAO in the triple expression vector was removed and replaced with the NotI- and PacI-digested GAO open reading frames. For standard yeast culture, the transgenic yeast strain of interest was inoculated in 3 ml of Synthetic Complete (SC) medium omitting the appropriate amino acids with 2% Glc. The inocula were cultured overnight at 30 °C and 200 rpm. The start culture was diluted 100-fold in SC medium omitting the appropriate amino acids with 1.8% Gal and 0.2% Glc. 100 ml of medium was cultured for metabolite profiling, whereas 1.0–2.5 liters of medium was cultured for chemical purification and identification. Rearranged sesquiterpenoids (costic acids) were extracted and analyzed by GC-MS according to the published methods (28Ro D.K. Ouellet M. Paradise E.M. Burd H. Eng D. Paddon C.J. Newman J.D. Keasling J.D. BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For buffered neutral culture, culture medium was adjusted to have 100 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5). After cultivating yeast for 48–72 h at 30 °C, the culture medium was adjusted to pH 6.0 with 2 m HCl, and the medium was extracted with ethyl acetate twice. The ethyl acetate fractions were evaporated in N2 gas to concentrate samples to 1 ml, and 1 μl was analyzed by GC-MS. For LC-MS analyses, the solvent was replaced with methanol. Microsomes were prepared according to the published protocol (29Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that a micro-beadbeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) was used for 90 s with glass beads (500-μm diameter). For immunoblot analysis, microsomal proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for at least 1 h, incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) in 1:5000 dilution, washed 3 times with TBST, and incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) in a 1:5000 dilution. After washing the membrane three times with TBST, the bound secondary antibodies were detected with ECL Plus detection reagents (GE Healthcare). For in vitro enzyme assay, the protease-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPL 154C:Pep4 KO strain was transformed with LsGAO/CPR::pESC-Leu2d and CPR::pESC-Leu2d. After 15 h of cultivation in Glc, the yeast culture was shifted to fresh medium with 2% Gal, and the yeasts were further cultivated for 24 h. The in vitro enzyme reactions were carried out in 3 ml of 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5) buffer containing 3 mg of microsomal protein, 200 μm germacrene A, 500 μm NADPH, and an NADPH regeneration system (10 mm Glc 6-phosphate and 3 units of Glc-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). The reaction occurred at 23 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. The reaction product was acidified with 2 m HCl to pH 6.0 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract solvent was then replaced with methanol for LC-MS analysis. Products obtained by the expression of the GAS/LsGAO/CPR::pESC-Leu2d plasmid were analyzed on an Agilent 6890N gas chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 5975B mass spectrometer. 1-μl samples were injected at a port temperature of 150 °C and analyzed on a DB5-MS column (30 m × 250-μm inner diameter × 0.25-μm film thickness). Helium was used as carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The temperature program was set to 40 °C for 1 min followed by a linear gradient of 10 °C min−1 to 250 °C. For separating α- and β-costic acids, 2-μl samples were analyzed on an Agilent chiral Cyclodex-B column (30 m × 250-μm inner diameter × 0.25-μm film thickness). The temperature program used was 1 min hold at 40 °C, 10 °C min−1 increments from 40 °C to 100 °C, and 3 °C min−1 increments from 100 to 245 °C. Retention indices for methyl esters of α-, β-, and γ-costic acid and ilicic acid were 1807, 1805, 1788, and 1966, respectively, in the DB-5 column and 1914, 1920, 1889, and 2208, respectively, in the Cyclodex-B column. Retention indices values for native forms of α-, β-, and γ- costic acid and ilicic acid were 1873, 1870, 1852, and 2103, respectively, in DB5 column. Cope-rearranged product, elemenic acid, showed a retention index of 1762, and electron impact MS relative ion intensity as follows: M+ 234 (1), 81 (100), 67 (49), 91 (38), 105 (34), 53 (33), 121 (29), 133 (18), 147 (17), 177 (17), 189 (14), 219 (8), 161 (9), 207 (4). For costic acids and ilicic acid, NMR spectra were recorded in 3-mm standard NMR tubes on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 3-mm indirect detection pulsed field gradient probe. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were referenced to solvent signals at δH/C 7.14/127.68 (C6D6) relative to tetramethylsilane. One- and two-dimensional homonuclear NMR spectra were measured with standard Varian pulse sequences, and the experiments performed included gCOSY, TOCSY, ROESY, gHSQCAD, and gHMBCAD. Adiabatic broadband and band-selective GHSQCAD and GHMBCAD spectra were recorded using CHEMPACK 4.0 pulse sequences (implemented in Varian Vnmrj 2.1B spectrometer software). For germacrene A acid, 1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired in 5-mm standard NMR tubes at 400.13 and 100.6 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE 400 Spectrometer equipped with 5-mm inverse probe with triple axis gradients. Chemical shifts (δ) were referenced to internal tetramethylsilane for both 13C and 1H. Spectra were recorded with standard Bruker pulse sequences under Xwinnmr. Experiments performed included one-dimensional proton, one-dimensional 13C with proton decoupling, 13C attached proton test with proton decoupling, COSY with double quantum filter, TOSCY with 60-ms mixing time, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence, and heteronuclear multiple bond coherence. The EtOAc extract was concentrated to 100 μl in a vacuum concentrator and separated by TLC on silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) with hexane/EtOAC (1:4 v/v) as the solvent. UV 254 nm identified an absorbent band with an RF value of 0.08 that was eluted from silica with EtOAC and subsequently identified to contain 4 (peak 4) in Fig. 2. Further purification was achieved by using an isocratic HPLC fractionation (P580 Dionex Liquid Chromatography system, Grom-Sil 120 ODS-5 ST column, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm (Grom, Herrenberg, Germany). The mobile phase used was 40% acetonitrile acidified to pH 2.5 with trifluoroacetic acid, and compounds were detected with Dionex DAD UVD340S. Compound 4 eluted at 9.9 min. The same TLC separation was conducted as described above. In addition to the ilicic acid band, another band on the TLC plate showing strong absorbance at UV254 with an RF value of 0.62 was identified to contain 1 and 3 (peaks 1 and 3, respectively) in Fig. 2 by GC-MS analysis. This band was excised, eluted with EtOAC, and further separated by HPLC as described above. Compound 1 (γ-costic acid) was eluted at 9.6 min with a shoulder peak. A separate collection of the shoulder peak and subsequent NMR analysis afforded β-costic acid (3). For purification of germacrene A acid, the culture medium was extracted with EtOAc, concentrated to 100 μl, and fractionated by a reverse-phase column, Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridge 55–105-μm column (Waters). Step gradients of elution solvents (water and acetonitrile) starting from 100% water with 10% increments of acetonitrile were used to isolate germacrene A acid. A total of 56 fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected, and the presence of germacrene A acid was visualized as a blue spot on TLC plate using the method described by de Kraker et al. (27de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. de Groot A. Shibata T. Bouwmeester H.J. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fractions showing blue spots on TLC were further monitored by HPLC (Waters 279 Separation Module; Waters Nova-Pak C18 column 4 μm, 3.9 × 150 mm; Waters 2996 Photodiode Array Detector with UV wavelength at 194 nm) to distinguish germacrene A acid (13.3 min retention time) from minor amounts of ilicic acid (9.3 min) and costic acids (14.5 min). This separation was achieved with a solvent gradient of 95:5 (A:B) to 20:80 (A:B) over 20 min at 1 ml min−1 and 40 °C column temperature (A: H2O with 1% acetic acid; B: 100% acetonitrile). Metabolite mass profiles were generated by an Agilent 1200 Rapid Resolution LC system coupled with an Agilent 6410 MS using 10-μl injections of samples onto a reverse phase C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm, Eclipse plus C18 Zorbax) with a solvent gradient of 80:20 (A:B) to 20:80 (A:B) over 12 min at 0.4 ml min−1 at 40 °C column temperature (A: H2O with 1% acetic acid; B: 100% acetonitrile). The initial 30 s of LC was operated at an isocratic mode with solvent composition 80:20 (A:B). Total ion scans were used in both negative and positive mode, and specific ion masses were selected for further mass analysis. For germacrene A acid detection in B. spinosa, 100 mg of ground fresh tissue (a mixture of flower and leaf that were used for the cDNA library preparation in the Compositae genomics project) was provided from the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Indiana University. The sample was extracted with 5 ml of ethyl acetate, filtered, dried, and dissolved in methanol. The same Rapid Resolution LC program as above was employed using the Zorbax SB-C18 column (2.1 × 30 mm, 3.5 μm). GAO and AMO amino acid sequences were aligned by ClustalW algorithm. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP) 4.0 software (Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA). The first 21 amino acids corresponding to the membrane domain were excluded. Characters were reweighted according to the rescaled consistency index. Parsimony analysis was performed using the tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) algorithm. 1000 replicates of the bootstrap analysis were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of each node. The DNA sequences for the GAO genes have been deposited in the GenBankTM data library under the following accession numbers: GU198171 (L. sativa), GU256644 (C. intybus), GU256645 (S. lappa), GU256646 (Helianthus annuus), and GU256647 (B. spinosa). Lettuce (L. sativa) accumulates STLs inside its laticiferous cells in stems and leaves (30Sessa R.A. Bennett M.H. Lewis M.J. Mansfield J.W. Beale M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26877-26884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and hence, we first aimed at functionally identifying a gene encoding the enzyme for germacrene A oxidation from lettuce. A bioinformatics screening of the lettuce express sequence tag data base using A. annua AMO (or CYP71AV1) identified a gene highly homologous to AMO (25Ro D.K. Paradise E.M. Ouellet M. Fisher K.J. Newman K.L. Ndungu J.M. Ho K.A. Eachus R.A. Ham T.S. Kirby J. Chang M.C. Withers S.T. Shiba Y. Sarpong R. Keasling J.D.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). PCR amplification using primers designed at the start and stop codons of the identified ESTs allowed us to isolate a full-length gene from lettuce leaf cDNA. The isolated cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 488 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 54.9 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence from this gene showed 86.7% identity to that from A. annua AMO. This P450 gene was designated as germacrene A oxidase (GAO) based on its catalytic property (see below). To assess the enzymatic activity of GAO, yeast strain EPY300 engineered to produce a markedly increased level of farnesyl diphosphate (an immediate precursor of germacrene A) served as a platform strain. The production of the hydrocarbon germacrene A in the EPY300 strain expressing previously characterized lettuce GAS has been demonstrated (21Bennett M.H. Mansf"
https://openalex.org/W2074665678,"As apoptosis defects limit efficacy of anticancer agents, autophagy has been proposed as a novel strategy for radiotherapy enhancement. We previously showed that caspase-3/7 inhibition induces autophagy and promotes radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism by which radiation triggers autophagy in caspase-3/7-deficient cells, and found the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The ER activates a survival pathway, the unfolded protein response, which involves ER-localized transmembrane proteins such as protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 and activating transcription factor-6. In this study, we found that PERK is essential for radiation-induced autophagy and radiosensitivity in caspase-3/7 double-knockout cells. Irradiation of these cells increased expression of phosphorylated-eIF2α. Similar results were seen after administration of tunicamycin (TM), a well-known ER stressor. Importantly, we found that the administration of TM with radiation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which are lacking functional caspase-3 and relatively resistant to many anticancer agents, enhances radiation sensitivity. Our findings reveal ER stress as a novel potential mechanism of radiation-induced autophagy in caspase-3/7-deficient cells and as a potential strategy to maximize efficiency of radiation therapy in breast cancer."

Here we show that an l-cysteine transporter, YdeD, is required for the tolerance of E. coli cells to hydrogen peroxide. We also present evidence that l-cystine, a product from the oxidation of l-cysteine by hydrogen peroxide, is imported back into the cytoplasm in a manner dependent on FliY, the periplasmic l-cystine-binding protein. Remarkably, this protein, which is involved in the recycling of the oxidized l-cysteine, is also found to be important for the hydrogen peroxide resistance of this organism. Furthermore, our analysis of the transcription of relevant genes revealed that the transcription of genes encoding FliY and YdeD is highly induced by hydrogen peroxide rather than by l-cysteine.

https://openalex.org/W1990787076,"Chronic heart failure (HF) is characterized by sympathetic overactivity and enhanced circulating catecholamines (CAs), which significantly increase HF morbidity and mortality. We recently reported that adrenal G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is up-regulated in chronic HF, leading to enhanced CA release via desensitization/down-regulation of the chromaffin cell alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors that normally inhibit CA secretion. We also showed that adrenal GRK2 inhibition decreases circulating CAs and improves cardiac inotropic reserve and function. Herein, we hypothesized that adrenal-targeted GRK2 gene deletion before the onset of HF might be beneficial by reducing sympathetic activation. To specifically delete GRK2 in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland, we crossed PNMTCre mice, expressing Cre recombinase under the chromaffin cell-specific phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene promoter, with floxedGRK2 mice. After confirming a significant ( approximately 50%) reduction of adrenal GRK2 mRNA and protein levels, the PNMT-driven GRK2 knock-out (KO) offspring underwent myocardial infarction (MI) to induce HF. At 4 weeks post-MI, plasma levels of both norepinephrine and epinephrine were reduced in PNMT-driven GRK2 KO, compared with control mice, suggesting markedly reduced post-MI sympathetic activation. This translated in PNMT-driven GRK2 KO mice into improved cardiac function and dimensions as well as amelioration of abnormal cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor signaling at 4 weeks post-MI. Thus, adrenal-targeted GRK2 gene KO decreases circulating CAs, leading to improved cardiac function and beta-adrenergic reserve in post-MI HF. GRK2 inhibition in the adrenal gland might represent a novel sympatholytic strategy that can aid in blocking HF progression."

https://openalex.org/W2088655832,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) plays a central role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism and metabolic adaptation to environmental and nutritional stimuli. We recently described a novel, biologically active splice variant of PGC-1alpha (NT-PGC-1alpha, amino acids 1-270) that retains the ability to interact with and transactivate nuclear hormone receptors through its N-terminal transactivation domain. Whereas PGC-1alpha is an unstable nuclear protein sensitive to ubiquitin-mediated targeting to the proteasome, NT-PGC-1alpha is relatively stable and predominantly cytoplasmic, suggesting that its ability to interact with and activate nuclear receptors and transcription factors is dependent upon regulated access to the nucleus. We provide evidence that NT-PGC-1alpha interacts with the nuclear exportin, CRM1, through a specific leucine-rich domain (nuclear export sequence) that regulates its export to the cytoplasm. The nuclear export of NT-PGC-1alpha is inhibited by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-194, Ser-241, and Thr-256 on NT-PGC-1alpha, which effectively increases its nuclear concentration. Using site-directed mutagenesis to prevent or mimic phosphorylation at these sites, we show that the transcriptional activity of NT-PGC-1alpha is regulated in part through regulation of its subcellular localization. These findings suggest that the function of NT-PGC-1alpha as a transcriptional co-activator is regulated by protein kinase A-dependent inhibition of CRM1-mediated export from the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2075124821,"Activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has anti-tumor effects in colon cancer cells but the mechanisms are not fully understood. This study has examined the regulation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling, as this pathway has been highlighted as central to the anti-tumor effects of PKG. We show that PKG activation in SW620 cells results in reduced beta-catenin expression and a dramatic inhibition of TCF-dependent transcription. PKG did not affect protein stability, nor did it increase phosphorylation of the amino-terminal Ser33/37/Thr41 residues that are known to target beta-catenin for degradation. However, we found that PKG potently inhibited transcription from a luciferase reporter driven by the human CTNNB1 promoter, and this corresponded to reduced beta-catenin mRNA levels. Although PKG was able to inhibit transcription from both the CTNNB1 and TCF reporters, the effect on protein levels was less consistent. Ectopic PKG had a marginal effect on beta-catenin protein levels in SW480 and HCT116 but was able to inhibit TCF-reporter activity by over 80%. Investigation of alternative mechanisms revealed that cJun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was required for the PKG-dependent regulation of TCF activity. PKG activation caused beta-catenin to bind to FOXO4 in colon cancer cells, and this required JNK. Activation of PKG was also found to increase the nuclear content of FOXO4 and increase the expression of the FOXO target genes MnSOD and catalase. FOXO4 activation was required for the inhibition of TCF activity as FOXO4-specific short-interfering RNA completely blocked the inhibitory effect of PKG. These data illustrate a dual-inhibitory effect of PKG on TCF activity in colon cancer cells that involves reduced expression of beta-catenin at the transcriptional level, and also beta-catenin sequestration by FOXO4 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2035322774,"In eukaryotic nuclei the majority of genomic DNA is believed to exist in higher order chromatin structures. Nonetheless, the nature of direct, long range nucleosome interactions that contribute to these structures is poorly understood. To determine whether these interactions are directly mediated by contacts between the histone H4 amino-terminal tail and the acidic patch of the H2A/H2B interface, as previously demonstrated for short range nucleosomal interactions, we have characterized the extent and effect of disulfide cross-linking between residues in histones contained in different strands of nucleosomal arrays. We show that in 208-12 5 S rDNA and 601-177-12 nucleosomal array systems, direct interactions between histones H4-V21C and H2A-E64C can be captured. This interaction depends on the extent of initial cross-strand association but does not require these specific residues, because interactions with residues flanking H4-V21C can also be captured. Additionally, we find that trapping H2A-H4 intra-array interactions antagonizes the ability of these arrays to undergo intermolecular self-association.

In eukaryotic nuclei, DNA is packaged into chromatin to facilitate and regulate the storage, segregation, organization, and utilization of the genome. Chromatin is a complex DNA-protein assembly that exhibits multiple levels of structures. Its most basic structural unit, the nucleosome, is composed of an octamer (two copies each of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), wrapped by 147 base pairs of DNA (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6921) Google Scholar, 2Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1097-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). In general, the majority of genomic DNA is sequestered in nucleosomes (3van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar), and in their most extended form these nucleosomal arrays form a 10-nm fiber. However, even for cells in interphase, it is widely believed that most of the chromatin adopts higher order structures. In these cells a variety of chromatin fibers have been observed, including fibers that are more than 100 nm thick (4Belmont A.S. Bruce K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The understanding of higher order chromatin structures has been significantly aided by in vitro studies of isolated and reconstituted nucleosomal array systems, where reversible short range intra-array and long range interarray nucleosome associations can be induced even in the absence of additional chromatin-associated proteins (5van Holde K.

Within the nucleosome, the amino-terminal portions of the histones that extend past the nucleosomal DNA, the histone tails, have been shown to affect both intra- and interarray associations (7Fletcher T.M.

Another important region within the nucleosome is the acidic patch interface of histones H2A and H2B (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6921) Google Scholar), where mutations to this region can change both intra- and interarray interactions (10Fan J.Y. Rangasamy D. Luger K.

However, based on crystal contacts observed in the first high resolution structure of a mononucleosome, i.e. a nucleosome not linked to other nucleosomes through intervening linker DNA, it was proposed that one way in which nucleosome interactions occur in nucleosomal arrays is through direct contact between the H4 tail of one nucleosome and the H2A/H2B interface of another nucleosome (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6921) Google Scholar, 17Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Indeed, for intra-array nucleosomal interactions, this contact has been captured by disulfide and photo-affinity cross-linking (18Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 19Kan P.Y. Caterino T.L. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Whether such interactions also occur for interarray associations is not as clear, because support for such a model has been indirect and potentially conflicting. In some cases, changes to the H4 tail and the H2A surface result in similar changes in intra- and interarray associations (9Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 10Fan J.Y. Rangasamy D. Luger K. Tremethick D.J. Mol.

Biol. 2007; 14: 1105-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting either that both types of interactions share a common mechanism or that intra-array associations facilitate interarray associations. In contrast, there are a number of examples where changes to the H4 tail-H2A/H2B interface interaction result in different intra- and interarray association effects (10Fan J.Y. Rangasamy D. Luger K. Tremethick D.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 655-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 16Zhou J. Fan J.Y. Rangasamy D. Tremethick D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This is seen, perhaps most dramatically, in the case of studies with tetramer arrays that lack the H2A and H2B subunits entirely. Studies of these systems have shown that they are highly defective in intra-array association (20Hansen J.C. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2339-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, despite the absence of any H2A or H2B histone, these arrays are just as capable of forming interarray associations as arrays with a complete complement of histones (8Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These results may indicate that the major mechanism of interarray association is different from than that for intra-array associations or that these two types of interactions are interrelated in a way such that changes in one type of nucleosome to nucleosome interaction can affect the nature of the other. To provide a foundation for interpreting these observations, we sought to determine the extent and nature of direct cross-strand interactions between the H4 tail and the H2A/H2B surface. Because of the complexity and large size of the self-associated array species, standard structural techniques are not readily applicable. Moreover, because the H4 interaction with the H2A/H2B surface is already known to be directly involved in intra-array interactions, any technique used must be able to separate this contribution from those involved in interarray interactions. By adapting a nucleosomal array system previously developed to trap intra-array nucleosome interactions (18Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we have been able to isolate and better understand the interactions of the H4 tail and H2A/H2B surface in interarray self-association. 208-12 5 S rDNA and 601-177-12 DNA templates were excised from plasmids and purified by gel filtration chromatography according to standard methods (9Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 21Carruthers L.M. Tse C. Walker 3rd, K.P. Hansen J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 174-bp carrier DNA was prepared by PCR amplification of the purified 196-bp fragment that results from complete EcoRI digestion of the 208-12 template. Carrier DNA was purified by phenol chloroform extraction and gel electroelution. The purity and quantity of the template and carrier DNA were determined by gel electrophoresis and absorbance spectroscopy. Xenopus histones were recombinantly expressed, purified, and characterized using standard methods (22Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine-containing histones H2A-E64C, H4-K20C, H4-V21C, H4-L22C, and H4-R23C were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) of the bacterial expression vectors containing histone genes (22Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Octamers were assembled and purified in the presence of 0.1 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) 2The abbreviations used are: TCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochlorideDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)ox/redoxidized to reduced. reductant using standard methods (22Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). All of the octamers were prepared using H3-C110A. The octamers were characterized by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and absorbance spectroscopy (22Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) oxidized to reduced. Nucleosomal arrays were assembled by mixing histone octamers and DNA components followed by the stepwise salt dialysis method as previously described (13Shogren-Knaak M. Ishii H. Sun J.M. Pazin M.J. Davie J.R. Peterson C.L. Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 21Carruthers L.M. Tse C. Walker 3rd, K.P. Hansen J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 0.1 mm TCEP reductant was added to the DNA and octamer mixture and to the dialysis solutions. For 208-12 arrays, molar ratios of octamer to template varied from 0.9 to 1.1. For 601-177-12 arrays, octamer to template to carrier DNA molar ratios were 1.15–1.3:1.0:0.3. Carrier DNA and mononucleosomes were removed by differential centrifugation as previously described (9Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The final composition of the array solutions included array buffer (2.5 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA for 208-12; 2.5 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, for 601-177-12) and 0.1 mm TCEP, and the arrays were stored at 0 °C. The arrays were quantified based on amount of DNA by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Array saturation was analyzed by restriction endonuclease analysis, sedimentation velocity analysis, and differential centrifugation assay as described below. Arrays with similar nucleosome saturation were used for studies. 2× cross-linking solutions were prepared by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (2× final concentration of 100 mm), 100 mm glutathione (2× final concentration of 2 mm, molar ratios of oxidized (Sigma) to reduced (Acros Organics) glutathione of 1:15, 1:7, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, 7:1, and 15:1), and 500 mm MgCl2 (2× final concentrations from 0 to 12.0 mm for interarray cross-linking, 2.0 mm for intra-array cross-linking) to the appropriate array buffer. To initiate cross-linking, this solution was mixed in an equal volume with nucleosomal arrays (concentration of 50 ng/μl of DNA template). For inter-molecular cross-linking, the arrays were incubated at room temperature for 16 h followed by the addition of an equal volume of EDTA solution (final concentration, 20 mm) and further incubation at room temperature for 2 h. For intra-molecularly cross-linked arrays, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. These samples were then dialyzed three times at 4 °C in array buffer. After dialysis, the absorbance values of samples at 260 nm were measured before and after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature to quantify and remove any highly cross-linked species. Array concentrations were determined by subtracting the 260-nm absorbance of a mock reaction consisting of all of the components except the array. Ideal solution conditions for generating cross-linked histone standards are those in which the histone is fully reduced and denatured, and where the solution is at a high ionic strength to allow close approach of the highly basic histones. 7 m guanidine hydrochloride fulfills these criteria and was used for the reduction and cross-linking steps. Urea was used in the dialysis steps used to remove the reductant because of its lower cost. Specifically, lyophilized histones H2A-E64C and H4-V21C were resuspended in unfolding buffer (7 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol), dialyzed two times in 7 m urea and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and finally dialyzed in 7 m guanidine-HCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Dialyzed histones were then quantified by absorbance. H2A-E64C alone, H4-V21C alone, or a one-to-one mixture of H2A-E64C and H4-V21C were mixed with 4 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) prepared in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, to achieve a final concentration of 100:50 μm histone to DTNB for single histones and 200:100 μm histones to DTNB for mixed histones. This mix was incubated at room temperature for 12–16 h and then dialyzed in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 4 °C. The histones were then dried, resuspended in protein loading dye with no reducing agents, and stored at −20 °C. As previously described, EcoRI and ScaI digestion was used to characterize the extent of nucleosome saturation of the 208-12 and 601-177-12 arrays, respectively (9Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 21Carruthers L.M. Tse C. Walker 3rd, K.P. Hansen J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The resulting mononucleosomes and free DNA were analyzed on 4% native PAGE gel followed by ethidium bromide staining. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with a Beckman XLA ultracentrifuge. Nucleosomal arrays were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 18 to 25 ng/μl of DNA template and at speeds from 12,000 to 16,000 rpm. TCEP to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and 0.1 mm additional EDTA were added to non-cross-linked nucleosomal arrays prior to analysis. For intramolecularly cross-linked arrays, the mock sample was used as reference, and no TCEP or EDTA was added to the samples. The data were analyzed using the method of van Holde and Weischet on Ultrascan data analysis software (Dr. B. Demeler, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX) as described previously (23Demeler B. van Holde K.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Differential centrifugation analysis of nucleosomal arrays prior to cross-linking was performed largely as previously described (8Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In short, nucleosomal arrays (∼30 ng/μl of DNA template) were mixed with an equal volume of array buffer containing both 0.1 mm TCEP reductant and MgCl2 at twice the desired final concentration. Following 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the arrays were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance of array in the supernatant was then determined at 260 nm. To calculate the fraction of nucleosomal array remaining in solution, this absorbance was divided by the absorbance of array that remains in solution when treated similarly, but with a 0 mm final MgCl2 concentration. The differential centrifugation analysis of cross-linked arrays was performed in a similar manner, but with the following differences. No TCEP reductant was present and the absorbance of array in the supernatant was determined relative to a mock cross-linked sample, which lacked nucleosomal arrays, but was otherwise treated identically. For the inter-molecularly cross-linked arrays, no additional array buffer or MgCl2 was added prior to measuring the absorbance. For arrays containing no cysteine residues, ∼75% recovery of initial signal was observed, potentially because of incomplete magnesium ion sequestration or a different array subpopulation, and the absolute recovered absorbance has been reported. For intra-molecularly cross-linked array, 10× MgCl2 in array buffer was added in a ratio of 1:9 instead of the 2× MgCl2 solution prior to measuring the absorbance. All of the trials were repeated at least three times mostly with the same array preparation and presented either as the representative data or the mean values, with error bars representing the standard deviation. Histones from cross-linked arrays were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (final concentration, 20% trichloroacetate) and resuspended in protein loading dye with no reducing agent. The histones were separated on an 18% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized using Coomassie Blue. Direct interactions between the histone H4 tail of one nucleosome and the H2A/H2B acidic patch of another have been previously demonstrated within the same nucleosomal array by Richmond and co-workers (18Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) using oxidative cross-linking. In this system, substitution of cysteines for histone residues H4-Val21 and H2A-Glu64 allowed them to trap interactions that occurred under conditions where nucleosomal arrays exhibit intramolecular but not intermolecular compaction. To adapt this technique to study the extent of interarray contacts between the H4 tail and H2A/H2B acidic patch, our strategy was to generate two different sets of arrays, where each array consisted of nucleosomes that included either H4-V21C histones or H2A-E64C histones. With a mixture of these arrays, if this interaction is involved in interarray association, then disulfide cross-linking would be induced under conditions that cause interarray self-association. The products of this cross-linking can then be characterized to assess how much of the array association persists under conditions that do not normally promote array self-association. Additionally, the nature of the cross-linked histone species can be determined, where any observed H2A-H4 cross-linking is only possible via interarray contacts. To generate well defined nucleosomal arrays, wild-type and cysteine-containing Xenopus laevis histones were recombinantly expressed, purified, and assembled into histone octamers. These octamers were then deposited onto recombinantly expressed and purified DNA templates by stepwise salt dialysis. In our initial experiments 208-12 DNA templates containing 12 head to tail repeats of the naturally occurring Lytechinus variegatus 5 S rDNA sequence were used (24Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Arrays were assembled to be significantly saturated, but not oversaturated, and to be closely matched in saturation. To confirm this, the arrays were characterized by EcoRI digestion (Fig. 1A), sedimentation velocity analysis (Fig. 1B), and cation-dependent differential centrifugation assays (Fig. 1C). Comparison of the results for the three arrays indicate that the arrays are well matched in saturation, that the arrays are nearly saturated (21Carruthers L.M. Tse C. Walker 3rd, K.P. Hansen J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Horn P.J. Crowley K.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and that the presence of the cysteine residues does not change their properties under nonoxidizing conditions. In the differential centrifugation analysis (Fig. 1C), in contrast to arrays assembled from isolated, endogenous histones (26Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no plateau is observed for lower magnesium ion concentration. Nonetheless, this behavior is consistent with previous studies of arrays reconstituted from recombinantly expressed core histones (10Fan J.Y. Rangasamy D. Luger K. Tremethick D.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 655-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Horn P.J. Crowley K.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and occurs regardless of whether or not the histones in the arrays contain cysteine residues (Fig. 1C). To capture interarray interactions, equal amounts of H2A-E64C and H4-V21C arrays were mixed with a solution containing magnesium chloride and glutathione. With a final concentration of divalent magnesium ion of either 4.0 or 6.0 mm, the arrays were expected to be fully self-associated and form species that exhibit a large sedimentation coefficient (Fig. 1C). The glutathione in solution contained equal molar amounts of its oxidized and reduced forms, creating a redox buffer in which histone disulfide formation could reach equilibrium with respect to the redox potential established by the ratio of glutathione species. Prior to analysis of the cross-linked arrays, EDTA was added to chelate the divalent magnesium and thereby limit interarray association caused by noncovalent interactions. Differential centrifugation analysis of these arrays, in which the amount of nonsedimented arrays is assessed after centrifugation, revealed that the glutathione-treated array mixture generated one or multiple species with very large sedimentation coefficients relative to wild-type arrays, consistent with extensive interarray cross-linking (Fig. 1D). Significant sedimentation was not observed with similar treatment of arrays containing H2A-E64C histones (Fig. 1D), indicating that H2A-H2A cross-linking was not responsible for the interarray association. However, arrays containing only H4-V21C did show significant sedimentation, suggesting that H4-H4 cross-linking could be responsible for the interarray association in the mixed array experiment. To directly assess the nature of the histone cross-linking, the histone composition of these reactions was analyzed by nonreducing denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1E). Consistent with the differential centrifugation, this analysis shows that H2A-E64C arrays do not generate cross-linked histones, whereas H4-V21C arrays, as well as mixtures of H2A-E64C and H4-V21C arrays, do. The H4-V21C arrays generate H4-H4 cross-linked histones, whereas the H2A-E64C and H4-V21C array mixture predominantly captures direct interarray interactions between histones H4-V21C and H2A-E64C while also producing some of the H4-H4 cross-linked species. To determine the relative stability and role of the H2A-H4 cross-link in interarray association, we investigated the effects of decreasing the oxidizing potential in the cross-linking reaction. For the H2A-E64C and H4-V21C array mixture, the formation of interarray cross-linked species that sediments remains constant over decreasing ratios of oxidized to reduced glutathione (Fig. 2A). In contrast, formation of such species for the H4-V21C arrays alone decreases with decreasing oxidizing potentials. At an oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio of 1:15, the array mixture shows complete sedimentation, whereas all of the individual array species show no discernable sedimentation (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the histones under these conditions shows that for the mixed array experiments, cross-linked H2A-H4 histones are the predominant cross-linked species, although some H4-H4 cross-linking is still observed (Fig. 2C). For the H4 arrays alone, H4-H4 cross-linking is still present, although slightly reduced relative to the higher oxidation potentials (data not shown). This indicates that the nature of the remaining H4-H4 cross-linked histones is insufficient to facilitate interarray sedimentation. In the mixed arrays, the amount of H4-H4 cross-linking is even less and suggests that, because the larger amounts of H4-H4 cross-linking observed in the H4-V21C arrays alone were not sufficient to promote interarray sedimentation, the smaller amounts present in the mixed arrays are not likely to be the species responsible for the interarray sedimentation, i.e. the H2A-H4 cross-linked species are the predominant species responsible for the interarray sedimentation. In self-associated arrays, interarray cross-linking between H4-V21C and H2A-E64C is favored over the other potential modes of cross-linking. We expected that this cross-linking was because these sites are brought into close spatial proximity with one another in self-associated arrays. To directly test this idea, we determined the relationship between array self-association and interarray cross-linking. As has been previously shown (8Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and is apparent in Fig. 1C, self-association of arrays is facilitated by divalent cations. Thus, if the observed interarray cross-linking requires array self-association, the degree of interarray cross-linking should decrease with decreasing amounts of divalent cation. Indeed, formation of species sufficiently cross-linked to sediment in the absence of divalent cations occurs only when initial cross-linking is performed at higher concentrations of divalent cation (Fig. 3A). Formation of this stably associated species appears to require H2A-H4 interactions, because arrays with only one of these components do not show significant differential centrifugation. Further, analysis of the histones from the H2A-E64C and H4V21C array mixture after cross-linking treatment shows the H2A-H4 cross-linked pair"

Here, we demonstrate that in addition to its regulation by extracellular protons (pHo) TASK-2 is gated open by intracellular alkalinization. The following pieces of evidence suggest that the gating process controlled by intracellular pH (pHi) is independent from that under the command of pHo. It was not possible to overcome closure by extracellular acidification by means of intracellular alkalinization. The mutant TASK-2-R224A that lacks sensitivity to pHo had normal pHi-dependent gating. Increasing extracellular K+ concentration acid shifts pHo activity curve of TASK-2 yet did not affect pHi gating of TASK-2. pHo modulation of TASK-2 is voltage-dependent, whereas pHi gating was not altered by membrane potential. These results suggest that pHo, which controls a selectivity filter external gate, and pHi act at different gating processes to open and close TASK-2 channels. We speculate that pHi regulates an inner gate. We demonstrate that neutralization of a lysine residue (Lys245) located at the C-terminal end of transmembrane domain 4 by mutation to alanine abolishes gating by pHi. We postulate that this lysine acts as an intracellular pH sensor as its mutation to histidine acid-shifts the pHi-dependence curve of TASK-2 as expected from its lower pKa. We conclude that intracellular pH, together with pHo, is a critical determinant of TASK-2 activity and therefore of its physiological function.

The TREK group of K2P K+ channels has been shown to be sensitive to the internal concentration of protons: TREK-1 and -2 (K2P2.1 and K2P10.1) are activated, and TRAAK (K2P4.1) is inhibited by internal acidification (6Maingret F.

Recently, TREK-1 and TREK-2 have been found to respond also to external proton concentration within the physiological range (10Cohen A. Ben-Abu Y. Hen S. Zilberberg N. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but, remarkably, although TREK-1 is strongly inhibited by extracellular acidification, TREK-2 is activated by acidification (11Sandoz G. Douguet D. Chatelain F. Lazdunski M. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is well known that K+ channels play important roles in epithelial transport processes of electrolytes and nonelectrolytes (12Hebert S.C. Desir G. Giebisch G. Wang W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 319-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Heitzmann D. Warth R. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1119-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reabsorption of HCO3− in the kidney proximal tubules, which accounts for up 80% of the filtered load, is an example. Transepithelial flux of HCO3− relies on the coordinated action of a luminal Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3), carbonic anhydrases (II and IV) and a basolateral electrogenic Na+/HCO3− cotransporter (NBCe1-A) that shuttles two negative charges per transport cycle. Continued efflux of HCO3− will depolarize the cell, thus decreasing the driving force for the process. It has been proposed that concomitant activation of a basolateral K+ conductance would be required to produce the hyperpolarization necessary to sustaining HCO3− transport. A recent study suggests that TASK-2 channels might be responsible for this conductance (14Warth R. Barrière H. Meneton P. Bloch M. Thomas J. Tauc M. Heitzmann D. Romeo E. Verrey F. Mengual R. Guy N. Bendahhou S. Lesage F. Poujeol P. Barhanin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8215-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It was shown that a leak-type current present in mouse cultured proximal tubule cells when HCO3− transport is active is not present in cells from a TASK-2 deficient (knock-out) mouse. The mutant mouse displays a reduced arterial blood pressure and a tendency to loose Na+ in urine and suffers from metabolic acidosis probably through a proximal tubular loss of Na+ and HCO3−. The authors of this work proposed that accumulation of basolateral HCO3− would activate basolateral TASK-2 channels by virtue of the ensuing extracellular alkalinization to provide the hyperpolarization needed for continuous cotransporter activity (14Warth R. Barrière H. Meneton P. Bloch M. Thomas J. Tauc M. Heitzmann D. Romeo E. Verrey F. Mengual R. Guy N. Bendahhou S. Lesage F. Poujeol P. Barhanin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8215-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The presence of extracellular and intracellular carbonic anhydrases and the fact that HCO3− is an important mobile buffer in the kidney and other cells (15Boron W.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2368-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) predict that changes in its flux will have an impact on intracellular pH (pHi) in the proximal tubule. We have now found that pHo-sensitive K+ channels belonging to the TALK group, opened by alkaline pHo, are also sensitive to intracellular pH (pHi). In contrast, acid-sensitive channels TASK-1 and TASK-3 are indifferent to pHi. In the present work, we explore in some detail the dependence of TASK-2 upon pHi, clearly separate the effects of extra- and intracellular pH on TASK-2 and identify Lys245, a residue located at the interface between the last transmembrane domain and the beginning of the large C terminus domain, as a possible sensor transducing the effects of pHi into gating regulation. The strong dependence of TASK-2 on intracellular pH will have to be taken into account when interpreting the possible role of this K+ channel in the process of bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Mus musculus TASK-2 (GenBankTM accession number AF319542) plasmid was obtained from mouse kidney (16Niemeyer M.I. Cid L.P. Barros L.F. Sepúlveda F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43166-43174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Human TALK-2 (GenBankTM accession number BC025726) was obtained from the ATCC mammalian gene collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse TASK-1 (GenBankTM accession number AB008537) was obtained from Dr. Donghee Kim and TASK-3 (GenBankTM accession number AF212827) from Dr. Jürgen Daut. All cDNAs were subcloned into the pCR3.1 vector. Transient transfections were done in HEK-293 cells as described previously using CD8 cotransfection to identify effectively transfected cells (17Cid L.P. Niemeyer M.I. Ramírez A. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1198-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CD8 antigen was revealed with microspheres (Dynabeads) coated with an anti-CD8 antigen. Site-directed mutagenesis and chimaera constructions were done by PCR as described previously (17Cid L.P. Niemeyer M.I. Ramírez A. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1198-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cells were transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope for study, where they were continuously superfused with a bathing solution containing 67.5 mm Na2SO4, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm potassium gluconate, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 105 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5. The high K+ solution was obtained by equimolar replacement of Na+ by K+. The pipette solution contained 8 mm KCl, 132 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In experiments to measure the extracellular pH dependence of the currents, HEPES, used for pH 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 in the bathing medium was replaced with AMPSO, 2The abbreviations used are: AMPSON-(1,1,-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-3-amino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acidCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acidMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidWTwild-typeBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidTM4transmembrane domain 4. pH 8.5 and 9.0; CAPS, pH 9.5, 10, and 11; or MES, pH 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0.

Sulfate was replaced by gluconate in the bath solutions when changes in intracellular pH were required: 135 mm sodium gluconate, 1 mm potassium gluconate, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 105 mm sucrose, 10 mm, HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5. For manipulations with NH4Cl, NH4Cl was added as an aliquot from a 2.5 m stock. Solutions containing 33 mm HCO−3 were made using the sodium salt with an equivalent decrease in sodium gluconate. This solution was maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 until used. In experiments designed to measure the intracellular pH dependence of the currents, we used an approach relying on intracellular loading with a weak base or acid in the pipette solution, which provides a means for imposing and maintaining a chosen pHi, or, by changing the external concentration of the weak electrolyte, to change pHi rapidly and reversibly. This procedure has been validated in various cell types by direct measurement of intracellular pH (19Grinstein S. Romanek R. Rotstein O.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1152-C1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yuan Y. Shimura M. Hughes B.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated not to be affected by membrane potential in neurons (21Hartzler L.K. Dean J.B. Putnam R.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 605: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The solutions used here to clamp pHi are based on those described previously (20Yuan Y. Shimura M. Hughes B.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Varying the transmembrane concentration gradient for acetate pHi was changed according to the relationship: pHi=pHo-log([acetate-]o/[acetate-]i)(Eq. 1) The composition of solutions used was as follows: pipette: 82 mm potassium gluconate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm BAPTA-sodium, pH adjusted to 7.4 with Tris; bath: sodium gluconate X, sodium acetate Y (where X + Y = 135), 4 mm KCl, 4 1 mm potassium gluconate, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and titrated to pH 7.4 with Tris. The extracellular concentration of acetate was varied between 126 and 1.26 mm to achieve intracellular pH values between 7.0 and 9.0 (20Yuan Y. Shimura M. Hughes B.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Intracellular pH values in the range 6.3–8.5 were obtained with a pipette solution containing 10 mm acetate and extracellular acetate concentrations between 125 and 0.8 mm. For pHi values 7.5–9.5, intracellular acetate was 130 mm, and extracellular acetate varied between 103 and 1.03 mm. Different intracellular acetate concentrations were compensated by equimolar changes in gluconate. Enough sucrose was added to give an osmolality of 300 mosm. When appropriate, Na+ was replaced by K+ to achieve symmetrical concentration of potassium. Standard whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed as described elsewhere (13Heitzmann D. Warth R. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1119-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Currents were measured at several potentials, but data mostly reported are those obtained at 0 mV. Recordings of single channels in the inside-out configuration were performed in symmetrical 140 mm K+. The inside aspect of the patch was bathed with the solution described above for the pipette in whole-cell recording experiments. All chemicals were from Sigma. The effect of pH on currents was evaluated by plotting current (I) measured at a membrane potential of 0 mV, against extracellular [H+]. For graphical representation, average ± S.E. I/Imax or I/IpH7.5 values were obtained from individual experiments. When appropriate, the fit of a Hill equation to the data was done for each individual experiment. The parameters are defined in the following equation: I = Imin + (Imax − Imin)/(1 + ([H+]/K½)nH). Fits were done using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm as implemented in the SigmaPlot software. Transient transfection of HEK-293 cells with TASK-2 or -3 or with TALK-2 cDNAs results in the generation of K+ currents as measured in the whole-cell configuration mode of the patch clamp technique. Fig. 1A shows currents elicited by pulsing to 0 mV in cells held at −70 mV. The currents are carried by K+ as intra- and extracellular Cl− concentrations are made equal (see “Experimental Procedures” for details of solution composition). Measured reversal potential of around −80 mV corresponds well with that of a K+ current, given K+ extra-/intracellular concentration ratio of 5/140 mm, and shifts to 0 mV in symmetrical K+ solutions. When cells are exposed to the weak base NH4Cl, transmembrane influx of NH3 leads to rapid rise of pHi, as intracellular NH3 combines with protons forming NH+4 (22Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). When this treatment was applied to cells expressing TASK-2 or TALK-2 an immediate increase in K+ current occurred, which reverted to control values upon removal of NH4Cl (Fig. 1A), suggesting that they are activated by intracellular alkalinization. The same procedure caused no change in the K+ channel activity in cells expressing TASK-3 (Fig. 1A) or TASK-1 (data not shown). These channels have previously been shown to be indifferent to internal proton concentration (3Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 5Rajan S. Wischmeyer E. Xin Liu G. Preisig-Müller R. Daut J. Karschin A. Derst C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In addition to being activated by intracellular alkalinization, TASK-2 current was inhibited by an acidification of the intracellular medium. This was achieved by a short pulse of a 5% CO2-HCO3− that, owing to the high permeability of CO2, will rapidly acidify intracellularly. As shown in Fig. 1B, such a treatment strongly inhibited the TASK-2-mediated K+ current. From these qualitative experiments, it would appear that TASK-2 is sensitive to pHi, being activated by alkalinization and inhibited by acidification. Yuan et al. (20Yuan Y. Shimura M. Hughes B.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) established that using a 50 mm intracellular acetate concentration and BAPTA to buffer Ca2+, changes in extracellular acetate bring about the expected changes in pHi as verified by direct measurement with the fluorescent pH probe 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. We have used this acetate-rich pipette to explore in more detail the dependence of TASK-2 activity on pHi. The use of these solutions did not alter the characteristic open rectification of TASK-2 or its selectivity of K+ over Na+ (supplemental Fig. 1). Fig. 2A shows the effect of clamping pHi at values between 7.0 and 9.0 by changing [acetate−]o between 1.26 and 126 mm with [acetate−]i of 50 mm. TASK-2-mediated current was inhibited by acidification to pHi 7.0 and was gradually increased by alkalinization. The effect was reversible upon return to a basal pHi of 7.5. TASK-2 is gated open by extracellular alkalinization in a similar pH range as described here for intracellular alkalinization. This gating process is mediated by arginine 224, so that mutant TASK-2-R224A channels lack sensitivity to pHo (24Niemeyer M.I. González-Nilo F.D. Zúñiga L. González W. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, when TASK-2-R224A was challenged with changes in intracellular pH, it was inhibited by intracellular acidification and activated by an alkaline pHi in much the same way as wild-type (WT) TASK-2 (Fig. 2B). Data from six experiments of each WT TASK-2 and TASK-2-R224A at pHi 7.5 and 9.0 are shown in the right-hand side graphs to Fig. 2, A and B, and show significant increases in currents measured at 0 mV upon alkalinization from 7.0 to 9.0. Fits of a Hill equation to WT TASK-2 data at 0 mV gave average pK½ and nH values of 8.0 ± 0.07 and 0.9 ± 0.04 (n = 7). Equivalent figures for TASK-2-R224A were 7.7 ± 0.22 and 0.9 ± 0.16 (n = 5). In Fig. 2C, experiments investigating the effect of changes in pHi at various membrane potentials are shown. The values have been normalized to the currents at pHi 7.5 and indicate that the membrane potential has no effect on the pHi sensitivity of TASK-2. This is different from what has been observed for the effect of pHo on TASK-2, whose pK½ shows an acid shift with depolarization (2Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 3C below). In a previous study, we used molecular simulation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to show that the activation of TASK-2 by extracellular pH is mediated by neutralization of an arginine (Arg224) residue (24Niemeyer M.I. González-Nilo F.D. Zúñiga L. González W. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Arg224 is located at the extracellular end of TM4 near the second pore domain. The protonated form of Arg224 is thought to interfere, through an electrostatic effect, with potassium occupancy of the selectivity filter leading to blockade by a mechanism similar to C-type inactivation (24Niemeyer M.I. González-Nilo F.D. Zúñiga L. González W. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This type of inhibition has been shown to be very dependent upon extracellular potassium concentration, which, through a “foot in the door” mechanism, prevents the conformational changes responsible for C-type inactivation (25Cohen A. Ben-Abu Y. Zilberberg N. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 39: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have tested the effect of increasing extracellular K+ concentration to 140 mm on the modulation of TASK-2 by pHi. Fig. 3A shows that pHi dependence of TASK-2 was unaffected by increasing extracellular K+ from 5 to 140 mm. At this high K+ concentration, the effect of pHi was also voltage-independent in the range −60 to 60 mV (Fig. 3A). This contrasts with the activation of TASK-2 by extracellular pH, which occurred with pK½ values for activation of 8.1 and 7.6 at extracellular [K+]o of 5 and 140 mm, respectively (Fig. 3B). The lack of dependence of the pHi effect on membrane potential is also in contrast with the voltage dependence of the pHo effect (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, this last effect was only observed at low [K+]o. 3M. I. Niemeyer, L. P. Cid, and F. V. Sepúlveda, unpublished data. The results shown above suggest that gating by extra- and intracellular pH are separate and independent events that must be mediated by distinct molecular sensors and are transduced through actions at gates with different locations. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 is an attempt at overcoming closure by extracellular acidification by means of intracellular alkalinization. Maintaining [acetate−]i at 50 mm, we simultaneously changed pHo and pHi to obtain a closed channel at pHo 6.0 and pHi 7.5, which could not be opened by an increase in pHi to 8.5 (Fig. 4A). In the same cell, the channel was further activated by pHi 8.5 when the channel was open at a permissive pHo of 7.93. A bar chart (Fig. 4B) summarizes the activation of TASK-2 channel by an increase in pHi from 7.5 to 8.5 at extracellular pH of 6.0, 7.4, and 7.9. At pHo 6.0, TASK-2 activity was barely enhanced by the intracellular alkalinization. Similar percent increases could be attained by shifting pHi from 7.5 to 8.5 at permissive pHo values of 7.4 and 7.9. Considering that half-maximum enhancement of current occurs at pHo 8.03 (24Niemeyer M.I. González-Nilo F.D. Zúñiga L. González W. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this result points to independence of the effects of intra- and extracellular pH on TASK-2. In contrast to the effect of pHi in the TALK family, pHo-gated channels TASK-1 and TASK-3 are largely insensitive to changes in pHi. We verified this view using the acetate pHi clamp approach described above, as shown in supplemental Fig. 2. To test whether the region of TASK-2 that confers the channel its pHi sensitivity is situated in the rather large 260-amino acid C terminus, we constructed a chimera in which residues 243–502 of TASK-2 were replaced by the C-terminal residues 246–365 of the pHi-insensitive TASK-3. This leaves a channel consisting of the putative membrane-resident part of TASK-2 and the intracellular C terminus tail of TASK-3 (Fig. 5). This construct, which we term 244TASK-2-245TASK-3, lacked pHi sensitivity (supplemental Fig. 2), although it retained a near normal response to pHo (pK½ 9.06 ± 0.03, data not shown). This result suggests that pHi sensitivity might reside in the C terminus. Ablation of all but the first 31 residues of the TASK-2 C terminus in the TASK-2Δ273 mutant did not alter the response to changes in pHi (supplemental Fig. 2). Transplanting TASK-2 C terminus residues 244–502 of TASK-2 into a C terminus-less TASK-3 comprising residues 1–240 (Fig. 5) conferred TASK-3 some measure of pHi dependence that was completely lacking in the TASK-3 WT construct (supplemental Fig. 2). These data suggested that if a single residue, or a short stretch of residues, acts as a pHi sensor in TASK-2, it could be located in the region delimited by residues Val242 and Ser273. Examination of such a region, which corresponds to the distal TM4 end and the beginning of the C-terminal segment, reveals various titratable lysine residues (see Fig. 5) that, given the approximate pK½ of pHi effect of ∼8, might act as sensors. As seen in Fig. 5, neutralization of Lys454 and Lys258, as well as a multiple neutralization of eight basic residues between Lys257 and Lys264, did not alter pHi dependence as tested by the NH4Cl pulse approach. However, and as will be described in detail below, mutation at Lys245 had a profound effect on pHi sensitivity as tested by the NH4Cl pulse approach, which failed to elicit any change in current (data not shown). Fig. 6A shows an experiment measuring the pHi sensitivity of the TASK-2-K245A mutant. There was little evidence for significant effects of changes in pHi. This is confirmed in the graph of Fig. 6C that reports average values for pHi dependence of TASK-2-K245A and compares them with the response of WT TASK-2. Mutant TASK-2-K245C channels also lost all pHi regulation. Mutation K245A in TASK-2 did not alter the general characteristics of the current, suggesting that Na+/K+ selectivity of TASK-2 were unaltered by removal of pHi dependence (supplemental Fig. 1). Similarly, pHo dependence was not altered by mutation K245A (supplemental Fig. 4). Lys245 is located toward the C-terminal side of TM4 in TASK-2, a segment that plays the role of inner helix in these dimeric channels, and therefore lines the intracellular cavity of the pore. The other helix lining the intracellular cavity is TM2. As shown in Fig. 5, in addition to the conserved putative hinge Gly122 (Gly234 in TM4), there is not much sequence conservation between these two transmembrane domains. Nevertheless, there are some basic amino acids immediately following TM2 that were neutralized by mutation to test for their possible role in pHi sensing. As reported in Fig. 5, none of these mutations affected the ability of intracellular alkalinization to activate TASK-2. The effect of intracellular pH could also be detected in single channel recordings performed in inside-out patches from cells expressing TASK-2. The left-hand side of Fig. 7 shows traces of WT TASK-2 single channel activity in an inside-out patch exposed to intracellular pH values of 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. As expected, the activity at acid pH was quite low, but openings occurred more frequently as the medium bathing the intracellular aspect of the membrane was alkalinized to pH 7.5 and 8.5. The calculated NPo value increased from 0.03 at pH 6.5 to 0.41 and 0.72 at pH 7.5 and 8.5, respectively. The single channel conductance was not altered by changes in pHi as can be seen in supplemental Fig. 3, which also reports mean values for NPo as a function of pHi. As shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 7, there was no marked effect of varying intracellular pH on the activity of the TASK-2-K245A mutant. Mean values of NPo for the mutant channels were 0.74 ± 0.08, 0.75 ± 0.02, and 0.79 ± 0.07 at intracellular pH values of 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, respectively (means ± S.E., n = 3). It might be expected that if Lys245 was a pHi sensor in TASK-2, replacement by mutation to a different basic amino acid might preserve pHi sensitivity but shift the activity pHi curve according to the shift in pKa of the amino acid. We have mutated Lys245 to His obtaining channels that generated currents sensitive to pHi (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6D, TASK-2-K245H had a sensitivity to pHi acid-shifted by >1 pH unit with respect to that of WT TASK-2 (pK½ 6.8 ± 0.06, n = 4). In contrast to what is seen with TASK-type K2P potassium channels, we report here that TALK-type channels TASK-2 and TALK-2 are sensitive to pHi, being activated by intracellular alkalinization and inhibited by intracellular acidification. We also present evidence that the control of gating by pHi occurs by a separate mechanism than the well known regulation of TASK-2 by extracellular pH and that a lysine residue in the cytoplasmic end of TM4 acts as a pHi sensor in the gating process.

In this paper, the Angolan MIS data were analyzed to produce the first smooth map of parasitaemia prevalence based on contemporary nationwide empirical data in the country. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to assess the effect of interventions after adjusting for environmental, climatic and socio-economic factors. Non-linear relationships between parasitaemia risk and environmental predictors were modeled by categorizing the covariates and by employing two non-parametric approaches, the B-splines and the P-splines. The results of the model validation showed that the categorical model was able to better capture the relationship between parasitaemia prevalence and the environmental factors. Model fit and prediction were handled within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Combining estimates of parasitaemia prevalence with the number of children under we obtained estimates of the number of infected children in the country. The population-adjusted prevalence ranges from in Namibe province to in Malanje province. The odds of parasitaemia in children living in a household with at least ITNs per person was by 41% lower (CI: 14%, 60%) than in those with fewer ITNs. The estimates of the number of parasitaemic children produced in this paper are important for planning and implementing malaria control interventions and for monitoring the impact of prevention and control activities."
https://openalex.org/W2050345313,"HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1) is an inducible microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of pro-oxidant heme. The goal of this study was to characterize a minimal enhancer region within the human HO-1 gene and delineate its role in modulating HO-1 expression by participation with its promoter elements in renal epithelial cells. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified a 220-bp minimal enhancer in intron 1 of the HO-1 gene, which regulates hemin-mediated HO-1 gene expression. Small interfering RNA, decoy oligonucleotides, site-directed mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the functional interaction of Sp1 with a consensus binding sequence within the 220-bp region. Mutations of regulatory elements within the -4.5 kb promoter region (a cyclic AMP response and a downstream NF-E2/AP-1 element, both located at -4.0 kb, and/or an E-box sequence located at -44 bp) resulted in the loss of enhancer activity. A chromosome conformation capture assay performed in human renal epithelial (HK-2) cells demonstrated hemin-inducible chromatin looping between the intronic enhancer and the -4.0 kb promoter region in a time-dependent manner. Restriction digestion with ApaLI (which cleaves the 220-bp enhancer) led to a loss of stimulus-dependent chromatin looping. Sp1 small interfering RNA and mithramycin A, a Sp1 binding site inhibitor, resulted in loss of the loop formation between the intronic enhancer and the distal HO-1 promoter by the chromosome conformation capture assay. These results provide novel insight into the complex molecular interactions that underlie human HO-1 regulation in renal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1988947808,"Omp85 proteins are essential proteins located in the bacterial outer membrane. They are involved in outer membrane biogenesis and assist outer membrane protein insertion and folding by an unknown mechanism. Homologous proteins exist in eukaryotes, where they mediate outer membrane assembly in organelles of endosymbiotic origin, the mitochondria and chloroplasts. We set out to explore the homologous relationship between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, studying the Omp85 protein from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Using state-of-the art sequence analysis and clustering methods, we show how this protein is more closely related to its chloroplast homologue Toc75 than to proteobacterial Omp85, a finding supported by single channel conductance measurements. We have solved the structure of the periplasmic part of the protein to 1.97 A resolution, and we demonstrate that in contrast to Omp85 from Escherichia coli the protein has only three, not five, polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains, which recognize substrates and generally interact with other proteins in bigger complexes. We model how these POTRA domains are attached to the outer membrane, based on the relationship of Omp85 to two-partner secretion system proteins, which we show and analyze. Finally, we discuss how Omp85 proteins with different numbers of POTRA domains evolved, and evolve to this day, to accomplish an increasing number of interactions with substrates and helper proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2014184505,"T-box 2 (TBX2) is a transcription factor involved in mammary development and is known to be overexpressed in a subset of aggressive breast cancers. TBX2 has previously been shown to repress growth control genes such as p14(ARF) and p21(WAF1/cip1). In this study we show that TBX2 drives proliferation in breast cancer cells and this is abrogated after TBX2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or after the expression of a dominant-negative TBX2 protein. Using microarray analysis we identified a large cohort of novel TBX2-repressed target genes including the breast tumour suppressor NDRG1 (N-myc downregulated gene 1). We show that TBX2 targets NDRG1 through a previously undescribed mechanism involving the recruitment of early growth response 1 (EGR1). We show EGR1 is required for the ability of TBX2 to repress NDRG1 and drive cell proliferation. We show that TBX2 interacts with EGR1 and that TBX2 requires EGR1 to target the NDRG1 proximal promoter. Abrogation of either TBX2 or EGR1 expression is accompanied by the upregulation of cell senescence and apoptotic markers. NDRG1 can recapitulate these effects when transfected into TBX2-expressing cells. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism for TBX2-driven oncogenesis and highlight the importance of NDRG1 as a growth control gene in breast tissue."

Each genome segment is dedicated to a single polymerase complex (PC) anchored to the interior of the particle. Particle-associated PCs act in synchrony to transcribe and replicate the viral dsRNA segments. Thus, subviral particles of dsRNA viruses can be viewed as nanoscale factories containing multiple highly coordinated PC machines. During transcription, each genome segment serves as a template for the generation of plus-strand RNAs (+RNAs). In addition to directing viral protein expression, +RNAs also serve as templates for minus-strand synthesis to recreate dsRNA duplexes. The intraparticle mechanism of RNA synthesis not only protects the genome from recognition by antiviral dsRNA sensors but also provides a mechanism for coordinating +RNA packaging with genome replication (4McDonald S.M.

The innermost layer of the TLP, referred to as the T = 1 core shell, is made up of 120 copies of VP2 organized as 12 decamers (Fig. 1) (13McClain B. Settembre E. Temple B.R. Bellamy A.R.

VP2-A monomers tightly encircle the 5-fold vertex of the decamer, whereas VP2-B monomers are situated farther back and intercalate VP2-A (13McClain B. Settembre E. Temple B.R. Bellamy A.R. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). An aqueous channel traversing the VP6 and VP2 layers at each 5-fold vertex (type I channel) serves as a conduit for the exit of +RNAs, and additional channels permit the entry of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) and divalent cations (9Prasad B.V.

Tethered to the inner surface of the VP2 shell near each 5-fold vertex is a single PC, consisting of the viral RdRp (VP1) and the viral RNA-capping enzyme (VP3) (13McClain B. Settembre E. Temple B.R.

Within the core shell, the genome is organized in symmetrical layers, with each segment spooled around one PC (13McClain B. Settembre E. Temple B.R. Bellamy A.R. Harrison S.C. J. Mol.

Because there are 12 5-fold vertices in the icosahedral core particle and only 11 segments of dsRNA in the RV genome, one vertex may lack an associated RNA molecule or PC. Together, the 11 RV genome segments encode six viral structural proteins (VP1–VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1–NSP6) (7Estes M.K. Kapikian A.Z. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1917-1974Google Scholar). During entry into a host cell, the VP4–VP7 outer capsid layer of the TLP is lost, yielding a double-layered particle (DLP) (Fig. 2) (7Estes M.K. Kapikian A.Z. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M.

In the cytoplasm, the DLP becomes transcriptionally active; its interior PCs act in concert to produce the 11 species of viral +RNA (1Lawton J.A. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V. Adv.

Transcription is conservative, with the parental plus and minus strands of dsRNA segments retained within the DLP. Multiple rounds of transcription result in the accumulation of numerous copies of each +RNA (1Lawton J.A. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V. Adv.

Following synthesis of the first few nucleotides of nascent transcripts, the VP3 component of the PC adds a 5′-terminal m7G cap (17Chen D. Luongo C.L. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T.

Thereafter, +RNA molecules are extruded out of the DLP and into the cytosol through type I channels located above the PCs (1Lawton J.A. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V. Adv.

These +RNAs not only direct protein synthesis but also accumulate in electron-dense cytoplasmic inclusions termed viroplasms. Viroplasms represent viral factories that are nucleated by the interaction of two multifunctional nonstructural proteins (NSP2 and NSP5) (27Fabbretti E. Afrikanova I. Vascotto F. Burrone O.R. J. Gen.

Its counterpart, NSP5, is a serine/threonine-rich phosphoprotein that forms dimers, which bridge NSP2 octamers (28Taraporewala Z.F. Patton J.T.

Virol. 1997; 71: 34-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NSP2 and NSP5 are presumed to be responsible not only for recruiting unassembled core proteins to viroplasms but also for retaining +RNAs made by DLPs in these inclusions. The interaction of NSP2 and NSP5 with core proteins and +RNA may be vital for regulating the complex sequence of events required to assemble progeny cores (24Jayaram H. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V. Virus Res. 2004; 101: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Taraporewala Z.F. Patton J.T. Virus Res. 2004; 101: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Patton J.T. Silvestri L.S. Tortorici M.A. Vasquez-Del Carpio R. Taraporewala Z.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 309: 169-187PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the NSP2 octamer undergoes ATP-dependent conformational shifts, consistent with the possibility that it serves as a packaging motor that introduces +RNAs into cores (30Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The characterization of replication intermediates (RIs) isolated from infected cells has provided important clues into the process by which core assembly is coordinated with +RNA packaging and dsRNA synthesis (Fig. 2) (37Gallegos C.O. Patton J.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Helmberger-Jones M. Patton J.T. Virology. 1986; 155: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39Patton J.T. Gallegos C.O. Virology. 1988; 166: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Patton J.T. Gallegos C.O. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the PC proteins, VP1 and VP3, interact with +RNAs in the viroplasm to form replication-incompetent precore RIs (28Taraporewala Z.F. Patton J.T. Virus Res. 2004; 101: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Gallegos C.O. Patton J.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Patton J.T. Gallegos C.O. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is during the formation of precore RIs that RNA-RNA interactions are thought to drive assortment, selection of the 11 different viral +RNAs that will be packaged and replicated. Interactions of VP2 with precore RIs mediate the formation of replication-competent core RIs, structures that contain the full complement of viral +RNAs (37Gallegos C.O. Patton J.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 40Patton J.T. Gallegos C.O. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The PC proteins of core RIs synthesize 11 viral dsRNAs from the packaged +RNAs. Each PC directs a single round of minus-strand synthesis, and the dsRNA product is retained within the core. Interestingly, core RIs decrease in size and become RNase-resistant as genome replication proceeds, yet genomic dsRNA is protected from dsRNA-specific RNase (40Patton J.T. Gallegos C.O. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that, initially, +RNAs are incompletely encapsidated by the VP2 shell of the core RI but are completely protected by the time the VP2 shell has fully matured and genome replication is complete. Following replication, VP6 trimers interact with core RIs, generating progeny DLPs. Some newly formed DLPs may become transcriptionally active, allowing them to contribute to the pool of +RNAs in the viroplasm that will be encapsidated and replicated within assembling cores (41Ayala-Breton C. Arias M. Espinosa R. Romero P. Arias C.F. López S. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8819-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the final stages of virion assembly, DLPs transit to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they acquire VP4 and VP7 prior to lytic release from the cell (7Estes M.K. Kapikian A.Z. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1917-1974Google Scholar, 42Pesavento J.B. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 309: 189-219PubMed Google Scholar). Although VP3 is a component of RV PCs, VP1 does not require the viral capping enzyme for dsRNA synthesis in vitro (43Wentz M.J. Zeng C.Q. Patton J.T. Estes M.K. Ramig R.F. Arch. Virol. 1996; 12: 59-67Google Scholar). Notably, this enzyme does have an important role in genome replication in vivo, as small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of VP3 expression in infected cells yields a reduction in progeny particles containing dsRNA (41Ayala-Breton C. Arias M. Espinosa R. Romero P. Arias C.F. López S. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8819-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 44Vásquez M. Sandino A.M. Pizarro J.M. Fernández J. Valenzuela S. Spencer E. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that dsRNA synthesis by VP1 is strictly dependent upon the presence of the core shell protein VP2 (41Ayala-Breton C. Arias M. Espinosa R. Romero P. Arias C.F. López S. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8819-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 45Mansell E.A. Patton J.T. J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear how VP1 is regulated by VP2, but prevailing evidence suggests that an interaction between these two proteins during core assembly triggers the RdRp to begin minus-strand synthesis (48McDonald S.M. Tao Y.J. Patton J.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 49Tortorici M.A. Broering T.J. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32673-32682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant VP2 is capable of self-assembling into empty core-like particles and putative assembly intermediates (i.e. decamers), making it an ideal scaffold (50Crawford S.E. Labbé M. Cohen J. Burroughs M.H. Zhou Y.J. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5945-5952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Labbé M. Charpilienne A. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2946-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N termini of VP2 molecules cluster to form an internal hub at each 5-fold vertex that is in proximity to engage VP1 (Fig. 1) (13McClain B. Settembre E. Temple B.R. Bellamy A.R. Harrison S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Removal of VP2 N termini not only abrogates VP1 and VP3 encapsidation into core-like particles but also severely diminishes VP1-mediated in vitro genome replication (47Patton J.T. Jones M.T. Kalbach A.N. He Y.W. Xiaobo J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9618-9626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Labbé M. Charpilienne A. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K. Cohen J. J.

This result suggests that the VP2 N-terminal structure plays an important role in genome replication either by directly triggering VP1 to begin RNA synthesis or by facilitating interactions between the RdRp and the T = 1 shell. The molar ratio of VP1 to VP2 for optimal in vitro genome replication is 1:10, which reflects the stoichiometry of the RV core (49Tortorici M.A. Broering T.J. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32673-32682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, an attractive model for RV assembly and genome replication is that VP2 decamers form around individual +RNA-bound PCs, making complete 5-fold vertices. It is likely that VP1 within the PC remains inactive until all 12 vertices interact to form an icosahedron. Unlike genome replication, RV transcription has not been reconstituted in vitro using recombinant proteins. Consequently, the minimal components required for +RNA synthesis are not known. DLPs isolated from RV-infected cells are transcriptionally active in vitro, whereas single-layered core particles are not, suggesting that VP6 is required (1Lawton J.A. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 185-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of recombinant VP6 to isolated RV core particles can restore their transcriptional activity (54Charpilienne A. Lepault J. Rey F. Cohen J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7822-7831Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 55Kohli E. Pothier P. Tosser G. Cohen J. Sandino A.M. Spencer E. Arch.

Virol. 1994; 135: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Still, mere recoating is not sufficient, as some forms of VP6 are capable of binding cores but not inducing transcription (54Charpilienne A. Lepault J. Rey F. Cohen J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7822-7831Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 55Kohli E. Pothier P. Tosser G. Cohen J. Sandino A.M. Spencer E. Arch.

Virol. 1994; 135: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results suggest that VP6 induces precise but as of yet unidentified structural changes in the VP2 layer, which influence the activity of the internally bound PCs. In addition to VP6, the outer VP7 layer is also an important regulator of transcription. Specifically, structural studies have shown that removal of VP7 exposes channels in the VP6 and VP2 layers, presumably allowing NTPs and divalent cations to flow into the DLP interior (57Chen J.Z. Settembre E.C. Aoki S.T. Zhang X. Bellamy A.R. Dormitzer P.R. Harrison S.C. Grigorieff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10644-10648Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of VP7, the diameter of the type I channels is increased, facilitating exit of newly made +RNAs (57Chen J.Z. Settembre E.C. Aoki S.T. Zhang X. Bellamy A.R. Dormitzer P.R. Harrison S.C. Grigorieff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10644-10648Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). During assembly of TLPs, addition of VP7 may serve to inhibit the transcriptional activity of newly formed DLPs. RV RNA molecules contain important sequence and structural elements that promote their use as templates for replication and transcription. The +RNA templates for dsRNA synthesis contain 5′-m7G caps but lack 3′-poly(A) tails (58Imai M. Akatani K. Ikegami N. Furuichi Y. J. Virol. 1983; 47: 125-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RV +RNAs typically contain a single open reading frame flanked by 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, which are of variable length. There is little sequence identity among the +RNAs, except for short consensus sequences (CSs) located at the extreme termini (59Mitchell D.B. Both G.W. Virology. 1990; 177: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 3′CS of RV +RNA (3′CS+) has the sequence 5′-UGUGACC-3′. This element has been functionally defined, using in vitro replication assays, as the minimal essential promoter for dsRNA synthesis (43Wentz M.J. Zeng C.Q. Patton J.T. Estes M.K. Ramig R.F. Arch. Virol. 1996; 12: 59-67Google Scholar, 49Tortorici M.A. Broering T.J. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32673-32682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 60Patton J.T. Wentz M. Xiaobo J. Ramig R.F. J.

The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions contain complementary sequences that mediate folding of +RNAs in cis into structures with extended panhandles. In these structures, the 3′CS+ is either not base-paired or only partially so, leaving the 3′-end of the +RNAs in a single-stranded conformation accessible to the RdRp (62Barro M. Mandiola P. Chen D. Patton J.T. Spencer E. Virology. 2001; 288: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 63Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7387-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free replication assays have established that the 3′-terminal CC residues of the 3′CS+ are required for initiation of minus-strand synthesis; on the other hand, electrophoretic mobility assays have shown that the UGUG residues of the 3′CS+ are important for specific recognition of +RNAs by VP1 (46Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7940-7947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Tortorici M.A. Broering T.J. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32673-32682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 60Patton J.T. Wentz M. Xiaobo J. Ramig R.F. J.

Virology. 2001; 282: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′CS+ is a multifunctional element that contributes not only to template recognition but also to RNA catalysis. VP1 recognition of the highly conserved 3′CS+ likely represents a critical step in packaging of +RNAs into viral cores, providing a mechanism by which viral RNAs can be distinguished from nonviral RNAs. Stem-loops are predicted to extend from the 5′–3′-panhandles of folded RV +RNAs (63Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7387-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65Patton J.T. Spencer E. Virology. 2000; 277: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 66Tortorici M.A. Shapiro B.A. Patton J.T. RNA. 2006; 12: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the precise location and length of the putative stem-loops differ among the 11 RV +RNAs, these structures are hypothesized to serve as assortment signals that mediate RNA-specific packaging of the 11 viral RNAs during core formation (65Patton J.T. Spencer E. Virology. 2000; 277: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The minus strands of dsRNA genome segments serve as the templates for transcription. Unlike the 5′-end of the plus strand, the minus strand lacks a 5′-cap (3Patton J.T. Vasquez-Del Carpio R. Tortorici M.A. Taraporewala Z.F. Adv. Virus Res. 2007; 69: 167-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 3′CS of the minus strand (3′CS−) is less conserved than the 3′CS+ of +RNAs, usually consisting of the sequence 5′-(A/U)7GCC-3′ (3Patton J.T. Vasquez-Del Carpio R. Tortorici M.A. Taraporewala Z.F. Adv. Virus Res. 2007; 69: 167-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the critical residues and elements in the minus strand that promote +RNA synthesis is limited by the lack of an efficient in vitro transcription system that can utilize exogenous dsRNA templates. Nonetheless, the conservation of the terminal CC residues in both the 3′CS− and 3′CS+ suggest that this dinucleotide plays a critical role in initiating both +RNA and minus-strand RNA (−RNA) synthesis. The catalytic polypeptide of the RV PC is VP1, a hollow enzyme composed of three domains: a globular N-terminal domain, a central polymerase domain, and a C-terminal bracelet domain (Fig. 3) (6Lu X.

The cell envelope represents the only major structural element in bacterial cells, and it extends from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer layer(s) of wall and capsular polymers. Also, it constitutes an important functional compartment to organize essential metabolic processes, such as solute transport, protein translocation, and respiratory/photorespiratory energy generation. As a mesh-like cell wall heteropolymer that completely surrounds the cell, the peptidoglycan (PG) 4The abbreviations used are: PGpeptidoglycanApeO-acetylpeptidoglycan esteraseIPTGisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranosideLTlytic transglycosylaseMltBmembrane-bound lytic transglycosylase BsMltBsoluble derivative of membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase BRcsregulator of capsule synthesisHEWLhen egg-white lysozymeIMACimmobilized-metal affinity chromatography. sacculus confers strength, support, and shape to bacteria (all but the mycoplasmas), as well as resistance to internal turgor pressures (1Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Consequently, maintaining the integrity of PG is essential to bacterial viability, which is reflected by the number of different classes of clinically important antibiotics that target its biosynthesis. The list of these include the glycopeptide vancomycin and the β-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams). The PG sacculus is also the target of the antibacterial enzyme lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17; muramidase), which is present at high concentrations in animal secretions, including tears and saliva, as well as representing a major component of the innate immune system (reviewed in Ref. 2Dziarski R.

The PG sacculus is not a static structure, but rather it is continually expanded as cells grow. Its metabolism also involves its cleavage for the creation of both pores for secretion systems and sites for the insertion of flagella, in addition to the lysis of septa during cell division (3Koraimann G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2371-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A key class of endogenous enzymes responsible for PG lysis are the lytic transglycosylases (LTs) (4Scheurwater E. Reid C.W. Clarke A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The LTs cleave PG with the same specificity as the lysozyme, that is, the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between MurNAc and GlcNAc residues (Fig. 1). However, unlike lysozyme, LTs are not hydrolases as they cleave PG with the concomitant formation of an intramolecular 1,6-anhydromuramoyl reaction product (5Höltje J.V. Mirelman D. Sharon N. Schwarz U. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of both LTs and lysozyme is inhibited by modifications to the C-6 hydroxyl moiety of muramoyl residues in PG. The most common modification to occur at this site among all bacteria is O-acetylation (Fig. 1). The O-acetylation of PG has been detected in a wide variety of bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, including important human pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, the enterococci (e.g. Enterococcus faecalis), Bacillus anthracis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis (6Clarke A.J. Dupont C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4550-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Pfeffer J.M. Strating H. Weadge J.T. Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 902-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to this modification to the PG substrate, a collection of Gram-negative bacteria appears to produce small protein inhibitors of lysozyme, one of which is named Ivy (inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme) (9Monchois V.

First identified as the product of the ykfE gene in Escherichia coli (9Monchois V. Abergel C. Sturgis J. Jeudy S. Claverie J.M. J. Biol.

Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Of these, the homologous Ivyp1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa also has been proven experimentally to inhibit type C lysozymes. Structural studies with Ivyc and Ivyp1 determined that the consensus sequence forms a rigid loop, which is locked by both a disulfide bridge between the two Cys residues and a salt bridge between the Lys and Asp residues. Ivy paralogs, which are found in species of Pseudomonas including P. aeruginosa, lack the consensus loop sequence, and it is replaced with a more variable sequence flanked by the two conserved Cys residues. Thus, despite their overall sequence similarity to Ivyc and Ivyp1, these Ivy paralogs do not inhibit lysozyme, and their function remained unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that both Ivyp1 and the paralog Ivyp2 inhibit membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase B (MltB) from P. aeruginosa and that the true physiological function of these periplasmic inhibitors may be to control autolysis in cells that do not O-acetylate their PG. Unless stated otherwise, all reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The soluble derivative of recombinant MltB (sMltB) from P. aeruginosa PAO1 was isolated and purified as described previously (11Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sources of plasmids and bacterial strains used or constructed in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. E. coli strains DH5α and BL21(λDE3) were maintained on Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or agar (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario, Canada) at 37 °C, which was supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. For overexpression studies and the production of high levels of proteins, E. coli BL21(λDE3) was grown in SuperBroth (5 g of sodium chloride, 20 g of yeast extract, and 32 g of Tryptone) at 37 °C with agitation. Samples of insoluble PG were isolated from the different bacteria listed in supplemental Table 1 using the boiling SDS protocol, and they were purified by enzyme treatment (amylase, DNase, RNase, Pronase) as described by Clarke (12Clarke A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The extent of O-acetylation of insoluble PG samples was determined as described previously (7Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4550-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using the Megazyme acetic acid assay kit (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd., Wicklow, Ireland) to quantify the released ester-linked acetate (13Weadge J.T. Clarke A.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The extent of O-acetylation is presented as a molar percentage of muramic acid content. Genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa PAO01 was used as template for the PCR reactions. All oligonucleotide primers used in this study (listed in supplemental Table 2) were acquired from the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada). PCR amplifications were achieved in 50-μl volumes using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR system 2400. Conditions were optimized for each primer pair using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science, Laval, Quebec, Canada). Purification of PCR products was performed using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) or the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science). PCR products and vectors were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes according to the manufacturer's instructions and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The MinElute reaction cleanup kit was used to purify the DNA from these reactions prior to their ligation into the pET28a(+) vector. Individual constructs were isolated from transformants, screened for the correct size insert, and completely sequenced to confirm nucleotide identity. E. coli BL21(DE3) freshly transformed with plasmid DNA was inoculated into SuperBroth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C until early exponential phase (A600 of ∼0.5). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for a further 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), washed, and resuspended in IMAC buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl) containing Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors, 10 μg/ml RNase, and 5 μg/ml DNase I. Suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min prior to at least three passages through a French pressure cell press (18 000 p.s.i.). Insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) (0.5 ml/liter starting culture) for 1–5 h at 4 °C. Contaminating proteins were removed from the resin by washing with 10 column volumes each of cold IMAC buffer, IMAC buffer at pH 7, and IMAC buffer at pH 6. Ivyp1 and Ivyp2 were recovered in 10 ml of IMAC buffer at pH 4.5 and dialyzed at 4 °C against 2 × 4 liters of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The turbidometric assay of Hash (14Hash J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1201-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to monitor the time course of PG solubilization by either HEWL or sMltB. Whole cells or purified PG from Micrococcus luteus were suspended at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and subjected to brief sonication to provide homogeneous suspensions. Enzyme (20–60 μg) was added to 1.5-ml (final volume) samples of substrate suspension, and the decrease in turbidity was monitored continuously at OD660 nm for a period of 15 min to 2 h. Reaction mixtures lacking the addition of enzyme served to control for settling of the insoluble substrate. The inhibition of HEWL and sMltB by Ivyp1 and Ivyp2 was tested by preincubating the enzymes with the potential inhibitors (0–15 μm) for 15 min at 25 °C prior to their addition to assay mixtures. Signal sequence predictions were performed using SignalP 3.0 and TMpred. Homology searches for homologs, orthologs, and paralogs of Ivyc were performed using the online BLASTP program to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, and analysis of sequence data was performed using ClustalW2 software (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using 12% acrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and proteins were detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and Western immunoblot analysis using an anti-His6 tag antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. A phylogenetic analysis conducted previously by Abergel et al. (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found that Ivy appeared to be distributed sporadically and only among the Proteobacteria (Gram-negative bacteria). Despite the plethora of genome sequences that are now available, an exhaustive search of the publicly accessible databases using three sequences iteratively as the queries, those of E. coli Ivyc and P. aeruginosa Ivyp1 and Ivyp2, led to our discovery of only 13 more bacterial species as producers. Moreover, it appears that Ivy continues to be confined to a few species of the alpha (Gluconobacter, Paracoccus), beta (Burkholderiaceae, Neisseriaceae), and gamma (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae) subdivisions of the Proteobacteria. Consistent with previous observations (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), each of the newly discovered hypothetical proteins are predicted to be localized to the periplasm. A phylogenetic tree of Ivy homologs and paralogs is presented in Fig. 2 and, perhaps not unexpectedly, the proteins are organized generally according to phylogeny of the producing bacteria. Each member of the Ivyc/p1 family is characterized by the CKPHDC consensus sequence, which has been demonstrated to be essential for binding to C-type lysozymes (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Kyomuhendo P. Nilsen I.W. Brandsdal B.O. Smalås A.O. J. Mol. Model. 2008; 14: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Ivyp2 paralogs, represented by P. aeruginosa Ivyp2 as the prototype, lack this consensus sequence but possess instead the consensus motif CEXXDXC. The alignment of each of the hypothetical sequences is presented in supplemental Figs. 1 and 2. It is interesting to note that P. aeruginosa is still found to be the only producer of both Ivyp1 and Ivyp2 and that Ivyp2 is confined to only the pseudomonads. Upon examination of the list of bacterial species that encode homologs of either Ivyp1 or Ivyp2 on their chromosome, it occurred to us that it included those few bacteria previously known to not O-acetylate their PG. Indeed, of the many bacteria that have been examined for the presence of O-acetylated PG (6Clarke A.J. Dupont C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4550-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Pfeffer J.M. Strating H. Weadge J.T. Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 902-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), only E. coli and P. aeruginosa (7Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4550-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been found to be devoid of the modification. Thus, we conducted a search of each of the genomes of the Ivy-producing bacteria for the presence of either oatA (18Bera A. Herbert S. Jakob A. Vollmer W. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) or the poa cluster (19Weadge J.T. Pfeffer J.M. Clarke A.J. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Moynihan P.J. Clarke A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13264-13273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), genes known to encode the enzymes responsible for PG O-acetylation in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Thus, S. aureus OatA (ZP_06334688), N. gonorrhoeae PatB (AAW89271), and B. anthracis Ape3 (NP843402) were used in these BLASTP searches. In addition, we also searched for homologs of N. gonorrhoeae Ape1 (AAW89270), an esterase responsible for removing O-acetyl groups from peptidoglycan (13Weadge J.T. Clarke A.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and also encoded within the poa cluster (19Weadge J.T. Pfeffer J.M. Clarke A.J. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Without exception, hypothetical homologs of these proteins were not found in any of the bacteria that would appear to encode homologs of either Ivyp1 or Ivyp2. To confirm this absence, the PG from a selection of these bacteria was isolated and purified and then analyzed directly for O-acetylation. The list of these bacteria included strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas putida, in addition to P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. With each, the level of ester-linked acetate associated with the isolated PGs was below 1% relative to muramic acid content; levels in producing species are greater than 15%, and typically range from 30 to 60% (6Clarke A.J. Dupont C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4550-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Pfeffer J.M. Strating H. Weadge J.T. Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 902-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Appropriate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for PCR amplification of both the 477-bp ivyp1 (PA3902) and the 483-bp ivyp2 (PA5481) from P. aeruginosa genomic DNA. Amplified products were cloned into pET28a(+), and the two constructs, pACCC-1 (encoding 165 amino acids; Ivyp1 and a C-terminal His6 tag) and pACCC-3 (encoding 167 amino acids; Ivyp2 and a C-terminal His6 tag), were transformed into E. coli DH5α. To circumvent any potential problems associated with the production of multiple processed forms of the full-length proteins, truncated derivatives of IvyP1 and Ivyp2, encoded on pACCC-2 and pACCC-4, respectively, were engineered that lack their N-terminal 24 and 23 amino acid residues, respectively. These residues were selected for deletion because they constitute their predicted cleavable signal sequences. Recombinant Ivyp1 and Ivyp2 overproduced in E. coli BL21(λDE3) cells were isolated and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The proteins were recovered by pH elution. Thus, lowering the pH of the wash buffer to 6 served to remove contaminating proteins, and both Ivyp1 and Ivyp2 were recovered in IMAC buffer at pH 4.5. Yields of ∼3 mg of protein were routinely prepared from 1 liter of culture medium by this protocol. Ivyp1 from P. aeruginosa, but not Ivyp2, has been shown previously to inhibit C-type lysozymes (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the current study. Preincubation of Ivyp1 at concentrations as low as 5 μm resulted in complete inhibition of the lytic activity of hen egg white lysozyme (Fig. 3), whereas it remained fully active in the presence of Ivyp2. No other activity had been determined for Ivyp2, and consequently its function remained unknown. Given that the LTs function as bacterial autolysins and share the same substrate specificity as lysozymes, we decided to test whether Ivyp2 acts to inhibit them. As shown in Fig. 3, purified Ivyp2 was found to inhibit the lytic activity of the soluble recombinant form of membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase B, sMltB, under conditions optimal for its activity (viz. 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 100 mm NaCl (11Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). Moreover, and to our surprise, Ivyp1 also inhibited sMltB. These inhibitions were dependent on the concentration of each Ivy (Fig. 4). Careful titration of sMltB with increasing concentrations of either Ivyp1 or Ivyp2 revealed them to be equally potent inhibitors. Thus, 50% inhibition of sMltB was achieved with 3 molar eq of either Ivyp1 or Ivyp2, and less than 5% residual activity remained in the presence of an Ivy:sMltB molar ratio of 13. The biochemical and structural analysis of the protein encoded by ykfE from E. coli was found to be a potent inhibitor of C-type lysozymes and thus renamed Ivyc for inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by others demonstrated that Ivyc and its homolog Ivyp1 from P. aeruginosa contribute to both lysozyme resistance (22Deckers D. Masschalck B. Aertsen A. Callewaert L. Van Tiggelen C.G. Atanassova M. Michiels C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Deckers D. Vanlint D. Callewaert L. Aertsen A. Michiels C.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 4434-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and survival of these bacteria in lysozyme-rich fluids, such as human saliva and breast milk, in addition to hen egg white (23Deckers D. Vanlint D. Callewaert L. Aertsen A. Michiels C.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 4434-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the essential cell wall component and target of lysozyme, PG, in Gram-negative bacteria is protected from exogenous agents by an outer membrane. Thus, the finding that (i) the production of Ivyc and its homologs is limited to Gram-negative bacteria rather than to Gram-positive bacteria, which possess exposed peptidoglycan and (ii) they are localized to the periplasm rather than to the external milieu was considered a paradox (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Compounding this paradox is the fact that the Ivyc-like proteins have limited specificity, and they are weak inhibitors of only a subset of the G-type lysozymes (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Kyomuhendo P. Nilsen I.W. Brandsdal B.O. Smalås A.O. J. Mol. Model. 2008; 14: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite its similarity, Ivyp2, which is produced by some pseudomonads, does not inhibit any type of lysozyme, and its function remained unknown (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that both the Ivyc homolog Ivyp1 and its paralog Ivyp2 function as inhibitors of the LTs, endogenous bacterial autolysins. Moreover, we observed that the sporadic production of Ivy coincides with bacteria that do not O-acetylate peptidoglycan. In view of these findings, we suggest that the true physiological function of the Ivy proteins is to control the autolytic activity of LTs within the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria and that the inhibition of exogenous lysozyme by the Ivyc-like proteins is simply a fortuitous coincidence. This situation would thus be analogous to the initial identification and characterization of some housekeeping enzymes as antibiotic resistance factors. For example, the physiological function of the well studied gentamicin 2′-N-acetyltransferase produced by Providencia stuartii was later identified as peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase (24Payie K.G. Rather P.N. Clarke A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4303-4310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LTs are ubiquitous bacterial enzymes (25Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that cleave glycosidic bonds within the peptidoglycan sacculus to facilitate a number of critical cellular processes. Thus, they are required for, among other functions, the expansion of the cell wall by creating sites for the insertion of PG precursors, the turnover and recycling of PG, the cleavage of the septum during the separation of dividing cells, and the insertion of protein complexes that extend through the sacculus, such as secretion systems, flagella, and pili (recently reviewed in Ref. 4Scheurwater E. Reid C.W. Clarke A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As with the penicillin-binding proteins, peripheral membrane enzymes responsible for formation of new glycosidic linkages and peptide cross-linking in PG, bacteria produce a complement of different LTs (e.g. E. coli (26Scheurwater E.M. Clarke A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8363-8373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and P. aeruginosa (25Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) produce seven and nine unique enzymes, respectively). They are classified as autolysins because if left uncontrolled, their activity results in the dissolution of the cell wall and consequent cell rupture. Given the essential requirement for a free C-6 hydroxyl group on muramoyl residues for the formation of the 1,6-anhydromuramoyl product (Fig. 1), the O-acetylation of PG has been proposed to provide a means of controlling LT activity in those cells that perform this modification (4Scheurwater E. Reid C.W. Clarke A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although the O-acetylation of PG has been detected in many bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, and include a number of important human pathogens, it is not universally found. Hence, it was recognized that other forms of control over the LTs would have to exist in those bacteria that lack O-acetylated PG, but nothing specific was known. In such cases, it was simply assumed that the physical association of the LTs as lipoproteins with the inner leaflet of the outer membrane and/or with the penicillin-binding proteins as synthetic complexes provided a level of control (4Scheurwater E. Reid C.W. Clarke A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, this may not apply to the more soluble forms of LTs, such as Slt70 and Slt35 of E. coli or SltB1, SltB2, and SltB3 of P. aeruginosa. Thus, it seems reasonable to propose that because it is produced by Gram-negative bacteria that do not O-acetylate PG and it is localized specifically to the periplasm, Ivy serves to control the LTs of these bacteria. Support for the physiological role of Ivy-like proteins in the control of LTs is provided by the observation that Ivyc resides under the Rcs regulon in E. coli (27Ferrières L. Clarke D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1665-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Laubacher M.E. Ades S.E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Rcs phospho-relay system in E. coli was originally discovered as a regulator of capsule synthesis (29Gottesman S. Trisler P. Torres-Cabassa A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it was later found to be activated by the inhibition of PG biosynthesis following administration of β-lactam antibiotics (28Laubacher M.E. Ades S.E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mutational activation of the Rcs pathway leads to protection against β-lactam treatment (28Laubacher M.E. Ades S.E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which, in fact, would result from the increased production of Ivy. Indeed, the lethal effect of β-lactams is not caused directly by the inhibition of PG synthesis but rather by the continuing autolysis catalyzed by the LTs and other autolysins (21Tomasz A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Rogers H.J. Nature. 1967; 213: 31-33Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Rogers H.J. Forsberg C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of the Rcs phospho-relay in response to PG stress in some Enterobacteriaceae would be to induce the production of Ivy to prevent uncontrolled autolysis by LTs. Currently, it is not clear why only P. aeruginosa produces both forms of Ivyp1 and Ivyp2. It is possible that this requirement reflects the different complement of LTs that this bacterium produces when compared with the others. As noted earlier, E. coli produces seven distinct LTs (26Scheurwater E.M. Clarke A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8363-8373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas P. aeruginosa appears to encode nine in its genome (25Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, a more significant difference between these two bacteria is that P. aeruginosa produces four different forms of MltB (11Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), whereas E. coli only has one. Thus, this in combination with the larger complement of LTs in P. aeruginosa may necessitate the production of the two Ivy inhibitors. Ivyc inhibits HEWL by forming a tight complex involving a buried surface area of over 1,300 Å2 (10Abergel C. Monchois V. Byrne D. Chenivesse S. Lembo F. Lazzaroni J.C. Claverie J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6394-6399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Through this interaction, the active site cleft of HEWL becomes occluded by a loop protruding from Ivyc, and a His residue at the center of this loop makes hydrogen bonds with both the catalytic acid/base Glu-35 and the catalytic nucleophile Asp-52. We have initiated crystallization trials with complexes of MltB and both Ivyp1 and Ivyp2 to determine whether a similar mode of inhibition occurs despite the fact that the LTs have only a single catalytic (acid/base) residue.

Failure to regulate Cdc25A leads to deregulated cell-cycle progression, bypass of cell-cycle checkpoints and genome instability. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has an important role in balancing Cdc25A levels. Cdc25A contains a DS(82)G motif whose phosphorylation is targeted by beta-TrCP E3 ligase during interphase. Targeting beta-TrCP to Cdc25A requires phosphorylation of serines 79 (S79) and 82 (S82). Here, we report that casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1alpha) phosphorylates Cdc25A on both S79 and S82 in a hierarchical manner requiring prior phosphorylation of S76 by Chk1 or GSK-3beta. This facilitates beta-TrCP binding and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cdc25A throughout interphase and after exposure to genotoxic stress. The priming of Cdc25A by at least three kinases (Chk1, GSK-3beta, CK1alpha), some of which also require priming, ensures diverse extra- and intracellular signals interface with Cdc25A to precisely control cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2091973032,"Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and elevated levels of its enzymatic product prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) occur in the majority of colorectal cancers and have important roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. However, despite the established prosurvival role of PGE(2) in cancer, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we have shown that PGE(2) suppresses apoptosis via repression of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim in human colorectal adenoma cells. Repression of Bim expression was dependent upon PGE(2)-mediated activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, which promoted Bim phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. Reduction of Bim expression using RNA interference reduced spontaneous apoptosis in adenoma cells and abrogated PGE(2)-dependent apoptosis suppression. Treatment of COX-2-expressing colorectal carcinoma cells with COX-2-selective NSAIDs-induced Bim expression, suggesting that Bim repression via PGE(2) signalling may be opposed by COX-2 inhibition. Examination of Bim expression in two established in vitro models of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence revealed that downregulation of Bim expression was associated with tumour progression towards an anchorage-independent phenotype. Finally, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Bim expression is markedly reduced in approximately 40% of human colorectal carcinomas in vivo. These observations highlight the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway as an important negative regulator of Bim expression in colorectal tumours and suggest that Bim repression may be an important step during colorectal cancer tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2030548520,"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of chronic liver diseases, and frequently results in hepatitis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. The role of HCV in associations with insulin signaling has been elucidated. However, the pathogenesis of HBV-associated insulin signaling remains to be clearly characterized. Therefore, we have attempted to determine the mechanisms underlying the HBV-associated impairment of insulin signaling. Methodology The expressions of insulin signaling components were investigated in HBx-transgenic mice, HBx-constitutive expressing cells, and transiently HBx-transfected cells. Protein and gene expression was examined by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and promoter assay. Protein-protein interaction was detected by coimmunoprecipitation. Principal Findings HBx induced a reduction in the expression of IRS1, and a potent proteasomal inhibitor blocked the downregulation of IRS1. Additionally, HBx enhanced the expression of SOCS3 and induced IRS1 ubiquitination. Also, C/EBPα and STAT3 were involved in the HBx-induced expression of SOCS3. HBx interfered with insulin signaling activation and recovered the insulin-mediated downregulation of gluconeogenic genes. Conclusions/Significance These results provide direct experimental evidences for the contribution of HBx in the impairment of insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2120004160,"We have reconstituted human mitochondrial transcription in vitro on DNA oligonucleotide templates representing the light strand and heavy strand-1 promoters using protein components (RNA polymerase and transcription factors A and B2) isolated from Escherichia coli. We show that 1 eq of each transcription factor and polymerase relative to the promoter is required to assemble a functional initiation complex. The light strand promoter is at least 2-fold more efficient than the heavy strand-1 promoter, but this difference cannot be explained solely by the differences in the interaction of the transcription machinery with the different promoters. In both cases, the rate-limiting step for production of the first phosphodiester bond is open complex formation. Open complex formation requires both transcription factors; however, steps immediately thereafter only require transcription factor B2. The concentration of nucleotide required for production of the first dinucleotide product is substantially higher than that required for subsequent cycles of nucleotide addition. In vitro, promoter-specific differences in post-initiation control of transcription exist, as well as a second rate-limiting step that controls conversion of the transcription initiation complex into a transcription elongation complex. Rate-limiting steps of the biochemical pathways are often those that are targeted for regulation. Like the more complex multisubunit transcription systems, multiple steps may exist for control of transcription in human mitochondria. The tools and mechanistic framework presented here will facilitate not only the discovery of mechanisms regulating human mitochondrial transcription but also interrogation of the structure, function, and mechanism of the complexes that are regulated during human mitochondrial transcription."

To address this issue, we examined the strength of interneuron-to–pyramidal cell connections across the rat anterior piriform cortex (aPC) and found a pronounced gradient of increasing pyramidal cell inhibition along the aPC rostro-caudal axis. This functional heterogeneity could govern aPC spatial activation in response to varying odor identities and features."
https://openalex.org/W2056816992,"Reduced brain input of serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a potent neurotrophic peptide, may be associated with neurodegenerative processes. Thus, analysis of the mechanisms involved in passage of blood-borne IGF-I into the brain may shed light onto pathological mechanisms in neurodegeneration and provide new drug targets. A site of entrance of serum IGF-I into the brain is the choroid plexus. The transport mechanism for IGF-I in this specialized epithelium involves the IGF-I receptor and the membrane multicargo transporter megalin/LRP2. We have now analyzed this process in greater detail and found that the IGF-I receptor interacts with the transmembrane region of megalin, whereas the perimembrane domain of megalin is required for IGF-I internalization. Furthermore, a GSK3 site within the Src homology 3 domain of the C-terminal region of megalin is a key regulator of IGF-I transport. Thus, inhibition of GSK3 markedly increased internalization of IGF-I, whereas mutation of this GSK3 site abrogated this increase. Notably, oral administration of a GSK3 inhibitor to adult wild-type mice or to amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 mice modeling Alzheimer amyloidosis significantly increased brain IGF-I content. These results indicate that pharmacological modulation of IGF-I transport by megalin may be used to increase brain availability of serum IGF-I. Interestingly, GSK3 inhibitors such as those under development to treat Alzheimer disease may show therapeutic efficacy in part by increasing brain IGF-I levels, an effect already reported for other neuroprotective compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1970189147,"Inactivation of the mainly endosomal 2Cl−/H+-exchanger ClC-5 severely impairs endocytosis in renal proximal tubules and underlies the human kidney stone disorder Dent's disease. In heterologous expression systems, interaction of the E3 ubiquitin ligases WWP2 and Nedd4-2 with a “PY-motif” in the cytoplasmic C terminus of ClC-5 stimulates its internalization from the plasma membrane and may influence receptor-mediated endocytosis. We asked whether this interaction is relevant in vivo and generated mice in which the PY-motif was destroyed by a point mutation. Unlike ClC-5 knock-out mice, these knock-in mice displayed neither low molecular weight proteinuria nor hyperphosphaturia, and both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis were normal. The abundances and localizations of the endocytic receptor megalin and of the Na+-coupled phosphate transporter NaPi-2a (Npt2) were not changed, either. To explore whether the discrepancy in results from heterologous expression studies might be due to heteromerization of ClC-5 with ClC-3 or ClC-4 in vivo, we studied knock-in mice additionally deleted for those related transporters. Disruption of neither ClC-3 nor ClC-4 led to proteinuria or impaired proximal tubular endocytosis by itself, nor in combination with the PY-mutant of ClC-5. Endocytosis of cells lacking ClC-5 was not impaired further when ClC-3 or ClC-4 was additionally deleted. We conclude that ClC-5 is unique among CLC proteins in being crucial for proximal tubular endocytosis and that PY-motif-dependent ubiquitylation of ClC-5 is dispensable for this role.

This localization has facilitated the biophysical characterization of its transport properties. ClC-5 mediates strongly outwardly rectifying currents (2Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M.

ClC-5 disruption impairs fluid-phase as well as receptor-mediated endocytosis and also slows the hormone-stimulated endocytic retrieval of apical plasma membrane proteins such as the Na+-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2a (Npt2, SLC34A1) or the Na+/H+-exchanger NHE3 (12Piwon N.

Both enzymes contain WW-domains that can interact with “PY-motifs,” which are named after their critical proline and tyrosine residues.

Dutzler R. Structure. 2006; 14: 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A synthetic tridecameric peptide encompassing the PY-motif of ClC-5 was found to interact with several WW-domains (21Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), most avidly with the fourth WW-domain of WWP2. ClC-5 point mutations destroying the PY-motif consensus sequence (e.g. Y762E) led to a roughly 2-fold increase in ClC-5 currents and surface residence when expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes (19Schwake M. Friedrich T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This observation resembled findings with the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC, where PY-motif-dependent ubiquitylation is crucial for the regulation of its presence in the plasma membrane (24Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Coexpression of ClC-5 with dominant negative constructs of WWP2 led to increased currents and surface expression only when the PY-motif of ClC-5 was intact (19Schwake M. Friedrich T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that PY-motif-dependent ubiquitylation leads to ClC-5 internalization by endocytosis as it is the case with ENaC. Moreover, stimulating or inhibiting endocytosis by expressing the Q79L or S34N mutants of rab5, respectively, decreased or increased currents of wild-type (WT) ClC-5, but not of the PY-motif mutant (19Schwake M. Friedrich T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies (20Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Lee A. Lensink I.L.

Moreover, Hryciw et al. (20Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Lee A. Lensink I.L. Kumar S. Guggino W.B. Cook D.I. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. J. Biol.

Dominant negative constructs of Nedd4-2 or its RNA interference-mediated knock-down inhibited albumin endocytosis in opossum kidney cells, an epithelial cell line retaining properties of PTs (20Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Lee A. Lensink I.L. Kumar S. Guggino W.B. Cook D.I. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54996-55007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that PY-motif-dependent interactions of ClC-5 with ubiquitin ligases are important for PT endocytosis (20Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Lee A. Lensink I.L. Kumar S. Guggino W.B. Cook D.I. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54996-55007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to stimulating ClC-5 endocytosis, ubiquitylation of ClC-5 might have other effects on intracellular sorting and trafficking.We now tested these hypotheses by generating knock-in (KI) mice whose PY-motif in ClC-5 is destroyed by mutating the important tyrosine residue to glutamate (Y762E). These mice did not display proteinuria, and in vivo pulse-chase experiments revealed no discernible effect on different types of endocytosis. No increase of brush-border expression of ClC-5 could be detected, either. Because CLC proteins can form functional heterodimers (25Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26Weinreich F. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2347-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and because ClC-5 can associate with its close homologs ClC-3 and ClC-4 (27Suzuki T. Rai T. Hayama A. Sohara E. Suda S. Itoh T. Sasaki S. Uchida S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in the PT, we also investigated PT endocytosis in mice disrupted for ClC-3 or ClC-4 either alone or in combination with the ClC-5(Y762E) mutation. clcn3−/− (28Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bösl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J.

Moreover, endocytosis in PT cells lacking either ClC-3 or ClC-4 was normal, and deletion of ClC-3 or ClC-4 in addition to ClC-5 did not impair endocytosis beyond the effect seen in ClC-5 KO mice.RESULTSTo investigate the relevance of the PY-motif in vivo, we generated KI mice by mutating its crucial tyrosine residue to glutamate (Y762E) (supplemental Fig. S1). This mutation led to a ubiquitin-ligase-dependent increase in ClC-5 surface expression which could not be increased further by additionally mutating the two preceding prolines of the PY-motif (19Schwake M. Friedrich T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of kidney membrane proteins (Fig. 1A) showed that mice homozygous for the clcn5Y762E allele expressed the ClC-5Y762E protein to levels undistinguishable from ClC-5 in WT mice. Based on our previous results from heterologous expression (19Schwake M. Friedrich T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we expected to find the plasma membrane expression of ClC-5Y762E increased compared with WT ClC-5. However, the subcellular localization of ClC-5Y762E was undistinguishable by immunohistochemistry from that of WT ClC-5 (Fig. 1, B and C). In both PTs and intestinal epithelia, WT and mutant proteins were expressed predominantly on subapical vesicles and to a lower extent in the brush-border membrane.PY-motif-dependent ubiquitylation of ClC-5 was suggested to be important for receptor-mediated endocytosis (20Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Lee A. Lensink I.L. Kumar S. Guggino W.B. Cook D.I. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54996-55007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the disruption of the PY-motif in clcn5Y762E mice impairs proximal tubular endocytosis to the extent that it leads to low molecular weight proteinuria as in ClC-5 KO mice (12Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, neither silver staining of total urinary proteins nor immunoblotting for several marker proteins revealed proteinuria in clcn5Y762E mice (Fig. 2). There were no changes in urinary electrolytes either (supplemental Table S3). We speculated that a moderate impairment of endocytosis may not result in proteinuria because the proximal tubule is not operating at the limit of its capacity. We therefore induced proteinuria by repeated injection of bovine serum albumin into the peritoneum (36Nagasawa Y. Takenaka M. Kaimori J. Matsuoka Y. Akagi Y. Tsujie M. Imai E. Hori M. Nephrol. Dial.

BMC Nephrol. 2005; 6: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Induced albuminuria was found in both WT and clcn5Y762E mice, with no difference being apparent between genotypes (supplemental Fig. S4).FIGURE 2Disrupting the PY-motif of ClC-5 does not lead to proteinuria.A, silver staining of urine reveals proteinuria only in ClC-5 KO mice, with no difference between WT and clcn5Y672E mice. B, immunoblot on urine using antibodies against transferrin, albumin, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and retinol-binding protein (RBP) confirms low molecular weight proteinuria in ClC-5 KO mice that is absent from WT or ClC-5Y672E mutant mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The analysis of ClC-5-dependent endocytosis was greatly facilitated by comparing side-by-side PT cells expressing or lacking ClC-5 in heterozygous clcn5+/− females (12Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This was possible because ClC-5 is encoded on the X chromosome and is subjected to random X chromosomal inactivation in females. Whereas ClC-5 KO cells can be identified easily by immunofluorescence, our ClC-5 antibodies (4Günther W. Lüchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) recognize both WT ClC-5 and the Y762E point mutant. We therefore tagged the ClC-5Y762E protein by generating KI mice in which the region encompassing the last 11 amino acids of the C terminus of ClC-5Y762E was converted to that of ClC-3 (supplemental Fig. S1, B–D). This “negative tag” (denoted by an asterisk) requires the change of just two amino acids (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D) and results in a protein that should no longer be recognized by our C-terminal ClC-5 antibody in both immunohistochemistry and immunoblots. However, in immunoblots (Fig. 3A) as well as in immunohistochemistry (supplemental Fig. S2) a faint background signal was visible in ClC-5Y762E* animals which is probably caused by weak cross-reactivity of our ClC-5CT antibody with the C terminus of ClC-3 (Fig. 3, A-C, and supplemental Fig. S2). We argued that the minimal change in ClC-5Y762E* is preferable to the more conventional addition of a “positive tag” of several amino acids which might interfere with ClC-5 function. In heterologous expression, this negative tag changed neither ClC-5 nor ClC-5Y762E currents, nor did it interfere with the increase in current observed with the Y762E mutant (supplemental Fig. S5A and supplemental Method). It did not change the abundance (Fig. 3A) and localization of the protein (supplemental Fig. S2) in clcn5Y762E* mice, either. We could now distinguish between both ClC-5 variants in chimeric PTs of heterozygous clcn5+/Y762E* females (Fig. 3, B and C).FIGURE 3ClC-5Y672E does not affect apical endocytosis in kidney proximal tubules.A, left, immunoblot of renal membrane proteins with an antibody detecting the N terminus of ClC-5 shows indistinguishable expression levels of WT ClC-5 and the negatively tagged ClC-5Y672E* mutant.

Open circles, unspecific bands detected by the ClC-5CT antibody. B, in vivo 10-min uptake of Alexa Fluor 546-labeled β-lactoglobulin (red, right) reveals no difference in receptor-mediated endocytosis between WT and ClC-5Y672E* cells in a chimeric proximal tubule from a clcn5+/Y672E* female mouse. WT ClC-5 protein is detected by a C-terminal antibody (green, left), which does not recognize ClC-5Y672E*. C, fluid-phase endocytosis is similarly unaltered in ClC-5Y672E* cells, as shown by in vivo 10-min uptake of Alexa Fluor 546-labeled 10-kDa dextran (red, right). D, The fluorescence of endocytosed Alexa Fluor 488-labeled 10-kDa dextran was quantified in kidney homogenates 15 min after injection into the vena cava and subsequent flushing with PBS.

There was no discernible difference in the amount of endocytosed β-lactoglobulin or dextran between PT cells expressing WT ClC-5 or the ClC-5Y762E* mutant, again arguing against an in vivo role of the PY-motif in ClC-5-dependent endocytosis. To quantify our results, we measured Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence in kidney homogenates of mice previously injected with Alexa Fluor 488-dextran (Fig. 3D). We confirmed the significant decrease in fluid-phase endocytosis in clcn5−/− mice (12Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) but found no difference between clcn5Y762E and WT mice (Fig. 3D).Disruption of ClC-5 not only led to impaired endocytosis, but also to a changed trafficking, subcellular localization, and abundance of membrane proteins like the endocytic receptor megalin and the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2a (12Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitylation can play a role in initial endocytosis from the plasma membrane as well as in later steps of the endocytic pathway (38Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In contrast to clcn5− mice, megalin expression was unchanged in PTs of clcn5Y762E mice (Fig. 4). Likewise, the localization and abundance of NaPi-2a were normal (Fig. 5, A). NaPi-2a is regulated by serum phosphate and PTH levels. Depriving mice of phosphate increases the brush-border localization of NaPi-2a (39Murer H. Forster I. Hernando N. Lambert G. Traebert M. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: F676-F684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect partially mediated by a decrease in serum PTH. This effect was observed with WT, clcn5−, and clcn5Y762E mice (Fig. 5B). A sudden increase in PTH levels leads to a rapid endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation of the transporter (39Murer H. Forster I. Hernando N. Lambert G. Traebert M. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol.

By contrast, and as described previously (12Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J.

WT and ClC-5Y672E are recognized by a C-terminal antibody (green). In PT cells of a ClC-5 KO mouse, staining for megalin is drastically reduced (bottom panels).

https://openalex.org/W2021850499,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a prothrombotic state. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to modulate fibrinolysis, lung injury/fibrosis, and angiogenesis. However, its role in SCD is less understood, and the molecular mechanisms underlying increased PAI-1 are unknown. Herein, we show a novel link between PAI-1 and sickle erythropoiesis. Plasma PAI-1 levels were high in SCD patients at steady state and in two humanized sickle mouse models, with increased PAI-1 immunolabeling in sickle mouse lung, bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Placenta growth factor (PlGF), released at high levels by sickle erythroblasts, induced PAI-1 expression in primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and monocytes through activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), NADPH oxidase, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Analysis of the human PAI-1 promoter revealed this induction was mediated by hypoxia-response element (HRE)-1, HRE-2, and distal activator protein (AP-1) sites. We also identify the involvement of c-Jun, c-Jun/c-Fos, and JunD, but not JunB, in binding with AP-1 sites of the PAI-1 promoter upon PlGF induction. Consistent with these findings, levels of PAI-1 were low in PlGF knock-out mice and sickle-PlGF knock-out mice; overexpression of PlGF in normal mice increased circulating PAI-1. In conclusion, we identify a novel mechanism of PAI-1 elevation in SCD."
https://openalex.org/W1986548727,"SSBP proteins bind and stabilize transcriptional cofactor LIM domain-binding protein1 (LDB1) from proteosomal degradation to promote tissue-specific transcription through an evolutionarily conserved pathway. The human SSBP2 gene was isolated as a candidate tumor suppressor from a critical region of loss in chromosome 5q14.1. By gene targeting, we show increased predisposition to B-cell lymphomas and carcinomas in Ssbp2−/− mice. Remarkably, loss of Ssbp2 causes increased LDB1 turnover in the thymus, a pathway exploited in Trp53−/−Ssbp2−/− mice to develop highly aggressive, immature thymic lymphomas. Using T-cell differentiation as a model, we report a stage-specific upregulation of Ssbp2 expression, which in turn regulates LDB1 turnover under physiological conditions. Furthermore, transcript levels of pTα, a target of LDB1-containing complex, and a critical regulator T-cell differentiation are reduced in Ssbp2−/− immature thymocytes. Our findings suggest that disruption of the SSBP2-regulated pathways may be an infrequent but critical step in malignant transformation of multiple tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2062476053,"Mutations of the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that impair its apical localization and function cause cystic fibrosis. A previous report has shown that filamin A (FLNa), an actin-cross-linking and -scaffolding protein, interacts directly with the cytoplasmic N terminus of CFTR and that this interaction is necessary for stability and confinement of the channel to apical membranes. Here, we report that the CFTR N terminus has sequence similarity to known FLNa-binding partner-binding sites. FLNa has 24 Ig (IgFLNa) repeats, and a CFTR peptide pulled down repeats 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, and 23, which share sequence similarity yet differ from the other FLNa Ig domains. Using known structures of IgFLNa.partner complexes as templates, we generated in silico models of IgFLNa.CFTR peptide complexes. Point and deletion mutants of IgFLNa and CFTR informed by the models, including disease-causing mutations L15P and W19C, disrupted the binding interaction. The model predicted that a P5L CFTR mutation should not affect binding, but a synthetic P5L mutant peptide had reduced solubility, suggesting a different disease-causing mechanism. Taken together with the fact that FLNa dimers are elongated ( approximately 160 nm) strands, whereas CFTR is compact (6 approximately 8 nm), we propose that a single FLNa molecule can scaffold multiple CFTR partners. Unlike previously defined dimeric FLNa.partner complexes, the FLNa-monomeric CFTR interaction is relatively weak, presumptively facilitating dynamic clustering of CFTR at cell membranes. Finally, we show that deletion of all CFTR interacting domains from FLNa suppresses the surface expression of CFTR on baby hamster kidney cells."

The genes from Aspergillus terreus NIH2624, Botryotinia fuckeliana B05.10 and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum 1980 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting His(8)-tagged proteins were purified and investigated biochemically. Their substrate specificity was found to be different from that of any other prenyltransferase investigated previously. Using 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene (2,7-DHN) and dimethylallyl diphosphate as substrates, they catalyzed a regiospecific Friedel-Crafts alkylation of 2,7-DHN at position 3. Using the enzyme of A. terreus, the K(m) values for 2,7-DHN and dimethylallyl diphosphate were determined as 324 +/- 25 microM and 325 +/- 35 microM, respectively, and k(cat) as 0.026 +/- 0.001 s(-1). A significantly lower level of prenylation activity was found using dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid as aromatic substrate, and only traces of products were detected with aspulvinone E, flaviolin, or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. No product was formed with l-tryptophan, l-tyrosine, or 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The genes for these fungal prenyltransferases are not located within recognizable secondary metabolic gene clusters.

Cytochrome aa3-600 is of interest because it is a very close homologue of the cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli, except that it uses menaquinol instead of ubiquinol as a substrate. One question of interest is how the proteins differ in response to the differences in structure and electrochemical properties between ubiquinol and menaquinol.

In the current work it is demonstrated that the aa3-600 menaquinol oxidase from B. subtilis, isolated with the detergent dodecylmaltoside, contains 1 eq of bound menaquinone-7. Partial reduction of the enzyme results in formation of a SQ, analogous to the formation of the SQ formed at the QH-site in cyt bo3. In the B. subtilis aa3-600 menaquinol oxidase, the four residues at the putative QH-site are Arg-70, D74, His-94, and Glu-97. The SQ stabilized by the B. subtilis aa3-600 was examined using continuous-wave and pulsed EPR methods. The results show a distinctly different pattern of hydrogen bonding between the protein and SQ species in the menaquinol oxidase than that observed with the E. coli cyt bo3 ubiquinol oxidase. The qoxABCD operon, encoding the B. subtilis aa3-600 menaquinol oxidase, was cloned and expressed from plasmid pLala (Cmr) under the control of the glp promoter. Plasmid pLala replicates both in E. coli and B. subtilis. E. coli strains transformed with pLala vector were maintained on LB plates with 12 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A His6 tag was introduced at the C terminus of qoxB to faciliate protein purification by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The isolated recombinant plasmid pLala was transformed into B. subtilis strain LUW143, lacking both the aa3-600 menaquinol oxidase and caa3-type cytochrome c oxidase (ΔqoxABCD::kan ΔctaCD::ble) (31Winstedt L. von Wachenfeldt C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6557-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were inoculated with B. subtilis cells grown on LB plates containing appropriate antibiotics. Cells were grown in LB medium treated with 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 7.5 μg/ml neomycin, and 1.8 μg/ml zeomycin at 37 °C. Enzyme expression was induced by the addition of 20 mm glycerol. To isolate cell membranes, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm K2HPO4 or 50 mm Tris plus 10 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.5 and disrupted at high pressure (100 p.s.i.) by using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp., Worcester, MA). Cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation at 8000 × g. The supernatant was then subjected to centrifugation at 180,000 × g for at least 4 h to collect membranes. The isolated membranes were dispersed in 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, and homogenized with 1% dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace) by stirring at 4 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 1 h to remove insoluble fragments and then loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column for purification. The column was initially equilibrated with 50 mm K2HPO4, 40 mm NaCl, 0.05% dodecylmaltoside, pH 7.5, for 3–5 column volumes. At least two incremental stepwise washes were performed with buffer containing up to 15 mm imidazole. Cytochrome aa3-600 was eluted with buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The protein was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm K2HPO4, 0.05% dodecylmaltoside, pH 7.5, and concentrated to ∼200 μm. For the preparation of 15N-labeled protein sample, cells were grown in Spizizen minimal medium, where the nitrogen source was replaced with isotopically labeled 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope, Andover, MA). Cyt aa3-600 oxidase had a turnover of 61 electrons s−1 at 25 °C with 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMN) in 50 mm Tris, 0.05%, pH 7.0. The respiratory activity was started by reducing 10 μm DMN in the presence of 200 μm NADH and excess amounts of purified diaphorase and by adding 0.05 μm of aa3-600 oxidase. The steady-state activity was monitored by oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. The autooxidation of DMN at concentrations above 10 μm prevented a study of oxidase activity dependence on substrate concentration. Among the various quinol-type electron donors, DMN was previously shown to have the highest enzyme activity (11Lemma E. Schägger H. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Quinone was extracted from the purified enzyme preparation with 3 ml of solvent containing methanol/petroleum ether (6:4, v/v) and repeated three times. The organic phase was combined and treated further after a procedure previously described (18Sato-Watanabe M. Mogi T. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Miyoshi H. Iwamura H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28908-28912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quinone was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC using a Varian Microsorb-MV 100–5 C18 column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) and a Waters HPLC system. Isoprenoid quinone structure was characterized by mass spectroscopy (Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL). To prepare the samples for EPR analysis, the purified protein (100–200 μm) was reduced anaerobically in the presence of a 3–5-fold excess of DMN and a 200-fold excess of NADH and rapidly frozen in the EPR tube. The continuous-wave EPR measurements were performed on an X-band Varian EPR-E122 spectrometer and a Q-band Bruker ELEXSYS 580 equipped with a separate Q-band microwave bridge and cavity operating at a 100 kHz modulation frequency. The pulsed EPR experiments were carried out using an X-band Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer equipped with Oxford CF 935 cryostats. Several types of experiments with different pulse sequences were employed with appropriate phase-cycling schemes to eliminate unwanted features from the experimental echo envelopes. Among these experiments were one- and two-dimensional three-pulse and four-pulse sequences, which are described in detail elsewhere (3Lin M.T. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 15768-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Spectral processing of three- and four-pulse ESEEM patterns was performed using Bruker WIN-EPR software, including subtraction of the relaxation decay (fitting by 3–6 degree polynomials), apodization (Hamming window), zero filling, and fast Fourier transformation. Pulsed ENDOR spectra of the radicals were obtained using Davies and Mims sequences with different pulse lengths. The specifics of these experiments are described in detail elsewhere (4Yap L.L.

The preparation of his-tagged cytochrome aa3-600 was assayed for the presence of quinone. It was found that 1.25 eq of menaquinone-7 (Fig. 1) co-purifies with the enzyme, which is extracted from the membrane and purified using the detergent dodecylmaltoside. Fig. 2 shows X- and Q-band EPR spectra of the SQ in the wild type cyt aa3-600. The X-band spectrum displays a single pattern with a g value of 2.0047 ± 0.0001 and resolved hyperfine structure consisting of the four components with approximate relative intensities 1:3:3:1 and a splitting of ∼0.45–0.49 mT (or 12–13 MHz). The hyperfine structure resolution is better in the sample prepared in 2H2O. On the other hand, the uniform 15N labeling of the protein does not significantly influence the EPR line-shape of the SQ. This EPR feature is tentatively assigned to three equivalent nonexchangeable protons interacting with the unpaired electron. The Q-band spectrum, measured with about 3.5-times higher microwave frequency than the X-band, resolves the g-tensor anisotropy with components gxx = 2.00642 ± 0.00002, gyy = 2.00540 ± 0.00002, gzz = 2.00228 ± 0.00004. Additional hyperfine structure (also better resolved in the sample prepared in 2H2O) can be seen in the area around gyy; however, its complete resolution would require experiments at microwave frequencies ∼95 GHz or higher. The components of the g-tensor, determined from the Q-band spectra of cyt aa3-600 SQ prepared in H2O and 2H2O, are within the range previously reported for various SQs in model systems and in proteins (30Grimaldi S.

A Q-band spectrum with a similar shape was previously reported for the semiquinone intermediate stabilized in the membrane-bound subunit NarI of nitrate reductase (NarGHI) from E. coli (35Grimaldi S. Lanciano P. Bertrand P. Blasco F. Guigliarelli B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Powder-type ESEEM spectra, obtained with frozen protein solutions, do not usually show all of the 14N nuclei that are magnetically coupled with the SQ. This is due to the influence of the nuclear quadrupole interaction (3Lin M.T. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 15768-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol.

To observe all of the nitrogens that magnetically interact with the unpaired electron spin of the SQ, it is necessary to use 15N-labeled protein. The 15N nucleus is a spin ½ system and does not possess the nuclear quadrupole moment that affects the 14N ESEEM spectra. Therefore, we performed ESEEM experiments both with the wild type cyt aa3-600-containing natural abundance 14N (99.16%) and with uniformly 15N-labeled protein. Fig. 3 shows a representative 15N HYSCORE spectrum from a uniformly 15N-labeled sample, measured at the maximum of the SQ EPR line and displayed in contour (A) and three-dimensional-stacked (B) presentations. The 15N line-shape is centered around the sharp peak at a diagonal point (15νN,15νN) with a 15N Zeeman frequency 15νN ∼1.5 MHz. This peak is accompanied by extended shoulders with two weakly resolved maxima at (1.94, 1.08) MHz (1) and (1.73, 1.33) MHz (2) corresponding to couplings of 0.96 MHz and 0.4 MHz, respectively. The total length of the shoulders is ∼1.5 MHz along the antidiagonal, symmetrically around (15νN,15νN). This significantly exceeds typical values of the anisotropy for protein nitrogens interacting with a SQ (3Lin M.T. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 15768-15769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Dikanov S.A. Holland J.T. Endeward B. Kolling D.R. Samoilova R.I. Prisner T.F. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25831-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that more than one nitrogen interacts with the SQ, accompanied by the transfer of unpaired spin density onto their nuclei. Major features of the 14N HYSCORE spectrum (Fig. 4, A and B) are the cross-peaks (1) correlating the frequencies at 3.5 and 4.5 MHz (±0.03 MHz). In addition, the spectrum resolves several other off-diagonal cross-features (2–4) of lower intensity, symmetrically located relative to the diagonal. The maxima of these cross-peaks are located at (3.0, 2.3) MHz (2), (3.0, 2.0) MHz (3), and (3.5, 2.0) MHz (4). Only the cross-peaks at (3.0, 2.3) MHz (2) possess a shape with well pronounced maxima. Cross-peaks 3 and 4 essentially have flat tops, indicating that they could be part of extended cross-features correlating transitions with significant orientation dependence. For this reason, the one-dimensional three-pulse ESEEM spectra show only two peaks at frequencies 3.5 and 4.4 MHz from transitions possessing a low orientation dependence in the HYSCORE spectra and do not resolve any other features (supplemental Fig. S1). The 3.5-, 3.0-, and 2.0-MHz frequencies are each made up of two different cross-peaks and cannot be assigned by assuming that all features are produced by the same nitrogen nucleus. A comparison of the frequencies of cross-peaks 1–4 shows that only 1 and 3 have a common frequency 3.5 MHz and, thus, could belong to the same nucleus. Cross-peaks 2 and 4 involve frequencies different from those of 1 and 3 and could be part of the extended cross-features correlating other transitions from either the same nucleus or from one or more different 14N nuclei. In summary, the 15N and 14N HYSCORE spectra indicate that the SQ in cyt aa3-600 interacts with at least two nitrogens from the protein environment. Besides the nitrogens, the HYSCORE spectra contain information about non-exchangeable and exchangeable protons interacting with the electron spin of the SQ. Fig. 5 shows the 1H HYSCORE spectra of the SQ in the cyt aa3-600 prepared in 1H2O (A and B) and 2H2O (C) buffer. Similar spectra for the SQ in the Qi-site of the cytochrome bc1 complex (37Dikanov S.A. Samoilova R.I. Kolling D.R. Holland J.T. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15814-15823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and QH-site of cytochrome bo3 (6Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16879-16887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have been discussed previously. In addition to a diagonal peak with extended shoulders at the proton Zeeman frequency (νH∼14.75 MHz), the spectrum contains several pairs of resolved cross-features located symmetrically relative to the diagonal. They are designated 1, 2, 3, and 4. The cross-peaks labeled 1 demonstrate the largest hyperfine splitting, of the order ∼10 MHz. Cross-ridges 2 possess the most extended anisotropic contour, with the largest deviation from the diagonal indicating a significant anisotropic hyperfine component. Cross-peaks 3 and 4 are located in a similar area of the plot, close to each other and partially overlapping, as shown in Fig. 5B. Contours 1 and 3 are approximately normal to the diagonal, suggesting a smaller anisotropy. The contours of cross-peaks 4, located above those of cross-peaks 3, indicate an anisotropic hyperfine interaction intermediate between the couplings producing cross-peaks 3 and 2. Cross-peaks 2 and 4 (Fig. 5C) completely disappear in the HYSCORE spectra obtained under the same conditions using the sample with 2H2O, showing that they are produced by exchangeable protons. However, cross-peaks 1 and 3 as well as the diagonal peak, with its shoulders, still appear in the spectra obtained in 2H2O. The 1H/2H exchange does affect the intensity of cross-peaks 3, which indicates that these peaks result from the simultaneous contribution of exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons. Additional support for this conclusion was obtained from pulsed ENDOR spectra (see below). Quantitative analysis of the cross-peak contour line-shapes and simulations of the spectra, described in detail in Yap et al. (6Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2100387062,"Living organisms have evolved intricate systems to harvest trace elements from the environment, to control their intracellular levels, and to ensure adequate delivery to the various organs and cellular compartments. Copper is one of these trace elements. It is at the same time essential for life but also highly toxic, not least because it facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species. In mammals, copper uptake in the intestine and copper delivery into other organs are mediated by the copper importer Ctr1. Drosophila has three Ctr1 homologs: Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C. Earlier work has shown that Ctr1A is an essential gene that is ubiquitously expressed throughout development, whereas Ctr1B is responsible for efficient copper uptake in the intestine. Here, we characterize the function of Ctr1C and show that it functions as a copper importer in the male germline, specifically in maturing spermatocytes and mature sperm. We further demonstrate that loss of Ctr1C in a Ctr1B mutant background results in progressive loss of male fertility that can be rescued by copper supplementation to the food. These findings hint at a link between copper and male fertility, which might also explain the high Ctr1 expression in mature mammalian spermatozoa. In both mammals and Drosophila, the X chromosome is known to be inactivated in the male germline. In accordance with such a scenario, we provide evidence that in Drosophila, the autosomal Ctr1C gene originated as a retrogene copy of the X-linked Ctr1A, thus maintaining copper delivery during male spermatogenesis."

This disorder is characterized by high sweat chloride concentration, pulmonary disease with high production of dehydrated viscous secretions, and pancreatic insufficiency (1Gadsby D.C. Vergani P.

CF affects all exocrine epithelia, with morbidity and mortality primarily caused by bacterial infection and inflammation in the lung. CF affects ∼30,000 individuals in North America, of whom about 70% carry one copy of the mutation ΔF508, the most common of >1,000 CF-associated mutations. ΔF508 is a folding mutation that leads to rapid degradation at the endoplasmic reticulum. The small fraction of ΔF508-CFTR that is not degraded is characterized by inefficient trafficking to the apical plasma membrane and reduced residency in the plasma membrane (2Sharma M. Pampinella F.

This justifies therapeutic approaches to promote delivery of ΔF508-CFTR and other functionally impaired CFTR mutants to the plasma membrane. A detailed understanding of factors that stabilize and regulate CFTR at the plasma membrane is important for the development of new therapies to correct CF-causing defects in vivo. CFTR is regulated by intracellular cAMP levels and phosphorylated at multiple sites by cAMP-activated protein kinase, which modulates CFTR trafficking (6Chang S.Y. Di A. Naren A.P. Palfrey H.C.

Sci. 2006; 31: 411-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Filamins tether such proteins to the membrane-proximal actin cytoskeleton and regulate their surface localization and dynamics. Filamins may also mediate direct signaling between these proteins and the cytoskeleton (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The filamins exhibit common structural and functional properties (for review, see Ref. 19Popowicz G.M. Schleicher M. Noegel A.A. Holak T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 411-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Filamins contain N-terminal globular actin-binding domains consisting of two calponin homology domains. These are followed by two extended rod domains connected by a hinge. The rod domains, respectively, consist of 15 and 8 immunoglobulin-like repeats, termed Ig1–Ig23. At the C terminus, a second hinge connects the second rod domain to a final repeat, Ig24, which is the dimerization element of the protein (21Pudas R. Kiema T.R. Butler P.J. Stewart M. Ylänne J. Structure. 2005; 13: 111-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Those Ig repeats that have been structurally characterized have 7-stranded β-sandwich folds (21Pudas R. Kiema T.R. Butler P.J. Stewart M. Ylänne J.

Selected Ig-like repeats, primarily the odd-numbered repeats in the second rod domain, bind a diverse array of linear motifs from the cytoplasmic portions of the integral membrane protein-binding partners of filamins (23Kiema T.

Interestingly, some binding partners such as integrin β7 can bind to more than one of the Ig-like repeats in vitro (23Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C.L. Baldassarre M. Wevener K.L. Campbell I.D.

Chen Y. Gentzsch M. Kreda S.M. Sallee J.L. Scarlett C.O. Borchers C.H. Jacobson K. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Disruption of the CFTR-filamin interaction results in greatly reduced CFTR surface levels due to rapid endocytosis. Unlike wild-type CFTR, the internalized S13F CFTR is targeted preferentially to lysosomes rather than being recycled to the plasma membrane (15Thelin W.R. Chen Y. Gentzsch M. Kreda S.M. Sallee J.L. Scarlett C.O. Borchers C.H. Jacobson K. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The CFTR-filamin interaction is thus crucial to maintain sufficient plasma membrane levels of CFTR, but the details of the interaction are unclear. It is also unclear how filamins fit into the diverse network of proteins that associate with CFTR and regulate its trafficking and activity at the plasma membrane. In this article, we present the crystal structure of the CFTR N terminus with immunoglobulin-like repeat 21 of filamin A (FlnA-Ig21). We also characterize the binding of the CFTR N terminus to other repeats in the C-terminal rod domain of filamin A using NMR. Our results explain why the S13F mutation disrupts the interaction between CFTR and filamins. In addition, we show that FlnA-Ig21 acts in a dominant negative fashion in cultured epithelial cells, disrupting the CFTR-filamin interaction and resulting in loss of surface CFTR. Our studies present the molecular details of the CFTR-filamin interaction and emphasize that coupling of CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton through filamin is crucial for the regulation of surface CFTR levels in epithelial tissues. Anti-human CFTR (C terminus-specific) monoclonal antibody was obtained from R&D Systems. Anti-FlnA antibody was from Millipore.

Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) for expression as GST fusions. GST-Ig repeats were expressed in Rosetta2(DE3) cells (EMD Biosciences) and purified by glutathione-affinity column chromatography in buffers containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The GST tag was removed by overnight cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease followed by additional glutathione-Sepharose and gel filtration chromatography. 15N-Labeled FlnA-Ig repeats were expressed as GST fusions in minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/liter [15N]NH4Cl (Isotec), cleaved, and purified in the same manner as the unlabeled repeats. CFTR N-terminal peptides were synthesized in the Molecular Biotechnology Core, Lerner Research Institute (Cleveland Clinic). The peptides are acetylated at their N termini and amidated at their C termini and were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Crystallization was carried out using 1 mm FlnA-Ig21 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, mixed with 3 mm CFTR4–22 peptide (splekasvvsklffswtrp) in water. The complex crystallized at 20 °C in hanging drops against 60% Tacsimate, 0.1 m Bistris-propane, pH 7.0. Crystals were cryoprotected directly in mother liquor and frozen in liquid nitrogen before data collection. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 4.2.2., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Diffraction from these crystals was typically very anisotropic.

Open table in a new tab NMR spectra for 15N-labeled FlnA repeats 10, 17, 19, 21, and 23 were collected at 25 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz Avance ICE spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Two-dimensional 1H/15N HSQC spectra were acquired utilizing a spin-state selective gradient-enhanced HSQC pulse sequence (34Schleucher J. Schwendinger M. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O.

All NMR datasets were processed with in-house scripts using NMRPipe (35Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

NMR samples contained 25 μm15N-labeled protein in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% D2O. Backbone chemical shift assignments for FlnA-Ig21 were determined using 1H/13C/15N HNCA, HNCO, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. The assignments will be published separately. 5J. Liu, S. Ithychanda, and J.

Peptide binding titrations were initially pursued using CFTR4–22 or CFTR4–22/S13F. These peptides tended to aggregate or form gel-like phases, causing extensive line broadening and leading to poor spectra. Therefore, titrations were carried out using shorter peptides containing an F16E substitution to increase peptide solubility and reduce aggregation behavior. 15N-Ig repeats were titrated with CFTR7–20/F16E (EKASVVSKLEFSWT) and CFTR7–20/S13F/F16E (EKASVVFKLEFSWT) at ratios ranging from 1:0 up to 1:100 (FlnA:peptide). These spectra exhibited much less line broadening and clearly defined chemical shift perturbations. Normalized chemical shift perturbations (Δδ) (39Grzesiek S. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10256-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) were calculated and plotted with Octave (40Eaton J.W. Bateman D. Hauberg S. GNU Octave: A High-level Interactive Language for Numerical Computations. Network Theory Ltd., United Kingdom2007Google Scholar) according to the equation Δδ = [(Δ1HN)2 + (Δ15NH/5)2]1/2. Peptide binding constants (Kd) were determined by nonlinear regression fitting of chemical shift changes versus peptide concentration for selected resonances, using the equation Δδ/Δδmax = [L]/(Kd + [L]), where Δδmax is the maximum change in chemical shift at saturation and [L] is the CFTR peptide concentration (41Fielding L.

Open table in a new tab CFTR4–22 peptide was docked to FlnA-Ig repeats 17, 19, and 23 using ambiguous intermolecular distance restraints, derived from 1H/15N chemical shift perturbations (CSPs). Restraints were input into a combined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol in Xplor-NIH (43Clore G.M. Schwieters C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2902-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Docking calculations utilized molecule A from the crystal structure of FlnA-Ig17 with GPIbα peptide (PDB code 2BP3) (24Nakamura F. Pudas R. Heikkinen O. Permi P. Kilpeläinen I. Munday A.D. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Ylänne J. Blood. 2006; 107: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the NMR structure of FlnA-Ig19 (PDB code 2K7Q) (37Heikkinen O. Permi P. Koskela H. Ylänne J. Kilpelainen I. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the NMR structure of FlnA-Ig23 (PDB code 2K3T) (38Nakamura F. Heikkinen O. Pentikäinen O.T.

PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 1H/15N CSP maps were converted into ambiguous distance restraints. An additional distance restraint between the CFTRS13 hydroxyl oxygen and the appropriate FlnA-Ig repeat backbone amide was also introduced. For each FlnA-Ig repeat·CFTR peptide complex, 100 structures were generated; the solution with the lowest total energy and no ambiguous distance restraint violations greater than 0.5 Å was selected as the best structure. We built a homology model for FlnA-Ig repeat 10 using the I-TASSER server (44Zhang Y. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar), based on the FlnB-Ig10 NMR structure (PDB code 2DIA). The I-TASSER C-score for the FlnA-Ig10 homology model was 1.15, indicating a high likelihood that the model accurately predicts the FlnA-Ig10 structure. As expected, the FlnA-Ig10 homology model is similar in structure to FlnB-Ig10 and other FlnA-Ig repeats. A more complete description of the molecular modeling procedures is provided in the supplemental Methods. Calu-3 cells were grown in cell culture on 100-mm2 tissue culture plastic or on 0.4-μm pore Transwell-Clear polyester filter inserts (Corning Costar) with a growth area of 4.4 cm2 for biotinylation experiments. For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells/filter with a growth area of 1.0 cm2. Mimimum Eagle's culture medium was supplemented with 2.4 mg of l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified air. Culture medium was changed at 48-h intervals until the desired confluence was reached, as assessed by microscopic examination. We used BioPORTER protein delivery system to deliver FlnA repeats into Calu-3 cells, as described previously (45Liedtke C.M. Hubbard M. Wang X. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C487-C496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). BioPORTER reagent was dissolved in methanol, aliquoted in 10-μl portions, and dried under an N2 stream. Dried reagent was reconstituted in 50 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (HPSS) per filter insert containing an aliquot of protein in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The total volume of the peptide·BioPORTER complex per filter insert was taken to 500 μl for 24-mm filter inserts or 300 μl for 12-mm filter inserts, using HPSS. Apical surfaces of cells were incubated with the protein·BioPORTER complex or BioPORTER reagent alone for 2.5 h at 35 °C. The apical solution was replaced with HPSS and the incubation continued for 2 h at 35 °C. Polarized Calu-3 cell monolayers were grown on 24-mm-diameter Transwell permeable supports. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS; Pierce) (46Auerbach M. Liedtke C.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C294-C304Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were cooled to 4 °C, washed in PBS, pH 8.2, supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, and incubated twice with 1 mg sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. Nonreacted sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin was quenched by washing cells with PBS, pH 8.2, with 100 mm glycine, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. Cells were harvested in CFTR lysis buffer and biotinylated proteins isolated using streptavidin-agarose beads (GE Healthcare). Biotinylated CFTR was detected by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed to the C terminus of CFTR. Exposed bands were quantitated by densitometry. Calu-3 cell monolayers at 50% confluence were dual-labeled for proteins of interest as described previously (9Liedtke C.M. Yun C.H. Kyle N. Wang D. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 10% normal goat serum in PBS.

We have previously shown that the tyrosine kinase c-Src enhances IRF-3-dependent transcription in response to viral double-stranded RNA. In this study, we show that c-Src has distinct roles in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation of IRF-5 and IRF-3. Surprisingly, c-Src inhibition markedly enhanced IRF-5 activation after treatment with unmethylated CpG, while suppressing IRF-3 activation. Also, CpG-elicited interleukin-6 mRNA production was increased, whereas IP10 mRNA synthesis was reduced in cells deficient in c-Src. Interestingly, c-Src regulated TLR-stimulated induction of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a transcriptional repressor. Depletion of ATF3 by small interfering RNA markedly enhanced interleukin-6 production after CpG treatment, whereas IP10 production was reduced. These results demonstrate functional specificity for c-Src in TLR-stimulated responses and suggest that c-Src modulation and ATF3 activity may contribute to differential regulation of IRF-3- versus IRF-5-mediated gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2065909389,"Dynein interacts with microtubules through a dedicated binding domain that is dynamically controlled to achieve high or low affinity, depending on the state of nucleotide bound in a distant catalytic pocket. The active sites for microtubule binding and ATP hydrolysis communicate via conformational changes transduced through a approximately 10-nm length antiparallel coiled-coil stalk, which connects the binding domain to the roughly 300-kDa motor core. Recently, an x-ray structure of the murine cytoplasmic dynein microtubule binding domain (MTBD) in a weak affinity conformation was published, containing a covalently constrained beta(+) registry for the coiled-coil stalk segment (Carter, A. P., Garbarino, J. E., Wilson-Kubalek, E. M., Shipley, W. E., Cho, C., Milligan, R. A., Vale, R. D., and Gibbons, I. R. (2008) Science 322, 1691-1695). We here present an NMR analysis of the isolated MTBD from Dictyostelium discoideum that demonstrates the coiled-coil beta(+) registry corresponds to the low energy conformation for this functional region of dynein. Addition of sequence encoding roughly half of the coiled-coil stalk proximal to the binding tip results in a decreased affinity of the MTBD for microtubules. In contrast, addition of the complete coiled-coil sequence drives the MTBD to the conformationally unstable, high affinity binding state. These results suggest a thermodynamic coupling between conformational free energy differences in the alpha and beta(+) registries of the coiled-coil stalk that acts as a switch between high and low affinity conformations of the MTBD. A balancing of opposing conformations in the stalk and MTBD enables potentially modest long-range interactions arising from ATP binding in the motor core to induce a relaxation of the MTBD into the stable low affinity state."
https://openalex.org/W2092560218,"Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs or EFTs) express neuronal markers, which indicates they may originate from cells at least partly committed to neuronal lineage. However, recent publications suggest EFT originates in mesenchymal stem cells, and EWS/ETS fusion proteins characteristic of EFT activate neuronal marker expression to confer a neural phenotype on EFT. Here we show that the neuronal marker BRN3A/POU4F1 is expressed abundantly at the protein level in primary EFT but not in rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma, and EFT cells exhibit high activity of the BRN3A proximal autoregulatory region. EWS/FLI-1 siRNA reduces BRN3A expression and promoter activity and EWS/ETS proteins are bound to the BRN3A locus, suggesting a direct function for EWS/ETS proteins in control of BRN3A expression. Differentiation-associated and autoregulatory activities of BRN3A are respectively impaired and altered in EFT cells, and EWS/FLI-1 siRNA can restore some BRN3A function. A potentially novel function for BRN3A in EFT cells is identified. These results extend the hypothesis that EWS/ETS proteins induce expression of neuronal markers such as BRN3A in EFT by showing that the function of those same markers may be restricted or controlled in an EWS/ETS-dependent manner."
