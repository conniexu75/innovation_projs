The host innate immune Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 was shown previously in cells of myeloid origin to recognize the viral replicative, intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Thus, dsRNA may be critical for the outcome of the infection. Here we first compared the activation triggered by either influenza A virus or dsRNA in pulmonary epithelial cells. We established that TLR3 is constitutively expressed in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, and we describe its intracellular localization. Expression of TLR3 was positively regulated by the influenza A virus and by dsRNA but not by other inflammatory mediators, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide, the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We also demonstrated that TLR3 contributes directly to the immune response of respiratory epithelial cells to influenza A virus and dsRNA, and we propose a molecular mechanism by which these stimuli induce epithelial cell activation. This model involves mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling, and the TLR3-associated adaptor molecule TRIF but not MyD88-dependent activation of the transcription factors NF-κB or interferon regulatory factor/interferon-sensitive response-element pathways. Ultimately, this signal transduction elicits an epithelial response that includes the secretion of the cytokines IL-8, IL-6, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), and interferon-β and the up-regulation of the major adhesion molecule ICAM-1.

Influenza is a highly contagious, acute respiratory disease that affects all age groups and that can promote exacerbations of obstructive airways disorders, including asthma and cystic fibrosis. The etiological agent of the disease, the single-stranded RNA influenza viruses, are responsible for an average of 114,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths each year, in the United States alone (1Ludwig S. Planz O. Pleschka S. Wolff T. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 46-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Influenza viruses are classified into three types (A, B, and C) of which influenza A is the most important clinically (2Julkunen I. Melen K. Nyqvist M. Pirhonen J. Sareneva T. Matikainen S. Vaccine. 2000; 19: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The major problem in fighting influenza is the high genetic variability of the virus, resulting in the rapid emergence of variants that escape the acquired immunity induced by the available vaccines or the resistance of the pathogen to antiviral agents (1Ludwig S. Planz O. Pleschka S. Wolff T. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 46-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Kiso M. Mitamura K. Sakai-Tagawa Y. Shiraishi K. Kawakami C.

In that context, it would be valuable to unravel the mechanisms of virus-host cell interactions that are responsible for the “flu” syndrome. Indeed, several studies suggest that the inflammatory response to respiratory viral infections contributes to the pathogenesis of the airway symptoms. In that regard, it is of note that the viral replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; DN, dominant-negative; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; ISRE, interferon-sensitive response element; MyD, myeloid differentiation; NS, nonstimulated; TLR, Toll-like receptor; poly(I-C), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; TIR, Toll-IL-1 receptor; TRIF, TIR domain containing adaptor inducing interferon-β; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; IL, interleukin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IFN, interferon; PFU, plaque-forming units; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; RT, reverse transcription; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CRE, cAMP-response element; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. is critical for the outcome of the infection (reviewed in Refs. 4Majde J.A.

For instance, synthetic dsRNA and dsRNA isolated from influenza virus-infected lungs are each able to induce both the local and systemic cytotoxic effects typical of flu (6Kimura-Takeuchi M.

Virol. 1999; 57: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells are armed with various latent mechanisms that are able to sense viral components and initiate intracellular signal transduction to respond rapidly to virus infections. Previously, the interferon (IFN)-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase R was considered to be central in the interaction with dsRNA (5Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, cells from RNA-dependent protein kinase R-deficient mice still respond to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C)), a synthetic dsRNA analog, suggesting the existence of a more critical receptor involved in the sensing and signaling in response to this viral component. Alexopoulou et al. (9Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar) demonstrated that dsRNA recognition relies on the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, a member of the conserved family of host innate immune receptors, essential for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The stimulation of TLR3 by dsRNA transduces signals to activate the transcription factors NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)/interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent and/or independent signaling pathways. The last of these involves a distinct adaptor molecule, namely the Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon (IFN)-β (TRIF), also called the TIR domain containing adaptor molecule (TICAM)-1 (10Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 11Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). This molecule elicits an anti-viral response, especially through the production of type I IFN. In humans, TLR3 mRNA is detected in the lung, placenta, pancreas, liver, heart, and brain. It is expressed in dendritic cells (12Muzio M. Bosisio D. Polentarutti N. D'Amico G. Stoppacciaro A. Mancinelli R. van't Veer C. Penton-Rol G. Ruco L.P. Allavena P. Mantovani A. J.

Immun. 2000; 68: 7010-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) but does not seem to be present in monocytes, lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or natural killer cells (14Matsumoto M. Funami K. Oshiumi H. Seya T. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 48: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, although TLR3 expression per se was not reported, a study by Gern et al. (15Gern J.E. French D.A. Grindle K.A. Brockman-Schneider R.A. Konno S. Busse W.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed recently that viral dsRNA activates bronchial epithelial cells. Lung epithelial cells are the primary target and the principal host for influenza viruses, causing cytopathic effects to the respiratory tract as well as shedding of infective viral particles. These epithelial cells also play a key role in the initiation of innate and subsequently adaptive immune responses to the virus (16Reynolds H.Y. Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2002; 8: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Message S.D. Johnston S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, very little information is available concerning the expression and localization of TLR3 in pulmonary epithelial cells. Moreover, the role of epithelial TLR3, its regulatory mechanisms, and the signaling pathways underlying the response to influenza A virus have not been investigated previously. We first studied the activation of bronchial epithelial cells induced by either purified dsRNA or following influenza A virus infection. Next, we demonstrated that TLR3 is constitutively expressed in distinct human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, and we described its intracellular localization. Finally, we determined that TLR3 and its signaling-associated molecule TRIF play a key role in the immune response of respiratory epithelial cells to both dsRNA and influenza A virus.

Cell and Culture Conditions—The human promonocytic cell line U-937, the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549, and the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection (Manassas, VA). The human tracheal epithelial cell lines CFT-2 and NT-1 were a kind gift from Dr. A. Paul (INSERM U402, Paris, France). CFT-2 was derived from primary tracheal epithelia homozygous for the common cystic fibrosis mutation ΔF508, and NT-1 was derived from normal primary tracheal epithelial cells (18Mergey M. Lemnaouar M. Veissiere D. Perricaudet M. Gruenert D.C. Picard J. Capeau J. Brahimi-Horn M.C. Paul A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L855-L864PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured as described previously (19Guillot L. Medjane S. Le-Barillec K. Balloy V. Danel C. Chignard M. Si-Tahar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Virus Preparation and Inactivation—Influenza A/Scotland/20/74(H3N2) virus was grown on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in the presence of 2 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. The supernatant was harvested on day 3 and clarified by centrifugation at 680 × g for 15 min. Viral stocks were stored in aliquots at –80°C. Virus titers were determined by a standard plaque assay using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. A noninfected cell culture was used for preparation of the control inoculum. UV light-inactivated virus was prepared by exposing stock virus solution (0.5 ml/6-cm Petri dish) to a 15-watt UV light at a distance of 20 cm for 15 min. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). RT was performed using 0.5 μg of total RNA extracted as described previously (19Guillot L. Medjane S. Le-Barillec K. Balloy V. Danel C. Chignard M. Si-Tahar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). PCR was performed using specific primers (Proligo, Evry, France) for human TLR3 (sense, 5′-AAA TTG GGC AAG AAC TCA CAG G-3′; and antisense, 5′-GTG TTT CCA GAG CCG TGC TAA-3′). As an internal control, we used primers for human β-actin (sense, 5′-AAG GAG AAG CTG TGC TAC GTC GC-3′; and antisense, 5′-AGA CAG CAC TGT GTT GGC GTA CA-3′). Amplifications were performed in a Peltier thermal cycler apparatus (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) using the Qbiotaq polymerase (Qbiogene, Illkirch, France). To detect TLR3, the thermocycling protocol was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 36 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 56 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. To detect β-actin, only 30 cycles were used, and the annealing temperature was 62 °C. Amplification products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Band intensities on gels were recorded after amplification with an Ultra-Lum system (Ultra-Lum, Claremont, CA). Samples for each point were serially diluted to verify that PCR was performed in the linear phase of the amplification reaction (data not shown). Immunoblotting—Epithelial cell extracts were prepared and solubilized as described previously (19Guillot L. Medjane S. Le-Barillec K. Balloy V. Danel C. Chignard M. Si-Tahar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Aliquots (15 μg of protein) were run on SDS-10% PAGE, and the proteins were then electrotransfered to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BA-S 85, Schleicher and Schuell) and probed with specific antibodies, as specified in the figure legends. Bound antibodies were detected using ECL+ immunoblotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Molecular masses were estimated from calibration standards included in each gel. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Epithelial and monocytic cells were dispensed (1 × 106 cells/ml) into conical bottomed 96-well plastic plates (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) and were centrifuged at 100 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.5% bovine serum albumin supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+, and a saturating concentration of anti-TLR3 antibodies (5 μg/ml), anti-ICAM-1 antibody (1 μg/ml), or nonimmune IgG as controls was then added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the corresponding secondary FITC-conjugated antibody (5 μg/ml). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized by incubation for 90 min on ice with a solution of PBS, 3.2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Tween 20; they were then incubated with an anti-TLR3 antibody (5 μg/ml) and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (5 μg/ml). FACScan flow cytometer (Immunocytometry Systems) was used for cytometric analysis. NF-κB Immunostaining—BEAS-2B epithelial cells were cultured on 22-mm glass cell culture coverslips (CML France, Nemours, France). Cells were washed three times with PBS and then fixed for 15 min in PBS, 3.2% paraformaldehyde. After washing with gentle shaking, cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed, as before, prior to incubation with an anti-NF-κB-p65 antibody (0.4 μg/ml) and a specific secondary antibody (5 μg/ml). In control experiments, cells were incubated with nonimmune IgG as control isotypes. Finally, the cells were washed extensively with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted in fluorescence mounting medium. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a 63×/1.4 oil objective lens on a confocal microscope (model LSM 510; Carl Zeiss France, Le Pecq, France), using laser excitation at 488 nm. Epithelial Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Studies—BEAS-2B cells were seeded at 5 × 104 on 24-well plates (Costar, New York) 96 h before transfection using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample contained 200 ng of an NF-κB-luciferase-(kindly provided by Dr. A. Israel, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France), an ISRE-luciferase-, or a CRE-luciferase-reporter plasmid (Clontech) and 500 ng of vector expressing a dominant-negative form of either MyD88 (DN-Myd88; a kind gift from Dr. M. Muzio, Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy) or TRIF (DN-TRIF). The TLR3 construct from which the TIR domain is deleted (pZERO-hTLR3) and encoding a nonfunctional TLR3 molecule were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). The empty plasmids, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pCMV (Clontech), were used as controls as appropriate. After 24 h, cells were left untreated or stimulated for 6 or 24 h at 37 °C with influenza A virus or 1 μg/ml poly(I-C). Luciferase activity was measured in the cell lysates as described previously (19Guillot L. Medjane S. Le-Barillec K. Balloy V. Danel C. Chignard M. Si-Tahar M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), using an EGNG Berthold luminometer. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units. Cytokine Measurements—Human IL-8, IL-6, RANTES, and IFN-β concentrations in cell culture supernatants were determined using Duo-Set ELISA kits obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Statistical Analysis—Each point corresponds to the mean ± S.D. of the indicated number of experiments. The statistical significance of differences between groups was tested using the unpaired Student's t test with a threshold of p < 0.05. Comparison of the Activation of Bronchial Respiratory Cells by dsRNA and Influenza A Virus—dsRNA is known to accumulate within infected cells, and it has the required physical and biological properties needed to induce antiviral responses and pathological inflammatory processes (4Majde J.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears important to examine whether influenza A virus-induced activation of pulmonary epithelial cells shares any characteristics with that stimulated by a synthetic dsRNA such as poly(I-C). Fig. 1 reports a comparison of the effects from two inducers in the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Poly(I-C) triggered a strong secretion of IL-8, in a concentration-(Fig. 1A) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The secretion started within 3 h and IL-8 accumulated in the culture medium up to 24 h (Fig. 1B). We also observed a time-dependent accumulation of IL-6 (Fig. 1C). RANTES was also induced by poly(I-C) but ∼3 h after the start of production of the other cytokines. This suggests an autocrine/paracrine activation by another mediator; for example IFN-β might feed back on RANTES production (Fig. 1D). In that regard, IFN-β production peaked 6 h post-stimulation but was not detected at 24 h, suggesting a reprocessing of this cytokine by BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 1E). To exclude any stimulatory effect associated with contamination of poly(I-C) by bacterial endotoxin, experiments were also performed using poly(I-C) supplemented with 20 μg/ml polymyxin B, a well characterized LPS inhibitor. Under these experimental conditions, IL-8 secretion by BEAS-2B cells was not modified (not shown). When BEAS-2B cells were infected with influenza A virus, IL-8 secretion was clearly detected 24 h later and was dose-dependent (Fig. 1, G and H). RANTES and IL-6 secretion were also dose-dependent up to a maximum at 5 × 104 PFU/multiplicity of infection of 0.25) (Fig. 1, I and K). Cytokine secretion was delayed by 20 h with respect to that by poly(I-C)-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. This delay may be consistent with the time required to generate dsRNA within the infected cell, during the replication of the virus (Fig. 1, H and J, and data not shown). Epithelial cells in the lung express ICAM-1, which is involved in the recruitment and the local accumulation of inflammatory cells through the binding to lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 (20Beck-Schimmer B. Schimmer R.C. Pasch T. News Physiol. Sci. 2004; 19: 129-132PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that pro-inflammatory mediators including LPS and TNF-α induce ICAM-1 expression on pulmonary epithelial cells (21Fakler C.R. Wu B. McMicken H.W. Geske R.S. Welty S.E. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We confirmed these findings by flow cytometric analysis, and we extended them to dsRNA and influenza A virus by demonstrating a potent up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression, which was as strong as that obtained with TNF-α (Fig. 1F and not illustrated). Previous studies have shown that production of inflammatory mediators in response to a viral infection can occur in the presence or absence of multiplication of the pathogen (22Geiss G.K. An M.C. Bumgarner R.E. Hammersmark E. Cunningham D. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We tested whether viral contact with the plasma membrane and/or viral penetration of the host cell was sufficient to trigger the inflammatory response. Bronchial epithelial cells were infected with UV-treated, and therefore nonreplicative, virus. Also, BEAS-2B cells were treated with an intact virus in the presence of 1 μg/ml amantadine, an influenza-specific inhibitor blocking the early release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm but not the endocytosis of the viral particle into the cell (1Ludwig S. Planz O. Pleschka S. Wolff T. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 46-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Neither UV-treated virus nor virus in the presence of amantadine induced IL-8 release (Fig. 1L). Thus, components generated during viral replication are required for the inflammatory response. Similarly, there was no RANTES or IL-6 secretion in the absence of viral replication (data not shown). Hence, the inflammatory response to influenza A virus infection is replication-dependent and is not mediated solely by the initial virus-host cell interaction or by any artifact possibly present in the infectious inoculum. Expression and Localization of TLR3 in Pulmonary Epithelial Cells—Because the foregoing results suggested that dsRNA is required for the immunostimulatory activity of influenza A virus, we examined the expression of TLR3, a recently described dsRNA sensor, in pulmonary epithelial cells (9Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). We first used RT-PCR to test for the presence of TLR3 mRNA in unstimulated human respiratory epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, TLR3 mRNA was detected in PMA-differentiated U-937 cells and in both human alveolar (A549) and tracheobronchial (BEAS-2B, NT-1, and CFT-2) epithelial cells lines. RT-PCR analysis of β-actin mRNA confirmed the quality of all RNA preparations. We then used two antibodies, N-15 and H-125, to test for TLR3 protein in human pulmonary epithelial cells. The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed by Western blotting with a recombinant TLR3-glycosylated peptide, consisting of amino acids 21–711 (not illustrated). Protein expression level of TLR3 was analyzed by flow cytometry in A549 and BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 2B). No TLR3 signal was detected at the cell surface of these respiratory cells (left panels), but abundant intracellular TLR3 was revealed using a mild fixation and permeabilization protocol (middle and right panels). Epithelial TLR3 Expression Is Up-regulated by Poly(I-C) and Influenza A Virus—Next we examined whether different stimuli regulate the epithelial TLR3 mRNA. BEAS-2B cells were exposed to an optimal concentration of poly(I-C) (1 μg/ml), LPS (1 μg/ml), TNF-α (50 ng/ml), IL-1β (20 ng/ml), or the potent protein kinase C activator PMA (15 nm) and to influenza A virus (5 × 104 PFU) for 24 h. Under these conditions, cell activation was fairly equipotent, as assessed by the measurement of IL-8 secretion induced by each stimulus (not shown). Expression of TLR3 mRNA was normalized to that of β-actin and is reported in Fig. 3B, histogram bars. This semi-quantitative densitometric measurement clearly shows that only influenza A virus infection and cell stimulation by the viral RNA mimetic component specifically up-regulated TLR3 mRNA; the other treatments had no significant effect (Fig. 3, A and B). IL-8 but Not RANTES Secretion Triggered by dsRNA or Influenza A Virus Shares a Common Signaling Pathway— Virus infection of susceptible cells activates multiple signaling pathways, including dynamic protein phosphorylations, that orchestrate the induction of genes contributing to the innate immune response. The kinases involved include p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and JNK. Little is known concerning the involvement of PI3K in virus-induced and/or TLR signaling. PI3K catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which allows the recruitment of signaling proteins, including the serine-threonine kinase Akt (23Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether dsRNA activates p38, JNK, ERK1/2, and Akt in bronchial epithelial cells. Treatment with poly(I-C) strongly up-regulated phosphorylation of these signaling components. The maximum level of phosphorylation was between 15 and 60 min and declined thereafter, except for p38 phosphorylation that increased until 360 min post-stimulation (Fig. 4A). To delineate specifically the role of these kinases in the production of epithelial cytokines, BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with the specific inhibitors PD98059 for ERK1/2, SB203580 for p38, and LY294002 for PI3K (Fig. 4B). None of these inhibitors caused cytotoxic effects on BEAS-2B cells at the concentrations used in these experiments. However, all inhibitors significantly reduced the dsRNA-induced production of IL-8 (Fig. 4B) and IL-6 (not illustrated). By contrast, only the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor reduced RANTES production. When pulmonary epithelial cells were infected by influenza A virus in the presence of 10 μm of the above inhibitors, IL-8 secretion was similar to that induced by synthetic dsRNA under the same experimental conditions: ≈45% inhibition in the presence of PD98059, and a secretion almost abolished in the presence of SB203580 or LY294002. By contrast, RANTES release triggered by either stimulus does not exhibit a similar inhibitory pattern. Remarkably, although the p38 inhibitor did not affect dsRNA-induced RANTES secretion, it strongly inhibited RANTES secretion following influenza A virus infection (Fig. 4C). The TLR3/TRIF Pathway Is Essential for dsRNA and Influenza A Virus-induced NF-κB and IRF/ISRE Activation in Pulmonary Epithelial Cells—Activation of transcription factors is pivotal to many signal transduction pathways. For instance, NF-κB can be activated in response to many different stress conditions, including infection, inflammation, and tissue repair.

https://openalex.org/W2077218648,"Fifty years ago, the age-old scourge of infectious disease was receding in the developed world in response to improved public health measures, while the advent of antibiotics, better vaccines, insecticides and improved surveillance held the promise of eradicating residual problems. By the late twentieth century, however, an increase in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases was evident in many parts of the world. This upturn looms as the fourth major transition in human-microbe relationships since the advent of agriculture around 10,000 years ago. About 30 new diseases have been identified, including Legionnaires' disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis C, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)/variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Nipah virus, several viral hemorrhagic fevers and, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. The emergence of these diseases, and resurgence of old ones like tuberculosis and cholera, reflects various changes in human ecology: rural-to-urban migration resulting in high-density peri-urban slums; increasing long-distance mobility and trade; the social disruption of war and conflict; changes in personal behavior; and, increasingly, human-induced global changes, including widespread forest clearance and climate change. Political ignorance, denial and obduracy (as with HIV/AIDS) further compound the risks. The use and misuse of medical technology also pose risks, such as drug-resistant microbes and contaminated equipment or biological medicines. A better understanding of the evolving social dynamics of emerging infectious diseases ought to help us to anticipate and hopefully ameliorate current and future risks."

https://openalex.org/W2112679085,"Expression of multiple oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressors is required to transform primary mammalian cells into cancer cells1,2,3. Activated Ha-RasV12 (Ras) is usually associated with cancer, but it also produces paradoxical premature senescence4 in primary cells by inducing reactive oxygen species5 followed by accumulation of tumour suppressors p53 and p16INK4a (ref. 4). Here we identify, using a direct genetic screen, Seladin-1 (also known as Dhcr24) as a key mediator of Ras-induced senescence. Following oncogenic and oxidative stress, Seladin-1 binds p53 amino terminus and displaces E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 from p53, thus resulting in p53 accumulation. Additionally, Seladin-1 associates with Mdm2 independently of p53, potentially affecting other Mdm2 targets. Ablation of Seladin-1 causes the bypass of Ras-induced senescence in rodent and human fibroblasts, and allows Ras to transform these cells. Wild-type Seladin-1, but not mutants that disrupt its association with either p53 or Mdm2, suppresses the transformed phenotype. The same mutants are also inactive in directing p53-dependent oxidative stress response. These results show an unanticipated role for Seladin-1, previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease6 and cholesterol metabolism7, in integrating cellular response to oncogenic and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2129224672,"Transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi is mediated by the sequential action of two coat complexes: COPII concentrates cargo for secretion at ER export sites, then COPI is subsequently recruited to nascent carriers and retrieves recycling proteins back to the ER. These carriers then move towards the Golgi along microtubules, driven by the dynein/dynactin complexes. Here we show that the Sec23p component of the COPII complex directly interacts with the dynactin complex through the carboxy-terminal cargo-binding domain of p150(Glued). Functional assays, including measurements of the rate of recycling of COPII on the ER membrane and quantitative analyses of secretion, indicate that this interaction underlies functional coupling of ER export to microtubules. Together, our data suggest a mechanism by which membranes of the early secretory pathway can be linked to motors and microtubules for subsequent organization and movement to the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2058825648,"The etiology of primary open angle glaucoma, a leading cause of age-related blindness, remains poorly defined, although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) contributes to the disease progression. To better understand the mechanisms causing elevated IOP from aqueous humor circulation, we pursued proteomic analyses of trabecular meshwork (TM) from glaucoma and age-matched control donors. These analyses demonstrated that Cochlin, a protein associated with deafness disorder DFNA9, is present in glaucomatous but absent in normal TM. Cochlin was also detected in TM from the glaucomatous DBA/2J mouse preceding elevated IOP but found to be absent in three other mouse lines that do not develop elevated IOP. Histochemical analyses revealed co-deposits of Cochlin and mucopolysaccharide in human TM around Schlemm's canal, similar to that observed in the cochlea in DFNA9 deafness. Purified Cochlin was found to aggregate after sheer stress and to induce the aggregation of TM cells in vitro. Age-dependent in vivo increases in Cochlin were observed in glaucomatous TM, concomitant with a decrease in type II collagen, suggesting that Cochlin may disrupt the TM architecture and render components like collagen more susceptible to degradation and collapse. Overall, these observations suggest that Cochlin contributes to elevated IOP in primary open angle glaucoma through altered interactions within the TM extracellular matrix, resulting in cell aggregation, mucopolysaccharide deposition, and significant obstruction of the aqueous humor circulation.

Glaucoma encompasses a group of blinding diseases classified generally as primary, for which there is no known etiology, or as secondary, in which a previous illness or injury is contributory. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) 1The abbreviations used are: POAG, primary open angle glaucoma; IOP, intraocular pressure; TM, trabecular meshwork; ECM, extracellular matrix; MPS, mucopolysaccharide; LC, liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HA, hemagglutinin; FCH, factor C homology; VWFA, von Willebrand factor A; EST, expressed sequence tag; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: POAG, primary open angle glaucoma; IOP, intraocular pressure; TM, trabecular meshwork; ECM, extracellular matrix; MPS, mucopolysaccharide; LC, liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HA, hemagglutinin; FCH, factor C homology; VWFA, von Willebrand factor A; EST, expressed sequence tag; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is the most common form of the disease, affecting 3 million Americans and over 70 million people worldwide (1Quigley H.A. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1996; 80: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). Vision loss in most but not all glaucoma cases is related to an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) with subsequent damage to the optic nerve. The molecular basis of the pathology is understood poorly, but the risk for POAG clearly increases with age, and ethnicity plays a role (e.g. blacks exhibit a higher incidence of POAG than whites and at an earlier age of onset). Although specific genes have been implicated in glaucoma pathology, including for example, TIGR and its gene product of unknown function, myocilin, genetic studies to date remain inconclusive regarding glaucoma disease mechanisms (2Cohen C.S. Allingham R.R. Curr. Opin. Ophthalmol. 2004; 15: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Elevated IOP typically develops into glaucoma as a result of impeded aqueous humor outflow (3Tomarev S.I. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Aqueous humor is actively produced by the ciliary epithelium in the posterior chamber of the eye and circulates through the pupil to the anterior chamber where it drains through the trabecular meshwork (TM) into Schlemm's canal and the episcleral veins (4Morrison J.C. Acott T.S. Morrison J.C. Pollack I.P. Glaucoma Science and Practice. Thieme Medical Publishers Inc., NY2003: 34-41Google Scholar). Resistance to outflow occurs commonly in the TM, which has a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of collagen beams lined with endothelium-like cells (5Lutjen-Drecoll E. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 6Lutjen-Drecoll E. J. Glaucoma. 2000; 9: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of resistance are not known; however, the pseudoendothelial cells in the TM produce a mucopolysaccharide (MPS) (7McMenamin P.G. Steptoe R.J. J. Anat. 1991; 178: 65-77PubMed Google Scholar) that appears to function in attracting macrophages for phagocytic self-cleaning of the TM (8Sherwood M.E. Richardson T.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A loss of control of MPS levels in the TM appears to disrupt the self-cleaning process and can result in large changes in IOP (9Nickla D.L. Wildsoet C.F. Troilo D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2519-2528PubMed Google Scholar). In other sensory systems, MPS deposits in the cochlea have been associated with the late onset and progressive auditory and vestibular disorder DFNA9, which involves increased intracranial pressure (10Bitner-Glindzicz M. Br. Med. Bull. 2002; 63: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Bom S.J. Kunst H.P. Huygen P.L. Cremers F.P. Cremers C.W. Br. J. Audiol. 1999; 33: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Drugs for treating POAG slow the disease progression by reducing aqueous production or by increasing aqueous outflow but do not provide a cure. Trabeculectomy is the most common treatment of last resort for POAG and involves the surgical removal of a small amount of TM tissue and redirection of the aqueous flow through the conjunctiva to the episcleral vessels. To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in glaucoma and specifically in the blockage of aqueous outflow, we initiated a classical proteomics study to compare the protein composition of glaucomatous TM obtained by trabeculectomy with that of normal TM. Here we present evidence that Cochlin, a protein associated with the auditory disorder DFNA9, is absent in normal TM but increases with age in glaucomatous TM in association with MPS deposits.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Procurement—Human eyes from 35 normal donors and 5 POAG donors, all between 40 and 85 years of age, were used in this study, and were obtained through the Cleveland Eye Bank. Eyes were enucleated within 12 h of death and stored at -80 °C until TM tissue was isolated by dissection. Normal control eyes were from donors with no visual field defects, no evidence of glaucoma, and without central nervous system abnormalities. Fixed human TM tissues used for immunohistochemistry were obtained from the Eye Donor Program of the Foundation Fighting Blindness (Owings Mills, MD). Glaucomatous eyes and tissues were from clinically documented POAG donors. Glaucomatous TM tissues (∼1–2 mm3) were obtained by trabeculectomy from 30 POAG patients in the Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, with institutional review board approval. Human tissue obtained by trabeculectomy consisted predominantly of TM, but possible contamination with small amounts of surrounding tissue (e.g. sclera) cannot be excluded. TM cells for cell culture were isolated from the rim tissue associated with corneas used for transplantation at the Cole Eye Institute and were obtained from healthy human eyes within 3 h of death and stored until use in Optisol-GS medium (Chiron Vision, Clairmont, CA).Adult mice from inbred strains DBA/2J, BALBc/ByJ, CD1, and C57BL/6J were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in the Cole Eye Institute animal facility. TM samples were obtained surgically following sacrifice with carbon dioxide using animal procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.Protein Analyses—TM tissue from cadaver and trabeculectomy samples was extracted by homogenization in 100 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm SnCl2, 50 mm NaHPO4, 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 100 mm butylated hydroxy toluene, and 0.5% SDS. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (8000 × g for 5 min), and soluble protein was quantified by the Bradford assay (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar), yielding ∼15–20 μg of total soluble protein/trabeculectomy tissue sample (∼1–2 mm3). Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad), and the gels were used either for mass spectrometric proteomic analyses or for Western analyses (13Crabb J.W. Miyagi M. Gu X. Shadrach K. West K.A. Sakaguchi H. Kamei M. Hasan A. Yan L. Rayborn M.E. Salomon R.G. Hollyfield J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14682-14687Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). For protein identifications, gel slices were excised and digested in situ with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using a CapLC system and a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF2, Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Protein identifications from MS/MS data utilized the ProteinLynx™ Global Server (Waters Corp.) and Mascot (Matrix Science) search engines and the Swiss Protein and NCBI protein sequence data bases (13Crabb J.W.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal anti-collagen II, and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). For quantitative Western analyses, anti-mouse secondary antibody linked to 700 nm IR dye and anti-chicken secondary antibody coupled to 800 nm IR dye were used with analyses on an Odyssey infrared imaging system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).Histochemical Analyses—Immunohistochemical analyses to localize Cochlin in ocular tissue were performed with cadaver eyes enucleated within 8 h of death and fixed immediately with calcium acetate-buffered 4% para-formaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded tissue was blocked and sectioned (12 μm) in 5% BlokHen (Aves Labs, Inc., Tigard, OR) in phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated overnight with 10 ng of anti-Cochlin antibody (15Robertson N.G. Resendes B.L. Lin J.S. Lee C. Aster J.C. Adams J.C. Morton C.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) at 4 °C and subsequently with 10 ng of rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were sealed with Vectashield and analyzed with a Nikon EFD-3 fluorescence microscope attached to a charge-coupled device camera. Movat's pentachrome staining for MPS was performed on multiple sections from each donor tissue according to a published protocol (16Khetarpal U. Laryngoscope. 2000; 110: 1379-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ten donor tissues each for control and glaucomatous TM were examined, with alternate sections used for Movat's staining and immunohistochemistry. To ensure identical processing and uniform exposure, control and glaucomatous sections were examined side by side on the same slide. For confocal immunohistochemistry, 12-μm paraffin-embedded sections were labeled with antibodies specific to Cochlin and with a secondary antibody coupled to TRITC (red) and then analyzed using a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope (TCS-SP2, Leica, Exton, PA). A series of 1-μm thick x-y (en face) images were collected and added to obtain an image representing a three-dimensional projection of the entire 12-μm section. Confocal microscopic panels were composed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5.Aggregation Assays—TM cells, from rim tissue associated with healthy corneas used for transplantation, were isolated for in vitro assays by dissection and extracellular matrix digestion (17Stamer W.D. Roberts B.C. Howell D.N. Epstein D.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1804-1812PubMed Google Scholar). TM primary cell cultures were established in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). For the aggregation assay, approximately 3000 cells were seeded in 4-well plates (35-mm wells, BD Biosciences) and grown for 5–7 days at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. The cells were washed with PBS, the PBS was aspirated, and then the cells were treated with 5 μg of either purified recombinant Cochlin or purified recombinant Notch produced in COS-7 cells or with an equal volume of medium from empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells after HA-affinity fractionation. To evaluate whether antibody could neutralize the observed cell aggregation, Cochlin (5 μg) was preincubated for 30 min with either 20 μg of polyclonal chicken anti-Cochlin or nonspecific chicken IgG (Immun System, Uppsala, Sweden), and then the mixture was used to treat the primary TM cells in an identical manner. After 2 min, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine serum was added, and cells were further incubated for 24–36 h as above. Cells were examined with an inverted microscope (model IM 35, Zeiss) and photographed using the Pix Cell II microscope system (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA) equipped with an Olympus camera, an Hitachi digital converter/Sony visual screen, and a Dell Oph Plex GX 110 computer. Recombinant Cochlin and recombinant Notch-1 were produced in COS-7 cells with 3-HA and 4-HA epitope tags, respectively, using the pcDNA 3.0 vector and SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) (18Robertson N.G. Hamaker S.A. Patriub V. Aster J.C. Morton C.C. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Nam Y. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The proteins were affinity-purified from the media of transiently transfected COS-7 cells using rabbit anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) coupled to protein A-agarose beads with dimethyl pimelimidate. Purified recombinant Cochlin was subjected to sheer stress by passing the protein (5 μg) through a Hamilton syringe (50 μl) five times in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% genapol and then was analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE immunoblotting.RESULTSCochlin Is Uniquely Associated with Glaucomatous TM— Protein extracts from six POAG and six normal TM tissues were subjected to SDS-PAGE, the gel slices were excised (Fig. 1A), and the proteins were identified using well established mass spectrometric and bioinformatic methods. Overall, 368 proteins were identified, of which 52 were detected only in glaucomatous TM but with variable frequency (see supplemental Table I). Cochlin, a protein of unknown function, was the component identified most frequently in glaucomatous TM. Indeed, Cochlin was detected by mass spectrometry in 5 of the 6 POAG samples (see supplemental Table I) and by immunoblotting analyses in 20 of 20 glaucomatous TM samples but not in the 20 normal control TM samples, irrespective of cadaver or trabeculectomy tissue source (Fig. 1B). Based on these findings from human TM, we probed Cochlin expression in an established animal model of glaucoma, the DBA/2J mouse. This mouse line exhibits increased IOP at 6–8 months of age, with progressive damage to the optic nerve and progressive hearing loss (20Chang B. Smith R.S. Hawes N.L. Anderson M.G. Zabaleta A. Savinova O. Roderick T.H. Heckenlively J.R. Davisson M.T. John S.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Western analyses of TM extracts from 10-week-old DBA/2J mice and from age-matched C57BL/6J, CD1, or BALBc/ByJ control mice, which do not develop increased IOP, revealed Cochlin expression only in TM from the DBA/2J mice (Fig. 2A). Western analysis of DBA/2J mouse TM over the first 16 weeks of postnatal development detected Cochlin expression at 1–2 weeks of age and demonstrated progressively increased expression at 3, 10, and 16 weeks of age (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Cochlin expression in DBA/2J mice. Protein (∼10 μg) extracted from mouse TM was subjected to Western analysis with anti-Cochlin antibody. A, Cochlin expression in TM from C57BL/6J, CD1, BALBc/ByJ, and DBA/2J mice (all 10 weeks old) is shown with chemiluminescence detection. B, Cochlin expression is shown in TM from DBA/2J mice (1–16 weeks old) and a 16-week-old C57BL/6J control mouse detected using 800 nm IR dye-coupled anti-chicken secondary IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cochlin Co-localizes with Mucopolysaccharide in Glaucomatous TM Deposits—Sheath-derived plaques and microfibrillar deposits have been reported previously (21Ueda J.

Eye Res. 1986; 42: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in the TM of POAG donor eyes. To probe the possible association of Cochlin with TM deposits, we pursued histochemical localization of Cochlin in the anterior segment of the human eye by staining alternate tissue sections with anti-Cochlin antibody or hematoxylin-eosin (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemical analyses of 10 glaucomatous and 10 normal donor eyes confirmed the presence of Cochlin in glaucomatous but not normal TM (Fig. 3, B–D). Additional lower magnification and confocal microscopic images supporting the unique presence of Cochlin in glaucomatous TM deposits are shown in supplemental Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Cochlin was localized within glaucomatous TM to variably sized deposits extending 80–150 μm along the length of Schlemm's canal (Fig. 3, C and D). Movat's pentachrome staining revealed the presence of acidophilic MPS or glycosaminoglycan in the core of the Cochlin deposits (Fig. 3F) but not in control eyes (Fig. 3E). Cochlin and MPS co-localized throughout the inner portion of the glaucomatous deposits, around Schlemm's canal, and in pseudoendothelial cells, but MPS staining was lacking around the periphery of the deposits. The dense, highly branched microfibrillar plaques in the cochlea that have been reported (18Robertson N.G. Hamaker S.A. Patriub V. Aster J.C. Morton C.C. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in DFNA9 also contain both Cochlin and MPS or glycosaminoglycans.Fig. 3Histochemical localization of Cochlin in human TM.A, an anterior segment section stained with hematoxylin-eosin is shown.

The FCH domain is named after the horseshoe crab coagulation factor, which becomes activated on binding lipopolysaccharides, initiating a host defense coagulation cascade. The FCH domain exists with unknown function in several other proteins. VWFA domains exist in a number of ECM and immune system components, interact with collagen proteins such as GpIbα and integrin αIibβ3, and have been implicated in adherence to and aggregation of platelets and macrophages. To explore a possible role for Cochlin in ocular cell adhesion, we performed aggregation assays using human primary TM cells in culture and purified human recombinant Cochlin (Fig. 4). Aggregation of the TM cells was observed with the addition of exogenous Cochlin to the culture (Fig. 4A) but not with control protein Notch or with the empty recombinant vector-transfected medium (Fig. 4, B and C). Preincubating recombinant Cochlin with anti-Cochlin chicken antibody prior to adding it to the primary TM cell prevented cell aggregation, whereas preincubation with control chicken IgG did not (data not shown). Notably, the aggregation of purified recombinant Cochlin following sheer stress was also observed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE Western analysis, suggesting that disulfide bond formation may be involved in the aggregation mechanism (Fig. 4F). These in vitro observations are consistent with an extracellular role for Cochlin involving interactions with ECM components such as collagen.Fig. 4Aggregation of TM cells by Cochlin. Primary TM cell cultures were established and treated as described under “Experimental Procedures” with: A, purified recombinant Cochlin (5 μg in 10 μl of PBS); B, purified recombinant Notch (5 μg in 10 μl of PBS); C, medium (10 μl) from mock empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells; D, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE of purified recombinant Cochlin and Notch; E, Western analysis of purified recombinant Cochlin (∼2 μg) and recombinant Notch (∼1 μg) using polyclonal rabbit anti HA-antibody, and F, Western analysis after non-reducing 10% SDS-PAGE of purified recombinant Cochlin using anti-Cochlin antibody before (-) and after (+) sheer stress, revealing stress-induced higher mass aggregates (arrowhead).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Age-dependent Changes in the Cochlin and Collagen Content of Glaucomatous TM—To probe the molecular role of Cochlin in glaucomatous TM and a possible connection with ECM instability, expression levels of Cochlin and type II collagen were compared by quantitative Western analyses of glaucomatous and normal TM from donors of ages 40–85 years (Fig. 5). An age-dependent increase in Cochlin content was detected in glaucomatous TM, with a concomitant decrease in type II collagen. No significant change with age was apparent in the type II collagen content of normal TM. These results suggest that the increased presence of Cochlin may contribute to the alteration of ECM interactions in glaucomatous TM, perhaps resulting in the collapse or degradation of the collagen-containing microfibrils in TM beams.Fig. 5Cochlin increases and type II collagen decreases in glaucomatous TM.A, representative quantitative Western analyses of normal and glaucomatous TM protein extracts (5 μg each) are shown for Cochlin, type II collagen, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) using IR dye-coupled secondary antibodies detected with an Odyssey infrared imaging system.

Subsequently, Cochlin was found to be uniquely associated with glaucomatous human TM by Western and immunohistochemical analyses of additional POAG and normal TM donors. Western analyses also demonstrated the presence of Cochlin in TM from the DBA/2J glaucomatous mouse but not from three other mouse strains that do not develop elevated IOP. Proteomic analyses identified many other proteins in human TM (see supplemental Table I), including myocilin; however, the significance of proteins detected only in glaucomatous TM remains to be determined. A recent expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis (23Tomarev S.I. Wistow G. Raymond V. Dubois S. Malyukova I. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) reported 1888 possibly expressed genes in normal human TM, including 198 of the 368 proteins (53%) identified in the present study. Other investigators (24Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that protein and mRNA abundance levels in tissues are not directly proportional, and the lack of detection by LC MS/MS does not necessarily mean the absence of protein expression. Accordingly, comparisons of supplemental Table I data with the recent EST study results must be interpreted with caution. Our proteomic analyses were performed on individual, clinically documented TM samples, whereas the EST analysis was performed on mRNA pooled from 28 normal TM donors. The lack of rigorous quantitation further complicates the comparison of protein expression levels, which is exemplified by the EST detection of 28 clones of myocilin in normal donor TM in contrast to mass spectrometric detection of myocilin in 3 of 6 POAG TM analyzed but in none of 6 normal TM analyzed. Of relevance to the present study, two clones of Cochlin were observed in the EST analysis of pooled mRNA (23Tomarev S.I. Wistow G. Raymond V. Dubois S. Malyukova I. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), implying a possible low level gene expression in normal TM. We have detected the COCH transcript in both normal and glaucomatous TM by reverse transcription PCR. 2S. K. Bhattacharya and J. W. Crabb, unpublished data. Nevertheless, our Western analysis reproducibly failed to detect the protein in non-glaucomatous tissues regardless of the amount of TM analyzed, strongly suggesting that Cochlin was absent or in very low abundance in normal TM.Cochlin is the product of the COCH gene, and its FCH domain is mutated in patients with the autosomal dominant nonsyndromic auditory and vestibular disorder DFNA9 (25Robertson N.G.

Persistent association with ER-resident molecular chaperones prevents exit of misfolded or incompletely assembled polypeptides from the ER and forward transport along the secretory line. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is in place to avoid ER constipation. Folding-incompetent products have to be identified to interrupt futile folding attempts and then targeted for unfolding and dislocation into the cytosol for proteasome-mediated destruction. These processes are better understood for N-glycosylated proteins that represent the majority of polypeptides expressed in the ER. EDEM, a mannosidase-like chaperone, regulates the extraction of misfolded glycoproteins from the calnexin cycle. Here we identify and characterize EDEM2, a novel, stress-regulated mannosidase-like protein that operates in the ER lumen. We show that transcriptional up-regulation of EDEM2 depends on the ER stress-activated transcription factor Xbp1, that EDEM2 up-regulation selectively accelerates ERAD of terminally misfolded glycoproteins by facilitating their extraction from the calnexin cycle, and that the previously characterized homolog EDEM is also a soluble protein of the ER lumen in HEK293 cells.

Only recently has the importance of these carbohydrate tags been fully appreciated. N-Linked glycans can increase the solubility of unstructured intermediates of the protein folding process thereby inhibiting the formation of toxic aggregates. Each of the sugar units composing the protein-bound glycan plays a role in the transfer of the branched glycan from the lipid donor in the ER membrane to nascent polypeptides, in mediating binding/release from ER resident lectins, and/or in determining the fate of the associated polypeptide chain (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Glucose trimming by glucosidase I and glucosidase II and glucose re-addition by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT) allows nascent and newly synthesized proteins access to and cycling into a system of chaperones composed by the homologous lectins calnexin (Cnx) and calreticulin (Crt) and the associated oxidoreductase ERp57 (2Ellgaard L.

Native proteins are transported along the secretory line to their destination, but a certain fraction of newly synthesized polypeptides will never make it into a native, export-competent structure. For proteins such as the cystic fibrosis channel the percentage of folding-incompetent chains may be as high as 80% (6Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Amino acid mutations or deletions may further increase the amount of protein to be destined for ERAD. A tightly controlled extraction of folding-incompetent polypeptides from the Cnx cycle and their selection for ERAD is crucial to prevent ER constipation and to maintain productive folding assistance by the ER chaperone network (7Eriksson K.K. Vago R. Calanca V. Galli C. Paganetti P. Molinari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44600-44605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Extraction is regulated by two members of the family 47 glycosyl hydrolases, ER α-mannosidase I and EDEM (ER degradation enhancing α-mannosidase like protein; Ref. 8Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K.

This makes glucosidase-mediated protein de-glucosylation (11Grinna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) less efficient and slows down the on/off cycles of substrate binding to/release from Cnx. Moreover, N-glycans with a reduced number of mannoses, if coupled to misfolded protein determinants, may determine deviation of the polypeptide chain into the ERAD machinery. Mannose trimming may therefore eventually lead to active extraction of folding incompetent proteins from the folding attempts phase in the Cnx cycle (13Trombetta E.S.

Under these conditions, by-products of protein biosynthesis progressively accumulate in the ER lumen eventually compromising secretory capacity (7Eriksson K.K. Vago R. Calanca V. Galli C.

A data base search using mouse EDEM revealed two novel homologues in both the mouse and human genomes which were members of the glycosidase 47 family. One of these proteins, named here EDEM2, was selected for further study because of the similarity to EDEM and the fact that the corresponding gene was up-regulated in response to ER stress in an Xbp1-dependent manner. The intracellular localization and consequences of overexpression on the ERAD of glycoprotein were analyzed for EDEM and for EDEM2. EDEM, a type 2 membrane protein in Cos cells (8Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and EDEM2 are soluble glycoproteins of the ER lumen in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK). EDEM2 showed a similar capacity to EDEM to accelerate the extraction of folding-incompetent glycoproteins from the Cnx cycle and their disposal from the ER, without affecting the rate of degradation of non-glycosylated polypeptides or the maturation of model secretory proteins. Mammalian Expression Constructs and Antibodies—Plasmids for expression of EDEM and EDEM2 with a C-terminal EFRH tag were generated by PCR from IMAGE clones 2654113 and 2811074, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pRK7. The polyclonal anti-Cnx was a kind gift of A. Helenius (Zurich). The monoclonal anti-EFRH used for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence of EFRH-tagged EDEM and EDEM2 was a kind gift of P. Paganetti (Basel, Switzerland). Anti-HA used for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence of HA-tagged EDEM was from Sigma. The polyclonal anti-EDEM antibody was a kind gift of Steve High (Manchester, UK). Transfections—Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, HEK293 cells were seeded at 80–90% confluence in polylysine-coated 6-cm Petri dishes. Eight hours later they were supplemented with 4 μg of expression plasmid in 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in 800 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen)/dish. For co-transfections (EDEM or EDEM2 and BACE476) the DNA for EDEM/EDEM2 was added in 2-fold excess. Expression plasmids containing a selection gene for Geneticin resistance were linearized for stable transfections. Selection media (2% Geneticin) was added to cells 48 h after transfection, and individual geneticin-resistant clones were isolated 12 days after transfection. Expression of EDEM or EDEM2 of the individual clones was assessed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot with HA- or EFRH tag specific antibodies. Pulse Chase and Immunoprecipitations—Cells were starved for 30 min in Met/Cys-free medium, pulsed for 10 min with 150 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys in 1 ml of starvation medium/dish, and chased for the times indicated in the figures with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 mm cold Met/Cys. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared by solubilization of cells in 800 μl/dish ice-cold 2% CHAPS in Hepes buffer saline, pH 6.8, containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, protease inhibitors (HBS). Cell extracts were prepared by 10 min centrifugation at 10,000 × g and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding protein A beads (Sigma; 1:10 w/v swollen in HBS) and the selected antibody to the cell extracts. Incubations were 1–4 h in a cold room. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, three times, with HBS, 0.5% CHAPS and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Relevant bands were quantitated by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were also exposed to BioMax (Eastman Kodak) films and scanned with an Agfa scanner. For EndoH (Roche Applied Science) treatment, immunoprecipitated BACE476 was denatured and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 milliunits of Endo H. Subcellular Fractionation and Preparation of Membranes Versus Luminal Content—Metabolically labeled cells were extensively washed in a 10-cm dish with isotonic buffer. They were gently detached with a rubber policeman and resuspended in 800 μl of homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). Cells were broken with 10–13 passages through a 22-gauge 1 and ¼ needle. Postnuclear supernatants were subjected to a first ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g in TLA 120.2) to separate endomembranes from the cytosol. The endomembrane-containing pellet was washed twice and left for 25 min on ice in 500 μl of 100 mm Na2CO3 for carbonate extraction of the luminal content. After an additional ultracentrifugation step (100,000 × g in TLA 120.2), the luminal fraction was harvested and supplemented with antibodies to Cnx, Crt, or to EDEM to determine their presence. The endomembrane fraction was subjected to an additional washing step with 100 mm Na2CO3 to minimize luminal contaminations and then resuspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer (2% CHAPS). The lysate was subjected to ultracentrifugation to eliminate insoluble material and the supernatant was analyzed by immunoprecipitation for chaperone content. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—1.2 × 106 wt mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) or XBP-1–/– cells were plated in 6-cm dishes without (mock) or with tunicamycin (Tun, 2.5 μg/ml). After 12 h cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA isolated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two micrograms of RNA were used for cDNA production by SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) primed by oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR was performed using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with transcript-specific primers using three different cycle numbers for each gene, all within the linear phase of template amplification. The primers were as follows: β-actin, CTTTCTGGGTATGGAATCCT (forward) and GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTT (reverse); BiP, GAGTTCTTCAATGGCAAGGA (forward) and CCAGTCAGATCAAATGTACCC (reverse); EDEM, GCTGTCTTGCTTGCTTTCTG (forward) and GAAACTCAAGGGAGGCTCTG (reverse); EDEM2, GGGAGAGCCGGTCAGATA (forward) and CCCAAACTGCTTCCATACAG (reverse); EDEM3, ATCAGAGTTCTTGGGGGTCT (forward) and TCAGCATTGGTTTGTGGATA (reverse). Signal Peptide Predictions—SignalP 3.0 (25Bendtsen J.D. von Nielsen H. Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5586) Google Scholar) and PSORT II (26Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) were used to predict signal peptide versus signal anchor sequences in mouse ER α-mannosidase, EDEM, and EDEM2. Both programs predicted that EDEM and EDEM2 contained probable cleavable signal peptides, while α-mannosidase I contained a probable signal anchor. For the hidden Markov model used by Signal P, EDEM had a signal peptide probability of 0.996, EDEM2 a signal peptide probability of 0.999, and α-manosidase I a signal anchor probability of 0.951. Identification of a Novel EDEM-like Protein—A data base search for novel components of ERAD using either mouse EDEM (8Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) or the yeast ER α-mannosidase-like protein Htmp1 (27Jakob C.A. Bodmer D. Spirig U. Battig P. Marcil A. Dignard D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Aebi M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) identified two previously uncharacterized open reading frames in each of the mouse and human genomes. All four proteins were members of the family 47 glycosyl hydrolases, which includes both EDEM and ER α-mannosidase I. The first gene, here named EDEM2, encoded a 577 amino acid protein in mouse (Swiss-Prot accession number Q91VV3, NCBI nucleotide 9530090G24Rik), which was 94% identical to a 578 amino acid protein in human (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9BV94; NCBI nucleotide C20orf31). The second pair of genes, here tentatively named EDEM3, encoded a 931-amino acid protein in mouse (NCBI nucleotide 2310050N11Rik), which from Met45 was 95% identical to a 889 amino acid protein in human (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9BZQ6, NCBI nucleotide C1orf22). The EDEM3 proteins not only contain a family 47 glycosyl hydrolase domain but also a protease-associated domain that could serve as an interaction site between EDEM3 and incorrectly folded proteins. EDEM3 is significantly longer than either EDEM, EDEM2, or Htmp1. No studies have yet been undertaken on EDEM3. Unigene (28Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Federhen S. Lash A.E. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Sequeira E. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) cDNA sources for mouse EDEM2 include bone, brain, colon, eye, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, mammary gland, ovary, pancreas, placenta, pituitary gland, skin, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, and uterus. An alignment of EDEM2 with EDEM and ER α-mannosidase I reveals that the core family 47 glycosyl hydrolase domain is relatively well conserved but that there is little or no conservation beyond this domain. The identities in the family 47 glycosyl hydrolase domain are 44% for mouse EDEM versus mouse EDEM2, 35% for mouse EDEM versus human ER α-mannosidase I, and 32% for mouse EDEM2 versus human ER α-mannosidase I. The mannosidase catalytic residues are conserved in EDEM and EDEM2, with the exception of a pair of cysteines that are conserved in most catalytically active mannosidases. The lack of these cysteines has been reported to be responsible for the lack of enzymatic activity of EDEM (8Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Mouse EDEM2 has four potential N-glycosylation sites, all of which are conserved in the human protein. EDEM2 is highly conserved between mouse, human, chicken, and xenopus except for a sequence corresponding to amino acids 508–553 of mouse EDEM2. Analysis of the EDEM2 sequence revealed that it has a predicted cleavable signal sequence with a probability exceeding 99%. Similar analysis of EDEM revealed a predicted cleavable signal sequence with a probability exceeding 99%, while ER-α-mannosidase I is identified by the same algorithms as being a type 2 membrane protein. EDEM and EDEM2 Are N-Glycosylated Proteins of the ER Lumen in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were transfected for stable or transient expression of tagged versions of EDEM or EDEM2. The tags used in our studies were a conventional non-apeptide HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) and a shorter tetrapeptide tag (EFRH) for which monoclonal antibodies are available in our laboratory. The tags were placed at the C termini of EDEM and EDEM2 as it had been previously shown that a C-terminal tag did not affect intracellular localization and activity of EDEM (8Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Expression, N-glycosylation, and intracellular localization of EDEM and EDEM2 were assessed after metabolic labeling of cells. Transfected cells expressing the tagged versions of EDEM or EDEM2 were incubated for 10 min with [35S]methionine and cysteine and chased in a medium containing excess of unlabeled methionine and cysteine before lysis with CHAPS. Post-nuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the specific anti-tag antibody and proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE gels. EDEM-EFRH (shown in Fig. 1A) and EDEM-HA (data not shown) had an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa; EDEM2-EFRH was about 70 kDa (Fig. 1A). Endo H treatment of the immunopurified recombinant proteins revealed that EDEM and EDEM2 were extensively glycosylated in HEK293 cells, consistent with the presence of five and four consensus sequences for N-glycosylation respectively. The mobility shift was the same just after synthesis when the proteins are in the ER and all N-glycans are Endo H-sensitive and 2 h after synthesis, as a clear indication that all glycans had maintained Endo H sensitivity (Fig. 1B) and that the proteins were not transported to the Golgi compartment (29Rothman J.E. Urbani L.J. Brands R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The localization of EDEM and EDEM2 in the ER was also confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). To determine whether EDEM and EDEM2 expressed in HEK293 cells are luminal or transmembrane proteins mock-transfected cells and cells with stable expression of EDEM or EDEM2 were metabolically labeled, extensively washed, and broken with 10–13 passages through a 22-gauge 1 and ¼ needle. Postnuclear supernatants were subjected to a first ultracentrifugation to separate endomembranes from the cytosol. The endomembrane-containing pellet was washed twice before carbonate extraction of the luminal content. The luminal fraction was supplemented with antibodies to Cnx, Crt, or to “tagged” EDEM to determine their presence. The endomembrane fraction was subjected to an additional washing step to reduce luminal contaminations and then detergent-solubilized before immunoprecipitation with antibody to Cnx, Crt, or to recombinant and endogenous EDEM. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, C–F). In mock-transfected cells, 90% of the labeled Crt was isolated from the luminal (Fig. 1C, lane 1) and 10% from the endomembrane fraction (lane 4) indicating incomplete rupture of intracellular compartments or tight association of Crt with a membrane-bound ER component. Cnx was solely extracted from the membrane fraction (lane 5), as expected for this type I ER membrane protein. The tagged versions of EDEM and EDEM2 were isolated from the luminal fraction of HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D, lane 9, and E, lane 15, respectively). For EDEM the result was unexpected because this protein is membrane-bound in COS cells (8Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Our results, however, confirmed predictions based on the protein sequence (see above). No change was observed in the localization of Cnx or Crt in the EDEM or EDEM2 overexpressing cells (Fig. 1, D, lanes 7 and 8 and 10 and 11 and E, lanes 13 and 14 and 16 and 17). A small amount of EDEM (asterisk in Fig. 1D, lane 12) and EDEM2 (+ in Fig. 1E, lane 18) was also found in the membrane fraction. These immunoreactive proteins were not present in the membrane fraction of mock-transfected cells (lane 6) and had gel mobility slightly slower than the EDEM found in the ER lumen. Thus, they most likely represent the fraction of recombinant EDEM and EDEM2 remaining anchored to the membrane through uncleaved signal peptide. The prevalent luminal localization of endogenous EDEM in the ER lumen of HEK293 cells was also confirmed (arrow in Fig. 1F). EDEM and EDEM2 Are Stress-regulated Proteins of the ER Lumen—An increase in cargo load or accumulation of misfolded polypeptides in the ER lumen trigger an unfolded protein response (UPR) with transcriptional up-regulation of a plethora of genes involved in protein and lipid biosynthesis, protein maturation, protein degradation, and protein transport along the secretory route (30Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Depletion of the proximal ER stress sensor IRE1α or of the transcription factor Xbp1 only mildly affects induction of BiP/Grp78 and of other ER resident chaperones but abolishes EDEM up-regulation upon ER stress (24Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 31Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). We first determined whether the novel member of the glycosyl hydrolase 47 family, EDEM2, is a stress-regulated gene and whether Xbp1 plays a role in its regulation. To this end, MEF and MEF derived from a Xbp1 knock-out mouse (Xbp1–/–MEF) were mock-treated or exposed for 12 h to Tun, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation that triggers UPR. At 2.5 μg/ml, Tun was inhibited by 50% N-glycosylation of two control viral glycoproteins (data not shown). Although up-regulation of ER stress-responding chaperones was not maximal (data not shown), this concentration of Tun was chosen for our experiments as it did not affect cell viability. To monitor variations in the expression of ER chaperones, RNA was isolated from mock- and Tun-treated wt and Xbp1–/–MEF and RT-PCR was performed followed by semiquantitative PCR with chaperone-specific primers. ER stress induction of BiP/Grp78 is only weakly affected in cells with defective IRE1α/Xbp1 response (24Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Accordingly, exposure of wt MEF (Fig. 1G, compare lanes 1 and 2) and of Xbp1–/–MEF (Fig. 1G, lanes 3 and 4) to Tun resulted in comparable induction of BiP. On the other hand, EDEM induction requires a fully functional IRE1α/Xbp1 response (24Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 31Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, Tun triggered transcriptional up-regulation of EDEM in wt MEF (Fig. 1G, lanes 9 and 10), but it failed to do so in cells depleted of Xbp1 (Fig. 1G, lanes 11 and 12). EDEM2 is also an ER stress-responding protein as it was clearly up-regulated in wt MEF exposed to Tun (Fig. 1G, lanes 13 and 14). As for EDEM, Xbp1 depletion abolished EDEM2 induction (Fig. 1G, lanes 15 and 16). EDEM3 transcription was on the other hand not enhanced upon ER stress (Fig. 1G, lanes 17–20). Thus, EDEM (24Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 31Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N.

For example, immortalized neurons and immature primary cortical neurons undergo cell death in response to depletion of the antioxidant glutathione, which can be elicited by administration of glutamate at high concentrations. We have demonstrated previously that this glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity requires activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase member ERK1/2, but the mechanisms by which this activation takes place in oxidatively stressed neurons are still not fully known. In this study, we demonstrate that during oxidative stress, ERK-directed phosphatases of both the serine/threonine- and tyrosine-directed classes are selectively and reversibly inhibited via a mechanism that is dependent upon the oxidation of cysteine thiols. Furthermore, the impact of ERK-directed phosphatases on ERK1/2 activation and oxidative toxicity in neurons was tested in a neuronal cell line and in primary cortical cultures. Overexpression of the highly ERK-specific phosphatase MKP3 and its catalytic mutant, MKP3 C293S, were neuroprotective in transiently transfected HT22 cells and primary neurons. The neuroprotective effect of the MKP3 C293S mutant, which enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation but blocks its nuclear translocation, demonstrates the necessity for active ERK1/2 nuclear localization for oxidative toxicity in neurons.

Glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity provides an excellent model for studying the effects of oxidative stress in immortalized neurons and in primary neuronal cultures (3Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.

We have shown previously that oxidative toxicity causes a delayed, sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 that is necessary for neuronal cell death (6Stanciu M.

The regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation reflects a subtle balance between ERK-directed kinase and phosphatase activity. A diverse range of phosphatases directed against phospho-serine/threonine, phospho-tyrosine, or both have been identified as negative regulators of ERK1/2.

Lombroso P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), among numerous others, can function as ERK-directed phosphatases in neurons. Dynamic changes in ERK-directed phosphatase activity can result from several mechanisms, including ERK-dependent up-regulation of phosphatase expression (12Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), phosphorylation-dependent increases in phosphatase stability (13Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and protein-protein interaction-dependent activation of phosphatase activity (14Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Collectively, these events have been shown to function in a negative feedback loop that terminates ERK signaling (12Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Recently, the role of oxidative stress in the regulation of phosphatase activity has received much attention (15Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 16Leslie N.R. Bennett D. Lindsay Y.E. Stewart H. Gray A. Downes C.P.

U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Several phosphatases have been shown to be redox-sensitive and can be either reversibly or irreversibly inhibited, depending upon the degree and mechanism of oxidation (15Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 18Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Oxidative phosphatase inhibition can impact various cellular signaling pathways and accounts for a mechanism now referred to as oxidative signaling. The extent to which oxidative inhibition of phosphatases plays a role in driving signaling events during neurotoxicity remains relatively unexplored. We sought to characterize the effect of glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity on ERK-directed phosphatases in primary neuronal cultures. In this study, we show that endogenous ERK-directed phosphatase activity is specifically and reversibly inhibited during oxidative stress, consistent with a mechanism involving the oxidation of cysteine thiols. This inhibition of ERK-directed phosphatases correlates with an increase in phosphorylated ERK levels. We show that this aggregate phosphatase activity is likely composed of PP2A and a vanadate-sensitive component. The impact of ERK-directed phosphatase activity on oxidative toxicity was revealed by the neuroprotective effects of overexpressed mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3) and its catalytic mutant, MKP3 C293S, in both HT22 cells and primary cortical neurons. Collectively, these data implicate oxidative inhibition of ERK-directed phosphatases in neuronal oxidative toxicity induced by glutathione depletion. Plasmids—The expression plasmids for MKP3 WT and MKP3 C293S, as well as the parent plasmid (pSG5), were kind gifts from Drs. Steven Keyse and Anne Brunet (19Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R.

The mitochondria-targeted eYFP expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Ian Reynolds, and the expression plasmid for the Elk-1/GAL4 fusion protein, the luciferase reporter, and the constitutive Renilla plasmid (all from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were purchased or donated by Dr. Elias Aizenman. Primary Cortical Cultures—Cortices from embryonic day 17 Spague-Dawley rat fetuses (Hilltop Lab Animals, Scottdale, PA) were dissected and manually dissociated by repeated trituration using fire-polished glass pipettes in Hanks' balanced salt solution (5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 137 mm NaCl, and 5.6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4) without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Invitrogen) followed by passage through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to remove clumped cells. Cells were counted and plated on 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-treated culture plates at a density of ∼2.1 × 104 cells/cm2. Cell viability was routinely greater than 80% as assessed by uptake of trypan blue dye upon plating. Cultures were maintained for 3–4 days in media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 10% Ham's F12 nutrient supplement (Invitrogen), 1.9 mm glutamine, 24 mm Hepes buffer, and 4.5 mg/ml glucose at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At this time, these mixed cortical cultures are predominately neuronal, with ∼20% glial fibrillary-associated protein staining cells (3Murphy T.H. Schnaar R. Coyle J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and reagents used were purchased from Sigma. Cell Line Culture—HT22 hippocampal cells, which are sensitive to glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity (5Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections in Primary Cortical Neuronal Cultures—A number of transfection reagents and protocols that were tested proved toxic to our primary immature cortical cultures. However, limited toxicity was observed when the 25-kDa polyamine polymer polyethyleneimine was used to form DNA complexes and transfect primary neurons (22Guerra-Crespo M. Charli J.L. Rosales-Garcia V.H. Pedraza-Alva G. Perez-Martinez L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2003; 127: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Horbinski C. Stachowiak M.K. Higgins D. Finnegan S.G. BMC Neurosci. 2001; 2: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 μl of a 100 mm polyethyleneimine stock solution was added to 250 μl of 150 mm NaCl, whereas 6.5 μg of DNA was added to 250 μl of 150 mm NaCl. Two μg of a mitochondria-targeted eYFP (mt-eYFP) plasmid DNA and 4.5 μg of MKP3 plasmids were used per condition. After 5 min, the two solutions were mixed. Polyethyleneimine-DNA complexes were allowed to form for 10 min and then diluted into 10 ml of minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Conditioned medium was removed from the primary neuronal cultures and replaced with minimum Eagle's medium. One ml of transfection solution was added to each 35-mm well, and cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The transfection media were then removed and replaced with conditioned media for the remainder of the experiment. The transfection efficiency with this method varied between 0.1% and 0.5%. Glutamate treatment was initiated 24 h after transfection. Transfections in HT22 Cells—The cationic lipid reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transiently transfect HT22 cells. For toxicity experiments, 2 μg of DNA was used per well of a 12-well tissue culture plate, in a DNA (μg)/Lipofectamine 2000 (μl) ratio of 1.5. Typically, 1 μg of mt-eYFP plasmid DNA and 1 μg of MKP3 plasmid DNA were used for these transfections. For the Elk-1-dependent luciferase expression experiments, ∼8 μg of total plasmid DNA was used for each 60-mm plate (3 μg of pSG5, MKP3 WT, or MKP3 C293S; 4 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid pFR-Luc; 0.12 μg of Elk-1/GAL4 fusion expression plasmid pFC-Elk-1/GAL4 or the GAL4 DNA binding domain expression plasmid pFC-GAL4 DBD; and 1.2 μg of constitutive Renilla expression plasmid PRK-tk Renilla), with a DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 ratio of 1.5. DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were diluted in Opti- MEM (Invitrogen) for 5 min and then combined to allow DNA complexes to form for 20 min. The transfection solution was added to HT22 cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics for 5 h, after which cells were returned to normal serum- and antibiotic-containing media (see “Transfections in Primary Cortical Neuronal Cultures”). Cells were harvested as described beginning 16 to 18 h after transfection, and luciferase/Renilla activity was measured (see “Elk-1/GAL4 Fusion Protein-dependent Luciferase Expression”). Elk-1/GAL4 Fusion Protein-dependent Luciferase Expression—Components of the PathDetect in vivo signal transduction pathway transreporting system (Stratagene) were used in order to monitor Elk-1-dependent gene expression in HT22 cells. Cells were transfected with an expression plasmid coding for an Elk-1/GAL4 fusion protein, a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under a synthetic promoter containing five tandem GAL4 binding sites, and a MKP3 expression plasmid. In this system, luciferase activity is a measure of the extent of Elk-1 activation. HT22 cells were co-transfected with the Elk-1 fusion plasmid (pFA2-Elk-1) or its negative control containing only GAL4 (pFC2-DBD), the luciferase reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc), a constitutive expression plasmid coding for Renilla under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (PRK-tk Renilla), and either the pSG5 empty vector, MKP3 WT, or MKP3 C293S plasmid. Sixteen hours after transfection, HT22 cells were left untreated or treated with glutamate for 7.5 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm NaF, and 2 mm DTT). Both luciferase activity and Renilla activity were measured with the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) using a luminometer (Wallac Victor3; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All luciferase signals were normalized to Renilla within each sample. Viability Measurements in Transfected Cells—Primary cortical neuronal cultures (DIV3) display cell body shrinkage, process retraction, and nuclear condensation at 18–20 h after treatment with 5 mm glutamate. After 24 h, cells begin to detach from the tissue culture plate. To assess cell viability in transfected neurons (i.e. mt-YFP-positive cells; see “Transfections in Primary Cortical Neuronal Cultures”), we treated cells with the DNA dye propidium iodide (PI), which is excluded from healthy, intact cells and only gains access into cells with a compromised plasma membrane. Eighteen hours after the initiation of all treatments, cultures were incubated for 10 min in media containing a final concentration of 6.25 μg/ml PI. Cells were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics (×20 objective; Nikon Eclipse TE200), and mt-eYFP-positive, PI-labeled, and unlabeled cells were counted. The percentage of dual-labeled cells in each well was then calculated as a percentage of all transfected cells counted (∼50 cells/well). Multiple wells were counted for each condition in at least three separate transfected cultures (total cell population of at least 250 per condition). Digital images were acquired by SimplePCI software (version 5.2.1; Compix Inc. Imaging Systems, Cranberry Township, PA) and formatted using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1. HT22 cells become PI-positive beginning 6–7 h after treatment with 5mm glutamate and begin to detach from the culture plate after 9 h. We thus assessed toxicity in transfected, mt-eYFP marker-positive cells at 7 h using the PI staining method as described above. Cells were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics (×20 objective; Nikon Eclipse TE200), and mt-eYFP-positive, PI-labeled, and unlabeled cells were counted. The percentage of dual-labeled cells in each field was then calculated as a percentage of all transfected cells counted (∼60 cells/field at ×100), and multiple fields were counted for each condition in at least three separate transfected cultures (total cell population of at least 500 per condition). Digital images were acquired by SimplePCI software (version 5.2.1; Compix Inc. Imaging Systems) and formatted using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1. Indirect Immunofluorescence—HT22 cells were plated on 12-well tissue culture plates in normal media (see “Cell Line Culture”) and then transfected with either the pSG5 parent plasmid, MKP3 WT, or MKP3 C293S expression plasmids for 16–18 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), fixed with -20 °C methanol for 5 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and then blocked for 1 h with PBS supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. The fixed cells were then incubated with an anti-c-myc antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or an anti-GAL4 DBD antibody (1:500; Sigma) in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS before incubation with a fluorescencelabeled secondary antibody (1:1000; anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and the nuclear stain Hoescht 33258 (1 μg/ml). After washing stained cells twice with PBS, images were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted fluorescence microscope. Digital images were acquired by SimplePCI software (version 5.2.1; Compix Inc. Imaging Systems) and formatted using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1. ERK-directed Phosphatase Activity Assay—We modified a nonradioactive method for determining ERK-directed phosphatase activity in whole cell lysates (24Laakko T. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31621-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This method relies on detecting dephosphorylation of a purified, dual-phosphorylated, His6-tagged ERK upon incubation with whole cell lysate. Thus, alterations in ERK-directed phosphatase activity within the lysate can be monitored by measuring changes in the phosphorylation state of the isolated substrate, as assessed by Western blotting with a phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody. In brief, 150 μg of whole cell lysate (see “Western Blot Analysis”) lacking DTT, Na3VO4, or NaF was diluted into a total volume of 250 μl in phosphatase assay buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 μm of the MEK inhibitor U0126). Recombinant, phosphorylated His6-ERK2 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was added to each sample (30 ng/sample), and the reactions were maintained at 37 °C for 40 min. As a positive control for phosphatase activity, 1200 units of the dual specificity phosphatase λ protein phosphatase (λ-PPase; New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) was included in a separate reaction. Treatment with 50 mm DTT or phosphatase inhibitors was accomplished during a 30-min incubation on ice, prior to the addition of purified ERK. When DTT and inhibitors were used, the samples were pre-incubated for 30 min on ice with DTT, followed by a 15-min incubation with inhibitors. After 40 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 250 μl of wash buffer (8 m urea, pH 8.6, containing 10 mm imidazole), and 30 μl of Ni2+-conjugated, magnetic beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added to each reaction. After 90 min of rocking at 4 °C, the samples were washed twice with wash buffer and once in 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The beads were then suspended in NaCl/Tris and Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and subjected to Western blotting to detect phosphorylated ERK and total ERK. JNK-directed Phosphatase Activity Assay—This method was performed exactly as described above, except that each sample was incubated with 30 ng of purified, dual-phosphorylated His6-tagged JNK-1 protein (Upstate, Waltham, MA), and Western blots were probed with anti-phospho-JNK and total JNK antibodies. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were treated as described, scraped and collected into PBS, pelleted at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) per milliliter of lysis buffer. Total extract protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent. Equivalent amounts of total protein (either 15 or 20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidine membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-phospho-ERK, anti-total ERK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-total JNK, or anti-c-myc; all from Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C with 3% dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin, subjected to three 10-min washes with PBST, and exposed to the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were again subjected to three 10-min washes with PBST, and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) using standard x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Several different exposure times were used for each blot to ensure linearity of band intensities. Densitometry was performed using a Personal Densitometer SI (Amersham Biosciences) linked to the ImageQuant 5.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—Comparisons of multiple mean values were accomplished by analysis of variance with either Tukey's or Bonferroni's post hoc tests for significance. Comparisons of two means were performed using a paired t test. p values of <0.05 were taken to be significant, and all data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA). ERK-directed Phosphatase Activity Is Specifically Inhibited during Glutamate-induced Oxidative Toxicity in Primary Immature Cortical Cultures—We have reported previously that in primary immature cortical cultures, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is elevated during oxidative stress generated by glutamate-induced glutathione depletion (6Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol.

Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), we set out to examine whether ERK-directed phosphatase activity was altered during glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity. To this end, we adapted a novel in vitro phosphatase assay that uses whole cell lysates to dephosphorylate purified, dual-phosphorylated, His6-tagged ERK2 (Fig. 1A, lane 1; see “Experimental Procedures”). This assay revealed the robust ERK phosphatase activity of exogenously applied λ protein phosphatase, a nonspecific dual specificity phosphatase that we employed as a positive control (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Furthermore, the method proved to be quite sensitive in detecting changes in phosphatase activity because the application of well-characterized phosphatase inhibitors was effective in inhibiting phosphatase activity in preparations of whole cell lysate (Fig. 2, A and B). Although not as active as purified λ phosphatase, whole cell lysates prepared from primary cortical neurons possess robust ERK-directed phosphatase activity (Fig. 1A, lane 3). When extracts were prepared from cultures treated with glutamate for 14 h, a decrease in ERK-directed phosphatase activity was revealed (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Quantification of several independent experiments revealed a significant decrease in ERK phosphatase activity in cultures treated for 14 h with glutamate, as reflected in a 5-fold increase (p < 0.01) in the normalized intensity of the phosphorylated ERK2 band when compared with untreated cultures (Fig. 1B). Shorter treatments with glutamate (i.e. 1 and 6 h) did not significantly affect ERK-directed phosphatase activity in the primary neuron culture extracts (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the observed inhibition of ERK-directed phosphatase activity in these extracts coincided with times of maximal oxidative stress, in which glutathione levels are depleted, and ERK phosphorylation is increased (5Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 8Levinthal D.J. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11206-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of ERK-directed phosphatase activity could be completely reversed by treatment of the extracts with 50 mm DTT (Fig. 1A, lane 7), implying that phosphatase function is impaired in oxidatively stressed cells due to cysteine oxidation. The restoration of ERK phosphatase activity in lysates from oxidatively stressed cells with DTT consistently yielded a level of activity greater than that found in untreated cells (e.g. compare lanes 3 and 7, Fig. 1A). Indeed, DTT treatment of lysates from primary cortical neuronal cultures not exposed to glutamate led to increased ERK-directed phosphatase activity (data not shown). Thus, a small pool of ERK phosphatases may be normally under tonic, reversible oxidative inhibition in primary neurons, despite intracellular conditions that are generally reducing.Fig. 2ERK-directed phosphatase activity is inhibited by okadaic acid and orthovanadate. The nature and identity of the components of the basal ERK-directed phosphatase activity were probed using the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A, and sodium orthovanadate, a general inhibitor of tyrosine-directed and dual specificity phosphatases. Whole cell lysates from untreated primary immature cortical neurons were incubated with vehicle (A, lane 3), 0.1 μm (A, lane 4) or 1 μm okadaic acid (A, lane 5), or 1 mm orthovanadate (B, lane 4) for 30 min before use in the in vitro ERK-directed phosphatase activity assay.

These channels are blocked by d-tubocurarine but not by α-bungarotoxin. We provide evidence that two additional subunits, ACC-3 and ACC-4, interact with ACC-1 and ACC-2.

The acetylcholine-binding domain of these channels appears to have diverged substantially from the acetylcholine-binding domain of nicotinic receptors. Fast (ionotropic) cholinergic neurotransmission is generally mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) 1The abbreviations used are: ACh, acetylcholine; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; C6, hexamethonium; dβe, dihydro-β-erythroidine; α-BT, α-bungarotoxin; d-TC, d-tubocurarine. receptors (nAChRs). These are cation-selective channels and hence mediate excitatory neurotransmission. However, electrophysiological evidence of ionotropic, ACh-gated chloride channels in molluscs suggests the existence of fast inhibitory cholinergic neurotransmission as well (1Kehoe J. J. Physiol. 1972; 225: 85-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Kehoe J. J. Physiol. 1972; 225: 115-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 3Kehoe J. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8198-8213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ACh-gated chloride channels in Aplysia neurons respond to several agonists and antagonists of nAChRs, indicating that, like the nAChRs, they may belong to the superfamily of Cys loop ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) subunits. Otherwise, little is known about the molecular nature of the receptors that mediate fast inhibitory cholinergic neurotransmission, whether this type of neurotransmission is widespread in the animal kingdom, or how it evolved. The Cys loop LGICs are encoded by a large and diverse gene superfamily. These channels are pentameric and can be homomers or heteromers consisting of as many as four different subunits, each encoded by a different gene (4Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Subunits of the Cys loop LGIC superfamily share a topology that consists of a large extracellular ligand-binding domain and four transmembrane domains that form the ion-selective pore (4Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 5Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed.

In vertebrates, the LGIC superfamily consists of two families of cation-selective channels, the nicotinic ACh receptors and the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors, and two families of anion channels, the GABAA receptors and the glycine receptors (7Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The repertoire of invertebrate LGICs is larger, including, in addition to homologues of vertebrate channels, histaminegated chloride channels (8Gisselmann G. Pusch H. Hovemann B.T. Hatt H. Nat.

Neurosci. 2001; 17: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the LGIC channel structure appears flexible enough to accommodate diverse ligands and ligand/ion selectivity pairings. Although no genes encoding ACh-gated chloride channels have been previously identified, it is likely that many invertebrate receptors with unusual properties remain to be characterized. The genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster reveal numerous predicted Cys loop LGICs that do not obviously belong to any family of known ion or ligand specificity (18The C. elegans Genome Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 19Bargmann C.I.

C. elegans in particular encodes ∼70 LGIC subunit genes, of which fewer than 20 have been characterized pharmacologically (19Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The function of such a large and diverse LGIC superfamily in a single species is unclear. To better understand the constraints on Cys loop LGIC structure and evolution and to identify new modes of neurotransmission, we have characterized several members of a novel family of channel subunits from C. elegans. These form ACh-gated chloride channels exhibiting an unusual pharmacology that appears to reflect a unique ACh-binding site. Cloning ACC cDNAs—Poly(A+) RNA was purified from adult worms (Bristol N2 strain). First strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primer using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The open reading frame of ACC-1, -2, and -4, as predicted in Wormbase (available on the World Wide Web at www.wormbase.org/), was amplified by PCR using the following primers: ACC-1, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCATATGAGTCATCCGGGTTGGATTAT-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTAGATTAAGGTTGATCAATATTCACA-3′; ACC-2, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCATATGATATTTACTCTTTTATCAACACTGCCT-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTAGATTATCCGTCAACTCGATT-3′; ACC-4, 5′-GGGGTACCATATGCGACTAATCATATTAGTAATCT-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAGATAGTTCTAACCAATAGTTTTCC-3′. PCR products were subcloned either into pDONR201 (ACC-1 and ACC-2) via recombination reaction using the Gateway Cloning Technology kit (Invitrogen) or into pBluescript (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) using the KpnI and XbaI sites (ACC-4). ACC-3 was first amplified from cDNA using a primer to the SL-1 transpliced leader sequence 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGGATCCTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3′ and a 3′ primer corresponding to the end of the putative open reading frame, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGCAGTCATGTGTTAACAGTAAGGTAATAT-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pDONR and sequenced. A new 5′-primer corresponding to the 5′-end of the open reading frame was used with the previous 3′-primer to amplify the open reading frame from the cloned ACC-3 cDNA. Three cDNA clones of each gene were sequenced to determine the true open reading frames and to find possible mutations resulting from reverse transcription-PCR. Nonsilent mutations were fixed either by overlap extension PCR (22Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) or by splicing together mutation-free cDNA fragments using convenient restriction sites. Sequence Analysis—Amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program (available on the World Wide Web at clustalw.genome.ad.jp). Transmembrane domains were predicted using the TMHMM method based on a hidden Markov model (23Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). SignalP 2.0, NetGlyc 1.0, and NetPhos 2.0 programs based on artificial neuronal networks were used to predict signal peptide sequences (24Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). All of the above mentioned prediction programs are available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services. Expression in Xenopus Oocytes and Electrophysiology—cDNAs were subcloned into the pT7N expression vector (25Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pT7NcDNA constructs were linearized with SalI (ACC-2) or BamHI (ACC-1, -3, and -4), and capped cRNAs were transcribed using the MEGAscript Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Synthesized cRNAs were recovered by LiCl precipitation and resuspended in nuclease-free H2O at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Oocytes were harvested from mature female Xenopus laevis according to standard procedures (26Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Oocytes were maintained at 20 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 100 mg/ml gentamycin and 550 mg/ml pyruvate. Oocytes were injected with 40 nl of cRNA using the Nanoject system (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) and incubated for 2 days before measurements were taken. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed using the AxoClamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Oocytes were perfused in an RC-12 recording chamber (Warner Instrument Inc., Hamden, CT) or a Maltese Cross chamber (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Data were acquired at 1 kHz using Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). All drugs were obtained from Sigma. Dose-response curves for agonists were generated by applying increasing concentrations of drug followed by 3–9-min washes. To determine the EC50 and Hill coefficient, dose-response curves (shown as smooth curves in graphs) were fitted using the Hill equation as follows, f(I)=(Imax[I]⋅/(EC50⋅+[I]⋅))+Imin(Eq. 1) where I represents the normalized response, Imax is the maximal response elicited by a saturating concentration of agonist, EC50 is the concentration of agonist inducing half-maximal response, n is the Hill coefficient, and Imin is the normalized response at lowest agonist concentration. Oocytes were preincubated with antagonist for 1 min (10 min for α-BT) prior to co-application of the antagonist with either 1 μm or 10 μm ACh for oocytes expressing ACC-1 or ACC-2, respectively. The amplitude of response to co-application of ACh and antagonist was normalized to that of the response to ACh alone. Because the ACC-1 and ACC-2 channels inactivate slowly in the presence of ACh, I-V curves were measured using voltage ramps of 4 mV/s in the presence of either 2 or 20 μm ACh for oocytes expressing ACC-1 or ACC-2, respectively. For ion substitution experiments, sodium gluconate or arginine-Cl were substituted for NaCl in the ND96 solution. The current amplitude was normalized to the peak response in normal ND96 at –80 mV. Cloning of Members of the ACC Subunit Family—A neighbor-joining tree of predicted C. elegans LGIC subunit genes revealed the presence of a distinct clade of 16 LGIC genes whose only characterized member was the serotonin-gated chloride channel subunit MOD-1 (11Ranganathan R. Cannon S.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2000; 408: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Members of this clade have no orthologs in Drosophila or vertebrate genomes (Fig. 1A, data not shown). The newly identified clade appeared to break down into three subgroups that we reasoned might correspond to families of channels with distinct ligand specificities. We isolated and sequenced four cDNAs from one subgroup: ACC-1 (also known as F58G6.4), ACC-2 (C53D6.3), ACC-3 (F55D10.5), and ACC-4 (T27E9.9). Open reading frames of the ACC-1 (1401 bp), ACC-2 (1338 bp), and ACC-4 (1227 bp) cDNAs corresponded to those annotated in the genome data base. The ACC-3 cDNA (1554 bp) was transpliced with an SL1 leader sequence and differed from the predicted open reading frame in the first and seventh through ninth exons. All typical features attributed to LGIC subunits, such as a signal sequence, an N-terminal extracellular domain with the Cys loop, four transmembrane domains (M1–M4), and a large cytoplasmic loop located between M3 and M4, were recognizable in the amino acid sequences of these proteins (Fig. 1B). The ACC-1 and ACC-2 putative proteins are 40% identical to each other at the amino acid level and exhibit 31 and 29% identity to MOD-1, respectively. In contrast, ACC-2 shows 23% identity to UNC-49B, a C. elegans GABA-gated chloride channel subunit (27Bamber B.A. Beg A.A. Twyman R.E. Jorgensen E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5348-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is only 16% identical to UNC-38, a C. elegans nAChR subunit. ACC-1 and -2 Form ACh-gated Chloride Channels—To determine the ligand specificity of the ACC subunits, we expressed ACC cRNAs in Xenopus oocytes and voltage-clamped the oocytes at –80 mV. ACC-1- and ACC-2-injected oocytes exhibited an ACh-elicited inward current with maximal magnitude varying from 0.8 to 3.4 μA (Fig. 2, A and C). The ACC-1-dependent current showed almost no desensitization even at saturating ACh concentrations, whereas the ACC-2-dependent current desensitized. ACC-1 responded to ACh with a half-effector concentration (EC50) of 0.26 ± 0.01 μm and an estimated Hill coefficient of 1.26 ± 0.04 (Fig. 2B), whereas ACC-2 was much less sensitive, responding with an EC50 of 9.54 ± 0.11 μm and a Hill coefficient of 2.64 ± 0.08 (Fig. 2D). Oocytes injected with ACC-3 cRNAs exhibited a weak response (10–30 nA) to 1 mm ACh, and those injected with ACC-4 showed no response. An ACh-induced current was not detected in distilled H2O-injected or noninjected oocytes. Oocytes expressing ACC cRNAs did not respond to 1 mm GABA, glutamate, glycine, histamine, or dopamine (not shown). ACC-2-injected oocytes responded slightly to 1 mm serotonin (<2% of the maximal ACh response) and to octopamine (∼1%), but no response to these compounds was observed in oocytes expressing other ACC subunits. ACC-1, -2, and -3 share a proline-alanine motif of the second transmembrane domain (corresponding to the intermediate ring of nAChRs) that has been shown to confer anion selectivity in vertebrate GABA and glycine receptors (28Jensen M.L.

Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether ACC-1 and ACC-2 are also chloride channels, we generated I-V curves. The reversal potentials in ND96 for ACC-1 or ACC-2 homomeric channels were –18.7 ± 1.4 mV and –18 ± 1.6 mV, respectively, consistent with the equilibrium potential for chloride (Fig. 3, A and B) (31Weber W.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When the nonpermeant anion gluconate was substituted for chloride (7.6 mm final external chloride), there was a positive shift in the reversal potential of 65.7 mV (ACC-1) and 68.6 mV (ACC-2). In contrast, when arginine was substituted for sodium, the shift in reversal potential was negligible (Ereversal = –17.2 ± 1.7 mV, ACC-1, and –17.0 ± 1, ACC-2) (Fig. 3, B and C). We observed shifts of 59.8 ± 4.9 and 54.4 ± 3.7 mV in the reversal potential for a 10-fold change in chloride concentration for ACC-1 and ACC-2, respectively (Fig. 3C). This is in agreement with the theoretical shift of 58 mV predicted by the Nernst equation for chloride-selective channels. The Pharmacology of the ACC Channels Reflects a Unique Ligand-binding Site—The sequence identity between the ACCs and nAChRs in their extracellular ligand-binding domains is relatively low. More specifically, the six ligand-binding loops (A–F), as predicted from lineups with nAChRs, are not well conserved between nAChRs and the ACCs (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we predicted that the ACCs would have a unique pharmacological profile. We tested agonists and antagonists of vertebrate nAChRs on the ACC receptors. The classical nAChR agonist nicotine at 1 mm was a poor agonist of the ACC channels (Fig. 4A). At 0.5 mm, nicotine was a partial antagonist of ACC-1 but not ACC-2. Cytisine, another nAChR agonist, similarly acted as a weak agonist of ACC-2 channels and as an antagonist of both ACC-1 and -2. The highest potency antagonists had the rank order: d-tubocurarine (d-TC) ≥ strychnine > atropine > dihydro-β-erythroidine (dβe) > hexamethonium (C6) for ACC-1, and d-TC ≥ strychnine ≥ dβe > C6 for ACC-2 (Figs. 2 (E and F) and 4B). At 1 mm, C6 acted simultaneously as an agonist and an antagonist of ACC-1. Interestingly, 20 μm d-TC, a competitive antagonist of nAChRs and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors, blocked ACC-1 and -2 completely. Weak activation by nicotine and cytisine and block by strychnine, d-TC, and dβe are characteristic of the vertebrate α9 nAChR channels (32Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8198-8213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike these channels, ACC-1 and -2 were not blocked by α-bungarotoxin (α-BT). Although nicotinic agonists had little effect on ACC-1 and ACC-2, arecoline, an agonist of metabotropic ACh receptors, evoked a current that was 82–89% of the maximal ACh-elicited current (Fig. 2, A and C). Arecoline evoked a slowly desensitizing current in both the ACC-1- and ACC-2-expressing oocytes with an EC50 of 4.7 ± 0.11 and 754 ± 22 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, B and D). A rebound inward current was observed upon the removal of arecoline in both types of receptors, an indication of agonist-dependent open channel block (34Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 35Maconochie D.J. Knight D.E. J. Physiol. 1992; 454: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We noted that the estimated Hill coefficients for arecoline of 2.66 ± 0.23 and 1.59 ± 0.09 for the ACC-2- and ACC-1-expressing oocytes, respectively, are not significantly different from the Hill coefficients for the response to ACh, indicating a similar degree of cooperativity of ACh and arecoline. Atropine, a nonselective antagonist of metabotropic ACh receptors and a competitive antagonist of α9 nAChRs, activated the ACC-2 channel with an EC50 of 873 ± 63 μm with an estimated Hill coefficient of 0.98 ± 0.07 (Fig. 2D) but evoked only 43% of maximal ACh-elicited current. In contrast, we detected no atropine-evoked activation (up to 1 mm) of the ACC-1-expressing oocytes. Instead, atropine blocked the response of ACC-1 channels to 1 μm ACh with an IC50 of 23 μm (Fig. 2). Thus, the pharmacological profiles of ACC-1 and -2 support a distinct ACC ligand-binding site. ACC-3 and ACC-4 May Form Obligate Heteromers—Because ACC-3 and ACC-4 do not respond robustly to ACh as homomers, we considered the possibility that they form obligate heteromers with other ACh-gated chloride channel subunits. ACC-3 forms a functional heteromeric channel with ACC-1. Co-expression of ACC-1 + ACC-3 generated a channel that exhibited a pronounced desensitization compared with the ACC-1 homomer (Fig. 5AversusFig. 2A). Moreover, the response of ACC-1 + ACC-3-expressing oocytes to ACh was more than 200-fold less potent (EC50 = 39.6 ± 1.6 μm) than that of homomeric ACC-1 channels. The estimated Hill coefficient of 0.78 ± 0.02 indicates that the ACC-1 + ACC-3 heteromer has fewer ACh binding sites than the ACC-1 homomer (Fig. 5B). Coexpression of ACC-1 with ACC-4 did not change significantly the maximal response, EC50 (0.36 ± 0.02) or Hill coefficient (1.11 ± 0.07) relative to the ACC-1 homomer (Fig. 5B). Thus, there is no indication that ACC-4 interacts with ACC-1. Oocytes coexpressing the ACC-2 cRNA with the ACC-3 or ACC-4 cRNAs either exhibited a weak response of 50–60 nA to 1 mm ACh or did not respond, respectively (Fig. 5C); nor did ACC-2 + ACC-3- nor ACC-2 + ACC-4-expressing oocytes respond to 1 mm serotonin, GABA, glutamate, glycine, or histamine. Inhibition was specific for ACC-2, since ACC-3 and ACC-4 did not inhibit expression of a glutamate-gated chloride channel subunit, AVR-15, or expression of ACC-1 (Fig. 5C; see above). We interpreted this result as indicating that ACC-3 and -4 are able to assemble with ACC-2 in a heteromeric channel and interfere with its gating or trafficking. We have identified a new family of Cys loop LGICs, the nematode ACh-gated chloride channels. We report the first molecular characterization of an anion-selective ACh receptor and show that a distinct class of Cys loop LGICs has evolved to mediate inhibitory cholinergic neurotransmission. This is also the first evidence of ACh-gated chloride channels in nematodes and suggests that fast inhibitory cholinergic neurotransmission is more widespread in the animal kingdom than previously suspected. The ACh-gated chloride channel subunits in C. elegans belong to the superfamily of Cys loop ligand-gated ion channels. As such, we would predict that the ACC channels are pentameric. We showed that both ACC-1 and ACC-2 form homomeric channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes but also that ACC-1 interacts with ACC-3 and ACC-2 interacts with both ACC-3 and ACC-4. The interaction of ACC-1 with ACC-3 produces a channel that could function in vivo, albeit one with a lower sensitivity to ACh than the ACC-1 homomer. The interaction of ACC-2 with ACC-3 and -4 is more problematic, since these subunits appear to inhibit ACC-2. We suspect that these subunits assemble into heteromers but require additional subunits to form a functional channel. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, although capable of assembling into a heteromer, these subunits are prevented from doing so in vivo or that ACC-3 and -4 negatively regulate ACC-2. Determining which subunits are co-expressed in vivo will help resolve this issue. Finally, the ability of the ACC-3 and -4 to associate with ACC-1 and -2 is consistent with the proposition that the ACCs constitute a family of ACh-gated chloride channel subunits. One of the most unusual features of these channels is the association of gating by ACh with anion selectivity. We can point to a clear structural motif that accounts for the anion selectivity. The M2 transmembrane domains line the pore of the channel and determine ion selectivity (30Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). At the cytoplasmic end of this domain is a Pro-Ala-Arg motif that is found in most anion channels in C. elegans. Similar motifs are found in vertebrate channels, and site-directed mutagenesis of this motif has confirmed its importance in determining anion selectivity in GABAA and glycine receptors (28Jensen M.L.

Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The other striking property of the ACCs is their unusual ligand binding site. The sequences of ACC-1 and ACC-2 subunits differ substantially from both nematode and vertebrate nAChRs in their extracellular ligand-binding domains (Fig. 1B, data not shown). Photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis studies (36Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), confirmed by analysis of the crystal structure of acetylcholine-binding protein (37Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), have identified residues that define the ACh binding site at the interface of two subunits. Residues on one side of the (+)-subunit (the α subunit in nAChRs) contribute loops A, B, and C. Residues on the other side of the adjacent (–)-subunit (γ and δ in nAChRs) contribute loops D, E, and F, which form the complementary part of the binding pocket. However, even the loops forming the ligand-binding pocket are not conserved between the ACCs and the nAChRs (Fig. 1B). Most notably, the adjacent cysteines of the C loop, a hallmark of the ligand-binding nAChR α subunits, are absent from the ACCs. Thus, ACCs may have evolved the ability to bind ACh independently of the nAChRs. The unusual pharmacological profiles of the ACC subunits support a unique acetylcholine-binding site. That nicotine, the defining agonist of nAChRs, and cytisine, a related agonist, are weak agonists and/or antagonists of ACC-1 and -2 distinguishes the ACCs from most nicotinic receptors. The weak nicotine response is not, however, unique. The C. elegans levamisole receptors (nAChRs) are insensitive to nicotine, and it has been shown that C. elegans has both nicotine-sensitive and -insensitive cation-selective ACh receptors (38Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Moreover, nicotine and cytisine are antagonists of the vertebrate α9 nAChRs (33Verbitsky M. Rothlin C.V. Katz E. Elgoyhen A.B. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). More surprising is that arecoline is an efficient agonist of both ACC-1 and -2, although with substantially lower affinity than ACh. Arecoline has been postulated to act on cation-selective nematode and insect LGICs, so this sensitivity to arecoline may be a common feature of invertebrate ACh receptors (39Garcia L.R. Mehta P. Sternberg P.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40Tribut F. Duval A. Lapied B. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 186: 325-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, α-BT, which is selective for vertebrate α7 and α9 nAChRs in the central nervous system and the nAChRs of the neuromuscular junction, does not block the ACC channels. α-BT binds primarily to the C loop in nAChRs (41Harel M. Kasher R. Nicolas A. Guss J.M. Balass M. Fridkin M. Smit A.B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Katchalski-Katzir E. Sussman J.L. Fuchs S. Neuron. 2001; 32: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of effect on ACC channels presumably reflects the inability of α-BT to bind the ACC subunit's divergent C loop sequences. Are the Aplysia ACh-gated ion channels orthologs of the ACCs? There are pharmacological similarities that suggest they might be (3Kehoe J. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8198-8213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the two Aplysia channels identified desensitized slowly, a characteristic of ACC-1 homomers and ACC-1/ACC-3 heteromers. Nicotine and cytisine were also poor agonists of the slowly desensitizing Aplysia channel. Potencies of the antagonists for nematode and mollusk receptors were in the same range. However, Aplysia receptors appear to have an EC50 for ACh of >100 μm. Perhaps most importantly, the Aplysia channels were blocked by α-BT, indicating that they share a much greater similarity to the nicotinic receptors, at least in the C loop, than do the ACC subunits. Ultimately, whether the Aplysia channels evolved independently will have to be determined by sequence analysis. Economically important antiparasitic nematocides target Cys loop LGICs. Levamisole is an agonist of a subset of nicotinic-type acetylcholine receptors (42Harrow I.D. Gration K.A.F. Pest. Sci. 1985; 16: 662-672Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and ivermectin activates glutamategated chloride channels (12Cully D.F. Vassilatis D.K. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Van der Ploeg L.H. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Both drug targets have properties that are unique to nematodes, making it possible to create drugs that are relatively ineffective agonists of homologous channels in the vertebrate host. The levamisole receptors are most similar to the vertebrate nicotine-sensitive nAChRs (α1–6) in sequence but are not nicotine-sensitive, whereas glutamate-gated chloride channels are not found in vertebrates (38Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Since ACCs are also not found in vertebrates, they are promising targets for the development of highly specific nematocides. We thank E. Cooper for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2050256043,"The successful replication of a viral pathogen in a host is a complex process involving many interactions. These interactions develop from the coevolution of pathogen and host and often lead to a species specificity of the virus that can make interspecies transmissions difficult. Nevertheless, viruses do sporadically cross species barriers into other host populations, including humans. In zoonotic infections, many of these interspecies transfer events are dead end, where transmission is confined only to the animal-to-human route but sometimes viruses adapt to enable spread from human to human. A pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a foreign host. The viral pathogen must enter the host cell, replicate with the assistance of host factors, evade inhibitory host products, exit the first cell and move on to the next, and possibly leave the initial host and transmit to another. Each of these stages may require adaptive changes in the pathogen. Although the factors that influence each stage of the replication and transmission of most agents have not been resolved, the genomics of both hosts and pathogens are now at hand and we have begun to understand some of the molecular changes that enable some viruses to adapt to a new host."
https://openalex.org/W2098106677,"PTEN is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor in malignancies. Interestingly, some malignancies exhibit undetectable PTEN protein without mutations or loss of PTEN mRNA. The cause(s) for this reduction in PTEN is unknown. Cancer cells frequently exhibit loss of cadherin, β-catenin, α-catenin and/or vinculin, key elements of adherens junctions. Here we show that F9 vinculin-null (vin–/–) cells lack PTEN protein despite normal PTEN mRNA levels. Their PTEN protein expression was restored by transfection with vinculin or by inhibition of PTEN degradation. F9 vin–/– cells express PTEN protein upon transfection with a vinculin fragment (amino acids 243–1066) that is capable of interacting with α-catenin but unable to target into focal adhesions. On the other hand, disruption of adherens junctions with an E-cadherin blocking antibody reduced PTEN protein to undetectable levels in wild-type F9 cells. PTEN protein levels were restored in F9 vin–/– cells upon transfection with an E-cadherin-α-catenin fusion protein, which targets into adherens junctions and interacts with β-catenin in F9 vin–/– cells. β-Catenin is known to interact with MAGI-2. MAGI-2 interaction with PTEN in the cell membrane is known to prevent PTEN protein degradation. Thus, MAGI-2 overexpression in F9 vin–/– cells restored PTEN protein levels. Moreover, expression of vinculin mutants that reinstated the disrupted interactions of β-catenin with MAGI-2 in F9 vin–/– cells also restored PTEN protein levels. These studies indicate that PTEN protein levels are dependent on the maintenance of β-catenin-MAGI-2 interaction, in which vinculin plays a critical role."

Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, most ALS cases show no genetic linkage, but ∼10% of patients have a hereditary background.

ALS2 encodes not only a large protein called alsin long form (alsinLF) but also alsin short form, an alternatively spliced short form (Fig. 1A).

Patients with a C-terminally truncated alsinLF show a variety of infantile-onset motoneuronal disorders, including ALS, which involves both upper and lower motor neurons, and hereditary spastic paraplegia, which involves only upper motor neurons. Motifs in the primary sequence of alsinLF including three GEFs and membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) are thought to be related to signal transduction, protein sorting, and membrane localization (Fig. 1A). The variety and the degree of loss of these functions due to frameshift probably give rise to a variety of pathophysiological disorders in alsin-related motor neuron diseases. We recently demonstrated that alsinLF has neuroprotective activity specifically effective against SOD1 mutant-induced cytotoxicity (11Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Detailed characterization has indicated that the RhoGEF domain is essential and sufficient for alsinLF-mediated neuroprotection. Considering that RhoGEF is a kind of GTPase regulator that activates Rho-family small G proteins by accelerating the reaction exchanging GDP for GTP, alsinLF-mediated neuroprotection against toxicity by SOD1 mutants has been hypothesized to be mediated by the RhoGEF activity of alsinLF, although target Rho family proteins of alsinLF remain unidentified. Rho family proteins are classified into several major subfamilies such as Rho, Rac, or Cdc42. Rho family proteins play a number of important roles in cell biology including cellular polarity, morphology, chemotaxis, invasion, cell division, cell transformation, metastasis, and cell survival (12Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 420: 629-635Crossref Scopus (3861) Google Scholar). Especially, it has been generally known that Rho family proteins become pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic, depending on the cellular conditions and the cell types. Although there still remain many uncharacterized mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities of Rho family proteins, several studies have identified pathways leading to cell death or cell survival. Upon stimulation of specific signals, different Rho family proteins might trigger different apoptotic pathways, which have been shown to be partially mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor κB (13Aznar S. Lacal J.C. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Fas stimuli induce apoptosis via Rho family proteins (14Subauste M.C. Von Herrath M. Benard V. Chamberlain C.E.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24612-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Rho-GEF domain of alsinLF has the guanine nucleotide exchanging activity for Rac1 in Sf9 insect cells, although the functional consequence of activation of Rac1 by the RhoGEF domain of alsinLF has not been assessed (22Topp J.D. Gray N.W. Gerard R.D. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24612-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It remains completely unknown whether Rac1, activated by the RhoGEF domain of alsinLF, acts as an effector for alsinLF-mediated protection against SOD1 mutant-induced neuronal cell death. Moreover, even if this is the case, it should be assessed whether Rac1 is the sole mediator for alsinLF-mediated protection of SOD1 mutant-induced neuronal cell death. In this study, we dissected the precise mechanism underlying neuroprotection by alsinLF against SOD1 mutant-induced neurotoxicity. We demonstrated that alsinLF is a Rac1-specific RhoGEF. Most importantly, Rac1, activated by the RhoGEF activity of alsinLF, plays a critical role in alsinLF-mediated neuroprotection against toxicity by SOD1 mutants. We further showed that alsinLF protects neuronal cells via the PI3K/Akt3 pathway. DNA Constructs—The full length of alsinLF cDNA was constructed as described previously (11Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). T701A-alsinLF, alsinLF with an amino acid substitution of alanine for threonine at the amino acid 701 position, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a sense primer (CTCCACGAGTTAGCTACTGCAGAAAGACGATTC) and an antisense primer (GAATCGTCTTTCTGCAGTAGCTAACTCGTGGAG). Several expression vectors encoding human Rho family proteins such as pEX-V-myc-G12V-Rac1 (constitutively active Rac1), pGEX-2T-RhoA, pGEX-2TK-Rac1, and pGEX-2TK-Cdc42, were kind gifts of Dr. Shu Narumiya at The University of Kyoto (Kyoto, Japan). A human RhoB cDNA, a human Rac2 cDNA, and a human Rac3 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. Harry Mellor at The University of Bristol (Bristol, UK), Dr. Gary Bokoch at The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA), and Dr. Nora Heisterkamp at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA), respectively. A human RhoC cDNA was PCR-amplified from cDNAs isolated from the frontal lobe of a human brain cerebrum (BioChain, Hayward, CA) with a sense primer (CGGGATCCATGGCTGCAATCCGAAAGAAGC) and an antisense primer (GGAATTCTCAGAGAATGGGACAGCCCC). A human RhoG cDNA was obtained from a human frontal lobe cDNA library (BioChain) by PCR with a sense primer (CGGGATCCATGCAGAGCATCAAGTGCGTG) and an antisense primer (GGAATTCTCACAAGAGGATGCAGGACC). cDNAs for RhoB, RhoC, RhoG, Rac2, and Rac3 were subcloned into the pGEX vector to produce recombinant proteins. cDNAs encoding Rab5A, Rab5B, and Rab5C were provided by the UMR cDNA Resource Center (www.cdna.org) and subcloned into the pGEX vectors. Dominant-negative and constitutively active mutants of a human Akt1 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. Yukiko Gotoh at University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan). Mouse Akt1 and Akt2 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. Satoru Sumitani at The University of Osaka (Osaka, Japan). Human and mouse Akt3 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Brian A. Hemmings at The Friedrich Miescher Institut (Basel, Switzerland). Referring to the structure of the constitutively active human Akt1, we constructed a constitutively active mutant of human Akt3 by PCR with a sense primer (GGAATTCACCATGGGGAGTAGCAAGAGCAAGCCTAAGGACCCCAGCCAGCGCAGCGAGGAGGAAGAGATGGATGCCTC) and an antisense primer (GGGGTACCTTCTCGTCCACTTGCAGAGTAG) to delete the N-terminal PH domain and add a myristoylation site to its N terminus. Plasmid-based Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Gene silencing was performed according to a plasmid-based siRNA method (23Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E.B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Plasmid vectors encoding siRNAs were constructed as follows. Two oligonucleotides consisting of a sense fragment and an antisense fragment were synthesized by Invitrogen. Two oligonucleotides were annealed in vitro, and the resultant double-stranded DNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI-KpnI site of a pRNA-U6.1/Shuttle vector (Genscript, NJ). For silencing of endogenous gene expressions in NSC34 cells, a sense fragment (CGGGATCCCGTTCAGGATACCACTTTGCACGTTGATATCCGCGTGCAAAGTGGTATCCTGAATTTTTTCCAAGGTACCCC) and an antisense fragment (GGGGTACCTTGGAAAAAATTCAGGATACCACTTTGCACGCGGATATCAACGTGCAAAGTGGTATCCTGAACGGGATCCCG) for mouse Rac1, a sense fragment (CGGGATCCCGTCAATCGTATCCTTGTCATCATTGATATCCGTGATGACAAGGATACGATGATTTTTTCCAAGGTACCCC) and an antisense fragment (GGGGTACCTTGGAAAAAATCAATCGTATCCTTGTCATCACGGATATCAATGATGACAAATACGATTGACGGGATCCCGG) for mouse Rac3, a sense fragment (CGGGATCCCATAGTGGCACCATCCTTGATC TTGATATCCGGATCAAGGATGGTGCCACTATTTTTTTCCAAGGTACCCC) and an antisense fragment (GGGGTACCTTGGAAAAAAATAGTGGCACCA TCCTTGATCCGGATATCAAGATCAAGGATGGTGCCACTATGGGATCCCG) for mouse Akt1, a sense fragment (CGGGATCCCGTAATCGAAGTCATTCATGGT CTTGATATCCGGACCATGAATGACTTCGATTATTTTTTCCAAGGTACCCC) and an antisense fragment (GGGGTACCTTGGAAAAAATAATCGAAGTCA TTCATGGTCCGGATATCAAGACCATGAATGACTTCGATTACGGGATCCCG) for mouse Akt2, and a sense fragment (CGGGATCCCGTACATCTTGCCAGTTTACTCCTTGATATCCGGGAGTAAACTGGCAAGATTATTTTTTCCAAGGTACCCC) and an antisense fragment (GGGGTACCTTGGAAAAAATACATCTTGCCAGTTTACTCCCGGATATCAAGGAGTAAACTGGCAAGATGTACGGGATCCCG) for mouse Akt3, were used.

NSC34 cell is a hybrid cell line of motor neurons derived from embryonic mouse spinal cord cells and mouse neuroblastoma with a number of characteristics for primary cultured motor neurons, including generation of action potential, acetylcholine synthesis, storage, and release. For transient transfection, NSC34 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 7 × 104 cells/well and cultured in 10% FBS, DMEM for 12–16 h and then transfected with a vector or vectors encoding alsinLF or other genes by lipofection (1 μg DNA, 2 μl of Lipofectamine, 4 μl of PLUS Reagent) in the absence of serum for 3 h. Lipofectamine and PLUS Reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. Transfected NSC34 cells were incubated with DMEM plus 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours after the onset of transfection, their culture media were changed to DMEM plus N2 supplement (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated for additional 48 h. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cell mortality was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay performed as follows. Cells were suspended by gentle pipetting, and 50 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma) was mixed with 200 μl of the cell suspension (final concentration 0.08%) at room temperature. Stained cells were counted within 3 min after the mixture with the trypan blue solution. 100 cells/well were counted for each trypan blue exclusion assay. Mortality of cells was then determined as a percentage of trypan blue-stained cells in total cells. Therefore, cell mortality determined by this method represents the population of dead cells in total cells, including both adhesive and floating cells, at the termination of experiments. It has been established by our previously reported experiments that our cell mortality determined with the trypan blue exclusion assay displays precisely reciprocal results to the WST-8 assay, the most established cell viability assay (11Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The WST-8 assay was performed with 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8) using Cell Counting kit-8 (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Osaka, Japan). Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were suspended by gentle pipetting. One-tenth volume (100 μl) of the cell suspension was incubated with 10 μl of WST-8 solution in a 96-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C. Absorbance of the samples at the 450-nm wavelength was measured by a Wallac 1420 ARVOsx Multi Label Counter. Real-time PCR—To confirm the gene-silencing effect of siRNA, we performed real-time PCR to assess the amount of endogenous mRNA of Rac1, Rac3, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. NSC34 cells were transfected with pRNA-U6.1/Shuttle-siRNA for Rac1 (siRac1), siRac3, siAkt1, siAkt2, and siAkt3 as described above. Transfection efficiency was estimated to be about 70% (11Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested for RNA extraction with ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized using Sensiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen, Germany) with 0.5 μg of total RNA. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) followed by analysis with ABI PRISM7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Five sets of primers, consisting of a sense primer (GTCCCAATACTCCTATCATCCTC) and an antisense primer (GAGCACTCCAGGTATTTGACAG) for mouse Rac1, a sense primer (CCACACACACCCATCCTTCTG) and an antisense primer (GCACTCCAGGTACTTGACGG) for mouse Rac3, a sense primer (CACGCTACTTCCTCCTCAAG) and an antisense primer (CTCTGTCTTCATCAGCTGGC) for mouse Akt1, a sense primer (CCTTCCATGTAGACTCTCCAG) and an antisense primer (CCTCCATCATCTCAGATGTGG) for mouse Akt2, and a sense primer (CATAGGCTATAAGGAGAAACC) and an antisense primer (TTGGATAGCTTCCGTCCAC) for mouse Akt3, were synthesized. Sense and antisense primers for mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, respectively. The data analyses were performed using Sequence Detection System software Version 1.9.1 (Applied Biosystems). To adjust the expression level of each mRNA, that of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as an internal control. Pull-down Assays—For bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-fused Rho family proteins or GST-fused Rab5 family proteins, the pGEX vector or pGEX vectors encoding Rho family proteins including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoG, Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, and Cdc42, and a dominant-negative Rac1 (dnRac1) or Rab5 family proteins including Rab5A, Rab5B, and Rab5C were introduced into Escherichia coli. Expressions of GST, GST-Rho family proteins, or GST-Rab5 family proteins were induced by incubating with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. Bacterial cells, centrifuged and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, were lysed with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and sonicated in the presence of Triton X-100 (final 0.1%). GST-Rho family proteins or GST-Rab5 family proteins were then precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 6 h. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. To remove preloaded nucleotides, GST-Rho family proteins or GST-Rab5 family proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with cell lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors) plus 10 mm EDTA at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin-containing phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed with cell lysis buffer A. To prepare cell lysates containing alsinLF or T701A-alsinLF for pull-down assays, NSC34 cells, seeded at 7 × 105 cells/dish in a 10-cm culture dish, were transfected with 10 μg of plasmids encoding alsinLF or T701A-alsinLF. Cells were cultured in 10% FBS-DMEM for 48 h after transfection and then harvested for lysis with the cell lysis buffer A. After a cycle of freeze-thaw was performed, lysates were centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Supernatants were then precleaned with recombinant GST beads at 4 °C for 3 h. Precleared cell lysates (100 μg/sample) were incubated with 10 μl of GST-beads or GST-Rho family beads or GST-Rab5 family beads for 30 min at room temperature. Beads were then washed four times with the cell lysis buffer before immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc antibody. To detect activated Rac1 (GTP-Rac1), activated Cdc42 (GTP-Cdc42), and activated RhoA (GTP-RhoA), we performed a pull-down assay as follows. Chinese hamster ovary cells, seeded onto 10-cm dish at 4 × 106 cells/dish 12–16 h before transfection, were transfected with the pEF1/MycHis vector, pEF1/MycHis-alsinLF, and pEF1/MycHis-T701A-alsinLF. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0% TritonX-100, protease inhibitors, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). After sonication for a few seconds, cell lysates were centrifuged. Precleared lysates were then mixed and incubated with agarose beads conjugating the GST-tagged p21 binding domain of human PAK1 (GST-PBD) or the GST-tagged Rho binding domain of mouse Rhotekin (GST-RBD) (Upstate Biotech. Charlottesville, VA) for 45 min at 4 °C. GTP-Rac1/GTP-Cdc42 were precipitated with the former beads, whereas GTP-RhoA was precipitated with the latter beads. The beads were then washed three times with the lysis buffer B before immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA. Establishment of NSC34 Cell Line Stably Expressing Human Akt3— NSC34 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(–)/MycHis-wild-type human Akt3 (wthAkt3) and cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, and 1 mg/ml of G418 sulfate (Sigma). After a 2-week culture, G418-resistant colonies were collected, and single cell clones were obtained by limited dilution (NSC34-wthAkt3). Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates (20 μg/lane) or pulled-down precipitates were subject to SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection of Myc-tagged proteins, membranes were probed with the primary anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by visualization of the immunoreactive bands with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of endogenous Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA, membranes were probed with the primary anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-Cdc42 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or rabbit anti-RhoA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and the secondary antibodies HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (Bio-Rad) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Bio-Rad). For detection of actin, amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), SOD1, presenilin1 (PS1), or presenilin2 (PS2) membranes were probed with rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-APP monoclonal antibody (22C11) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-human SOD1 monoclonal antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), rat anti-PS1 antibody (Chemicon), or rabbit anti-PS2 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). His6/Xpress-tagged α-synuclein was detected with anti-Xpress (Invitrogen) antibody or HRP-conjugated anti-HisG antibody (Invitrogen). For detection of Myc/His6-tagged Akt1 derivatives and Myc/His6-tagged Akt3, membranes were probed with anti-Myc antibody or anti-His6 antibody. For detection of HA-tagged mouse Akt i"

A cellular receptor through which T2-TrpRS exerts its anti-angiogenic activity has not previously been identified. Here T2-TrpRS was shown to bind at intercellular junctions of endothelial cells (ECs). Using genetic knock-outs, binding was established to depend on VE-cadherin, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule, which is selectively expressed in ECs, concentrated at adherens junctions, and is essential for normal vascular development. In contrast, T2-TrpRS binding to EC junctions was not dependent on platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule type-1, another adhesion molecule found at EC junctions. Pull-down assays confirmed direct complex formation between T2-TrpRS and VE-cadherin. Binding of T2-TrpRS inhibited VEGF-induced ERK activation and EC migration. Thus, a VE-cadherin-dependent pathway is proposed to link T2-TrpRS to inhibition of new blood vessel formation.

T2-TrpRS inhibited several additional EC responses to the mechanical force of shear stress including endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activation, shear stress-induced gene expression, and cell alignment (13Tzima E. Reader J.S. Irani-Tehrani M. Ewalt K.L. Schwartz M.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14903-14907Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). While the protein binds specifically to the ends of newly formed vessels, the connection of this binding to the inhibition of angiogenic signal transduction pathways remains unknown. To further elucidate the mechanism of T2-TrpRS, we sought to identify the EC target responsible for the potent anti-angiogenic activity. Cell Culture, Shear Stress, and Transfections—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l -glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator at 37 °C. VE-cadherin–/– and VE-cadherin RC were prepared as described (14Lampugnani M.G. Zanetti A. Breviario F. Balconi G. Orsenigo F. Corada M. Spagnuolo R. Betson M. Braga V. Dejana E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1175-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 5 μg/ml EC growth serum, and 100 μg/ml heparin. PECAM-1–/–and PECAM-1 RC cells were prepared as described (15Wong C.W. Wiedle G. Ballestrem C. Wehrle-Haller B. Etteldorf S. Bruckner M. Engelhardt B. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3109-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM, 10% FBS, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l -glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, pyruvate, 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. For transfections, cells at ∼50% confluence in 60-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with the 0.5 μg of DNA using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, San Diego, CA). After 10 h in growth medium, cells were starved overnight in 0.5% serum prior to binding of T2-TrpRS. ERK Activation Assays—ERK activation was detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling); total ERK was detected using a polyclonal antibody against p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling). Fluorescence Microscopy—Alexa488-T2-TrpRS and Alexa546-T2-TrpRS were prepared using AlexaFluor protein labeling kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cell binding was performed by incubating Alexa488-T2-TrpRS or Alexa546-T2-TrpRS at 30 μg/ml for 15 min. Cells were fixed for 30 min in 2% formaldehyde, rinsed twice with PBS, and mounted in immunofluorescence mounting medium (ICN). Images of fixed cells were acquired using a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Following binding of T2-TrpRS, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1mm β-glycerophosphate). Samples (2 × 106 cells) were precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatant was then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose previously conjugated with anti-His Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Samples were washed three times in lysis buffer, and immune complexes were eluted in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with anti-VE-cadherin Ab (Alexis Biochemicals) and horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For direct binding of VE-cadherin to T2-TrpRS, a recombinant Fc/VE-cadherin chimera (Novagen) (1 μg/ml) was immobilized on magnetic anti-human IgG beads (50 μl) (Novagen) for 3 h at 4 °C and incubated with (30 μg/ml) T2-TrpRS for 3 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Flow Cytometry—Live cells were incubated with 30 μg/ml Alexa488-T2-TrpRS for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed twice with PBS. Cell surface-bound fluorescence was determined in a FACScan® flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), using CellQuest® software. Migration Assays—Migration assays were performed using The CHEMICON® QCM™ cell migration assay, based on the Boyden chamber principle. Briefly, BAECs that had been serum-starved were allowed to migrate using a chemotactic stimulus, VEGF165 (0.5 nm), for 6 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For inhibition assays, full-length TrpRS (1 μm) or T2-TrpRS (1 μm) was added 15 min before placement in the chamber. Migrated cells on the bottom of the insert membrane are dissociated from the membrane, lysed, and detected by the CyQUANTā GR dye. Binding of T2-TrpRS to Endothelial Cells—Previous studies identified T2-TrpRS as an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo, localizing it to blood vessels, and as an inhibitor of EC proliferation and migration in response to VEGF in vitro (4Wakasugi K. Slike B.M. Hood J. Otani A. Ewalt K.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Otani A. Slike B.M. Dorrell M.I. Hood J. Kinder K. Ewalt K.L. Cheresh D. Schimmel P. Friedlander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that T2-TrpRS was effective at inhibiting EC responses stimulated by either growth factors or mechanical stress (13Tzima E. Reader J.S. Irani-Tehrani M. Ewalt K.L. Schwartz M.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14903-14907Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating that T2-TrpRS may interrupt these signaling systems by acting on a point common to both mechanisms. Shear stress responses inhibited by T2-TrpRS included activation of intracellular signaling pathways involving ERK and Akt, gene expression, and cell alignment (13Tzima E. Reader J.S. Irani-Tehrani M. Ewalt K.L. Schwartz M.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14903-14907Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These fundamental activities, as well as those stimulated by growth factors, are needed during angiogenesis, and therefore, inhibition of EC responses to either VEGF or shear stress could explain how T2-TrpRS inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. Interestingly, BAECs that had been pretreated with T2-TrpRS and were subjected to long periods of shear stress failed to align their stress fibers in the direction of flow (13Tzima E. Reader J.S. Irani-Tehrani M. Ewalt K.L. Schwartz M.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14903-14907Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Eventually cells detached from the substratum and their cell-cell contacts were visibly altered, compared with cells not treated with T2-TrpRS (13Tzima E. Reader J.S. Irani-Tehrani M. Ewalt K.L. Schwartz M.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14903-14907Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that the cellular target for T2-TrpRS was involved either directly or indirectly in cell-cell and cell-substratum contacts. Thus, we examined the specific binding of T2-TrpRS (Alexa488-T2-TrpRS) to live BAECs and localized it at foci near intercellular contacts (Fig. 1a). The binding was specific, as it was blocked by preincubation with unlabeled T2-TrpRS (Fig. 1a). The peripheral localization suggested that T2-TrpRS bound to a component of endothelial intercellular junctions. We examined binding to ECs with genetic knock-outs of two prominent cell junction proteins, vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PE-CAM-1), that modulate EC migration and angiogenesis. VE-cadherin is a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule, selectively expressed in ECs, that is concentrated at adherens junctions and is essential for normal vascular development (16Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F.

PE-CAM-1 is an Ig-family adhesion receptor found in EC junctions, but, unlike VE-cadherin, PECAM-1 is not localized in adherens junctions (17Lu T.T. Yan L.G. Madri J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11808-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18DeLisser H.M. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Strieter R.M. Burdick M.D. Robinson C.S. Wexler R.S. Kerr J.S. Garlanda C. Merwin J.R. Madri J.A. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 671-677PubMed Google Scholar). Alexa488-T2-TrpRS failed to bind mouse ECs lacking VE-cadherin (VE-cadherin–/–). Reintroduction of the VE-cadherin gene (VE-cadherin RC) restored binding. In contrast, no difference in T2-TrpRS binding was seen using PECAM-1 null (PECAM-1–/–) or reconstituted (PECAM-1 RC) ECs (Fig. 1b). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis confirmed that T2-TrpRS binding was VE-cadherin-dependent with ∼10-fold higher binding in all VE-cadherin containing cells (Fig. 1c). Thus, VE-cadherin, but not PECAM-1, was critical for binding of T2-TrpRS to ECs. T2-TrpRS Binds to VE-cadherin—At adherens junctions, VE-cadherin interacts with three armadillo proteins, β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120. Phosphorylation of VE-cadherin regulates the composition of these junctional complexes and release of β-catenin may contribute to cell signaling as it is a transcription cofactor in the Wnt pathway (19Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). VE-cadherin also acts as a scaffolding protein able to associate dynamically with vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor (VEGFR2) and to promote its signaling (reviewed in Ref. 20Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). In several studies the association of proteins to VE-cadherin has been monitored through immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (21Grazia Lampugnani M. Zanetti A. Corada M. Takahashi T. Balconi G. Breviario F. Orsenigo F. Cattelino A. Kemler R. Daniel T.O. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 22Shay-Salit A. Shushy M. Wolfovitz E. Yahav H. Breviario F. Dejana E. Resnick N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9462-9467Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Weis S. Shintani S. Weber A. Kirchmair R. Wood M. Cravens A. McSharry H. Iwakura A. Yoon Y.S. Himes N. Burstein D. Doukas J. Soll R. Losordo D. Cheresh D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we examined whether T2-TrpRS could be used to isolate VE-cadherin from BAEC extracts. T2-TrpRS was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the His6-tag of recombinant T2-TrpRS and bound VE-cadherin was detected by Western blot. As a control another nonspecific antibody was used for immunoprecipitation of the complex (Fig. 2a). The result indicated that VE-cadherin coimmunoprecipitated with T2-TrpRS but not with nonspecific IgG. Because several proteins associate in adherens junctions, it was possible that T2-TrpRS binding to VE-cadherin was dependent on the presence of another junction component. To determine whether T2-TrpRS bounds directly to the extracellular domains of VE-cadherin in the absence of adherens junctions, a recombinant VE-cadherin/Fc chimera containing the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin immobilized on magnetic anti-human IgG beads was incubated with T2-TrpRS. As shown in Fig. 2b, T2-TrpRS bound to VE-cadherin immobilized beads. In contrast, T2-TrpRS did not bind to beads alone. Thus, the interaction between T2-TrpRS and VE-cadherin appeared to be direct. VE-cadherin Reconstitutes Binding of T2-TrpRS—The direct interaction of T2-TrpRS with VE-cadherin indicated that this junctional receptor was the essential endothelial-specific component that facilitated binding of T2-TrpRS to ECs. On this point, VE-cadherin is only expressed by ECs, suggesting that it exerts cell specific function. To test this hypothesis, we examined the binding of T2-TrpRS to a non-EC line, COS7, after transfection with VE-cadherin. COS7 cells lack VE-cadherin and as such do not bind T2-TrpRS. However, COS7 cells do contain a homologue N-cadherin, as well as catenins, which may provide an appropriate cellular context for overexpressing VE-cadherin. COS7 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for human VE-cadherin cDNA and GFP or were transfected with GFP plasmid alone. As shown in Fig. 2c, binding of Alexa546-T2-TrpRS to cells expressing VE-cadherin and GFP was observed. In contrast, cells expressing GFP alone showed no binding of T2-TrpRS. This result showed that the presence of VE-cadherin on the cell surface allowed COS7 cells to bind T2-TrpRS. Inhibition of Angiogenesis Signaling—Angiogenesis involves a complex series of events including the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis of capillary ECs (24Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1102-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To show that the binding interactions of T2-TrpRS to ECs directly inhibit angiogenesis, we examined the transduction of two well characterized angiogenesis-related signals. VEGF activates specific intracellular survival pathways in ECs including ERK activation. Increased phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK was observed after 10 min of exposure to VEGF; importantly T2-TrpRS down-regulates VEGF-induced ERK activation in BAECs (Fig. 3a). T2-TrpRS also inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF-induced migration of ECs. As shown in Fig. 3b, T2-TrpRS inhibited VEGF-stimulated BAEC chemotaxis, whereas full-length TrpRS had no effect. Conclusions—The absence of VE-cadherin or blocking of its adhesive activity prevents a normal organization of new vascular structures (16Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F.

The identification of VE-cadherin as a target for T2-TrpRS explains for the first time how the anti-angiogenic activity of T2-TrpRS is transduced through the inhibition of EC signaling in response to growth factors and shear stress. VE-cadherin has a well established, fundamental role in the growth, survival, and function of normal and pathological tissues (24Carmeliet P. Nat.

During angiogenesis, vascular ECs form capillaries (29Ausprunk D.H. Folkman J. Microvasc. Res. 1977; 14: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 30Hashimoto H. Ishikawa H. Kusakabe M.

In point of fact, targeted inactivation of the VE-cadherin gene caused lethality in mice at 9.5 days of gestation due to vascular insufficiency (16Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F.

In VE-cadherin–/– mice, ECs undergo apoptosis and lose the capacity to activate Akt in response to the survival signal of the VEGF (16Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V.

The TGF-β/SMAD pathway is a major regulator of collagen production in connective tissue. Reduced expression of SMAD7 has been reported in TGF-β-mediated fibrotic diseases, characterized by overproduction of collagen. Solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation reduces collagen production by fibroblasts in human skin in vivo. We have investigated regulation of Smad7 gene expression by UV irradiation in human skin fibroblasts. UV irradiation transiently increased SMAD7 mRNA and protein levels. Induction of SMAD7 mRNA and protein was maximal within 5 h and returned to initial basal levels 24 h post-UV irradiation. UV irradiation induced Smad7 promoter-reporter activity 3-fold. The Smad7 promoter contains functional enhancer sequences that bind transcription factors SMAD3 and activator protein-1 (AP-1). UV irradiation reduced protein binding to the Smad3 enhancer and increased binding to the AP-1 enhancer. Deletion of the AP-1 binding site in the Smad7 promoter completely abolished UV stimulation of SMAD7 transcription. Deletion of the Smad3 element had no effect on UV irradiation-induced promoter activity. UV irradiation increased mRNA and protein expression of the AP-1 family members, c-Jun and c-Fos, which bound to the AP-1 element in the Smad7 promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative c-Jun substantially reduced UV irradiation induction of SMAD7 transcription.

Expression of SMAD7 is inducible by TGF-β itself, and this induction plays a critical role in negative feedback mechanisms that regulate TGF-β/Smad-mediated biological responses (7Hayashi H.

Aberrant expression of SMAD7 disrupts the delicate balance inherent in TGF-β/SMAD signaling and thereby alters TGF-β-dependent cellular responses (2Varga J.

For example, the level of SMAD7 expression is reportedly reduced in the fibrotic disease scleroderma (14Dong C. Zhu S. Wang T. Yoon W. Alvarez R. ten Dijke P. White B. Wigley F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3908-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This reduction could permit unrestrained activation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway, resulting in excessive production and deposition of collagen, which is observed in this disease (14Dong C. Zhu S. Wang T. Yoon W. Alvarez R. ten Dijke P. White B. Wigley F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3908-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Conversely, SMAD7 is reportedly overexpressed in inflammatory bowel disease (15Monteleone G. Kumberova A. Croft N. McKenzie C. Steer H. MacDonald T. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This overexpression could down-regulate TGF-β-mediated immunosuppression, resulting in hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which is observed in this disease. We have reported previously that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induces SMAD7 in human skin in vivo and that this induction contributes to impairment of TGF-β/SMAD signaling (16Quan T. He T. Kang S.

We observed that UV irradiation induces SMAD7 in both the outer compartment (epidermis) and inner compartment (dermis) of human skin (16Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Investig.

In the outer compartment of skin, TGF-β is a powerful negative regulator of cell (keratinocyte) proliferation (13He W. Li A. Wang D. Han S. Zheng B. Goumans M.-J. ten Dijke P. Wang X.-J.

In the inner compartment of skin, TGF-β is a major regulator of extracellular matrix production and deposition by fibroblasts (2Varga J.

In dermal fibroblasts, impairment of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway causes reduced production of type I procollagen, thereby leading to loss of collagen (26Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Reduced collagen is a key factor in premature skin aging (photoaging), which is caused by UV irradiation (27Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 3: 61-68Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, induction of SMAD7, with concomitant reduction of TGF-β responsiveness, may be a key mediator of UV irradiation-induced skin cancer and photoaging. Accordingly, understanding mechanisms by which UV irradiation induces Smad7 gene expression is vital to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of these common diseases. The 5′-flanking region of the Smad7 promoter contains binding sequences for the transcription factors SMAD3, AP-1, and Sp-1 (28Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dyke P. Heldin C.-H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These regulatory elements and flanking sequences of the Smad7 gene promoter are highly conserved in human, rat, and murine genes (29Stopa M. Anhuf D. Terstegen L. Gatsios P. Gressner A. Dooley S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29308-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SMAD3, AP-1, and Sp-1 binding sequences are necessary for optimal induction of SMAD7 transcription by TGF-β (28Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dyke P. Heldin C.-H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Nagarajan R. Zhang J. Li M. Chen Y. J. Biol.

Disruption of the Smad3 element abolishes TGF-β inducibility but does not greatly impair basal expression. Disruption of the AP-1 and Sp-1 binding elements substantially impairs basal and TGF-β-stimulated Smad7 expression. Exposure of human skin in vivo to UV irradiation activates multiple cell surface cytokine and growth factor receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and rapidly induces transcription factor AP-1 activity (23Fisher G.J.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that AP-1 plays a major role in induction of Smad7 expression by UV irradiation. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the mechanism of Smad7 induction by UV irradiation. Our data demonstrate that the AP-1 family members c-Jun and c-Fos mediate activation of Smad7 transcription by UV irradiation in human skin dermal fibroblasts. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin solution, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The c-Jun and c-Fos antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and SMAD3 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA). The SMAD7 primary antibody was generously provided by Dr. Peter ten Dijke. The Smad7 promoter-reporter constructs were kindly provided by Rainer Heuchel. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and UV Irradiation—Human skin primary fibroblasts were prepared from a keratome biopsy of healthy adult normal human skin as described previously (34Fisher G.J. Esmann J. Griffiths C.E.M. Voorhees J.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cells used for this study were between passages 3 and 6. UV irradiation was performed as described previously (17Quan T. He T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 35Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 402-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells were exposed to UV irradiation (50 mJ/cm2) using an Ultralite Panelite lamp containing six FS24T12 UVB-HO bulbs (Daavlin, Byran, OH). A Kodacel filter was used to eliminate wavelengths below 290 nm (UVC). The irradiation intensity was monitored with an IL400A phototherapy radiometer and a SED240/UVB/W photodetector (International Light, Newbury, MA). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from cultured human skin fibroblasts was prepared using a commercial kit (RNeasy Midi kit, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Quan T. He T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (20 μg) was resolved by 1.2% agarose electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with Smad7 cDNA probes (17Quan T. He T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Each blot was stripped and rehybridized with the 36B4 internal control gene transcript to monitor the sample load in each lane. The intensities of each band were quantified by a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed as described previously (35Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 402-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PCR primers and probes were purchased from the Applied Biosystems custom oligonucleotide synthesis service. The c-Jun and c-Fos primers and FAM-labeled probes for real-time RT-PCR were as follows: c-Jun sense primer, 5′-CCTCAACGCCTCGTTCCT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TCAGGGTCATGCTCTGTTTCAG-3′; probe, 5′-CCGAGAGCGGACCTTATGGCTACAGTAACCCC-3′; c-Fos sense primer, 5′-GCCGAGCGCAGAGCATT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCCTTCGGATTCTCCTTTTCTC-3′; and probe, 5′-TCTTCTGGAGATAACTGTTCCACCTTGCC-3′. Primers and VIC-labeled probe for 36B4 were described previously (35Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 402-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Multiplex PCR reactions contained primers and probes for the target gene and 36B4. Target gene and 36B4 mRNA levels were quantified based on standard curves, and gene levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene 36B4 (a ribosomal protein used as an internal control for quantitation). Western Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Quan T. He T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins from whole cell extract were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) containing 5% milk. Primary antibodies were diluted in the PBST solution (1:1000) and incubated with a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed three times with the PBST solution and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBST, the blots were developed with ECF (Vistra ECF Western blotting system, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) following the manufacturer's protocol. The intensities of each band were quantified by a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistology—Immunohistology was performed as described previously (17Quan T. He T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 104) were plated on 8-well chamber slides and exposed to UV irradiation as described under “Cell Culture and UV Irradiation.” Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. The slides were preincubated with normal rabbit serum for 1 h. Subsequently the slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal antibody against Smad7. The slides were then incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min. The slides were then incubated with avidin-biotin peroxidase complex for 30 min. 3-Amino-9-ethyl carbazole (Sigma) was used as a chromogen. Between steps, the slides were rinsed for 10 min in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100. All sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (17Quan T. He T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using nuclear extracts from the human skin fibroblasts. Oligonucleotides for EMSA probes, designed from the Smad7 promoter, were as follows: Smad binding element (SBE) probe, 5′-TTTTAAAGCGACAGGGTGTCTAGACGGCCACG-3′; AP-1 binding element (AP-1E) probe, 5′-GGCCACGTGACGAGGCCGGAGCCGG-3′; SBE/AP-1E probe, 5′-TTTTAAAGCGACAGGGTGTCTAGACGGCCACGTGACGAGGCCG-GAGCCGG-3′. The SBE, AP-1E, and SBE/AP-1E probes were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). AP-1 consensus (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) and mutant (5′-CGCTTGATGACTTGGCCGGAA-3′) probes were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of cold competitors was preincubated with nuclear extract for 30 min on ice before the labeled probes were added. The gel was transferred to Whatman No. 3MM paper, vacuum-dried, and quantified by a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Coupled with Western Blot—The major shifted bands were excised from the EMSA gel, and then the proteins were extracted from the gel by incubation overnight at 37 °C in buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Gel debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was concentrated by Centricon-10 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The samples were then heated for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by Western blot. Transient Transfection of Smad7 Promoter-Reporter Construct and Luciferase Assays—Cells were transfected with wild-type Smad7 promoter/luciferase construct (-613 to +112) or deletion constructs in the binding sites of Smad3 and AP-1 (28Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dyke P. Heldin C.-H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the β-galactosidase expression vector to provide an internal standard for transfection efficiency. In some studies, the dominant negative mutant c-Jun (TAM-67) (36Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar) expression vector was transfected. All plasmids were transfected into dermal fibroblasts using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or the human dermal fibroblasts nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocols. After 24 h of transfection, cells were exposed to UV irradiation and harvested 24 h post-UV irradiation. Aliquots containing identical β-galactosidase activity were used for each luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was measured using an enhanced luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical Analysis—Comparisons among treatment groups were made with the paired t test (two groups) or the repeated measures of analysis of variance (more than two groups). Multiple pairwise comparisons were made with the Tukey's Studentized range test. All p values are two-tailed and considered significant when <0.05. UV Irradiation Increases SMAD7 mRNA and Protein in Human Skin Fibroblasts—We first determined the kinetics of induction of SMAD7 mRNA and protein in human skin fibroblasts by UV irradiation. UV irradiation transiently increased the levels of SMAD7 mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein (Fig. 1B). Induction of Smad7 mRNA was maximal 5 h post-UV irradiation and returned to the initial basal level by 24 h post-UV irradiation. Induction of the SMAD7 protein was maximal between 5 and 8 h following UV irradiation and returned to the basal level 24 h post-irradiation. Immunohistology revealed that the SMAD7 protein was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of untreated cells, and the SMAD7 protein increased in the cytoplasm 5–8 h post-UV irradiation (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that UV irradiation increases the levels of SMAD7 mRNA and protein in human skin fibroblasts. UV Irradiation Induces AP-1-dependent Smad7 Promoter Activity in Human Skin Fibroblasts—We next examined UV stimulation of Smad7 promoter activity. The Smad7 promoter/luciferase construct (-613 to +112) containing the Smad3, AP-1, and Sp-1 binding elements was transfected into skin fibroblasts, and reporter activity was determined following sham or UV irradiation. UV irradiation stimulated promoter activity 3-fold (Fig. 2). Deletion of the Smad3 element reduced basal and UV irradiation-stimulated reporter activity proportionally such that net induction by UV irradiation was not altered. Deletion of the AP-1 binding element also reduced basal reporter activity. However, in contrast to deletion of the Smad3 element, deletion of the AP-1 element abolished induction of reporter activity by UV irradiation. These data indicate that UV irradiation stimulates Smad7 promoter activity and that this stimulation is dependent on the presence of the AP-1 binding site in human skin fibroblasts. UV Irradiation Increases Protein Binding to the AP-1 but Not Smad3 Element in the Smad7 Promoter—We next examined protein binding to the Smad3 and AP-1 elements in non-irradiated and skin fibroblasts exposed to UV irradiation. EMSAs were performed using three probes with sequences identical to the Smad7 promoter. The SBE/AP-1E probe contained both the Smad3 and AP-1 elements; the SBE probe contained only the Smad3 element; and the AP-1E probe contained only the AP-1 binding element (Fig. 3A). Nuclear proteins from non-irradiated fibroblasts formed two major specific retarded complexes with the SBE/AP-1E probe (Fig. 3B). UV irradiation substantially increased the intensity of the upper retarded DNA-protein complex and reduced the intensity of the lower complex (Fig. 3B). The upper retarded DNA-protein complex was abolished by the excess unlabeled consensus AP-1 probe but not by the consensus SBE probe. In contrast, the lower complex was completely abolished by excess unlabeled consensus SBE but not consensus AP-1 probe (data not shown). These data indicate that the upper complex contains AP-1 family protein but not SMAD3 protein, and the lower complex contains SMAD3 protein but not AP-1 family protein. Nuclear proteins from non-irradiated cells formed a single retarded complex with the SBE probe (Fig. 3C). This single retarded DNA-protein complex migrated to the position of the lower band observed with the SBE/AP-1E probe (Fig. 3, B and C). UV irradiation reduced the intensity of the SBE complex similar to what was observed with the lower complex formed with the SBE/AP-1E probe (Fig. 3, B and C). The AP-1E probe formed a single specific retarded complex with nuclear proteins from non-irradiated fibroblasts (Fig. 3D). The migration of this complex was similar to the upper retarded band formed with the SBE/AP-1E probe (Fig. 3, B and D). UV irradiation increased the intensity of the AP-1 complex as was observed with the upper retarded band formed with the SBE/AP-1E probe (Fig. 3B). To confirm the specificity of the retarded complexes formed with the AP-1E probe induced by UV irradiation, we performed competition EMSA. DNA-protein complex formation with the labeled AP-1E probe was completely abolished by the excess unlabeled consensus AP-1 but not by the mutant AP-1 probe (Fig. 3E). To identify proteins bound to the SBE/AP-1E, SBE, and AP-1E probes, we performed supershifts using antibodies to SMAD and AP-1 family members. However, these experiments did not yield reproducible results. Therefore, we performed EMSA coupled with Western blot analysis for the identification of proteins bound to the probes. The upper retarded complex formed by cells exposed to UV irradiation with the SBE/AP-1E probe, the lower retarded complex formed by non-irradiated cells with the SBE/AP-1E probe, the complex formed by non-irradiated cells with the SBE probe, the complex formed by cells exposed to UV irradiation with the AP-1E probe, and equivalent gel areas from lanes without probes (used for control) were excised and subjected to SDS-PAGE immunoblotting with antibodies to c-Jun, c-Fos, and SMAD3 (Fig. 4). c-Jun and c-Fos were readily detected in the upper retarded complex (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2), and SMAD3 was detected in the lower retarded complex (Fig. 4, lane 3) formed with the SBE/AP-1E probe. The AP-1E probe bound c-Jun and c-Fos (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5) but not SMAD3 (data not shown), whereas the SBE probe bound SMAD3 (Fig. 4, lane 6) but not c-Jun or c-Fos (data not shown). No immunoreactivities were detected in extracts from the gel control lanes (data not shown). These data demonstrate that UV irradiation increases binding of c-Jun and c-Fos and reduces binding of SMAD3 to the Smad7 promoter. Overexpression of Dominant Negative c-Jun Abolished UV Irradiation-induced Activation of Smad7 Promoter—The data presented in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 indicate that AP-1 plays a major role in UV irradiation-induced Smad7 gene expression. To further substantiate this conclusion, UV irradiation-induced c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western analysis, respectively. UV irradiation-induced c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA (Fig. 5, A and C) within 2 h, and maximum induction of the c-Jun and c-Fos proteins (Fig. 5, B and D) was observed at 8 h post-UV irradiation in human skin fibroblasts. Finally, we utilized dominant negative mutant c-Jun to examine AP-1 function. As shown in Fig. 6, overexpression of dominant negative c-Jun reduced basal Smad7 promoter activity ∼50%. Importantly, induction of Smad7 promoter activity by UV irradiation was essentially abolished by overexpression of dominant negative c-Jun. These data demonstrate that induction of AP-1 by UV irradiation functions to induce Smad7 gene expression in human skin fibroblasts. SMAD7 functions as an endogenous negative feedback regulator of TGF-β/SMAD signaling to modulate the intensity and duration of TGF-β responses (7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.-Y.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic effect of SMAD7 on the TGF-β/SMAD pathway are relatively well characterized (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMAD7 stably interacts with the activated TGF-β receptor type I to prevent association and phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 and thus inhibits SMAD2 and SMAD3 nuclear translocation (7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.-Y. Grinnell B. Richardson M. Topper J. Grimbrone Jr., M. Wrana J. Falb D.

Furthermore, SMAD7 inhibits TGF-β responsiveness by promoting degradation of TGF-β receptor type I through recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase to the TGF-β receptor (37Kavsak P.

In addition to its inhibitory effects at the TGF-β receptor, SMAD7 can function as a transcription repressor in the nucleus by recruiting histone deacetylases to TGF-β/Smad target genes (41Bai S. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4176-4182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that exposure of human skin in vivo to solar simulated UV irradiation induces SMAD7 and impairs the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway (16Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 499-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Quan T. He T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26349-26356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that UV irradiation stimulates Smad7 promoter activity and that this activation is mediated by transcription factor AP-1, which is induced by UV irradiation, in human skin fibroblasts. The proximal promoter of the Smad7 gene contains binding elements for Smad3, AP-1, and Sp-1 (28Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dyke P. Heldin C.-H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The SMAD3 binding element is required for induction of Smad7 by TGF-β (30Nagarajan R. Zhang J. Li M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11320-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), whereas the AP-1 and Sp-1 binding elements cooperate to enhance SMAD3-dependent Smad7 gene expression (28Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dyke P. Heldin C.-H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here we provide several lines of experimental evidence that support the conclusion that AP-1 but not SMAD3 plays a critical role in activation of Smad7 promoter activity by UV irradiation (Figs. 2, 3, and 6). Interestingly, we found that UV irradiation reduced SMAD3 binding to its element in the Smad7 promoter. Inhibition of SMAD3 activation by UV irradiation may be mediated by several mechanisms. First, we have reported that UV irradiation down-regulates TGF-β receptor type II, which results in reduced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD3 in response to TGF-β (26Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Second, as shown here, UV irradiation induces SMAD7, which in turn interacts with TGF-β receptor type I to prevent association and activation of SMAD3. Third, it has been shown that c-Jun, which is induced by UV irradiation, is able to interact physically with SMAD3 and thereby suppress SMAD3-driven gene transactivation (42Verrecchia F. Pessah M.

UV irradiation activates multiple cell surface growth factor and cytokine receptors, which initiates intracellular signal transduction cascades (22Fisher G. Kang S. Varani J. Bata-Csorgo Z. Wan Y.

Nature. 1996; 379: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). These activated signaling cascades activate target transcription factors, including AP-1. We show here that UV irradiation induces c-Jun and c-Fos in human skin fibroblasts. A primary function of human skin fibroblasts is to produce type I collagen (and other extracellular matrix molecules), which is the major structural protein in skin connective tissue. This production of collagen by skin fibroblasts is strongly stimulated by TGF-β (26Quan T. He T. Kang S. Voorhees J. Fisher G. Am. J.

We have reported previously that UV irradiation reduces type I procollagen production in human skin in vivo and human skin fibroblasts (46Fisher G. Datta S. Wang Z. Li X. Quan T. Chung J. Kang S. Voorhees J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 661-668Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This inhibition is mediated in part by UV-irradiated induction of AP-1 (46Fisher G. Datta S. Wang Z. Li X. Quan T. Chung J. Kang S. Voorhees J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 661-668Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which has been shown to interfere with TGF-β-activated SMAD3 stimulation of type I procollagen promoter activity (45Chen S.J.

The data presented here strongly suggest that AP-1 represses type I procollagen production by a second distinct mechanism, which involves stimulation of Smad7 expression, which impairs TGF-β responsiveness. In addition to driving Smad7 expression, AP-1 drives induction of matrix metalloproteinases by UV irradiation (22Fisher G. Kang S. Varani J. Bata-Csorgo Z. Wan Y. Datta S. Voorhees J. Arch. Dermatol. 2002; 138: 1462-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 23Fisher G.J. Wang Z.Q. Datta S.C. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. N. Engl. J.

This degradation of skin collagen is a major cause of premature skin aging and promotes a tissue environment conducive to skin cancer (33Fisher G.J. Datta S.C. Talwar H.S. Wang Z.Q. Varani J. Kang S.

By inducing Smad7 expression, AP-1 can interfere with type I procollagen production and thereby exacerbate UV irradiation-induced degradation and loss of type I collagen.

https://openalex.org/W2112595206,"We have studied mechanisms of Akt-mediated phosphorylation and regulation of cellular localization of p27. Akt phosphorylates Thr-157 in p27 and retains it in the cytosol. In cells arrested in G1 and then synchronized to enter into S phase, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-157 p27 occurred in the cytosol during G1 phase of the cell cycle. Both T157A and S10A p27 mutants localized in the nucleus in all phases of the cell cycle regardless of the expression of active Akt. Thr-157 phosphorylation was undetectable in S10A-p27, suggesting that Ser-10 phosphorylation is required for p27 localization in the cytosol and subsequent phosphorylation at Thr-157. Phosphorylation at Thr-157 interrupted the association of p27 with importin α. A T157A-p27 mutant protein exhibited higher association with importin α than wild-type-p27. Treatment of transfected and endogenous p27 with alkaline phosphatase rescued its association with importin α. Leptomycin B inhibited cytosolic Thr-157 P-p27 staining, implying that CRM1-dependent nuclear export is required for Akt-mediated Thr-157 phosphorylation. Heterokaryon shuttling assays with NIH3T3 (mouse) cells transfected with FLAG-p27 and HeLa (human) cells revealed that both wild type and T157A-p27 shuttled from NIH3T3 to HeLa cell nuclei with similar frequencies. However, S10A-p27 was found only in the NIH3T3 nuclei of NIH3T3-HeLa cell fusions. These results suggest that 1) Ser-10 phosphorylation is required for nuclear export of p27, 2) subsequent Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-157 during G1 phase corrals p27 in the cytosol, and 3) Thr-157 phosphorylation inhibits the association of p27 with importin α thus preventing its re-entry into the nucleus.

Cell cycle progression is dependent on the activity of complexes containing cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk). 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; WT, wild-type; hKIS, human kinase-interacting stathmin; CIAP, calf intestine alkaline phosphates; FBS, fetal bovine serum; LMB, leptomycin B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; WT, wild-type; hKIS, human kinase-interacting stathmin; CIAP, calf intestine alkaline phosphates; FBS, fetal bovine serum; LMB, leptomycin B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin. The Cdk inhibitor p27 is an important regulator of the mammalian cell cycle (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar). p27 causes G1 arrest by inhibiting the activities of G1 cyclins and Cdks. An increase in p27 levels results in a delay of cell cycle progression, whereas a decrease in p27 promotes arrested cells to resume proliferation. The expression of p27 is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally. Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of Forkhead transcription factors were reported to decrease p27 gene transcription (2Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of p27 at Thr-187 results in complex formation with ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2 leading to 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of p27 in proliferating cells (3Montagnoli A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). During G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, p27 degradation can also occur independently of Thr-187 phosphorylation and binding to SCFSkp2 (5Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K. Hatakeyama S.

Devault A. Taviaux S. Fesquet D. Martinez A.M. Galas S. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3127-3138PubMed Google Scholar). The binding to and inhibition of Cdks in the nucleus by p27 is probably impaired (8Orend G. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in many human tumor cells where cytosolic redistribution of p27 has been observed (9Ciaparrone M. Yamamoto H. Yao Y.

Signoretti S. Chiaur D.S. Pagano M. Loda M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1730-1735PubMed Google Scholar).More recent evidence suggests that phosphorylation of p27 is an important determinant of its subcellular localization. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of p27 at Thr-157 results in retention of p27 in the cytosol (11Liang J. Zubovitz J. Petrocelli T. Kotchetkov R. Connor M.K. Han K. Lee J.H. Ciarallo S. Catzavelos C.

Expression of constitutively active mutants of Akt results in cytosolic localization of wild-type (WT) p27. However, a mutant p27 protein in which Thr-157 has been replaced with Ala shows nuclear localization regardless of high cellular Akt activity (11Liang J. Zubovitz J. Petrocelli T. Kotchetkov R.

Furthermore, high expression of active (phosphorylated) Akt in primary human breast cancers statistically correlates with localization of p27 in tumor cytosol (12Shin I. Yakes F.M. Rojo F. Shin N.Y. Bakin A.V. Baselga J. Arteaga C.L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Ser-10 is another major phosphorylation site in p27 (14Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and this modification is necessary for the nuclear export of the protein mediated by the exportin (15Ishida N.

The binding of p27 to CRM1 requires Ser-10 phosphorylation, as an S10A p27 mutant shows reduced association with CRM1, whereas phospho-mimicking p27 mutants in which Ser-10 has been substituted with aspartic acid (S10D) or glutamic acid (S10E) show a markedly enhanced interaction with CRM1 (15Ishida N.

Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition to point mutations in Ser-10, mutations in basic residues within the nuclear export sequence also impair p27 nuclear export, suggesting that export is mediated by the interaction of CRM1 with the atypical nuclear export sequence in p27 (17Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The kinase responsible for Ser-10 phosphorylation is human kinase-interacting stathmin (hKIS) (18Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The forced expression of hKIS reverses the cell cycle arrest induced by WT-p27 overexpression but not by S10A-p27, indicating that hKIS modulates cell cycle progression through Ser-10 phosphorylation and nuclear export (18Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).The macromolecular cargo transport between the nucleus and the cytosol is mediated by nuclear pore complexes. Mammalian nuclei typically contain several thousand nuclear pore complexes (19Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) each composed of proteins termed nucleoporins, which form a complex of around <125 MDa (20Doye V. Hurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Soluble transport receptors (karyopherins) that bind either the NLS or nuclear export sequence in cargo proteins can be classified into exportins and importins. The most widely characterized exportin is CRM1, which binds basic amino acid residues in the nuclear export sequence. Importin α recognizes NLS, and the association of the importin α-NLS complex with the nuclear pore complex is mediated by importin β (19Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 21Gorlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The C terminus of p27 contains a classical bipartite NLS consisting of an N-terminal cluster of three basic residues and a C-terminal cluster of two basic residues separated from each other by 10 amino acids (22Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). This NLS is thought to be responsible for p27 import into the nucleus (23Zeng Y. Hirano K. Hirano M. Nishimura J. Kanaide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The binding of NLS to importin α might be mediated by the ionic interaction between basic amino acid residues in the NLS and acidic residues in importin α (19Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar).We report herein that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of p27 at Thr-157 occurs in the cytosol during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Blockade of nuclear export with the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B eliminated detectable levels of cytosolic Thr-157 P-p27, implying that CRM1-dependent nuclear export is required for Akt-mediated Thr-157 phosphorylation in the cytosol. A T157A p27 mutant protein exhibited high association with importin α and exclusive nuclear localization, whereas p27 phosphorylation at this site prevented the association with importin α. The binding with importin α was dependent on Thr-157 dephosphorylation, because treatment with calf intestine alkaline phosphates (CIAP) restored the association of both transfected and endogenous p27 with importin α, although there was no effect of CIAP on the association between T157A-p27 and importin α. Co-expression of a vector encoding active Akt abrogated the association of WT-p27 with importin α. These results along with previous reports (15Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K.

In this mutant, Thr-308 and Ser-473 have been substituted with aspartic acid, resulting in a constitutively active Akt kinase (24Hutchinson J. Jin J. Cardiff R.D. Woodgett J.R. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The transfection of plasmids into cell lines was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. CIAP was purchased from Promega. Propidium iodide, polyethylene glycol 8000, leptomycin B (LMB), cycloheximide, and Hoechst 33342 were from Sigma. The protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science. Erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva) was provided by Dr. Mark Sliwkowski (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA).Cell Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (25Lenferink A.E. Busse D. Flanagan W.M. Yakes F.M. Arteaga C.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6583-6591PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets from a monolayer culture were incubated in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Cells were homogenized (Dounce, 30 strokes), and their nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 3500 rpm). The supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction, and nuclear pellets were incubated in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) for 1 min in a sonicating water bath. Prior to immunoblotting, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped in EBC lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture), and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C while rocking. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 12,000 rpm, 4 °C). Fifty μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (25Lenferink A.E. Busse D. Flanagan W.M. Yakes F.M. Arteaga C.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6583-6591PubMed Google Scholar) using the primary antibodies described below and horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). Antibodies used were as follows: monoclonal against importin α (karyopherin α/Rch-1, BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ), FLAG-M2 monoclonal (Sigma), p27, hemagglutinin (HA), tubulin 14-3-3 (H-8), and c-jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); total Akt, P-S473 Akt, and P-T308 Akt (Cell Signaling, Beverly MA);Texas Red-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG and Oregon Green-conjugated antibody against mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). A phospho-specific Thr-157 p27 antibody was a gift from Dr. Giuseppe Viglietto (Centro di Endocrinologia et Oncologia Sperimentale, Naples, Italy) (13Viglietto G. Motti M.L. Bruni P. Melillo R.M. D'Alessio A. Califano D. Vinci F. Chiappetta G. Tsichlis P. Bellacosa A. Fusco A. Santoro M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating 0.5–1 mg of total cell lysates with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma, 1:1 slush in PBS) was then added for 2 h at 4 °C while rocking. The precipitates were washed four times with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 6× Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. For studies involving phosphatase treatment, cells were lysed in CIAP buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). The lysates were treated with or without 200 units of CIAP at 37 °C for 1 h after which phosphatase inhibitors (Na3VO4 (1 mm) and NaF (50 mm)) were added.Cell Cycle Analysis—293T and BT-474 cells were synchronized in G1 phase of the cell cycle by serum starvation for 48 h. BT-474 cells were also treated with the erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib (3 μm) (26Hidalgo M. Siu L.L. Nemunaitis J. Rizzo J. Hammond L.A. Takimoto C. Eckhardt S.G. Tolcher A. Britten C.D.

At variable times after the addition of serum, cells were trypsinized, fixed with methanol, and their nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide as described (25Lenferink A.E. Busse D. Flanagan W.M. Yakes F.M. Arteaga C.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6583-6591PubMed Google Scholar). 2 × 104 propidium iodide-positive nuclei were gated and analyzed in a FACS/Calibur Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson).Immunofluorescence Staining—293T cells were seeded onto coverslips in 12-well plates at the density of 105 cells/well. On the next day, cells were transfected with 1 μg of FLAG-p27 with or without 1 μg HA-AktDD. Eighteen hours later, the cells were serum-starved for 48 h. FBS (10%) was added for 6–24 h, the time at which the monolayers were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (15 min), and blocked for nonspecific binding in PBS, 3% milk for 30 min. Subcellular localization of FLAG-p27 was monitored using a FLAG antibody (1:500) diluted in PBS, 1% milk. Expression of HA-AktDD was monitored with a polyclonal HA antibody (1:250). Endogenous Thr(P)-157-p27 in BT-474 cells was stained with a Thr(P)-157 p27 antibody (1:250) described above. Incubation with primary antibodies was for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, samples were treated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:250) or Oregon Green-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:250) for 30 min. For DNA staining, samples were incubated with Hoechst 33342 dye (1 μg/ml, 10 min) after incubation with secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence was monitored with a cooled digital CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Monmouth Junction, NJ) on a Zeiss Axiophot upright microscope.Heterokaryon Shuttling Assay—An interspecies heterokaryon shuttling assay was performed as described (28Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. On the next day, cells were transfected with 2 μg of FLAG-p27 with FuGENE 6 for 48 h. HeLa cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well on top of the NIH3T3 cells. Cell fusions were induced by the addition of 50% polyethylene glycol 8000 for 2 min. To block de novo protein synthesis, 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide was added for 5 min before the addition of polyethylene glycol. After a 1-h incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing cycloheximide, the samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (10 min). In some cases, LMB was added to the medium at 10 ng/ml immediately after seeding HeLa cells on top of NIH3T3 cells.RESULTSAkt Phosphorylates Cytosolic p27 on Thr-157 during G1 Phase—We first analyzed the spatial and temporal regulation of Akt-mediated phosphorylation of p27 in G1-arrested and cycling 293T cells (Fig. 1). Serum starvation for 48 h increased the 293T G1 fraction from 40 to 70%. Akt was predominantly localized in the cytosol throughout the cell cycle. At short intervals (5–30 min) after the addition of serum to G1-arrested cells, total Akt and Ser-473 P-Akt were detectable in 293T nuclear fractions. Ser-473 P-Akt was undetectable in serum-starved cells but was maximal 3–6 h after serum addition. p27 was found both in cytosol and the nucleus in asynchronous cultures, whereas serum-starved quiescent cells exhibited high p27 levels only in the nucleus. p27 translocated to the cytosol 1 h after serum addition reaching its maximal level in this compartment 6 h later in mid G1. Three to six hours after serum addition and when (cytosolic) P-Akt levels were maximal, levels of Thr(P)-157 p27 were also maximal. Phosphorylation of p27 in Thr-157 was only detectable in cytosolic fractions of 293T cells. Twenty-four hours after serum stimulation when cells have entered S phase, p27 was degraded consistent with reports of proteolytic degradation of p27 in cycling cells (29Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar).Similar results were obtained with erbB2-overexpressing BT-474 human breast cancer cells induced into quiescence by serum starvation and treatment with the erbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib. P-Akt and Thr(P)-157 p27 were detectable in asynchronous cell cultures but undetectable in quiescent cells (Fig. 2A). Upon serum addition and release from G1, P-Akt and Thr(P)-157 p27 content as monitored by immunohistochemistry increased with similar kinetics achieving a maximum in mid-to-late G1 phase of the cell cycle. Immunofluorescence staining of synchronized cultures showed minimal P-Akt and Thr(P)-157 p27 staining of quiescent BT-474 cells and a time-dependent increase upon serum addition at 5 h (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that temporal and spatial phosphorylation of p27 in Thr-157 correlate with the cellular distribution of Akt and its activation.Fig. 2Time course of Akt and p27 phosphorylation in BT-474 cells.A, BT-474 cells were synchronized by serum starvation and incubation with 3 μm erlotinib for 48 h. At this time, improved minimal essential medium, 10% FBS was added. Cells were then harvested at the indicated times and subjected to flow cytometry as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” The percentage of cells in G1,S,andG2M phases of the cell cycle at different times following serum addition are indicated on top. Cell lysates (30 μg/lane) were subjected to immunoblot analyses with the antibodies indicated on the right of each panel. B, simultaneously, BT-474 cells on coverslips were induced to undergo cell cycle arrest (as in Fig. 2). At 48 h, 10% FBS was added to induce the progression into S phase. At the indicated times following serum addition, the cells were fixed and stained with P-Akt and Thr(P)-157 p27 antibodies as well as Hoechst nuclear dye.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ser-10 Phosphorylation Is Required for p27 Cytosolic Localization and Its Phosphorylation at Thr-157—To further document that phosphorylation of p27 in Thr-157 occurs in the cytosol, FLAG-WT-p27, FLAG-T157A-p27, and FLAG-S10A-p27 were expressed in 293T cells and examined during cell cycle progression. WT-p27 localized in both cytosol and nuclei of asynchronous 293T cells. In quiescent cells WT-p27 was almost exclusively localized in the nucleus with cytosolic FLAG-WT-p27 levels markedly increasing 6 h after the addition of serum (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Co-transfection of activated Akt markedly increased FLAG-WT-p27 cytosolic levels throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8). Both FLAG-T157A-p27 and FLAG-S10A-p27 were exclusively nuclear in 293T cells in the presence or absence of transfected active Akt, suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser-10 is also required for cytosolic localization of p27 and phosphorylation at Thr-157. Consistent with this possibility, Thr-157 phosphorylation was detectable in transfected wild-type p27 but it was almost undetectable in pull downs of the S10A p27 mutant (Fig. 3B). Finally, treatment of BT-474 cells with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export, abrogated cellular levels of Thr(P)-157 p27 (Fig. 3C), implying that nuclear export of p27 is required for Thr-157 phosphorylation.Fig. 3Phosphorylation of p27 on Thr-157 occurs in the cytosol.A, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-WT-p27, FLAG-T157A-p27, or FLAG-S10A-p27 either with or without HA-AktDD. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved (ss) for 48 h. To release cells into S phase, synchronized cells were treated with 10% FBS and harvested 6 or 24 h after as indicated. Both cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to FLAG immunoblot analysis. Tubulin and c-jun (cytosolic and nuclear markers, respectively) immunoblots confirmed there was no significant cross-contamination between cytosolic and nuclear fractions. B, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged WT-, T157A- or S10A-p27 for 48 h. FLAG-p27 was precipitated from 500 μg of whole cell lysates and subjected to Thr(P)-157 p27 and FLAG immunoblot analyses. C, BT-474 cells on coverslips were treated with LMB at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 2.5 h, fixed, and stained with a Thr(P)-157 p27 antibody or Hoechst dye.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results shown in Fig. 3A were confirmed by immunolocalization studies. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-WT-p27, FLAG-T157A-p27, and FLAG-S10A-p27, each with or without constitutively active HA-AktDD and subjected to staining with FLAG antibodies. FLAG staining was observed in the cytosol and nuclei of asynchronous 293T cells transfected with FLAG-WT-p27. Serum starvation resulted in nuclear localization of WT-p27, which translocated to the cytosol 6 h after the addition of serum (Fig. 4A). At 24 h, there was a 70% reduction in FLAG-positive cells (data not shown) consistent with p27 degradation during S phase. Expression of HA-AktDD resulted in cytosolic localization of WT-p27 in serum-starved cells and in cycling cells at 6- and 24-h post-serum addition. Staining with an HA antibody indicated that the active Akt mutant was predominantly localized in the cytosol. This result agrees with the localization of endogenous activated Akt in 293T cell fractions (shown in Fig. 1A). Both T157A-p27 and S10A-p27 were exclusively nuclear throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 4,"
https://openalex.org/W1974483793,"We previously demonstrated that the human calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is allosterically activated by l-amino acids (Conigrave, A. D., Quinn, S. J., and Brown, E. M. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 4814–4819). However, the domain-based location of amino acid binding has been uncertain. We now show that the Venus Fly Trap (VFT) domain of CaR, but none of its other major domains, is required for amino acid sensing. Several constructs were informative when expressed in HEK293 cells. First, the wild-type CaR exhibited allosteric activation by l-amino acids as previously observed. Second, two CaR-mGlu chimeric receptor constructs that retained the VFT domain of CaR, one containing the extracellular Cys-rich region of CaR and the other containing the Cys-rich region of the rat metabotropic glutamate type-1 (mGlu-1) receptor, together with the rat mGlu-1 transmembrane region and C-terminal tail, retained amino acid sensing. Third, a CaR lacking residues 1–599 of the N-terminal extracellular head but retaining an intact CaR transmembrane region and a functional but truncated C terminus (headless-T903 CaR) failed to respond to l-amino acids but retained responsiveness to the type-II calcimimetic NPS R-467. Finally, a T903 CaR control that retained an intact N terminus also retained l-amino acid sensing. Taken together, the data indicate that the VFT domain of CaR is necessary for l-amino acid sensing and are consistent with the hypothesis that the VFT domain is the site of l-amino acid binding. The findings support the concept that the mGlu-1 amino acid binding site for l-glutamate is conserved as an l-amino acid binding site in its homolog, the CaR. We previously demonstrated that the human calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is allosterically activated by l-amino acids (Conigrave, A. D., Quinn, S. J., and Brown, E. M. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaR, calcium-sensing receptor; mGlu-1, metabotropic glutamate type-1; VFT, Venus fly trap; T903 CaR, CaR truncated after residue 903.1The abbreviations used are: CaR, calcium-sensing receptor; mGlu-1, metabotropic glutamate type-1; VFT, Venus fly trap; T903 CaR, CaR truncated after residue 903. plays a key role in the regulation of whole body calcium metabolism. In keeping with this, the CaR-null mouse exhibits loss of feedback control of parathyroid hormone secretion, hyperparathyroidism, and a metabolic bone disease (2Ho C. Conner D.A. Pollak M.R.

Furthermore, inactivating and activating mutations of the receptor in humans have been shown to induce various disorders of calcium metabolism (for review, see Ref. 3Hofer A.M. Brown E.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar).Although the CaR is a key molecular regulator of whole body calcium metabolism, it presents something of a conundrum. It is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, including tissues such as the brain, that are not clearly involved in calcium metabolism. Furthermore, its closest relatives in molecular terms are members of sub-group C of the G protein-coupled receptors, receptors for specific amino acids such as l-glutamate (mGlus) and glutamate analogs, e.g. GABA. The large extracellular heads of these receptors are related to nutrient-sensing, bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins (4Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The finding that the CaR is allosterically activated by a broad spectrum of l-amino acids, including aromatics such as l-Phe and l-Trp and aliphatic and polar amino acids such as l-Ala and l-Ser, has the effect of drawing it closer functionally to other members of subgroup C (1Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, the site of amino acid binding has been unclear. A site-directed mutagenesis study implicated a role for a triple serine motif (Ser-169/Ser-170/Ser-171) in the VFT domain (5Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in an analysis of CaR mutants, differential effects of the type-II calcimimetic NPS R-467, whose binding site lies in the transmembrane region of the receptor, and the aromatic amino acid l-Phe indicated that their binding sites were distinct (6Zhang Z. Jiang Y. Quinn S.J. Krapcho K. Nemeth E.F. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33736-33741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In the current study, we have evaluated the domain-based requirements for amino acid sensing using chimeric receptors devised by domain swapping between two receptor homologs, the human CaR, which responds to Ca2+ and aromatic and aliphatic amino acids, and the rat mGlu-1, which responds to l-glutamate. Functional analysis of three key chimeric receptor constructs (listed as VFT/Cys-rich region/transmembrane domain+C-tail), including CaR/CaR/mGlu-1, CaR/mGlu-1/mGlu-1, and –/–/T903 CaR constructs together with two controls, the wild-type CaR and T903 CaR, indicates that the VFT domain alone is required for amino acid sensing. Thus, the VFT domain of CaR is the likely site of l-amino acid binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) containing the wild-type human calcium-sensing receptor (cassette version, Ref. 7Bai M.

Nakanishi (Kyoto University, Japan). DNA ligase and restriction enzymes BspE1, NotI, SpeI, XbaI, XhoI, and ApaI were obtained from New England Biolabs. PCR reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange™ kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pGEM T-Easy (Promega) was used to subclone the “headless” PCR product.Construction of hCaR, Rat mGlu-1 Chimeric Receptors—The two chimeric constructs studied (in the format VFT domain/Cys-rich region/transmembrane region+C-tail) were CaR/CaR/mGlu-1 and CaR/mGlu-1/mGlu-1. A CaR/CaR/mGlu-1 chimera encoded a protein containing the VFT and Cys-rich regions of hCaR (residues 1–598) fused to the transmembrane region plus cytoplasmic tail of the rat mGlu-1α (residues 579–1199). Its construction has previously been described in detail (8Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N. Hung B.C. Simin R.T. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 642-648PubMed Google Scholar).CaR/mGlu-1/mGlu-1 was designed to encode a protein that contained the hCaR VFT domain (residues 1–540) with the rat mGlu-1 Cys-rich region, transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic tail (residues 524–1199). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce BspE1 restriction enzyme sites at residues 522 of rmGluR1α and 541 of CaR/CaR/mGlu-1. A second BspE1 site at amino acid 877 of the mGlu-1 sequence was removed by site-directed mutagenesis without disturbing the encoded peptide sequence prior to performing the above digestion and ligation reactions. The DNA fragments containing the bases encoding residues 1–540 of hCaR and 523–1199 of rmGluR1α, together with an interlinking single Gly residue, were then purified and ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) to create CaR/mGlu-1/mGlu-1. The junction was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Brisbane, Qld, Australia).Headless CaR Construct—A headless CaR deletion mutant elsewhere referred to as Rho-C-CaR (9Zhao X.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) containing 20 amino acids of the N terminus of rhodopsin and amino acids 600–903 of the hCaR was constructed in pcDNA3.1 using PCR as described previously (9Zhao X.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sense primer was 100 nucleotides long, corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the N-terminal 20-amino acid signal peptide of bovine rhodopsin and nucleotide positions 1797–1832 of the hCaR (GenBank™ 20759). The antisense primer was a 46-base oligonucleotide that corresponded to CaR nucleotides 2667–2709. The PCR product encodes a protein in which the bovine rhodopsin signal peptide is fused to Ala-600 of the CaR sequence and the CaR is truncated after Gly-903. The construct lacks the VFT domain of CaR and retains just 12 residues at the C-terminal end of the Cys-rich region of CaR on the C-terminal side of the bovine rhodopsin signal peptide. The PCR product was subcloned into NotI- and XbaI-digested pcDNA3.1 via the pGEM T-Easy Vector System 1 (Promega). DNA sequencing confirmed successful construction of Rho-C-hCaR (Australian Genome Research Facility).Wild-type CaR Truncated after Residue 903—As a control for the headless construct described above, the wild-type receptor was also truncated after residue 903. This pcDNA 3.1 construct was made using XhoI and ApaI restriction enzymes to generate a 450-bp fragment from a XhoI restriction site at nucleotide 534 of the headless-T903 construct to an ApaI restriction site just beyond the 3′-end of the insert (nucleotide 997 of the empty vector, pcDNA3.1+). This fragment was then ligated into the wild-type CaR construct that had been predigested with XhoI and ApaI. Both sites occur uniquely in the human wild-type CaR construct in pcDNA3.1(+). The accuracy of the junctions was confirmed by DNA sequencing as described above.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange™ kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers of 25–35 bases was designed for each mutagenesis with the mutation placed at the middle of the primers (sequences of primers available from authors on request). The template hCaR in pcDNA3.1(+) was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with these primers for 12–16 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer). After digestion of the template DNA with DpnI (New England Biolabs), the amplified mutant DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α or XL1-Blue). The incorporation of the desired mutations and absence of other mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility).Transient Transfection of Wild-type, Mutants, and Chimeric Receptors in HEK293 Cells—Transfection-grade DNA was prepared using the High-speed™ midi kit (Qiagen). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. When the cells reached 90–95% confluence, they were transfected with wild-type CaR, mutant CaR, or chimeric expression constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen). A given amount of plasmid DNA was diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, mixed with diluted LipofectAMINE 2000™, and allowed to complex at room temperature for 20 min before being added to HEK293 cells in plates. For Fura-2 assays in the microscope format, transfections were performed in 6-well plates using 2–4 μg of DNA/well. For aequorin assays (see below), 150 ng of each expression construct was co-transfected with 150 ng of the pcAEQ reporter plasmid in 96-well plates as described previously (13Tan Y.M. Cardinal J. Franks A.H. Mun H.-C. Lewis N. Harris L.B. Prins J.B. Conigrave A.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Stable Expression of Wild-type, Mutants, and Chimeric Receptors in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were maintained in 25-cm2 culture flasks and transfected with 8 μg of the wild-type CaR, mutant CaR, or chimeric expression constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000™ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were transferred to 24-well plates and grown for a further 24 h. Selection of stable transformants was then carried out in the presence of 50–100 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) or 100–400 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Individual resistant clones were isolated 3 weeks later, screened by aequorin luminescence for activity, and subsequently studied by microfluorimetry using Fura-2.Detection of Changes in Cytoplasmic-free Ca2+Concentration—The aequorin luminescence screening assay used to identify CaR-expressing HEK293 cell clones for further analysis was performed as described previously (13Tan Y.M. Cardinal J. Franks A.H. Mun H.-C. Lewis N. Harris L.B. Prins J.B. Conigrave A.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For analysis of amino acid- and type-II calcimimetic-dependent activation of the CaR and CaR chimeras, changes in cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ concentration were determined by microfluorimetry after loading with Fura-2/AM. HEK293 cells that had been transfected with the wild-type CaR or one of the chimeric CaR constructs were cultured on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum in 6-well plates and loaded with Fura-2/AM (5 μm, 2 h; 37 °C) in physiological saline solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH, pH 7.4), 0.1% d-glucose, bovine serum albumin 1 mg/ml. After 2 h the Fura-2-containing solution was removed, and the cells were resuspended in physiological saline solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Fura-2-loaded cells were transferred into a superfusion chamber and placed in the light path of a Nikon Diaphot microscope as described previously (14Bradbury R.A. McCall M.N. Brown M.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The control superfusion solution had the following composition: 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 0.2 or 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH), 0.1% d-glucose, pH 7.4. Excitation at alternating wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), detection of fluorescent light (F; peak 510 nm) and its digitized recording using Acqknowledge software for Macintosh was performed as described previously (14Bradbury R.A. McCall M.N. Brown M.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Data for cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ concentrations were expressed either as uncorrected excitation ratios (F340/F380) or converted to ionized Ca2+ concentration using a calibration procedure (14Bradbury R.A. McCall M.N. Brown M.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Curve Fitting and Statistical Analysis—The Ca2+ mobilization data were expressed as concentration-response curves and fitted to the following form of the Hill equation as shown in Equation 1R=b+(a−b)∗Cn/(en+Cn)(Eq. 1) where R = response; a = maximum response; b = basal response; C = extracellular Ca2+ concentration (in mm); e = EC50 (the concentration of Ca2+ that induced a half-maximal response), and n = Hill coefficient. Other data are routinely expressed as means ± S.E. (number of experiments).RESULTSEffects of l-Amino Acids and NPS R-467 on CaR-expressing HEK293 Cells—Two lines of HEK293 cells that stably expressed the wild-type human calcium-sensing receptor were studied. After Fura-2 loading, cells from both lines exhibited extracellular Ca2+-dependent intracellular Ca2+ mobilization that was allosterically activated by either l-amino acids or the type-II calcimimetic NPS R-467 (Fig. 1 and Table I). Exposure of Fura-2-loaded CaR-expressing HEK293 cells to both l-Phe (10 mm) and R-467 (5 μm) at high concentrations resulted in a small additional enhancement of the response (Fig. 1C). Characterization of the effects of various l- and d-amino acids was consistent with previous data (Table I) (1Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The constructs (listed in the form VFT domain/Cys-rich domain/Transmembrane domain+C-tail) were CaR/CaR/mGlu-1 and CaR/mGlu-1/mGlu-1. In both cases, HEK293 cells that stably expressed these constructs exhibited extracellular Ca2+-dependent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 and Table I). In addition, both receptor constructs were stereo selectively activated by l-amino acids (Fig. 2A and Table I), but not by the type-II calcimimetic NPS R-467 (see Fig. 2B for CaR/Glu/Glu data; CaR/CaR/Glu data not shown). Thus, replacement of the transmembrane domain of CaR with the mGlu-1 transmembrane domain resulted in loss of the receptor's response to type-II calcimimetics, but not l-amino acids. The selectivity for different l-amino acids (l-Phe >l-Ala >l-Glu >l-Arg >l-Leu) appeared to be identical for the wild-type and CaR/CaR/Glu and CaR/Glu/Glu chimeric receptor constructs (Table I).Fig. 2Effects of l-Phe and NPS R-467 on CaR/Glu/Glu chimeric receptor expressed in HEK293 cells.

(9Zhao X.M. Hauache O. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) described a functionally active headless CaR construct in which 599 of the 612 amino acid residues of the N-terminal extracellular domain (i.e. VFT and Cys-rich domains) were replaced with a much shorter N terminus containing the bovine rhodopsin signal peptide sequence. In addition, the C terminus of this headless construct was truncated after residue 903 to promote surface expression. This construct and a corresponding wild-type receptor construct that was also truncated after residue 903 were synthesized in the current study and used to further evaluate the hypothesis that the VFT domain of CaR is required for l-amino acid sensing.In transiently transfected HEK293 cells, cells transfected with vector alone exhibited a small concentration-dependent response to elevated Ca2+o that was sensitive to neither 10 mm l-Phe nor 5 μm R-467 (Fig. 3A). The maximal response in cells transfected with vector alone and in untransfected cells (not shown) was ∼15–20% of that observed in cells transfected with the wild-type CaR (Fig. 3B). The wild-type CaR, the CaR truncated after residue 903 (Fig. 3C, T903 CaR), and the headless-T903 CaR (Fig. 3D) all exhibited Ca2+o-dependent increases in cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ concentration when compared with cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Effects of l-Phe and NPS R-467 on a headless CaR construct. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the empty pcDNA 3.1 vector alone (A), the wild-type CaR (B), the wild-type CaR truncated after residue 903 (C), and a headless receptor construct (also truncated after residue 903) (D). The data are cumulative excitation ratios (Δ from baseline) expressed as a percentage of the maximal response observed for the wild-type CaR. The effects of 10 mm l-Phe, 1 μm R-467, 5 μm R-467, and the combinations of l-Phe and either 1 or 5 μm R-467 are shown. Open circles, control; filled circles, 10 mm l-Phe alone; open triangles, 1 μm R-467 alone; filled triangles, 1 μm R-467 plus 10 mm l-Phe; open squares, 5 μm R-467; filled squares, 5 μm R-467 plus 10 mm l-Phe. In panel D the open circles (control) are largely obscured by the filled circles (10 mm l-Phe).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The phenylalkylamine type-II calcimimetic, R-467, potentiated the responses of all three constructs, enhancing the receptors' sensitivities to Ca2+o. The finding that R-467 retains activity in the headless receptor is consistent with the idea that the transmembrane domain region of CaR contains binding sites for type-II calcimimetics (10Hauache O.M. Hu J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as Ca2+o (12Ray K. Northup J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, R-467 exhibited differential potencies on the control and headless constructs. Whereas 1 and 5 μm R-467 activated the wild-type CaR and T903 CaR, only 5 μm R-467 activated the headless-T903 CaR (Fig. 3D), indicating loss of potency.The headless-T903 CaR, unlike T903 CaR or the wild-type CaR, was insensitive to l-Phe at 10 mm (Fig. 3, B–D, and Table II) and up to 100 mm (not shown). In addition, l-Phe failed to promote the responses of the headless-T903 CaR to either 1 or 5 μm R-467 (Fig. 3D). Thus, the headless CaR retained sensitivity to R-467, albeit with moderately reduced potency, but was completely resistant to l-Phe at concentrations 100–1000 times its normal plasma concentration (1Conigrave A.D.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe current work has demonstrated that the VFT domain of CaR alone is required for l-amino acid sensing. Only the headless-T903 CaR exhibited absolute resistance to l-Phe at concentrations 100–1000-fold those found in plasma (1Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the selectivity of CaR for aromatic (l-Phe, l-His, l-Trp) and aliphatic (l-Ala), but not branched chain or charged amino acids (l-Leu, l-Arg), was unaffected by replacement of the extracellular Cys-rich region of CaR or its transmembrane region and C-terminal tail with the corresponding domains from the rat mGlu-1 receptor. The data clearly distinguish the domains that are required for sensing by l-amino acids and phenylalkylamine type-II calcimimetics, whose binding site has been localized previously to the transmembrane region (9Zhao X.M. Hauache O. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Hauache O.M. Hu J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).The finding that the VFT domain, and none of the other domains, is required for l-amino acid sensing does not, in itself, establish that amino acids bind there. Because the CaR forms functional homodimers (15Bai M. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), however, it is most likely that the l-amino acid binding site is located in the CaR's own VFT domain and not on a currently unrecognized accessory subunit. In addition, amino acid binding in the VFT domain provides a potential explanation for the observation that the l-amino acid and type-II calcimimetic binding sites are distinct and interacting (6Zhang Z. Jiang Y. Quinn S.J. Krapcho K. Nemeth E.F. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33736-33741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that alanine substitutions of the triple serine motif, Ser-169/Ser-170/Ser-171, in the VFT domain disable amino acid sensing (5Zhang Z.

Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite, is the etiological agent of the fatal form of human visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar (1Chang K.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. Suppl. 1983; 14: 267-305PubMed Google Scholar), affecting millions of people worldwide. In common with most trypanosomatids, Leishmania lack a complete heme biosynthetic pathway (2Sah J.F. Ito H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14902-14909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and must acquire heme from the external sources to sustain their growth (3Chang K.P. Trager W. Science. 1974; 183: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The majority of the heme in the host is sequestered in erythrocytes in the form of hemoglobin. Consequently, Hb-binding proteins have been identified in some pathogens, e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and so forth (1Chang K.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. Suppl. 1983; 14: 267-305PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen C. Sparling P.F. Lewis L.A. Dyer D.W. Elkins C. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5008-5014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jin H. Ren Z. Pozsgay J.H. Elkins C. Whitby P.W. Morton D.J. Still T.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3134-3141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, information is scanty regarding the role of these proteins in the physiology of these pathogens. Because such organisms often lack the ability for de novo biosynthesis of heme (6Wilson M.E. Britigan B.E. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Wandersman C. Stojiljkovic I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), it appears likely that these proteins may be involved in the internalization and subsequent intracellular degradation of Hb to generate heme, which is essential for their growth. Recently, we have shown that Hb endocytosis in Leishmania is mediated through a 46-kDa protein located in the flagellar pocket of Leishmania (8Sengupta S. Tripathi J. Tandon R. Raje M. Roy R.P. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and signals mediated through the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of this protein are essential for targeting the protein-bound Hb to the late compartment (9Singh S.B. Tandon R. Krishnamurthy G. Vikram R. Sharma N. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), probably to generate intracellular heme. Moreover, a few receptor systems have been identified on trypanosomatid parasites such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania that mediate the uptake of low density lipoprotein and transferrin, presumably for efficient supply of nutrients such as cholesterol and metal ions such as iron required for rapid growth (10Bastin P.

In the present investigation, we describe the purification and characterization of a 46-kDa HbR 1The abbreviations used are: HbR, hemoglobin receptor; HK, hexokinase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LSB, low salt buffer; BHb, biotinylated hemoglobin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. from the L. donovani promastigotes membrane to homogeneity. The sequence of the cloned HbR gene and its biochemical characterization reveal that HbR is a HK located in the flagellar pocket of Leishmania and is involved in Hb endocytosis.

Purification of HbR from Leishmania Promastigotes—Membrane fraction from L. donovani promastigotes was prepared as described previously (8Sengupta S. Tripathi J. Tandon R. Raje M. Roy R.P. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Mazumder S. Mukherjee T. Ghosh J. Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18440-18446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in hypotonic Tris-HCl buffer (5 mm; pH 7.2) and subsequently lysed by sonication (3 × 20 s). The unbroken cells and other cell debris were separated by low-speed centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min). The resultant supernatant was again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain membrane protein-enriched fraction. Finally, membrane proteins were extracted with PBS containing 2% β-octyl glucoside at 4 °C overnight and separated from residual debris by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. In order to enrich the 46-kDa HbR, membrane proteins (16 mg) were sequentially precipitated with 27% and 50% ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate obtained after 50% ammonium sulfate treatment was dissolved and dialyzed against a low salt buffer (LSB; 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitor). Subsequently, dialysate containing membrane proteins (8 mg) was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (LSB with 2 m urea) SP-Sepharose fast flow column and allowed to bind to the matrix. Unbound proteins were removed from the matrix by washing the column with 20 volumes of LSB. Finally, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of salt (50–700 mm NaCl in LSB), and different fractions were collected. The protein profile of each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. HbR-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against LSB. Detection of Hb Binding with HbR—Determination of Hb binding with HbR was carried out using biotinylated hemoglobin (BHb) by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (18Mukherjee K. Parashuraman S. Raje M. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23607-23615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ng of the native or recombinant HbR (10 μg/ml) was incubated in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of coating buffer (0.1 N sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9) to coat the plastic wells with the protein, and subsequently, wells were washed three times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer (PBST containing 2% gelatin). Wells were washed three times with PBST and incubated with different concentrations of BHb in 100 μl of PBS for 1 h at 37 °C to allow binding. To determine the binding of BHb, wells were washed and incubated with 100 μl (1 μg/ml) of avidin-HRP for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, unbound avidin-HRP was removed by washing with PBST, and the HRP activity present in each well was measured by a standard procedure (19Gruenberg J. Griffths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and expressed as relative binding of Hb with test protein. Similarly, binding of BHb with immobilized HbR was also determined in the presence of unlabeled Hb (10 μg). To determine the specificity, binding of BHb (25 ng) with immobilized HbR (500 ng) was carried out in the presence of 100-fold excess of different heme- or iron-containing proteins (2.5 μg) under similar conditions. Detergent Solubilization and Phase Separation of HbR—To determine whether the HbR in Leishmania is an integral membrane protein, membrane fraction was prepared (17Mazumder S. Mukherjee T. Ghosh J. Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18440-18446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to analytical phase separation in nonionic detergent Triton X-114 as described previously (20Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent to phase separation by Triton X-114, the distribution of HbR was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-HbR antibody. Cloning and Expression of HbR from L. donovani—The purified protein was subjected to tryptic digestion, and the peptides obtained were purified and sequenced by mass spectrometry in a commercial facility (W. M. Keck Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Virginia). Subsequently, BLAST analysis of peptides showed that peptides 17 and 14 have significant homology with the Leishmania major partial HK sequence reported in the GenBank™ data base with accession numbers AF202062 and AQ848098, respectively, and these peptides are located in the middle of the reported full-length HK sequence of Trypanosoma brucei (21Wilson M. Sanejouand Y.H. Perie J. Hannaert V. Opperdoes F. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Accordingly, forward and reverse primers were designed against peptide 17 (5′-GTGGATCCAGTGCCCTGGTTGGCGATGC-3′) and peptide 14 (5′-GTGAATTCCTTGGAGTCGAAGTTACCGCA-3′) and used to amplify an internal region of HbR by reverse transcription-PCR using L. donovani cDNA. Briefly, total RNA isolated from Leishmania promastigotes using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was used for cDNA synthesis using Super ScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, PCR was performed using the above-mentioned primers and Platinum HiFidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler for 30 cycles (denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 2 min). The 5′ end of the gene was amplified using a forward primer against the mini-exon (22Sinha K.M. Ghosh M. Das I. Dutta A.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) sequence (5′-CTCGGAATTCCAACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTCTGTACTTTATTG-3′) and a reverse primer against peptide 17 (5′-GTGAATTCATCGCCAACCAGGGCACT-3′) by PCR under similar conditions. Similarly, the 3′ end of the HbR gene was amplified using a 3′-RACE kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a forward primer designed against peptide 14 (5′-GTGGATCCGAGTGCGGTAACTTCGACTCC-3′) under identical conditions. The PCR products were cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using m13 universal primers in an automated sequencer. From the sequence of the 5′- and 3′-end fragments, the start and stop codons of the gene were identified. Subsequently, forward (5′-GTGGATCCATGGCCACCCGCGTGAAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTGAATTCCTACTTCTTGTTGACGGCCA-3′) primers designed against the start and stop codons, respectively, were used to amplify the open reading frame of the putative HbR from L. donovani cDNA by PCR under similar conditions. The full-length gene was cloned into pGEMT-easy vector (Promega), sequenced, subsequently subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and transformed into Escherichia coli. Transformed E. coli were grown in LB and induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and recombinant GST-HbR was purified by a standard procedure using reduced glutathione beads. Similarly, the full-length gene was also subcloned into pET 28a and pET 28b vectors (Novagen) and transformed into E. coli to produce recombinant protein with a His6 tag in either the N (His-HbR) or C terminus (HbR-His) of the HbR, respectively, according to manufacturer's protocol. Overexpression of HbR in Leishmania Promastigotes—To overexpress HbR in Leishmania promastigotes, pXG vector (23Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) was linearized by digestion with BamHI and subsequently partially digested with EcoRI, followed by ligation with BamHI-EcoRI-digested full-length HbR. Leishmania promastigotes were transfected with this construct using a standard protocol (24Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, Leishmania cells were grown to the late log phase (∼1.0 × 107 cells/ml) at 23 °C in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were resuspended at a density of 1.0 × 108 cells/ml in HEPES-buffered saline (21 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, and 6 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Cells (0.4 ml) were transferred to a pre-cooled electroporation cuvette, and an appropriate construct of chilled DNA (40 μg) was added, followed by electroporation using a GenePulser (Bio-Rad) to facilitate DNA uptake by cells. Cells were then incubated on ice for 10 min and transferred into drug-free medium for 30 h at 23 °C. Subsequently, stable clones were selected in the presence of G418 antibiotic (30 μg/ml). Overexpression of HbR was confirmed by Western blotting using specific antibody. Determination of Activity of HbR—HK activity of HbR was measured either from the respective recombinant HbR proteins (10 μg) or from the cell lysate (10 μg) prepared from the HbR-overexpressing Leishmania promastigotes using a coupled reaction as described previously (25Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2765-2771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Leishmania promastigotes overexpressing HbR were lysed by PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice and used in the HK assay. Briefly, HK activity was determined using standard reaction mixtures (0.6 ml) containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm glucose, 5.3 mm ATP, 0.72 mm NADP, and 2 units/ml Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (type XXIV from L. mesenteroides; Sigma). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μg of cell extract or recombinant HbR, and the initial velocity of NADP reduction (ϵNADPH = 6.22 × 106 cm-2) was measured at 30 °C as the change in absorbance at 340 nm at 30-s intervals. Protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Determination of Binding and Uptake of 125I-Hb by Leishmania— Hemoglobin binding and uptake by Leishmania were determined as described previously (8Sengupta S. Tripathi J. Tandon R. Raje M. Roy R.P. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hb was labeled with Na125I by iodine monochloride-catalyzed reaction, and >99% of the radioactivity was acid-precipitable with a specific activity of 165 cpm/ng Hb. To determine the inhibition of 125I-Hb binding with cells by indicated antibodies, cells (1 × 107) were washed and pre-incubated with serum containing the respective antibody (1:50) in RPMI 1640 in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 4 °C, and then cells were incubated at 4 °C with 6 μg/ml 125I-Hb. After 2 h, cells were washed to remove the unbound radioactivity. The cell pellet was finally dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH, and an aliquot was used to determine the cell-associated radioactivity. Similarly, cells were incubated at 23 °C with 1 μg/ml 125I-Hb for 4 h in the presence or absence of the same concentration of different fragments of the HbR to determine the uptake of Hb. Results were expressed as ng Hb bound/mg cell protein. Immunolocalization of HbR and Hb Binding in Leishmania—In order to localize Ld-HbR in Leishmania promastigotes, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with anti-Ld-HbR-ΔC antibody (1:50) for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS and probed with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C to detect the primary antibody binding sites. Promastigotes were pre-incubated with SYTO-14 for 30 min at 23 °C in PBS to label the nucleus. Slides were mounted with antifade reagents and viewed in a LSM 510 confocal microscope using an oil immersion objective. Purification of HbR from Leishmania Promastigote—To purify the 46-kDa HbR from Leishmania promastigote membrane, the 46-kDa membrane protein was enriched by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation (Fig. 1A, lane 4) and subsequently separated from other membrane proteins by ion-exchange chromatography. The results presented in Fig. 1B show that a ∼46-kDa protein from the membrane protein-enriched fraction specifically eluted from the SP-Sepharose column at salt concentrations of ∼140 to 190 mm (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–9). To determine the Hb binding ability of the purified 46-kDa protein eluted in fractions 5–7 (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–9), proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with BHb (10 ng/μl). Binding of Hb with purified proteins was detected by probing with avidin-HRP (1 ng/μl). The results presented in Fig. 1C demonstrate that the 46-kDa protein purified from Leishmania binds Hb. The amphiphilic nature of the Leishmania HbR was investigated by analytical phase separation of membrane proteins in the nonionic detergent Triton X-114 (20Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, Western blot analysis was carried out to check the distribution of HbR in detergent phase using a specific antibody. The majority of HbR was recovered in the detergent phase as shown in Fig. 1D. Specific Binding of Hb with Purified HbR from Leishmania—To determine the binding of Hb to the purified protein, the protein was immobilized and incubated with increasing concentrations of BHb (0–1 μg/ml) in 100 μl of phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.5). The binding of BHb with purified protein followed saturation kinetics, and maximum binding was observed with 50 ng of Hb (Fig. 2A). The half-maximal binding of BHb was achieved at 5 ng of the protein. Moreover, the binding of BHb with purified protein was effectively inhibited by unlabeled Hb (Fig. 2A), but not by various other heme- and iron-containing compounds, viz., hemocyanin, transferrin, α-globin, β-globin, and myoglobin (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that purified protein specifically binds Hb. Cloning and Expression of HbR from Leishmania—In order to clone HbR from Leishmania, the purified protein was subjected to tryptic digestion, and the peptides obtained were purified and sequenced by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, different sets of primers were designed based on the peptide sequences to amplify appropriate fragments from Leishmania cDNA. Thus, forward and reverse primers designed against peptides 17 and 14, respectively, were used to amplify a 482-bp internal fragment of HbR from Leishmania cDNA (Fig. 3B, lane 2). In Leishmania, the 5′ end of all mature mRNA is known to contain a conserved 35-nucleotide spliced-leader sequence called the mini-exon, as a consequence of trans-splicing (27Sutton R.E. Boothroyd J.C. Cell. 1986; 47: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Accordingly, using forward primer against the mini-exon and reverse primer against peptide 17, a 553-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′ end of the gene was amplified from Leishmania cDNA (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Finally, a 893-bp fragment corresponding to the 3′ end of the gene was amplified using a forward primer against peptide 14 and a reverse primer against the poly(A) tail by 3′-RACE (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Subsequently, putative start and stop codons were predicted from the 5′- and 3′-end fragments, respectively. Appropriate forward and reverse primers were designed and used to amplify the full-length (1416 bp) HbR gene from L. donovani cDNA (Fig. 3B, lane 5). The PCR product was cloned, sequenced, and hypothetically translated (471 amino acids). All peptides obtained from tryptic digestion of the purified native protein could be mapped into the cloned protein (Ld-HbR). Comparison of the Ld-HbR sequence with other HK sequences using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of conserved HK motifs in Leishmania HbR and revealed that the cloned protein has -79% homology with Trypanosoma, 46% with Entamoeba, 52% with yeast, and 49% with human HK (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, we have measured the HK activity of different Ld-HbR recombinant proteins (10 μg), e.g. GST-HbR, His-HbR, and HbR-His, with tag at either the C or N terminus of the protein. The results presented in Fig. 3D demonstrate that purified recombinant HbR with tag at either the C or N terminus shows significant HK activity. However, the apparent increase of HK activity with His-tagged HbR in comparison with GST-HbR is due to the higher molar substitution of HbR in His-HbR form. This is supported by the fact that an equimolar amount (313 nmol) of the indicated recombinant proteins shows similar HK activity (Fig. 3D, inset). The N Terminus of HbR Is Required for Hb Binding—The results presented in Fig. 4A show that both GST-HbR and His-HbR bind with Hb with similar kinetics, as observed with the protein purified from Leishmania promastigotes, and binding of Hb with GST-HbR is specifically competed by unlabeled Hb and commercially available yeast HK (Fig. 4A, inset). However, the apparent increase of Hb binding with His-HbR in comparison with GST-HbR is due to the higher molar substitution of HbR in His-HbR. In order to determine the Hb-binding region of the receptor, we have cloned and expressed different truncated forms of the receptor as GST fusion proteins: the N terminus (Ld-HbR-ΔC; amino acids 1–126), the middle region (Ld-HbR-ΔNC; amino acids 121–276), and the C terminus (Ld-HbR-ΔN; amino acids 270–471). Subsequently, these truncated proteins were used to determine their Hb binding ability. The results presented in Fig. 4B show that Hb predominantly binds to the N-terminal fragment (Ld-HbR-ΔC) in comparison with the C-terminal fragment (Ld-HbR-ΔN) of HbR. However, moderate binding of Hb was also observed with the middle fragment (Ld-HbR-ΔNC), suggesting that the Hb-binding site possibly straddles these two fragments. HbR from Leishmania Is a Hexokinase—In order to determine whether the HbR in Leishmania is a HK, we transfected Leishmania with the HbR gene and measured total HK activity associated with cell lysate. Accordingly, full-length HbR was overexpressed in Leishmania promastigotes using pXG vector, and stable clones were selected in the presence of G418 antibiotic. The overexpression of HbR in transfected cells in comparison with control cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the cell lysates using anti-HbR antibody (Fig. 5A, inset). Moreover, lysate prepared from cells overexpressing HbR showed significantly higher HK activity as compared with vector-transfected (control) Leishmania (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that HbR in Leishmania is a HK. In order to further explore the possibility that the HK present on the cell surface of Leishmania is HbR, binding of 125I-Hb (6 μg/ml) by Leishmania at 4 °C was determined in the presence of antibodies raised against the recombinant N-terminal (Ld-HbR-ΔC, amino acids 1–126) and C-terminal (Ld-HbR-ΔN) fragments of HbR. Western blot analysis show that anti-Ld-HbR-ΔC antibody specifically recognized the N-terminal fragment (Ld-HbR-ΔC) and full-length protein (HbR), but not the C-terminal fragment (Fig. 5B, inset). The results presented in the Fig. 5B shows that anti-Ld-HbR-ΔC specifically inhibits the binding of 125I-Hb, whereas no significant inhibition of binding was observed with anti-Ld-HbR-ΔN. Unlabeled Hb (600 μg/ml) was used as a positive control. Similarly, >50% of the uptake of 125I-Hb at 23 °C by Leishmania is inhibited specifically by full-length Ld-HbR and Ld-HbR-ΔC, but not by Ld-HbR-ΔN, further confirming the fact that the recombinant protein showing HK activity present on the Leishmania cell surface is involved in Hb binding through its N-terminal end (Fig. 5C). Localization of HbR on Leishmania Promastigotes—Because the N-terminal of HbR is the extracellular Hb-binding domain of the receptor, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the Ld-HbR-ΔC fragment that specifically recognized a 46-kDa protein from Leishmania promastigote lysate (data not shown). In order to localize Ld-HbR on Leishmania promastigotes, cells were washed and incubated with anti-Ld-HbR-ΔC antibody at 4 °C to determine the surface component. Confocal images presented in Fig. 6 show that the HbR in Leishmania is localized above the nucleus (Fig. 6d) and at the base of the flagellum (Fig. 6h), indicating their localization in the flagellar pocket. We have shown previously that endocytosis of Hb in Leishmania is mediated through a receptor present in the flagellar pocket (8Sengupta S. Tripathi J. Tandon R. Raje M. Roy R.P. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), possibly to generate intracellular heme after transporting the internalized Hb to the late degradative compartment (9Singh S.B. Tandon R. Krishnamurthy G. Vikram R. Sharma N. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Leishmania utilize the 46-kDa protein as a HbR to acquire heme through Hb endocytosis because these parasites lack a complete heme biosynthetic pathway (2Sah J.F. Ito H. Kolli B.K. Peterson D.A. Sassa S. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14902-14909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, the 46-kDa protein was purified from the solubilized membrane preparation of Leishmania by serial ammonium sulfate precipitations, followed by cation-exchange column chromatography (Fig. 1, A and B). The detection of HbR in the detergent phase in analytical phase separation with nonionic detergent indicated that it was an integral membrane protein (Fig. 1D). Moreover, localization of HbR in the flagellar pocket and similar Hb binding kinetics and specificity (Figs. 1C and 2, A and B) as observed previously with intact Leishmania promastigotes (8Sengupta S. Tripathi J. Tandon R. Raje M. Roy R.P. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the purified protein from Leishmania membrane is Hb receptor. To determine the nature of HbR, we have cloned and expressed HbR from Leishmania as a GST fusion protein using primers designed against different peptide sequences obtained from tryptic digestion of the purified protein (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned HbR revealed (Fig. 3C) that Ld-HbR contains HK signature sequence 156LGFTFSFPVDQKA VNKGLLIKWTKGF281 (29Schirch D.M. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and ATP-binding motifs (30Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) such as 88ALDLGGTNFR97, 232VGVIIGTGSNAC242, and 417AVDGSV422, in which the underlined residues represent conserved amino acids. Moreover, Ld-HbR also shows high homology with the recently described HK sequence from Trypanosoma cruzi (31Caceres A.J. Portillo R. Acosta H. Rosales D. Quinones W. Avilan L. Salazar L. Dubourdieu M. Michels P.A.M. Concepcion J.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and contains PTS-II motif 4RlXXLXXHI12, which is suggested to be responsible for targeting hexokinase to the glycosomes of the trypanosimatid parasites (21Wilson M. Sanejouand Y.H. Perie J. Hannaert V. Opperdoes F. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results, along with the finding that purified recombinant HbR with tag at either the C or N terminus shows significant HK activity (Fig. 3D), demonstrate that HbR in Leishmania is a HK. The results presented in Fig. 4A show that Ld-HbR expressed as GST fusion protein specifically binds with Hb, and no binding was detected with free GST (data not shown). Moreover, the Hb binding ability of the different truncated mutants of the receptor showed that Hb-binding domain of the receptor resides in the N-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 4B). Binding of Hb with Ld-HbR was also competed by yeast HK, further substantiating the fact that HbR in Leishmania is probably a HK. However, we were unable to detect HK activity in the purified endogenous protein (Fig. 3D), possibly due to the use of detergent and urea in the purification procedure. Recent studies have shown that even His-tag containing recombinant HK-displays less affinity for its substrate than the natural protein (31Caceres A.J. Portillo R. Acosta H. Rosales D. Quinones W. Avilan L. Salazar L. Dubourdieu M. Michels P.A.M. Concepcion J.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), possibly because of the additional N-terminal tag in the recombinant protein that presumably hinders the native confirmation needed for HK activity. To rule out the interference of the tag as well as to detect the enzymatic activity of Ld-HbR in the native environment of Leishmania promastigotes, we overexpressed the untagged HbR in Leishmania and measured the total HK activity associated with the lysate. The consistently higher HK activity of HbR-overexpressing cells in comparison with control cells indicates that the hemoglobin receptor in Leishmania is a HK (Fig. 5A). HK activity measured from 10 μg of HbR-overexpressing cell lysate corresponds to the HK activity seen with 10 μg of purified recombinant protein, demonstrating that native conformation is needed for proper HK activity. Moreover, binding of 125I-Hb with the receptor present on the surface of Leishmania is significantly blocked by anti-Ld-HbR-ΔC, demonstrating that HK present on the surface of Leishmania is involved in Hb binding (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, inhibition of uptake of 125I-Hb in Leishmania by Ld-HbR and Ld-HbR-ΔC, but not by Ld-HbR-ΔN (Fig. 5C), further strengthened the observation that cell surface-localized HK is HbR in Leishmania that binds with Hb through its N-terminal extracellular domain. These observations are consistent with our previous results that C-terminal is the cytoplasmic domain of HbR (9Singh S.B. Tandon R. Krishnamurthy G. Vikram R. Sharma N. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian cells, endocytosis in trypanosomatids occurs exclusively through the flagellar pocket (32Overath P. Stierhof Y. Weise M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies using anti-Ld-HbR-ΔC antibody indicated that HbR is localized in the flagellar pocket of Leishmania promastigotes (Fig. 6). These results are in agreement with our earlier studies, in which we have shown that Hb binds with Leishmania promastigotes in the flagellar pocket (8Sengupta S. Tripathi J. Tandon R. Raje M.

Thus, the observation that Ld-HbR, which localized on the cell surface, has HK activity and Hb binding ability conclusively proves that Hb receptor in Leishmania is HK present in the flagellar pocket. This investigation identifies a form of HK, a glycolytic enzyme, localized in the flagellar pocket on the cell surface and performing as an endocytic receptor for internalization of Hb in Leishmania and adds to the small but growing list of glycolytic enzymes of essentially identical primary structures performing diverse functions at different locales of the same cell or cell types (33Frommer W.B. Schulze W.X. Lalonde S. Science. 2003; 300: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For instance, cell surface-associated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was shown to be a fibronectin and laminin-binding protein in Candida albicans (34Gozalbo D. Gil-Navarro I. Azorin I. Renau-Piqueras J. Martinez J.P. Gil M.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and involved in iron acquisition in Staphylococcus (35Modun B. Morrissey J. Williams P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 231-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase also plays major role in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport by regulating vesicle fusion (36Robbins A.R. Ward R.D. Oliver C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In concordance with our observation, a 95-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein, localized on the surface of mouse spermatozoa and serving as a cell surface receptor for ZP3 (38Leyton L. Saling P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), was identified as HK (39Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports also suggest that the HK in Arabidopsis not only catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose but also senses glucose levels and the phosphorylation status of glucose and transmits these signals to the nucleus through a signal transduction pathway (40Moore B. Zhou L. Rolland F. Hall Q. Cheng W.H. Liu Y.X. Hwang I. Jones T. Sheen J. Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Similarly, HK present on the chloroplast outer envelope regulates glucose export by phosphorylating glucose before it enters the cytosol (41Wiese A. Groner F. Sonnewald U. Deppner H. Lerchl J. Hebbeker U. Flugge U. Weber A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether similar phosphorylation by HbR plays any role in the import of Hb by Leishmania. In conclusion, our results represent the first documentation that Hb endocytosis in Leishmania is mediated through a HK present in the flagellar pocket. The ability of HK to bind Hb has not been observed in any other system; however, under certain conditions, Hb is found to be associated with type II HK present in the erythrocyte of newborn infants (42Holmes E.W. Malone J.I. Winegrad A.I. Oski F.A. Science. 1967; 156: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that this unusual binding capacity is an inherent characteristic of HK and might have evolved more significantly in hemoparasites such as Leishmania because of their imperative requirement of heme. However, how glycolytic enzymes such as HK are exported to the cell surface is a very intriguing question and is currently being investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1973855693,"Processivity in myosin V is mediated through the mechanical strain that results when both heads bind strongly to an actin filament, and this strain regulates the timing of ADP release. However, what is not known is which steps that lead to ADP release are affected by this mechanical strain. Answering this question will require determining which of the several potential pathways myosin V takes in the process of ADP release and how actin influences the kinetics of these pathways. We have addressed this issue by examining how magnesium regulates the kinetics of ADP release from myosin V and actomyosin V. Our data support a model in which actin accelerates the release of ADP from myosin V by reducing the magnesium affinity of a myosin V-MgADP intermediate. This is likely a consequence of the structural changes that actin induces in myosin to release phosphate. This effect on magnesium affinity provides a plausible explanation for how mechanical strain can alter this actin-induced acceleration. For actomyosin V, magnesium release follows phosphate release and precedes ADP release. Increasing magnesium concentration to within the physiological range would thus slow both the ATPase activity and the velocity of movement of this motor.

A detailed understanding of chemo-mechanical transduction by the myosin family of molecular motors requires determining the structures of each of the intermediates in the myosin ATPase cycle and understanding how they are interconnected. Although a full understanding of how the myosin motor works requires knowledge of the crystallographic structures of both strong and weak actin-binding states, only the latter have been available until recently (1Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). However, a structure of myosin V crystallized in the absence of nucleotide has now appeared, and it reveals atomic level details that are quite distinct from those of previous, weak binding structures (3Coureux P.-D. Wells A.L. Menetrey J. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2003; 425: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Most significant of these is a closure of the actin-binding cleft, caused by an approximation of the upper and lower 50-kDa domains. This would be predicted to enhance actin-binding affinity. Concomitantly nucleotide affinity was reduced because of a ∼6.5-Å separation of the P loop from Switch I within the catalytic site. These structural features, in combination with kinetic studies on actin binding by nucleotide-free myosin V (4De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), have led to the suggestion that this new myosin structure represents a rigor-like conformation (3Coureux P.-D. Wells A.L. Menetrey J. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2003; 425: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). If this is so, then it follows that between the weak binding structures previously crystallized and this new, rigor-like structure, there must also be a series of “intermediate,” post-hydrolytic structures that contain within their catalytic sites ADP, magnesium, and/or phosphate. Our recent studies on the kinetics of nucleotide release from myosin V (5Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are consistent with this conclusion in that they propose a series of distinct myosin-nucleotide conformations characterized by progressively higher actin affinity and progressively lower nucleotide affinity, A⋅(M⋅D⋅Pi)weak→A⋅(M⋅D)intermediate↔A⋅(M⋅D)strong↔A⋅MrigorReaction 1 where A is actin, M is myosin, and D is ADP. These states have been characterized by their relative actin affinities, as indicated by the subscripts “weak,” “intermediate,” and “strong” (5Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, another way of characterizing these states is by the contents of the catalytic site. Immediately after ATP hydrolysis, the catalytic site contains ADP, magnesium, and Pi, whereas at the end of the mechanochemical cycle, the catalytic site is empty (“rigor state”). Although phosphate is released rapidly after hydrolysis, it is not clear whether magnesium and ADP are released together or in separate steps (4De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 5Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). If it is the latter, then each of the above states could be characterized by the contents of the catalytic site: ADP + phosphate + magnesium in one case, ADP + magnesium in the second, and ADP in the third. Recent crystallographic models of myosin V support this possibility, because they reveal a structure with ADP weakly bound and without magnesium in the catalytic site (6Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we have examined the effects of magnesium on the kinetics of ADP binding to and dissociation from actomyosin V. Our results support a model in which hydrolysis products are released in three steps, phosphate first, magnesium second, and ADP third, that are each associated with a progressively higher actin affinity. Further, they suggest that actin induces a movement of Switch I, which leads immediately to phosphate release, and that these changes in turn weaken magnesium affinity. Loss of magnesium would in turn lead to weakening of ADP affinity, followed by its dissociation. These studies also provide an explanation for how intramolecular strain could alter ADP binding to the active site, and they thereby provide a structural model for the control of processivity by this molecular motor (22Forkey J.N. Quinlan M.E. Shaw M.A. Corrie J.E. Goldman Y.E. Nature. 2003; 422: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 23Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R.

Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Prepoured Sephadex G25 columns (PD10) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Actin was prepared from rabbit acetone powder as described (8Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A myosin V S1 construct consisting of the motor domain and 1 IQ domain was prepared as described previously (4De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Complexes of myosin V constructs with 2′dmD 1The abbreviation used is: 2′dmD, 2′ deoxy mant ADP. were formed by preincubating S1 with a 20-fold molar excess of 2′dmD, followed by gel filtration on prepoured Sephadex G25 columns (PD10; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractional labeling of the complexes with 2′dmD was determined by using the extinction coefficient of the fluorescent nucleotide (5700 m-1 cm-1 at 356 nm) (7Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and the measured protein concentration. Ratios of 2′dmD to active site concentration were typically 0.90–0.95. Free magnesium concentrations were calculated from the stability constant for binding of magnesium to ADP (9Smith R.M. Alberty R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 2376-2380Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Marsh D.J. de Bruin S.H. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1738-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Kinetic Methodologies—Kinetic measurements were made at 20 °C using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped flow spectrophotometer with instrument dead time of 1.2 ms. Studies of 2′dmD binding and release were monitored by energy transfer from vicinal tryptophan residues (λex = 280 nm), and the emission was monitored at 90° from the incident beam with a 450-nm cut-off filter (Omega Optical). Effect of Magnesium on the Kinetics of ADP Release from and Binding to Myosin V—We first monitored the effects of magnesium on the kinetics of ADP release from myosin V. To do this, we mixed in the stopped flow a stoichiometric complex of 4 μm myosin V 1IQ·dmD + 0.5 mm MgCl2 with 800 μm ADP in the presence of varying amounts of magnesium or in the presence of 8 mm EDTA; the latter was to generate a magnesium-free state. We calculated the final free magnesium concentration in each case, using the stability constant for binding of magnesium to the unprotonated form of ADP (9Smith R.M. Alberty R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 2376-2380Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Marsh D.J. de Bruin S.H. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1738-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the kinetics of equilibration of this reaction is extremely rapid (11Eigen M. Hammes G.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 5951-5952Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Hammes G. Levison S.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1504-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), particularly relative to the dead time of the stopped flow (1.3 ms), we assumed that the final concentrations of magnesium were formed by the end of the mixing phase. The dissociation of 2′dmD from myosin V was monitored by energy transfer from vicinal tryptophan and tyrosine residues, as reported in our earlier studies (5Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates examples of the resulting fluorescence transients at 0 mm (red) and 2 mm (green) and 10 mm (blue) final magnesium concentration. Although the transients in the presence of magnesium consisted largely of two phases of roughly equal amplitude, an additional very slow component (rate constant, 0.2–0.3 s-1) could also be detected, although its amplitude was consistently <10% of the total signal amplitude (data not shown), and it was not investigated further. The rate constant of the first phase varied in an inverse hyperbolic manner with magnesium concentration (Fig. 2, solid red circles) and could be fit to Equation 1, λ=k′⋅([Mg+2]Ka)+k([Mg+2]Ka)+1(Eq. 1) Fig. 2Plots of rate constants for 2′dmD release from myosin V (red) and actomyosin V (blue) versus magnesium concentration. For both myosin V (solid red circles) and actomyosin V (solid blue boxes), the rate constant for the first component could be fit to Equation 1, yielding similar values of k1 and k1′ (see Fig. 7). By contrast, actin binding increases Ka ∼10-fold, from 0.07 ± 0.01 mm to 0.68 ± 0.21 mm. The rate constant for the second phase showed little magnesium concentration effect for myosin V (open red circles) or actomyosin V (open blue boxes).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where λ is the observed rate constant, k and k′ are the rate constants for the fastest phase under magnesium-free and magnesium-bound conditions, respectively, and Ka is an apparent magnesium dissociation constant. Fitting the observed rate constants (Fig. 2, solid red line) yielded values of k = 41.5 ± 0.7 s-1, k′ = 13.4 ± 0.3 s-1, and Ka = 0.07 ± 0.01 mm. By contrast, the second phase showed little magnesium concentration dependence and averaged 1.63 ± 0.08 s-1 (Fig. 2, open red circles). The transient produced by mixing with 8 mm EDTA (Fig. 1A, inset, red curve) also contained three components: an initial lag (arrow) that was not seen in the presence of magnesium (green curve) associated with a rate constant of 154 s-1, a fast decreasing phase with rate constant of 33.5 ± 0.5 s-1, and a slow decreasing phase with rate constant of 1.7 ± 0.3 s-1 that constituted ≈20% of the total signal amplitude. A rapid decrease in 2′dmD fluorescence, whose rate constant varies with magnesium concentration, implies that immediately after mixing, the myosin V·2′dmD complex is in a rapid equilibrium between magnesium-bound and magnesium-free states. However, the presence of a second, slower phase of similar amplitude implies that there are two myosin V·ADP states and therefore that ADP can dissociate through at least two interconnected pathways (summarized in Fig. 7, Scheme I). The upper tier of reactions would describe the kinetics of ADP dissociation under saturating magnesium concentrations, whereas the lower tier would describe ADP dissociation in the absence of magnesium. Because Ka is a rapid equilibrium, the apparent rate constants for 2′dmD release, λ1,2, can be defined by the following relationship that we have described previously (13Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11908-11919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9994-9999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), λ1,2=S±S2−4C2(Eq. 2) where S=k¯1+k¯−1+k¯2 and C=k¯1⋅k¯2 and where k¯1=k1′⋅([Mg+2]Ka)+k1([Mg+2]Ka)+1(Eq. 3) k¯−1=k−1′⋅([Mg+2]Kb)+k−1([Mg+2]Kb)+1(Eq. 4) k¯2=k2′⋅([Mg+2]Kb)+k2([Mg+2]Kb)+1(Eq. 5) Solving for the rate constants in Scheme I of Fig. 7 can be simplified by considering the limiting cases: no magnesium (e.g. in the presence of EDTA) and saturating magnesium (e.g. [Mg2+]>>Ka). However, the experiment depicted in Fig. 1A does not provide an independent measure of k2 or k2′, the dissociation rate constants in the absence and presence of magnesium, respectively. To measure these values, we performed the following experiment. Nucleotide-free myosin V was mixed in the stopped flow with varying concentrations of 2′dmD in the presence of 8 mm EDTA or in the presence of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mm MgCl2 (final concentrations). The resulting fluorescence increase consisted of two well separated phases under all conditions (Fig. 3A). In the absence of magnesium, the slower phase constituted 8% of the total signal amplitude. This value increased to 29% at 5.0 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). The rate constant of the faster phase varied linearly with [2′dmD], and the slopes and y intercepts, defining the apparent second order rate constant and dissociation rate constant, respectively, decreased with increasing magnesium concentration (Fig. 3A, inset). The apparent second order rate constant of the faster phase varied with magnesium concentration (Fig. 4, red circles) in a manner described by Equation 1, yielding values of k-2, k-2′, and Kc of 8.7 ± 0.9 μm-1 s-1, 3.7 ± 1.0 μm-1 s-1, and 0.6 ± 0.5 mm, respectively (Fig. 4, red curve). Extrapolation of the rate constant for the faster phase to the origin provides a measure of the dissociation rate constant k¯2. This likewise varied with magnesium concentration (Fig. 5, red circles), defining dissociation rate constants k2, k2′, and Kb of 163 ± 20 s-1, 15 ± 12 s-1, and 0.05 ± 0.05 mm, respectively. The rate constant of the slower phase in the absence of magnesium provides a measure of k1 + k-1, whereas at saturating magnesium concentrations it measures k1′ + k-1′. Note that the high apparent affinity of magnesium significantly limits the accuracy of Kb. This issue was addressed by examining the effect of magnesium on the slower phase. The rate constant for this process varied in an inverse hyperbolic manner with magnesium concentration (Fig. 6, red circles), defining k1 + k-1 = 52.2 ± 2.2 s-1 and k1′ + k-1′ = 2.8 ± 1.9 s-1. The magnesium concentration dependence of these rate constants provides a separate and more accurate measure of Kb of 0.12 ± 0.02 mm.Fig. 4Plot of kappversus [magnesium] for myosin V (red) and actomyosin V (blue). For both preparations, data could be fit to Equation 1, defining values of kapp for magnesium-free and magnesium saturated conditions. For myosin V, kapp is 8.7 ± 0.9 μm-1 s-1 in the absence of magnesium, 3.7 ± 1.0 μm-1 s-1 extrapolated to infinite magnesium, and Kc = 0.6 ± 0.5 mm.

The magnesium concentration dependence of these rate constants provides a separate and more accurate measure of Kb of 0.12 ± 0.02 mm.

The rate-limiting step in this pathway is an isomerization between two myosin V·MgADP states. This is consistent with our prior studies of other high duty cycle myosins, including myosin IIB (15Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Chen L.-Q. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27449-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Effect of Magnesium on the Kinetics of ADP Release from and Binding to Actomyosin V—Having used the results with myosin V to develop an overall kinetic scheme, we next turned our attention to actomyosin V to examine how actin affects the kinetics of ADP release. We monitored the kinetics of ADP release by mixing a complex of 2 μm myosin V 1IQ·dmD + 0.5 mm MgCl2 with 20 μm actin + 800 μm ADP in the presence of varying amounts of magnesium, as was done in experiments in the absence of actin. Fig. 1B illustrates the resulting fluorescence transients at 0 mm (red), 1.5 mm (green), and 10 mm (orange) final magnesium concentration. At all of the magnesium concentrations examined, the transient could be fit to a double exponential decay (Fig. 1B, solid black lines). The rate constant of the faster phase varied with magnesium concentration in a manner that could be described by Equation 1, with k = 33.6 ± 2.1 s-1, k′ = 4.6 ± 2.2 s-1, and Ka = 0.7 ± 0.2 mm (Fig. 2, solid blue boxes). The slower phase, constituting ∼20–30% of the total signal amplitude, was characterized by a rate constant that showed little magnesium concentration dependence and averaged 2.7 ± 1.8 s-1 (Fig. 2, open blue boxes). As with myosin V alone, the transient for actomyosin V in the absence of magnesium also contained an initial lag (Fig. 1B, inset, arrow) not seen in the presence of magnesium (Fig. 1B, inset, green transient). The lag phase was associated with a rate constant of 145 ± 56 s-1. Finally, we examined the kinetics of binding of 2′dmD to a complex of actomyosin V by mixing nucleotide-free actomyosin V with varying concentrations of 2′dmD in the presence of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm MgCl2. As in the case of myosin V, the resulting fluorescence increase consisted of two well separated phases under all conditions (Fig. 3B). In the absence of magnesium, the slower phase constituted 18% of the total signal amplitude, whereas at 10 mm MgCl2 it increased to 31% (data not shown). The rate constant of the faster phase varied linearly with [2′dmD], and the slopes and y intercepts decreased with increasing magnesium concentration (Fig. 3B, inset). The apparent second order rate constant of the faster phase varied with magnesium concentration (Fig. 4, solid blue boxes) in a manner described by Equation 1, yielding values of k-2, k-2′, and Kc of 9.6 ± 0.7 μm-1 s-1, 3.5 ± 0.5 μm-1 s-1, and 0.68 ± 0.21 mm, respectively. The value of kk¯2 also varied with magnesium concentration, as in the case of myosin V (Fig. 5, solid blue boxes), defining values of k2, k2′, and Kb of 141 ± 16 s-1, 28 ± 17 s-1, and 0.81 ± 0.44 mm, respectively. Finally, the rate constant of the slower phase in Fig. 3B also varied with magnesium concentration, defining values of k1 + k-1 = 50.6 ± 2.3 s-1 and k1′ + k-1′ = 5.9 ± 2.1 s-1 (Fig. 6, solid blue boxes). The magnesium concentration dependence of these rate constants provides an independent measure of Kb of 0.50 ± 0.27 mm. Solving the rate equations with these parameters provides values of the rate constants for the case of actomyosin V. These are depicted as Scheme II in Fig. 7. Although there are multiple points in the pathways outlined in Scheme II where actin could exert its effect in accelerating ADP release, it is striking that the most prominent effect of actin is on the affinity of magnesium for the M1·D and M2·D states, which are reduced ∼10-fold. A Model of Magnesium-regulated ADP Release—The results of this study demonstrate that magnesium affects the dissociation kinetics of ADP from myosin V. Understanding the physiologic relevance of this finding, however, requires a detailed kinetic model that describes how magnesium affects the pathway leading to ADP dissociation. Our data support a model in which myosin V·ADP undergoes two conformational changes before nucleotide is released, indicated by the subscripts 1 and 2 in Fig. 7. Because each of these states can bind magnesium, this situation could generate multiple pathways for ADP release. Which one of these is used by myosin V under physiologic conditions? Answering this question requires determining the values of the rate and equilibrium constants in this system. We propose that after ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release, myosin V·ADP enters a rapid equilibrium described by the following, M1⋅DMg+2↕ KaM1⋅D(Eq. 6) where Ka is defined by the fit to Equation 1 (0.07 mm). Transition to the M2 state could occur either in the presence or in the absence of magnesium. The probability that magnesium would be released first, followed by formation of the M2 state, can be determined by the following relationship. Probability=k¯1k¯1+k¯1′(Eq. 7) At a magnesium concentration of 2.0 mm, this would be ≈45%. Thus, both the upper and lower pathways illustrated in Scheme I would be utilized under physiologic conditions. Given that the Ka and Kb equilibria are rapid, Equation 2 predicts that the fluorescent decrease associated with release of 2′dmD from myosin V should be biphasic. In the presence of magnesium, adequate fitting of the data in Fig. 1A required three exponential terms, although the amplitude of the third term was typically <10% of the total signal amplitude. This suggests that although myosin V·ADP is mostly an equilibrium mixture of two states, there is a small fraction of an additional state. By contrast, actomyosin V represents a very different situation. Because actin binding markedly weakens Ka and Kb, the probability that magnesium would be released prior to ADP would be 96% at 2 mm magnesium. Hence, the dominant pathway would be as follows. A⋅M1⋅DMg+2↕ KaA⋅M1⋅D↔A⋅M2⋅D(Eq. 8) The next step, formation of the AM2·ADP state, is linked to ADP dissociation, which is irreversible under physiologic conditions. Given that k2 >> k2′, this means that the predominant physiologic pathway would be, A⋅M1⋅DMg+2↕ KaA⋅M1⋅D↔k1/k−1A⋅M2⋅D↔k1/k−2A⋅M2+D(Eq. 9) and this pathway is highlighted in red in Scheme II of Fig. 7. Mixing myosin V·2′dmD or actomyosin V·2′dmD with EDTA produced transients that contained an initial lag phase (Fig. 1, A and B, insets) with rate constants consistent with what would be predicted from Equation 2. However, a slower phase with a rate constant of ≈1.7 s-1 in the absence of magnesium would not have been predicted from either scheme in Fig. 7. This component may represent a subset of myosin V·Mg-2′dmD molecules in which the magnesium is only slowly exchangeable and in which nucleotide release only occurs along the upper pathway of Scheme I even in the presence of EDTA. Further studies will be necessary to determine the nature of this state and its physiologic significance. Four conclusions are apparent from Scheme I. First, our finding that Ka and Kb are similar in value to each other implies that the conformational changes that underlie the M1·D ↔ M2·D and A·M1·D ↔ A·M2·D transitions do not involve major rearrangements in the structures that coordinate magnesium. A second, related conclusion is that the major effect of magnesium on these transitions is kinetic, not thermodynamic. Magnesium slows the forward and reverse rate constants for this transition in both myosin V and actomyosin V by approximately 1 order of magnitude. By contrast, our finding that the equilibrium and rate constants that describe the M2·D ↔ M2 + D and A·M2·D ↔ A·M2 + D transitions are affected by magnesium leads to a third conclusion: the structural elements that change conformation in these transitions are involved in magnesium coordination. Finally, we conclude that the marked reduction in Mg2+ affinity produced by actin binding implies that actin alters the conformation of the structural elements involved in coordinating the divalent metal. The M1 state represents a structural state that has been seen at high resolution for a number of myosins and has been referred to as the near rigor state, the open state, and recently, the post-rigor state (6Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In this state the magnesium coordination depends on an element in the nucleotide pocket known as Switch I. This is illustrated in Fig. 8, which was derived from crystallographic models of myosin V (3Coureux P.-D. Wells A.L. Menetrey J. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Nature. 2003; 425: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 6Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In our earlier work, which characterized the product release steps in myosin V, we observed a change in the fluorescence signal of mant nucleotide that was associated with release of phosphate (5Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We suggested that the mant fluorophor was reporting a movement of Switch I that allows phosphate release and leads to formation of the AM1 state. Our current data also suggests that actin binding induces the movement of Switch I, because actin binding markedly reduces magnesium affinity, an effect that could be produced by disrupting the coordination of magnesium by Switch I. As we noted above, the fact that Ka and Kb are quite similar suggests that the Mg2+ coordination does not markedly change between the AM1 and AM2 states. We propose that the AM2 state is structurally equivalent to the recently published rigor-like state of myosin V, in which Switch I is too far from the P loop to coordinate magnesium. The transition from AM1 to AM2 has been described kinetically for other myosins. It occurs concomitantly with an additional lever arm movement (17Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25418-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and provides a mechanism for strain sensitivity in these myosins. Although the magnesium affinity does not change between the AM1 and AM2 states, the ADP affinity does. In the absence of actin in the post-rigor state, magnesium is coordinated by Switch I and by the β-phosphate of ADP and the P loop (directly and via water; see Fig. 8). Upon actin binding, Switch I must move away from its post-rigor position. In the case of myosin V·ADP·Pi, this movement is coupled to phosphate release and likely is necessary to create the escape route for the phosphate (19Houdusse A. Sweeney H.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The movement would result in loss of Mg2+ coordination by serine 218 of Switch I, leading to a reduced affinity for Mg2+. The question is how does loss of Mg2+ from the AM1 state increase the rate of isomerization from the AM1 to the AM2 state, leading to reduced ADP affinity. Some insights are provided by the recently published myosin V rigor-like state and a similar state with ADP (but not Mg2+) bound at the active site. The nucleotide-binding elements of this ADP-bound structural state are shown in Fig. 8 and reveal that the loss of Mg2+ results in rearrangements of the P loop (and slight rearrangement of Switch II) as compared with the post-rigor conformation that would weaken ADP affinity (notably the loss of lysine 169). Mg2+ presumably would constrain these rearrangements because of the participation of threonine 170 of the P loop and aspartate 437 of Switch II (via water) in Mg2+ coordination. Thus, the loss of Mg2+ from the strong ADP-binding AM1 state may trigger rearrangements of the P loop from its post-rigor conformation, as well as allow small rearrangements of Switch I and II. We propose that this favors the rearrangements depicted in Fig. 8. In this view, the structure in Fig. 8 (which we named the weak ADP state) is equivalent to the weak ADP-binding AM2·ADP kinetic state defined in the current study. Concerted rearrangements of the Switch elements and P loop that follow Mg2+ release and that give rise to this state must be coupled to the lever arm swing associated with isomerization from the AM1 to AM2 states. This arrangement would confer a strain dependence. A comparison of myosin V rigor-like crystal structures with and without ADP bound reveals a further rearrangement of the P loop upon ADP dissociation (6Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A Mechanism for Strain-regulated ADP Release—Our previous study on the mechanism of myosin V processivity concluded that torsional strain on the trailing head of a myosin V dimer, which might be expected to occur as a myosin V motor steps onto a second actin filament, accelerates ADP release by ∼2-fold (5Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In fact, the value of the rate constant that we measured in that study is remarkably similar in value to k1 in Fig. 7 (Scheme II). In light of this, we propose that strain affects the kinetics of myosin V ADP release through its effects on the release of magnesium. In our model, forward strain on the leading head would increase Ka to a value appreciably larger than the physiologic magnesium concentration of ∼0.5–1.0 mm (21Kushmerick M.J. Dillon P.F. Meyer R.A. Brown T.R. Krisanda J. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14420-14429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous study, we had shown that rearward strain blocked ADP release from the forward head (5Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). If rearward strain simply reduced the value of Ka, this would slow forward movement but not stop it, because ADP would be released at a rate defined by k1′ = 4 s-1. Rather, we propose that rearward strain must also slow the A·M1 → A·M2 transition to effectively slow ADP release to the rate of MgADP release from A·M1. Relevance to Other Myosin Isoforms—Finally, it is interesting to consider how this scheme might apply to other myosin family members. Smooth muscle myosin II, brush border myosin I, myosin VI, and nonmuscle IIB appear to use the same kinetic scheme as that used by myosin V (15Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Chen L.-Q. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27449-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This scheme includes a strain-dependent ADP dissociation step that is associated with an additional movement of the lever arm. However the equilibrium between those states (our A·M1 and A·M2 states) varies with temperature and with the particular isoform. For most isoforms, including smooth muscle myosin II and myosin V, it is shifted toward the A·M2 state, which would imply that magnesium release would precede ADP release. For myosin V and myosin VI, increasing magnesium concentration would be predicted to slow the steady state ATPase rate, because ADP release is rate-limiting. For all myosins, ADP release is thought to limit the maximal speed of movement, and we would predict that this in turn would be sensitive to magnesium concentration. For myosin V, this sensitivity is over the physiological range. The accompanying paper from Fujita-Becker et al. (27Fujita-Becker S. Durrwant U. Erent M. Clark R.J. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrates that myosin I displays motility that is sensitive to magnesium concentration over the physiological range. Thus, it is likely that for most myosins, the strain-sensitive isomerization that allows rapid ADP release is coupled to the release of magnesium."

In mice, selectin ligand activity regulating leukocyte recruitment and lymphocyte homing into lymph nodes results from the sum of unequal contributions of fucosyltransferase (FucT)-IV and FucT-VII, with FucT-VII playing a predominant role. Here we have examined the role of human FucT-IV and -VII in conferring L-selectin, P-selectin, and E-selectin binding activities to PSGL-1. Lewis x (Lex) carbohydrate was generated at the CHOdhfr– cell surface by FucT-IV expression, whereas sialyl Lex (sLex) was synthesized by FucT-VII. Both human FucT-IV and -VII had the ability to generate carbohydrate ligands that support L-selectin-, P-selectin-, and E-selectin-dependent rolling on PSGL-1, with FucT-VII playing a major role. Cooperation was observed between FucT-IV and -VII in recruiting L-, P-, or E-selectin-expressing cells on PSGL-1 and in regulating cell rolling velocity and stability. Additional rolling adhesion assays were performed to assess the role of Thr-57-linked core-2 O-glycans in supporting L-selectin-, P-selectin-, and E-selectin-dependent rolling on PSGL-1. These studies confirmed that core-2 O-glycans attached to Thr-57 play a critical role in supporting L- and P-selectin-dependent rolling and revealed that additional binding sites support >75% of E-selectin-mediated rolling. The observations presented here indicate that human FucT-IV and -VII both contribute and cooperate in regulating L-selectin-, P-selectin-, and E-selectin-dependent rolling on PSGL-1, with FucT-VII playing a predominant role in conferring selectin binding activity to PSGL-1."

We have previously shown that localized stimulation of EGF receptor with EGF bound to beads results in localized actin polymerization and protrusion. Here we show that the actin polymerization is dependent upon activation of the Arp2/3 complex by neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (N-WASP) via Grb2 and Nck2. Suppression of Grb2 or Nck2 results in loss of localization of N-WASP at the activation site and reduced actin polymerization. Although cortactin has been found to synergize with N-WASP for Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization in vitro, we find that cortactin can restrict N-WASP localization around EGF-bead-induced protrusions. In addition, cortactin-deficient cells have increased lamellipod dynamics but show reduced net translocation, suggesting that cortactin can contribute to cell polarity by controlling the extent of Arp2/3 activation by WASP family members and the stability of the F-actin network.

Biochemical studies have shown that WASP and WAVE family proteins as well as cortactin can induce Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (13Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). N-WASP and WAVE family proteins use their C-terminal verprolin, cofilin, acidic (VCA) homology sequence domains to bind and activate the Arp2/3 complex (13Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev.

Rac1 or Nck are thought to activate WAVE family members by disruption of a five-protein complex (17Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W.

Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Unlike N-WASP and WAVE proteins, cortactin requires binding to F-actin filaments to induce Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (18Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 19Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr.

Binding assays have shown that cortactin co-operatively binds the Arp2/3 complex with N-WASP (19Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Recent findings have suggested that cortactin can also displace N-WASP from the Arp2/3 complex, stabilizing filament branches and maintaining actin polymerization (20Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of cortactin in actin polymerization may vary depending on cell type and stimulation condition. To define the spatial patterns of pathways that can link the EGF receptor to Arp2/3 complex activation, we have developed a method of stimulating cells with EGF-coated beads to allow us to evaluate local stimulation of actin polymerization (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Stimulation with EGF-coated beads induced localized actin polymerization within a 2 μm radius, and in 25% of the cases the actin polymerization was accompanied by a protrusion extending the bead several microns off the surface of the cell. The response was inhibited by blocking EGF receptor activity or actin polymerization. This type of stimulation did not induce focal adhesion clustering (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which may integrate other signals influencing actin dynamics. We found that both cofilin and the Arp2/3 complex were required to stimulate protrusions and localized actin polymerization by EGF immobilized on beads but that these responses were independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas responses to soluble EGF are sensitive to this kinase (22Mouneimne G. Soon L. DesMarais V. Sidani M. Song X. Yip S.C. Ghosh M. Eddy R. Backer J.M. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). EGF beads may mimic ligands bound to extracellular matrix in vivo, which could elicit a different response compared with the addition of soluble growth factor. In this report, we analyze the signaling pathways contributing to regulation of the Arp2/3 complex in the EGF-bead response. We find N-WASP to be the critical factor in Arp2/3 activation by EGF beads. Furthermore, both Grb2 and Nck2 are required for activation of N-WASP. Removal of cortactin enhanced the EGF-bead protrusion response together with an increase in N-WASP around the bead. We conclude that under our stimulation conditions, cortactin restricts N-WASP activation of actin polymerization and stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton. Cell Culture and Stimulation—MTLn3 cells were maintained in α minimal essential media with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (23Segall J.E. Tyerech S. Boselli L. Masseling S. Helft J. Chan A. Jones J. Condeelis J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were plated on MatTek dishes in complete media overnight. Typically, cells were then starved for 3 h in L15 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.35% bovine serum albumin before stimulation with EGF-bound beads for 3 min or with 10 nm soluble EGF (Invitrogen) for 1 min. Biotin EGF (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was bound to streptavidin-bound magnetic beads (Pierce, or Dynal, Brown Deer, WI) brought down onto cells within 20 s using a magnet; this was followed by fixation and staining as described (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Kempiak S.J. Segall J.E. Science's STKE. 2004; 218: 11Google Scholar). Observation in the F-actin (rhodamine) channel was used to characterize the response as either: 1) a protrusion (a three-dimensional structure where the bead has been “pushed” away from the cell and is not in the same plane of focus as neighboring cell components), 2) local positive responses (increased F-actin staining near the bead but in the same plane of focus as neighboring cell components with no three-dimensional structure clearly visible), or 3) no responses (no protrusion or increased F-actin staining near the bead). Data were then plotted as fraction of cells showing protrusions only or total responses (the sum of protrusions and local positive responses). For analysis of net path length and net flow, 60-min-long time lapse movies were analyzed with DIAS at 5-min intervals (Solltech, Oakdale, IA). Net path length was provided by DIAS as the straight line distance from the path starting point to the ending point during the entire 60-min interval. Net flow represents the total fraction of cell area that changes position between successive time points and is the sum of the positive and negative flow parameters calculated by DIAS. Net path length represents the net movement of the cell centroid, whereas net flow is a measure of all changes in cell shape and protrusion independent of their contribution to cell translocation.

Cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) 36 or 48 h before use.

In siRNA rescue, cells were first treated with siRNA and allowed to rest until 80–90% confluent. Cells were then transfected with cDNA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Rescued cells were identified by GFP or antibody staining using anti-N-WASP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-cortactin (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies. Triton Permeabilization Assay—Cells were either fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for an additional 10 min (total filaments) or fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min (stable filaments). Both groups were then washed in 1× Tris-buffered saline five times, stained with rhodamine-phalloidin in 1× Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% fetal calf serum, and then washed with 1× Tris-buffered saline five times. Staining Intensity Measurements—The F-actin or N-WASP staining ratio of the bead site compared with the edge of cell was then determined as described (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Kempiak S.J. Segall J.E. Science's STKE. 2004; 218: 11Google Scholar). In brief, using an image processing program such as NIH Image or ImageJ, the area of increased fluorescence intensity in the cell membrane next to the bead is outlined and the average intensity determined. The average intensity of the membrane staining in an equivalent area far from the bead is also determined. The ratio of the two is then calculated for each cell followed by averaging of the ratios from all the cells for each condition. Western Blot—Western blots were performed as described (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were for p34 and cortactin (Upstate Biotechnology), N-WASP, WAVE1 and WAVE2 (Dr. Tadaomi Takenawa, University of Tokyo, Japan) and Nck (Dr. Tony Pawson, University of Toronto, Canada). The EGF-Bead Response Requires N-WASP—To determine the pathway upstream of Arp2/3 required for the response to EGF beads, siRNAs were designed to suppress expression of the major activators of the Arp 2/3 complex: N-WASP, WAVE1, WAVE2, and cortactin (26Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WAVE3 and WASP were not tested because they are not expressed in MTLn3 cells (data not shown). Measurements were scored by identifying beads in contact with cells and then using rhodamine-phalloidin staining to determine whether the bead induced no response or localized actin polymerization or a protrusion (Fig. 1A). WAVE1 and WAVE2 suppression resulted in little or no reduction of responses (Fig. 1B). N-WASP suppression resulted in a decrease in protrusions and total responses observed by 50% (Fig. 1B). A second siRNA to a different region of N-WASP yielded a similar level of inhibition (data not shown). Expression of Bos taurus N-WASP (which contains two base pair mismatches in sequence compared with the siRNA used) restored the EGF-bead response in N-WASP siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, N-WASP is important for activation of the EGF-bead induced response, whereas neither WAVE1 nor WAVE2 play a substantial role. Simultaneous suppression of both Arp2/3 complex and cofilin function is required for near complete inhibition of the EGF-bead-induced response, suggesting two parallel pathways to actin polymerization (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Simultaneous suppression of N-WASP and cofilin also dramatically decreased the EGF-bead-induced response (Fig. 1D). The combination of N-WASP and p34 (a component of the Arp2/3 complex) siRNA did not reduce responses to EGF-coated beads more than N-WASP siRNA alone (Fig. 1D), indicating that N-WASP is the major upstream activator of the Arp2/3 complex in actin polymerization induced by localized EGF. Grb2 and Nck2 Are Required in the EGF-Bead Response to Recruit and Activate N-WASP—We have shown previously that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and cdc42 are not required for the responses induced by EGF beads (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore tested Grb2, Nck1, and Nck2, which can also activate N-WASP (15Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21946-21952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Rohatgi R. Nollau P. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. Mayer B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26448-26452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Suppression of Grb2 decreased responses by 40% (Fig. 2A, diagonal lines bars) and was confirmed using a second siRNA (data not shown). A GFP-tagged human Grb2 sequence, which deviates from the rat Grb2 siRNA by three base pairs, restored responses in cells treated with rat Grb2 siRNA (Fig. 2B, gray bars). To monitor Nck protein expression, we used an antibody that recognizes both Nck1 and Nck2 SH3 domains (27Bladt F. Aippersbach E. Gelkop S. Strasser G.A. Nash P. Tafuri A. Gertler F.B. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Either Nck1 or Nck2 suppression alone resulted in a partial decrease in protein expression; however, when both siRNAs were added simultaneously little or no protein remained (Fig. 2E). This result is consistent with Nck knock-out experiments utilizing mouse embryonic fibroblast lysates in which much of the antibody staining was caused by Nck1 (27Bladt F. Aippersbach E. Gelkop S. Strasser G.A. Nash P. Tafuri A. Gertler F.B. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, suppression of Nck1 had no effect on the EGF-bead response (Fig. 2A, dotted bars). Nck2 suppression (Fig. 2A, gray bars) inhibited the bead response to an extent similar to that seen in Grb2 suppression or simultaneous suppression of both Nck1 and Nck2 (Fig. 2A, horizontal striped bars). Thus Nck2, like Grb2, mediates EGF-bead-induced responses. This was confirmed by a second Nck2 siRNA (data not shown) and rescue of the siRNA treatment using GFP-tagged human Nck2, which had four mismatched base pairs to the rat Nck2 siRNA used (Fig. 2C). Simultaneous reduction of the levels of Grb2 and Nck2 did not inhibit the bead response more than reduction of either protein alone (Fig. 2A, black bars). Suppressing N-WASP in combination with either Grb2 or Nck2 (Fig. 2D) did not significantly differ from suppression of N-WASP, Grb2, or Nck2 alone. However, suppressing cofilin in combination with either Grb2 or Nck2 showed a decrease in responses similar to suppression of both N-WASP and cofilin (Fig. 1C) or both p34 and cofilin (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Grb2 and Nck2 might act in concert to activate N-WASP in response to EGF-beads. To test this hypothesis we evaluated N-WASP recruitment to the bead site in the presence or absence of Grb2 or Nck2. In a normal response, N-WASP staining is increased next to the bead (Fig. 3, A, open bars, and B, top panels). In the absence of either Grb2 or Nck2, N-WASP staining at the bead site decreased to levels seen at the edge of cells that were not touched by a bead (Fig. 3, A, striped and solid bars, and B, bottom panels). Furthermore, the beads that showed positive responses under these conditions had a decrease in F-actin staining at the bead site compared with control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that the loss of Grb2 and Nck2 along with a decrease in N-WASP recruitment impeded actin polymerization at the bead site. Grb2 and Nck2 siRNA had no effect on N-WASP, p34, or cofilin expression (data not shown). We conclude that Grb2 and Nck2 are necessary for recruitment of N-WASP to the EGF receptor to activate Arp2/3-induced actin polymerization. Cortactin Is Antagonistic to Actin Polymerization Induction but Is Required for Integration of Freshly Polymerized Actin into the Cell Cytoarchitecture—Suppression of cortactin expression unexpectedly resulted in the enhancement of protrusion responses by 50% (Fig. 4A, diagonal lines bars) and was confirmed by another siRNA against a different region of the cortactin gene (data not shown). Next we rescued the rat cortactin siRNA response by overexpressing a human cortactin sequence, which had three mismatches to the siRNA used. Overexpression of human cortactin in rat cortactin siRNA-treated cells decreased responses (Fig. 4A, gray bars), whereas expression of an N-terminal deletion of cortactin, which does not bind Arp2/3 but does have its F-actin binding region (18Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), also enhanced protrusion responses (Fig. 4B, gray bars). This overexpression analysis suggested that the antagonistic function of cortactin was occurring at its Arp2/3 binding region and may be regulating N-WASP function. Because it has been shown that cortactin can displace N-WASP from the Arp2/3 complex in the presence of F-actin (20Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we compared the localization of N-WASP in control and cortactin siRNA-treated cells. In control siRNA-treated cells, N-WASP staining was tightly localized around the bead site, whereas cortactin localized with F-actin staining just outside the site of N-WASP localization (Fig. 4E) similar to actin comet tails formed by vaccinia virus (28Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and Shigella (20Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells treated with cortactin siRNA had increased N-WASP protein staining at EGF beads and more uniform colocalization of N-WASP with F-actin throughout protrusions (Fig. 4, C and E). Thus, suppression of cortactin increases N-WASP recruitment and the number of protrusions found at the EGF-bead site. Cells with reduced cortactin also displayed increased F-actin staining at the lamellipod edge compared with control siRNA cells (Fig. 5A) suggesting that increased actin polymerization was occurring there. Live cell imaging was performed to compare the cortactin to control siRNA-treated cells. There was an increase in multiple actively protruding cell edges in cortactin siRNA-treated cells compared with control siRNA-treated cells, which tended to have one dominant lamellipod (supplemental Movies 1 and 2 and net flow in Fig. 5B). Net flow (Fig. 5B), which is a measure of retraction and extension of cell protrusions, was significantly higher in the cortactin siRNA-treated cells, consistent with the presence of multiply protruding cell edges. However, cells with reduced cortactin showed decreased total translocation compared with control treated cells (net path length in Fig. 5B)in line with previous reports of cortactin contributing to effective cell movement (29Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 30Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These data suggest that cortactin is required for cell movement but not for the induction of actin polymerization in spontaneous cell motility. If cortactin is involved in binding F-actin filaments in conjunction with the Arp2/3 complex (19Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), then loss of cortactin might result in reduced stability. The stability of the actin filaments in control and cortactin siRNA-treated cells after EGF-bead stimulation was determined using a Triton permeabilization assay. Cells were fixed in the presence of Triton X-100, which can enhance the loss of labile structures within the cell. Although suppression of cortactin produced increased actin polymerization around the beads in the absence of Triton (Fig. 5C, total F-actin), the amount of F-actin was significantly decreased after Triton treatment in cortactin siRNA-treated cells compared with control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5C, stable F-actin). Therefore, cortactin contributes to the stability of actin filaments induced by EGF beads. Previously, we found that actin polymerization induced by EGF beads is dependent on cofilin and the Arp2/3 complex but independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Cdc42/Rac (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggesting that Arp2/3 activation in this response was independent of Rho family proteins. In the current manuscript we examined the mechanism of Arp2/3 activation. Of Arp2/3 complex activators, only N-WASP siRNA treatment significantly inhibited the response. Next we inhibited the expression of N-WASP activators, Grb2 and Nck1 and Nck2 (15Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21946-21952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Rohatgi R. Nollau P. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. Mayer B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26448-26452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and found that both Grb2 and Nck2 were required in the EGF-bead response. When used in combination with cofilin siRNA, the N-WASP, Grb2, or Nck2 siRNAs were able to inhibit the protrusion response almost completely, similar to suppression of cofilin and p34 (21Kempiak S.J. Yip S.C. Backer J.M. Segall J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the combination of p34 with N-WASP siRNA or N-WASP with Grb2 or Nck siRNA had no additional effect over any one siRNA treatment alone, indicating that Grb2, Nck2, N-WASP, and p34 are all on the same pathway leading to activation of the Arp2/3 complex. Remarkably, we found that suppression of cortactin, another Arp2/3 activator, increased the number of EGF bead-induced protrusions. This increase in responses was also seen with overexpression of a cortactin fragment that lacked the N-terminal acidic domain, which mediates binding to the Arp2/3 complex (18Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 19Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This suggested that the antagonistic function of cortactin was caused by its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. Because cortactin can displace the VCA homology sequence domain of N-WASP from Arp2/3 complex in the presence of F-actin (20Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we tested if cortactin was regulating N-WASP localization at the EGF-bead site. After cortactin loss, there was increased N-WASP found at the EGF-bead site as well as increased localization of N-WASP throughout protrusions. This increased binding of N-WASP was concurrent with an increase in F-actin staining at the bead site as well as other areas of actin polymerization, such as the leading edge, demonstrating that cortactin is regulating the function as well as location of N-WASP. Both Grb2 and Nck1 and -2 have been shown to bind the activated EGF receptor, either directly at phosphotyrosine residues in the case of Grb2, or via other proteins, such as Dok in the case of Nck (31McCarty J.H. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, Grb2 and Nck have been shown to bind and stimulate N-WASP activation of the Arp2/3 complex (15Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P. Pantaloni D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Localized accumulation of the Nck SH3 domains induces actin polymerization dependent on N-WASP (33Rivera G.M. Briceno C.A. Takeshima F. Snapper S.B. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both Ncks and Grb2 were shown to contribute to the recruitment of N-WASP in vaccinia-induced and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate-induced motility (25Scaplehorn N. Holmstrom A. Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 740-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37771-37776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We find that N-WASP recruitment to the bead site is decreased after removal of either Grb2 or Nck2, indicating that both Grb2 and Nck2 are required for the proper localization of N-WASP in the EGF-bead response. Both Grb2 and Nck2 bind the polyproline region of N-WASP (26Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly at different sites; however, in vitro studies of Grb2 and Nck1 used in combination did not show synergistic activation of N-WASP-induced Arp2/3 dependent actin polymerization (14Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). In our studies, Nck1 did not mediate activation of N-WASP, raising the possibility that the mechanism of Nck2 activation of N-WASP may differ from that of Nck1. Because Grb2 and Nck2 bind to the activated EGF receptor at different locations (31McCarty J.H. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the receptor may orient these molecules so they synergize to localize and activate N-WASP in vivo. Alternatively, Grb2 and/or Nck2 may interact with additional proteins, such as Toca-1 (transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly) (36Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Le M. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), or WIP (34Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M.

Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Ramesh N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As part of our study of Arp2/3 activators, we also examined the role of cortactin in the EGF-bead response. It was surprising to see an increase in the number of protrusion responses when cortactin was suppressed. However, cortactin can displace N-WASP from the Arp2/3 complex after N-WASP has initiated actin polymerization (20Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our immunostaining demonstrated that N-WASP is at the site of EGF receptor activation and cortactin is juxtaposed to N-WASP, similar to what has been reported for vaccinia virus (28Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and Shigella-stimulated (20Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) actin tails. Furthermore, the loss of cortactin resulted in enhanced actin polymerization as shown by increased F-actin staining at the EGF-bead site as well as at lamellipods. This information shows that cortactin can regulate actin polymerization by maintaining N-WASP at sites of actin polymerization and limiting its localization. Cortactin may have similar effects on WAVEs, which have a VCA homology sequence terminal sequence similar to N-WASP (26Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have been shown to be required for lamellipod protrusions (38Suetsugu S. Yamazaki D. Kurisu S. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 595-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cortactin has also been implicated in stabilizing actin branches (19Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The Triton permeabilization assay showed reduced F-actin staining in cortactin siRNA-treated cells, demonstrating that cortactin can contribute to the stability of F-actin induced in the EGF-bead response. Our data are consistent with a model in which cortactin can displace N-WASP from the Arp2/3 complex (20Uruno T. Liu J. Li Y. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26086-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Martinez-Quiles N. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Under other conditions, such as during contact-stimulated spreading and adhesion (40Kinley A.W. Weed S.A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), cortactin may also stimulate (or regulate) actin polymerization. In summary, we have mapped out an actin polymerization pathway from the receptor to output by observing the EGF-bead response. Grb2 and Nck2 can bind the activated receptor and then recruit/activate N-WASP to the EGF-bead site. This simple pathway differs from the main pathway of N-WASP activation triggered by soluble EGF and may reflect the effect of restraining EGF receptors by binding them to immobilized ligands. Such responses may occur in vivo in the presence of ligands bound to extracellular matrix elements. We thank Drs.

These ac-TAGs have long-chain acyl groups esterified at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycerol. Cell-free extracts of developing seeds of E. alatus contain both long-chain acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA sn-1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity. We have isolated a gene from developing seeds of Euonymus alatus that shows a very high sequence similarity to the members of the DGAT1 gene family (i.e. related to acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases). This Euonymus DGAT1 gene, when expressed in wild type yeast, results in a 5-fold enhancement of long-chain triacylglycerol (lc-TAG) accumulation, as well as the appearance of low levels of ac-TAG. Hydrogenated ac-TAG molecular species were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Microsomes isolated from this transformed yeast show diacylglycerol:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activity, which is about 40-fold higher than that measured in microsomes prepared from yeast transformed with the empty vector or with the Arabidopsis thaliana DGAT1 gene. The specific activity of this microsomal acetyltransferase activity is of the same order of magnitude as the microsomal long-chain DGAT activities measured for yeast lines transformed with the empty vector or either the Arabidopsis or Euonymus DGAT1 genes. Despite this, ac-TAG accumulation in yeast transformed with the Euonymus DGAT1 gene was very low (0.26% of lc-TAG), whereas lc-TAG accumulation was enhanced. Possible reasons for this anomaly are discussed. Expression of the Euonymus DGAT1-like gene in yeast lines where endogenous TAG synthesis has been deleted confirmed that the gene product has both long-chain acyl- and acetyltransferase activity. 1,2-Diacyl-3-acetyl-sn-glycerols (ac-TAG) are unusual triacylglycerols that constitute the major storage lipid in the seeds of Euonymus alatus (Burning Bush).

Microsomes isolated from this transformed yeast show diacylglycerol:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activity, which is about 40-fold higher than that measured in microsomes prepared from yeast transformed with the empty vector or with the Arabidopsis thaliana DGAT1 gene. The specific activity of this microsomal acetyltransferase activity is of the same order of magnitude as the microsomal long-chain DGAT activities measured for yeast lines transformed with the empty vector or either the Arabidopsis or Euonymus DGAT1 genes. Despite this, ac-TAG accumulation in yeast transformed with the Euonymus DGAT1 gene was very low (0.26% of lc-TAG), whereas lc-TAG accumulation was enhanced. Possible reasons for this anomaly are discussed. Expression of the Euonymus DGAT1-like gene in yeast lines where endogenous TAG synthesis has been deleted confirmed that the gene product has both long-chain acyl- and acetyltransferase activity. The occurrence and the structural characterization of the 3-acetyl-1,2-long-chain diacyl-sn-glycerols (1,2-diacyl-3-acetins, or ac-TAG) 1The abbreviations used are: ac-TAG, a triacylglycerol where one acyl group is acetyl; DAG, diacylglycerol, DGAT, diacylglycerol:acyl-CoA acyltransferase; FID, flame ionization detector; GC, gas chromatography; lc-TAG, a triacylglycerol where all three acyl groups are long-chain fatty acyl groups; MS, mass spectrometry; TAG, triacylglycerol; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: ac-TAG, a triacylglycerol where one acyl group is acetyl; DAG, diacylglycerol, DGAT, diacylglycerol:acyl-CoA acyltransferase; FID, flame ionization detector; GC, gas chromatography; lc-TAG, a triacylglycerol where all three acyl groups are long-chain fatty acyl groups; MS, mass spectrometry; TAG, triacylglycerol; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription. in seed oils were reported by Kleiman et al. (1Kleiman R. Miller R.W. Earle F.R. Wolff I.A. Lipids. 1967; 2: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unlike most long-chain triacylglycerols (lc-TAG), these ac-TAGs exhibit a strong optical activity because of asymmetry at the central carbon atom of the glycerol moiety introduced by the acetyl group. They have been found mainly in plants of the family Celastraceae but also in the families Lardizabalaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, and Balsaminaceae. These unusual triacylglycerols are found in varying amounts, but in the genus Euonymus they can represent up to 98% of the total triacylglycerols in the seed oil. In Euonymus the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the acetyl glycerides are esterified with common long-chain fatty acids, predominantly palmitate, oleate, and linoleate. Short-chain fatty acids are also found esterified in the triacylglycerols of milk from ruminants, particularly at the sn-3 position (2Padley F.B. Gunstone F.D. Harwood J.L. Padley F.B. The Lipid Handbook. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1986: 113-129Google Scholar), and ac-TAGs have been identified in bovine udder lipids (3Limb J.-K. Kim Y.H. Han S.-Y. Jhon G.-J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2169-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that ac-TAGs are often a minor component in the human diet. In addition, SALATRIM (short and long acyltriglyceride molecule) triacylglycerols have been developed as a commercial reduced calorie fat (4Smith R.E. Finley J.W. Leveille G.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1994; 42: 432-434Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Auerbach M.H. Chang P.W. Kosmark R. O'Neill J.J. Philips J.C. Klemann L.P. Christophe A. Structural Modified Food Fats: Synthesis, Biochemistry, and Use. American Oil Chemists' Society Press, Champaign, IL1998: 89-116Crossref Google Scholar). These are interesterified TAGs containing saturated fatty acids (largely stearate) and short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, and/or butyrate). Lipase-catalyzed interesterification has also been used to produce acetylacylglycerols (6Kuo S.-J. Parkin K.L. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1995; 43: 1775-1783Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Triacylglycerols can be by synthesized by sn-1,2-diacylglycerol:acyl-CoA acyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.20) (DGAT) or by various transacylases. The first DGAT gene to be cloned was from mouse (7Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) and is a member of the DGAT1 gene family, which is closely related to the cholesterol:acyl-CoA acyltransferase gene family. Homologous DGAT1 genes have been cloned from Arabidopsis and other plants (8Bouvier-Nave P. Benveniste P. Oelkers P. Sturley S.L. Schaller H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9Hobbs D.H. Lu C. Hills M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Routaboul J. Benning C.

Plant J. 1999; 19: 645-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis there is only one DGAT1 gene, and studies with mutant lines generated by chemical mutagenesis or tDNA tagging indicate that this gene contributes significantly to seed oil content (10Routaboul J. Benning C. Bechtold N. Caboche M. Lepiniec L. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Zou J. Wei Y. Jako C. Kumur A. Selvaraj G. Taylor D.C. Plant J. 1999; 19: 645-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second family of DGAT genes (DGAT2) was first identified in the oleaginous fungus Morteriella ramanniana, based upon purification of a DGAT activity, peptide sequencing, and subsequent isolation of the corresponding genes (12Lardizabal K.D.

DGAT2 genes do not share sequence similarity to DGAT1 genes. Several DGAT2 homologues are reported in fungi, plants, and mammals (13Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Stahl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E.

Most recently, a gene encoding a bifunctional wax ester synthase/acyl:CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase was characterized in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (15Kalscheuer R. Steinbuchel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8075-8082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Several related open reading frames have been identified in Arabidopsis. This novel long-chain acyl-CoA acyltransferase is not related to the DGAT1 or DGAT2 gene families described above, and any role in triacylglycerol synthesis in higher plants still has to be established. Transacylases can produce triacylglycerols via acyl-CoA-independent reactions. A phospholipid:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase has been reported to be involved in triacylglycerol synthesis in yeast and higher plants (16Dahlqvist A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar).Triacylglycerol synthesis has been described in developing seed extracts from various plant species using medium-chain acyl-CoAs and/or medium-chain diacylglycerols in DGAT assays (17Ichihara K. Noda M. Phytochemistry. 1982; 21: 1895-1901Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Cao Y.-Z. Huang A.H.C. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 762-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wiberg E. Tillberg E.

Frequently, the substrate specificity and selectivity of these DGATs are fairly broad. Our in vivo labeling of developing Euonymus seeds with exogenous [14C]acetate produced [acetyl-14C]1,2-diacyl-3-acetins with negligible kinetic lag phase, suggesting that is no intermediate acetyl lipid involved in biosynthesis, i.e. that a transacylase mechanism of synthesis was unlikely. 2M. Pollard, unpublished data.2M. Pollard, unpublished data. In this paper we present evidence for a 1,2-diacylglycerol:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activity in extracts of developing Euonymus seeds, and we describe the isolation and characterization of a Euonymus DGAT1 gene that encodes an DGAT with both long-chain acyl- and acetyltransferase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Developing seeds of Euonymus alatus were harvested during the early fall of 1999 on Michigan State University campus, courtesy of the Grounds Department of Campus Parks, and the endosperm plus embryo tissue were dissected and stored at –80 °C. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Colombia-2) developing seeds were collected from the siliques of 6–8-week-old plants, grown in the growth chambers (22 °C, 16-h light period at 80–100 microeinsteins of light intensity). Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cultures (“wild type” is Invitrogen strain INVSc1; genotype, MATa his3D1 leu2 trp1-289 ura3-52) were grown in either YPD medium or selective synthetic SC medium (according to the protocol of Invitrogen for pYES2CT) supplemented with 2% glucose and were grown at 28 °C in a shaker. Induction media for yeast cells containing constructs consisted of SC medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. Strain H1266 (MATa are2-Δ::LEU2 dga1-Δ::KanMX4 lro1-Δ::TRP1 ADE2) was obtained from Prof. Sten Stymne, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. This line has the three genes encoding almost all of the TAG synthesis capacity of the yeast cell deleted (13Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Stahl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain HB101 was grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth media (21Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 217-222Google Scholar), supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics for selection of the constructs: 100 μg/ml ampicillin (pYES2CT) or 50 μg/ml kanamycin (pE1776).Isolation of Euonymus and Arabidopsis cDNAs Encoding DGAT1— Total RNA was extracted from developing seeds of Euonymus according to the protocol of Chung et al. (22Chung C.H. Kwon O.C. Lee Y.M. Lee S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 108-111Google Scholar) and from developing seeds of Arabidopsis by the method of Ruuska and Ohlrogge (23Ruuska S.A. Ohlrogge J.B. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For Euonymus gene isolation, alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of several plant and mammalian DGAT1 genes showed very well conserved sequences. On the basis of the most conserved sequences between these DGATs, seven sets of degenerated primers were designed and tested in a PCR for accuracy with the Arabidopsis DGAT1 EST AA042298 as template. Two sets of primers (MP1 and MP6) were found to be successful and were used for an RT-PCR with Euonymus total RNA of developing seeds. The cDNA of the total RNA was made with an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). Because the resolution of the products on gel was not clear, the primers were labeled with 32P, and the products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel. A 330-bp radioactive band was recovered, cloned into the TopoPCR2.1 vector, and sequenced. With gene-specific primers designed on the basis of the obtained 330-bp sequence, 3′- and 5′-RACE yielded the cDNA ends, using a RACE kit (Invitrogen). Primers used to obtain the 330-bp fragment are MP1 and MP6, and primers for the 3′-RACE and primers for the 5′-RACE are MP 10, 11, and 16 and MP 30, 15, and 31, respectively.For a full-length Euonymus cDNA, first strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA using an oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase superscript according to Invitrogen. With the 3′ primer DAGFEaYes (containing a BamHI site and a yeast translation signal) and 5′ primer DAGREaYes (containing a XhoI site), a PCR was set up, using high fidelity polymerase Pwo (Roche Applied Science). A product of 1.5 kb, encompassing the coding region and appropriate yeast signals, was obtained, gel-purified (Qiagen kit), and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of the yeast vector pYES2CT (Invitrogen). The presence of the insert was verified by whole cell PCR using DGAT1-specific primers, and the correct base composition was verified by sequence analysis, yielding a suitable clone designated pYES2EaPCR5.1. Data base searches were done using the BLAST algorithm (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69163) Google Scholar). DNA sequences and the deduced amino acid sequence were analyzed with the Vector NTI Suite of Infor-Max. The Arabidopsis DGAT1 cDNA was isolated via RT-PCR of total RNA from developing seeds, using the primers DAGFAtYes (containing a BamHI site) and DAGRAtYes (containing an XhoI site). The 1.6-kb PCR fragment was purified with the kit from Qiagen and cloned in the vector pYES2CT. Whole cell PCR of obtained colonies with DGAT1-specific primers confirmed the presence of the insert, and the DNA sequence was verified, yielding the clone pYES2At2.2.The PCR primers used are as follows: MP1, TANTTNATGNTNGCNCCNAC; MP6, NTCNTGNAANACNGCNGA; MP10, TACCCCATATGTTCGCAAGG; MP11, ATGCCATTGAGAGAGTTTTG; MP16, TGGTTCYGCATGTTCTACTG; MP30, CAGTCCTTGTAGAACTCACGA; MP31, CTCTCTCAATGGCATACAAAAAG; MP15,GCAGTAGAACATGCAGAACC; DAGFEaYes, ATATGGATCCAATAATGTCTATGGCTGCTAACTTGAACGAAG; DAGREaYes, ATATCTCGAGCACAAAACTTGCCTCTACTCCA; DAGFAtYes, ATAGGTACCAATAATGGCGATTTTGGATTCTGCTG; and DAGRAtYes, ATAGGATCCGTTGTTTCATGACATCGATCCT.Expression of Euonymus (Ea) DGAT1 and Arabidopsis (At) DGAT1 in Yeast Strains—The Ea cDNA and the At cDNA, cloned into the yeast vector pYES2CT, as well as the empty vector, were transferred to the S. cerevisiae strains INVSc1 and H1266 via transformation. Three yeast colonies for each construct were grown in liquid medium and analyzed for lipid content. For the growth phase-dependent analysis with semiquantitative lipid analysis by TLC, a small 5-ml culture of each colony was started in SC medium with 2% glucose and grown overnight. This culture was diluted 1:100 in a volume of 200 ml and grown overnight in SC medium with 2% glucose until the OD was between 1 and 2. This culture was subsequently centrifuged and washed with sterile water and resuspended in 400 ml of SC medium supplemented with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose, with a starting OD of 0.4. Growth was followed over time, and 40-ml samples were taken at early and mid-exponential phase and beginning, mid-, and late stationary phase. These samples were washed, pelleted, and stored at –20 °C and analyzed for lipids as described below. For the full and quantitative analysis of lipids, 800 ml of yeast cultures of S. cerevisiae and H1266 carrying either pYES2CT, pYES2EaPCR5.1, or pYES2At2.2 were grown until the start of the stationary phase and were treated as described above.Lipid Analysis—Yeast pellets were quenched by heating in 5 volumes of hot isopropyl alcohol for 10 min to inactivate lipases. The pellets were then vortexed with glass beads and re-extracted with hot isopropyl alcohol. The pellet was extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (25Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). The initial hot isopropyl alcohol extracts were combined with 1.5 volumes of hexane and added to the lipid extraction. The lipids recovered from the extractions were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. For semi-quantitative lipid analysis, the total lipid extract was separated by TLC (0.25-mm thickness K6 Silica Gel 60 A plates, Whatman), developed with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid 80:20:1 (v/v/v). Visualization of bands was carried out with iodine staining, and bands were compared with mass standards.For quantitative lipid analysis and identification, GC standards were prepared. 3-Acetyl-1,2-dipalmitin was prepared by the acetylation of 1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol with acetic anhydride in pyridine and purified by preparative TLC. A mixture of palmitoylstearoyl-3-acetin and distearoyl-3-acetin was prepared by hydrogenation of the purified 1,2-diacyl-3-acetin fraction isolated from E. alatus seeds. Dipentadecanoyl-α-acetin was prepared by the interesterification of triacetin (1 mmol) and tripentadecanoin (2 mmol). These triacylglycerols were heated in a capped tube at 250 °C in the presence of sodium methoxide (0.2 mmol) catalyst for 1 h. The resulting dipentadecanoyl-α-acetin was separated from the scrambled products by preparative TLC. The lipids recovered from the large scale yeast cultures were first weighed, and then triheptadecanoin (lc-TAG) and dipentadecanoyl-α-acetin (ac-TAG) internal standards were added. An aliquot of the sample was hydrogenated. Hydrogenations were carried out by continuous stirring of lipids (5–20 mg) in hexane (2–3 ml) with 2–3 mg of platinum(IV) oxide catalyst and hydrogen at slightly above atmospheric pressure at room temperature for 2 h. The hydrogenated lipid was then treated with ethereal diazomethane to convert free fatty acids to fatty acid methyl esters, because free fatty acids will co-chromatograph with ac-TAG on silica TLC. An aliquot was then transmethylated by using the method of Ichihara et al. (26Ichihara K. Shibahara A. Yamamoto Y. Nakayama T. Lipids. 1996; 31: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and analyzed by GC (with flame ionization detector (FID)) to determine total fatty acid content (against 17:0 from added triheptadecanoin). The lc-TAG and ac-TAG fractions were isolated by preparative TLC using 1-mm thickness K6 Silica Gel 60 A plates (Whatman) and were developed multiple times with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid 80:20:1 (v/v/v). Plates were viewed under UV light after spraying with ethanolic dichlorofluorescein (0.2% w/v) to locate the bands. Lipids were eluted from the silica with hexane/isopropyl alcohol 3:2 (v/v). The hydrogenated triacylglycerols were analyzed by high temperature GC using a DB-5ht capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.1-μm film thickness) with helium carrier gas at 1.5 ml/min. The column was temperature programmed at 5 °C/min to 360 °C, with the injector set at 380 °C and a 40:1 split ratio, and the FID detector temperature was also 380 °C. For GC-MS to identify the hydrogenated ac-TAG fractions, a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph-coupled MSD 5972 mass analyzer was used, with the mass analyzer set in electron impact mode scanning from 40 to 700 atomic mass units. Long-chain TAG and ac-TAG quantification was based on relative FID responses relative to triheptadecanoin or to acetyl-dipentadecanoin internal standards, respectively. Since within ac-TAG or lc-TAG molecular species series observed the response factor variation per the internal standard was small (–5 to –10%, or –5 to +15%, respectively), no response factor correction was included.Microsomal Assays for DGAT Activity—Cultures of S. cerevisiae strains INVSc1 and H1266 carrying pYES2CT, pYES2EaPCR5.1, or pYES2At2.2 were grown in SC medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 1% raffinose and 2% galactose. At the beginning stationary phase, 100-ml cultures were centrifuged (∼0.5 g of yeast pellet), and microsomes were isolated as described by Dahlqvist et al. (16Dahlqvist A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. The yeast pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 m ammonium sulfate) and vortexed vigorously with 2-ml glass beads for 5 min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 15 min at 6 °C. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h at 6 °C. The pellet was resuspended in cold 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, to 1.5–3.5 mg of protein/ml, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations of the yeast microsomes were determined according to the dye-binding method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 248-254Crossref Scopus (213510) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DGAT assays contained 2–5 μl of microsomes (5–15 μg of protein), 100–250 nCi of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA or [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA as substrates (20–50 μm), and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was immediately quenched in hot isopropyl alcohol, and lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (25Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). Total lipids were analyzed on K6 Silica TLC plates developed with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid, 80:20:1 (v/v/v). Labeled bands were located and quantified using an Instant Imager. To identify the putative [14C]ac-TAG fraction, it was recovered from the silica, and reanalyzed by C18 reverse phase TLC and by argentation TLC. For reverse phase TLC, KC18 plates (Whatman) were developed three times in methanol. Argentation TLC plates were prepared by impregnation of K6 silica plates with 15% (w/v) silver nitrate in acetonitrile, activation at 110 °C for 1 h, and triacylglycerols separated by multiple developments in toluene.DGAT Assays with Euonymus Seed Extracts—Frozen embryo and endosperm tissue was homogenized in 2 volumes of chilled buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and filtered through two layers of Miracloth. The residue was re-homogenized in 2 more volumes of buffer and filtered. The filtrates were combined and constitute the cell-free homogenate. The cell-free homogenate was frozen and stored at –70 °C until used for enzyme assays and contained 12–17 mg of protein/ml. The acetyltransferase assay contained [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (100 μm, 200,000 dpm) plus 140 μl of homogenization buffer in a total volume of 200 μl. 1,2-Dihexanoyl-sn-glycerol was added as 1 μl of ethanol solution. To initiate the assay, 20 μl of cell-free homogenate was added. The reaction was run at 25 °C for 15 min and then terminated, and lipids were extracted as described above. Long-chain acyltransferase assays contained [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA and 20–40 μl of cell-free homogenate and were run for 30 min. Normal phase TLC of the labeled lipid products was performed as described above. For subsequent reversed phase TLC analysis, the neutral lipids were eluted from the silica with hexane/isopropyl alcohol. The recovered lipids were analyzed on KC18F reversed phase TLC plates with multiple development in methanol/isopropyl alcohol, 4:1 (v/v). A 3-acetyl-dihexanoin standard was prepared by reacting 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycerol in pyridine:acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) overnight at room temperature.RESULTSDGAT Activity in Cell-free Extracts of Developing Euonymus Seeds—Developing seeds of E. alatus deposit large amounts of ac-TAG as their principal storage lipid (1Kleiman R. Miller R.W. Earle F.R. Wolff I.A. Lipids. 1967; 2: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is no report on the enzyme activity responsible for this sn-3 acetylation reaction. Labeled lipids from incubation of cell-free homogenates prepared from developing E. alatus seed tissues with [14C]acetyl-CoA were analyzed by TLC as shown in Fig. 1. In the absence of exogenous diacylglycerol (DAG), normal phase TLC showed a major labeled band (Fig. 1, lane 2) that co-eluted with endogenous ac-TAG. When this labeled band was recovered and analyzed by C18 reversed phase TLC, the radioactivity migrated with the mass bands corresponding to the major ac-TAG molecular species (Fig. 1, lane 4). To confirm further the reaction as a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glcyerol:acyl-CoA acyltransferase reaction, a unique exogenous DAG, 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycerol, was added to the assays, resulting in a novel band that co-chromatographed with the synthetic 3-acetyl-1,2-dihexanoin standard in both normal (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3) and reverse phase TLC systems (lanes 5 and 6). The acetyltransferase assay gave a linear initial rate of incorporation into ac-TAG up to 15 min, and activity was proportional to protein up to 20 μl of extract (0.3 mg of protein) (data not shown). Extract boiled for 5 min was inactive. There was no measurable lag phase before the label appears in the ac-TAG product, indicating that no detectable [14C]acetyl-lipid intermediate was formed. Thus the activity was defined as a DGAT by the incorporation of the labeled acetyl group from acetyl-CoA, by the acetyl incorporation kinetics, and by the use of a distinctive acyl acceptor. When the homogenate was assayed for long-chain TAG synthesis at 5–60 μm palmitoyl-CoA concentrations, the lc-DGAT activity was about half of the acetyltransferase-specific activity measured at the same acetyl-CoA concentration.Identification of a DGAT1 Gene in Euonymus—Total RNA was isolated from developing E. alata seeds at early to mid-maturation, a period during which the accumulation of acetyl glycerides reaches a maximum,2 and thus mRNA levels for the responsible biosynthetic enzyme(s) would be high. An RT-PCR gene-cloning strategy was used for the isolation of putative TAG synthesis genes. Several classes of TAG-synthesizing genes/proteins have been described, with the DGAT1 family being the first to have been identified. Because nulls for the single DGAT1 gene present in A. thaliana result in the reduction of seed oil content by 35–45% (10Routaboul J. Benning C. Bechtold N. Caboche M. Lepiniec L. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Zou J. Wei Y. Jako C. Kumur A. Selvaraj G. Taylor D.C. Plant J. 1999; 19: 645-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the DGAT1 gene product contributes substantially to seed oil content. As other TAG-synthesizing enzymes might compensate for the loss of the DGAT1 activity, it is likely that in Arabidopsis the DGAT1 gene could contribute much more than half of the total oil accumulation in the wild type. Thus our strategy was to isolate a putative DGAT1 gene from E. alatus and investigate whether it would be involved in 1,2-diacyl-3-acetin production.We searched for a DGAT1-like gene in Euonymus using degenerate primers that were made on the basis of well conserved regions of several DGAT1 proteins. These primers were used for RT-PCR of total RNA from Euonymus developing seeds. A small fragment of"

These advances have required new approaches to preparedness, planning and surveillance, as well as new partnerships and collaborations across a range of disciplines. We examine some of these developments, discuss potential uses and limitations of these approaches, and identify priorities for the future."
https://openalex.org/W2116296702,"Class I myosins are single-headed motor proteins implicated in various motile processes including organelle translocation, ion channel gating, and cytoskeleton reorganization. Dictyostelium discoideum myosin-ID belongs to subclass 1α, whose members are thought to be tuned for rapid sliding. The direct analysis of myosin-ID motor activity is made possible by the production of single polypeptide constructs carrying an artificial lever arm. Using these constructs, we show that the motor activity of myosin-ID is activated 80-fold by phosphorylation at the TEDS site. TEDS site phosphorylation acts by stabilizing the actomyosin complex and increasing the coupling between actin binding and the release of hydrolysis products. A surprising effect of Mg2+ ions on in vitro motility was discovered. Changes in the level of free Mg2+ ions within the physiological range are shown to modulate motor activity by inhibiting ADP release. Our results indicate that higher concentrations of free Mg2+ ions stabilize the tension-bearing actin myosin ADP state and shift the system from the production of rapid movement toward the generation of tension.

Class I myosins are produced by a wide range of organisms and cell types (1Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). They share a conserved motor domain, a light chain-binding domain, and a tail region that contains a polybasic region that directly binds to membranes via electrostatic interactions (2Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Miyata H. Bowers B. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that there are at least four myosin I subclasses. Dictyostelium discoideum myosin-ID is a member of the amoeboid subclass. Despite its name, this is the most widely expressed subclass. Amoeboid class I myosins have two additional domains in their tails that are involved in ATP-insensitive actin binding. The first domain is a region rich in the amino acids glycine, serine, and alanine (or glutamate or serine) (4Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Miyata H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19333-19339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Lynch T.J. Albanesi J.P.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4281-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The regulation of class I myosins from a wide range of organisms appears to be mediated by the phosphorylation of a serine or threonine residue in the motor domain that is located 16 residues upstream of the highly conserved DALAK sequence. Vertebrate class I myosins, like nearly all other myosins, have negatively charged glutamate or aspartate residues at the corresponding position. Therefore the phosphorylation site is generally referred to as the TEDS site (9Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The TEDS site resides in a surface loop that forms part of the actin-binding site. The heavy chain of myosin-ID is an in vitro substrate for members of the p21-activated kinase/STE20 family of protein kinases (10Brzeska H. Young R. Tan C. Szczepanowska J. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

Although the importance of TEDS site phosphorylation for the kinetic behavior and in vivo function of class I myosins is well documented, the direct effect of TEDS site phosphorylation on the motile activity of class I myosins is less well understood. Here, we generated three types of recombinant constructs to analyze the functional properties of D. discoideum myosin-ID. Motor domain constructs were used to determine steady-state and transient kinetic parameters. To directly measure the motor activity of myosin-ID, we generated a motor domain fragment with an artificial lever arm consisting of D. discoideum α-actinin repeats 1 and 2 (15Anson M.

The terminology used (D692 and D692–2R) refers to the type of myosin-I and the site of motor domain truncation. 2R serves as abbreviation for the attachment of two α-actinin repeats to the motor domain. To study the effects of the TEDS site phosphorylation on the motor properties, we generated the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of D692–2R by treatment with λ-phosphatase and Acanthamoeba castellanii myosin-I heavy chain kinase (17Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Hoey J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27056-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additionally, we generated mutant versions of D692–2R, which facilitated the combined characterization of motor and kinetic properties. The serine at the TEDS site of these constructs was replaced by either an alanine residue, to mimic the unphosphorylated state, or a glutamate residue, to mimic the phosphorylated state (18Wang Z.Y.

The values for kcat and Kapp were calculated from fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The apparent second order rate constant for actin binding (kcat/Kapp) was obtained from the calculated ratio of both values.

Wild-type and mutant constructs could be purified in sufficient quantities for detailed kinetic analysis. In the absence of actin filaments, all of the constructs displayed similar ATPase activity. To determine the maximum values of the ATPase activity and the efficiency of coupling between actin and nucleotide binding, we measured the ATPase rates with actin concentrations in the range of 0–60 μm F-actin (Fig. 1A). The parameters kcat, Kapp, and kcat/Kapp were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. They are presented in Table I. Kapp is the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant for actin binding in the presence of ATP, and kcat gives the maximum value of the ATPase activity. The apparent second order rate constant for actin binding (kcat/Kapp) indicates the coupling efficiency between actin and nucleotide binding. The ATPase activity of D692(S332A) was only slightly activated by the addition of F-actin. In contrast the ATPase activity of D692(S332E) was strongly activated by actin and showed a hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration. The coupling efficiency of D692(S332E) is 80 times higher than that of the Ser-to-Ala mutants.Fig. 1Interaction of myosin-ID with F-actin.A, actin stimulation of the steady-state ATPase activities of D692(S332A), D692, and D692(S332E). B, interaction of the actin-bound protein with nucleotides and ATP-induced dissociation of pyr-acto·D692. At low ATP concentrations kobs was linearly dependent upon [ATP], and the slopes define the second order binding K1k+2. In each case the intercept was not significantly different from zero.

Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of myosin-ID by TEDS site phosphorylation, we treated the purified D692–2R motor domain constructs with λ-phosphatase to generate the dephosphorylated form or with myosin-I kinase (12Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to generate the phosphorylated form. Additionally, we used D692–2R constructs in which the serine at the TEDS site was mutated to either glutamate or alanine.For each construct, the movement of at least 50 filaments was followed, and the velocity was determined. The average sliding velocities are summarized in Table II. The phosphorylated form of D692–2R showed an average velocity of 890 nm s-1, whereas the dephosphorylated protein displayed no detectable motile activity. Most filaments stayed on the assay surface after the addition of Mg2+ATP. Similar changes in motile activity were observed for the TEDS site mutants. The Ser-to-Glu mutant moved actin filaments with an average velocity of 670 nm s-1, 13-fold faster than the Ser-to-Ala mutant.Table IIMotile activity of myosin-ID constructsAverage sliding velocityaThe uncertainties represent standard deviations of the mean values,bThe experimental conditions were 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °CD692-2RM765-2Rμm/sUntreated0.13 ± 0.040.82 ± 0.07Phosphatase-treatedNo motilityNAeNA, not applicableKinase-treated0.89 ± 0.10NAS332A0.05 ± 0.02NAS332E0.67 ± 0.09NAHigh [ATP]cThe experimental conditions were 10 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C1.78 ± 0.20dMeasured for D692-2R(S332E)0.83 ± 0.08a The uncertainties represent standard deviations of the mean valuesb The experimental conditions were 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °Cc The experimental conditions were 10 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °Cd Measured for D692-2R(S332E)e NA, not applicable Open table in a new tab TEDS Site Phosphorylation Stabilizes the Acto·Myosin-ID Complex—The rate of actin binding was measured following the exponential decrease in pyrene fluorescence observed on binding of an excess of pyrene-actin to the myosin-ID constructs. The observed rate constants were plotted against pyrene-actin concentration, and the kobs values were linearly dependent upon actin concentration over the range studied (Fig. 1B). The second order rate constants of pyrene-actin binding (k+A) were obtained from the slope of the plot, and the resulting values are summarized in Table III. A 3-fold decrease in k+A was observed for D692(S332E) compared with the Ser- to-Ala mutant.Table IIIActin affinity Treatment of the TEDS site mutant constructs with apyrase did not result in significant changes in the observed rate constants.

The observed process could be fitted to a single exponential, where kobs corresponds directly to k-A. In contrast to their similar rates of actin binding, the mutant constructs displayed significant differences in the rates of actin dissociation. Actin dissociates 30 times faster from D692(S332A) than from the Ser-to-Glu mutant. The dissociation equilibrium constant for actin binding (KA), as calculated from the ratio of k-A and k+A, indicates an 11-fold increased actin affinity for D692(S332E) compared with the Ser-to-Ala mutant (Scheme 1).Binding of Nucleotide to Myosin-ID—The rate constants measured for nucleotide binding to wild-type constructs and to TEDS site mutants were mostly identical. Therefore, although all of the measurements were performed with wild-type and mutant constructs, we will refer in most instances only to the wild-type construct.Rates of ATP binding (K1k+2) and ADP binding (k-6/K7) were monitored from the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence following the addition of excess ATP or ADP (Scheme 2). The observed increases in intrinsic protein fluorescence were 10 and 14% for ADP and ATP binding, respectively. Myosin-ID has the conserved tryptophan in the relay loop, which reports the open to closed transition of Switch II that accompanies ATP hydrolysis (36Batra R. Manstein D.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additionally, we measured the binding of the nucleotide analogues 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate and 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine 5′-diphosphate by following the fluorescence enhancement after mixing with the D692 motor domain constructs. The results of these measurements were analyzed as described previously (30Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Mus. Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and are summarized in Table IV. Our results show that for myosin-ID the apparent second order association rate constants (K1k+2 or k-6/K7) are similar for ATP, ADP, and the mant analogues. At high ATP concentrations the rate of binding saturates for D692 at 640 s-1. For most myosins this maximum rate constant has been attributed to the rate constant for the ATP hydrolysis step (k+3 + k-3), which is signaled by the fluorescence change of the tryptophan located at the tip of the relay loop (36Batra R.

Open table in a new tab As mentioned above, ATP binding to myosin-ID constructs produced a larger fluorescence increase than the binding of ADP. Therefore, the displacement of ADP by ATP could be followed from the net increase in fluorescence upon displacement of excess ADP from the D692-ADP complex by the addition of a larger excess ATP. The rate of ADP release from D692 (k+6) was 0.60 s-1. At intermediate ADP concentrations (<40 μm), the reaction observed on adding excess ATP to D692 could be described by two exponentials. The amplitude of the fast phase declined, and that of the slow phase increased with increasing ADP. The fast process is the rate at which ATP binds to unliganded myosin (K1k+2[ATP]), and the slow process is the rate at which ATP replaces ADP bound to myosin (k+6). Accordingly the slow phase was independent of the concentration of ATP used. The dependence of the amplitudes on the ADP concentration was described by hyperbolic functions, which define the equilibrium constant of ADP binding to D692 (K6K7). The value obtained for D692 was 1.9 μm (Table IV).Nucleotide Binding to Acto·Myosin-ID—The binding of ATP to the acto·myosin-ID complex could be followed by observing the exponential increase in fluorescence of pyrene-actin, because the complex formed by F-actin and D692 dissociates following the addition of excess ATP. The observed rate constants were linearly dependent upon ATP concentration in the range of 5–25 μm (Fig. 2A). The apparent second order binding constant K1k+2 (Scheme 3) is defined by the gradient of the plot. Values of 0.49 μm-1 s-1 were obtained for D692, and similar values were obtained with the mutant constructs. At high ATP concentrations (>2 mm), the observed rate constants saturate, and the dependence on the ATP concentration could be described by a hyperbola, where the maximum value of kobs defines k+2 (Fig. 2A, inset).Fig. 2Transient kinetic analysis of the interaction of myosin-ID with actin and nucleotides.A, ATP-induced dissociation of the actomyosin complex. The observed rate constant for D692 is linearly dependent on the ATP concentration in the range 5–25 μm.

By 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends assay and DNA sequencing from mouse tissues and 7–15-day stage embryos, mRFC transcripts with four unique 5′ noncoding exons, designated mRFC-a,-b,-c, and -d, were identified mapping over 6300 bp. The 5′ noncoding exons were characterized by multiple transcription starts and, for form b, two alternate splice forms. mRFC transcript forms were measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in mouse tissues and embryos and in L1210 leukemia and BNL CL.2 liver cell lines. The highest mRFC levels were detected in kidney and brain. mRFC-b and -c were the major transcript forms, with low levels of mRFC-a and -d. The 5′-flanking regions for exons a–d each exhibited promoter activity in reporter gene assays. mRFC transcripts and individual noncoding exons were measured in small intestine and kidney from mice fed folate-deficient or -replete diets. Mice fed the folate-deficient diet exhibited a significant (13.8-fold) increase in total mRFC transcripts and protein in the small intestine, reflecting increases in each of the mRFC-b, -c, and -d forms. Only minor changes in mRFC transcript levels or distributions were detected for kidney. Levels of folate-binding protein α were also increased in both small intestine and kidney in folate-deficient mice (91- and 2-fold, respectively). Multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1 and 3 were, likewise, elevated in intestine from folate-deficient mice (53- and 168-fold, respectively); however, there were no significant changes in kidney. Our results document the existence of four unique noncoding exons and promoters for mRFC and demonstrate a facile induction of mRNAs for mRFC and multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1 and 3 in intestine in response to changes in dietary folate intake.

Tetrahydrofolate cofactors are essential to cell survival, since they participate in one-carbon transfer reactions in biosynthetic pathways leading to the purine nucleotides, thymidylate, serine, and methionine (1Stokstad E.L.R. Picciano M.F. Stokstad E.L.R. Greogory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Since mammalian cells cannot synthesize folates de novo, they must obtain these derivatives from the outside environment. A number of transport systems for folates have been described, including: the family of membrane-localized folate-binding proteins (FBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: FBP, folate-binding protein; RFC, reduced folate carrier; hRFC, human RFC; mRFC, mouse RFC; 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; MRP, multidrug resistance-associated protein; contig, group of overlapping clones. that mediate folate uptake by an endocytotic process (2Antony A.C.

The best characterized route for the membrane transport of tetrahydrofolate cofactors into mammalian cells and tissues is the ubiquitously expressed RFC (3Matherly L.H. Goldman I.D. Vitam.

Reflecting its profound physiologic and pharmacologic importance, there has been intense interest in the molecular biology and regulation of RFC. The mouse RFC (mRFC) cDNA was the first RFC cDNA to be cloned in 1994 (11Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this was soon followed by homologous human RFC (hRFC) cDNAs (12Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

These developments paved the way for the structural characterization of the mRFC gene in 1997 (16Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Both mRFC and hRFC transcripts are characterized by heterogeneous 5′-ends (12Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 332: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), yet, for both species, there is only a single RFC locus, on chromosome 10 for the mouse (21Roy K. Chiao J.H. Spengler B.A. Tolner B. Yang C.H. Biedler J.L. Sirotnak F.M. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1998; 105: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and chromosome 21 for the human gene (13Moscow J.A. Gong M. He R. Sgagias M.K. Dixon K.H. Anzick S.L. Meltzer P.S. Cowan K.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3790-3794PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of the mRFC and hRFC genes were initially considered to be similar, in terms of their sizes (∼23 kb versus 27 kb, respectively), and the numbers (i.e. five) and intron junctions for the coding exons (16Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, for both mRFC and hRFC, two alternative upstream noncoding exons and promoters were originally identified (designated 1 and 1a for the mRFC gene and A and B for the hRFC gene). However, other than their high GC contents, there appeared to be no significant sequence similarities in the upstream noncoding exons or regulatory regions between the species. More recent studies have shown that the hRFC gene locus is significantly larger than originally believed, reflecting the presence of as many as six noncoding regions (designated hRFC-A1/A2, -A, -B, -C, -D, and -E) and multiple promoters, spanning more than 35 kb upstream of the AUG translational start in coding exon 1 (22Whetstine J.R.

Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5111-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we now reconsider the upstream structure and regulation of the mRFC gene as a pretext to better understanding its in vivo regulation in relation to embryonic development (24Zhao R.

Horm. 2003; 66: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Our results document the existence of four unique 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) and promoters for mRFC. Moreover, we demonstrate a facile in vivo induction/repression of gene expression for both luminal (RFC) and basolateral (MRP1 and MRP3) intestinal folate transporters in response to levels of dietary folate intake. Chemicals and Reagents—Primers were purchased either from Invitrogen or Sigma. Lipofectamine™ 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction and modifying enzymes, reporter gene vectors (pGL3-Basic and pRLSV40), and other molecular biologicals were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Tissue culture reagents and supplies were purchased from assorted vendors with the exception of iron-supplemented calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources in the highest available purity. The affinity-purified AE390 antibody to the mouse RFC (27Wang Y. Zhao R. Russell R.G. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. I. David Goldman (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). Cell Culture—L1210 murine leukemia cells were provided by Dr. I. David Goldman (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated iron-supplemented calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2, 95% air. BNL CL.2 mouse liver cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. Characterization of mRFC Transcript 5′-UTRs by 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE) assay and RT-PCR—Eleven commercial mouse embryo and tissue total RNAs (7-day embryo, 11-day embryo, 15-day embryo, 17-day embryo, liver, lung, smooth muscle, testis, kidney, brain, and uterus) were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). mRFC transcripts were analyzed by 5′-RACE with a SMART RACE kit (Clontech) as in our earlier study (23Flatley R.M. Payton S.G. Taub J.W. Matherly L.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5111-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using gene-specific antisense primers (5′-GATGAAGCTTTCCCCAGGACGCAAC-3′ for primary PCR and 5′-GTGGTCCTGCCTGGGCTCTTCGTATG-3′ for nested secondary PCR, respectively). Secondary PCR products were ligated into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega), and, following transformation into competent JM109 cells, plasmid DNAs were prepared from 16–27 colonies, and 5′-RACE inserts were sequenced with the M13 forward primer. Sequence data were aligned to mouse RFC genomic DNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number GI 28497897) by BLAST 2.0. For rare 5′-RACE products (i.e. exons a and d), additional confirmation of the transcription start sites was performed, using sense 5′-RACE nested universal primer A (Clontech) and an antisense noncoding exon-specific primer (5′-CACCGGGTGAGGAGTCACGTC-3′ for exon a and 5′-CACCCCAGCAGGGATGTTCAG-3′ for exon d), with first round 5′-RACE products from kidney, brain, and uterus as templates. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 4 min (1 cycle), 94 °C for 30 s, and 62 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 45 s (35 cycles), followed by 72 °C for 7 min (1 cycle). The amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, and 10 clones were sequenced with M13 forward and reverse primers. To confirm mRFC noncoding exon sequences identified in murine tissues and cell lines, total RNAs were reverse transcribed from 1 μgof total RNA using random hexamer primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. cDNAs were amplified with 5′-UTR-specific sense primers for exons a (5′-CATATTGACGTGACTCCTCAC-3′), b (5′-GAGCTAGGAATCCATTCTATGC-3′), c (5′-GAGCTGAGACCCGGTCAAG-3′), and d (5′-CTGAGCATCAGCTGAACATC-3′) and a common antisense primer (5′-GATGAAGCTTTCCCCAGGACGCAAC-3′) within coding exon 1. For the rare 5′-UTRs (a and d) that could not be detected by primary PCR, secondary amplifications were performed with the noncoding exon-specific primers and a nested antisense primer within coding exon 1 (5′-GTGGTCCTGCCTGGGCTCTTC-3′). PCR conditions for all amplifications were 94 °C for 4 min (1 cycle), 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s (35 cycles) and 72 °C for 7 min (1 cycle). The amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector for transformation and sequencing. Real Time RT-PCR Quantitation of mRFC Transcripts—Total RNAs were isolated from BNL CL.2 and L1210 cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA from mouse small intestine was purchased from BioChain Institute, Inc. (Hayward, CA). RNAs from snap-frozen small intestine and kidney samples from the in vivo folate feeding experiment (see below) were prepared with a RNeasy RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of RNAs prepared from cell lines or tissues, using random hexamer primers and an RT-PCR kit (PerkinElmer) and purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Total mRFC transcripts, mRFC-a,-b,-c, and -d 5′-UTRs, and 18 S RNAs were quantitated with a LightCycler real time PCR machine (Roche Applied Science). PCRs contained 2 μl of purified cDNA or standard plasmid, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm each sense and antisense primers, and 2 μl of FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I enzyme-SYBR reaction mix (Roche Applied Science). PCR amplifications for the individual 5′-UTRs were performed with sense primers to 5′-UTR sequences (exon a, 5′-CATATTGACGTGACTCCTCAC-3′; exon b, 5′-GAGCTAGGAATCCATTCTATGC-3′; exon c, 5′-GAGCTGAGACCCGGTCAAG-3′; and exon d, 5′-CTGAGCATCAGCTGAACATC-3′) and a common antisense primer located in coding exon 1 (5′-GTGGTCCTGCCTGGGCTCTTCGTATG-3′). Total mRFC transcripts were amplified by sense (5′-GTGGAGTGTCATCTTGGCCCG-3′) and antisense (5′-CGTTCCAGGAGGAAGGGTGTG-3′) primers within coding exon 1. 18 S RNA was measured with sense (5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′) and antisense (5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′) primers. For all amplifications, PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturing step of 99 °C for 10 min, followed by 35–55 cycles of 95 °C, 62 °C for 10s, and 72 °C for 5s, with melting curve analysis from 40 to 99 °C to ensure specificity. External standards were prepared by amplification of cDNAs for 18 S RNA, total mRFC, and the individual 5′-UTRs, using the above primers. The amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, and the vectors were linearized with ApaI and used to prepare external standard curves. Total mRFC and transcript levels for each 5′-UTR were normalized to 18 S RNA. All real time PCR results were expressed as mean values from 2–3 separate experiments using the same cDNA preparation. Transcript levels for MRP1, MRP3, MRP4, and FBP-α were measured by real time PCR on cDNAs prepared as described above, using the following primers: MRP1, 5′-AGAACACGGTCCTCACATGGGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCCAGCAGATGATCCACAGAA-3′ (antisense); MRP3, 5′-GCTGTGGAGAGAGTCAAGGAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGCACATGAACAGTCACGTTC-3′ (antisense); MRP4, 5′-ACTGGTCATAAGCGGAGACTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCTTTGTTAAGGAGGGCTTCC-3′ (antisense); and FBP-α, 5′-GCTCACCTGATGACTGTGCAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAACAGCAGGAATTCGTCTTC-3′ (antisense). PCR conditions were identical to those for mRFC, above. Standards were prepared by PCR with the above primers, cloning the amplicons into pGEM-T-Easy vector and linearizing the plasmids with ApaI, as described above. Preparation of mRFC-luciferase Reporter Constructs—Genomic sequences (positions –4315 to –7000, relative to the ATG translational start in exon 1), including putative mRFC promoters flanking noncoding exons mRFC-a (positions –5049 to –4315), mRFC-b (positions –5615 to –4945), mRFC-c (positions –6101 to –5616), and mRFC-d (positions –7002 to –6104), were amplified from mouse genomic DNA isolated from whole blood. An XhoI restriction site was added to the sense primer, and a HindIII restriction site was incorporated into the antisense primer. The primers included promoter a sense (5′-GACTACTCGAGTACGGTTCTGTTCCTTCCGGTG-3′) and antisense (5′-GACATAAGCTTCACCGGGTGAGGAGTCACGTC-3′), promoter b sense (5′-GAATACTCGAGTAGGGGGCTCGTAAAGGGGCTCAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GAATCAAGCTTACCCTGCCTGGAGCTTTGTAG-3′), promoter c sense (5′-GACAGCTCGAGAGTTTGAAAGATTGGGGGA-3′) and antisense (5′-GAATCAAGCTTACCCGTCCAGCGCTTGACCGG-3′), and promoter d sense (5′-GAAGTCTCGAGGCCATGCAGACTGGATACCACT-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTGTAAGCTTCACCCCAGCAGGGATGTTCAG-3′) primers (restriction sites are underlined). PCR was performed with Easy-A high fidelity PCR cloning enzyme (Stratagene) using the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 55 s; and one cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. The amplicons were digested with XhoI and HindIII and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of XhoI/HindIII-digested pGL3-Basic vector. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—BNL CL.2 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well poly-l-lysine-coated dishes 24 h before transfection. When cells were 70% confluent, 2 μg of the mRFC promoter constructs or empty pGL3-Basic (negative control) were co-transfected with 10 ng of pRLSV40 plasmid using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were incubated for 6 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity by the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) with a Turner BioSystems Luminometer model TD-20/20. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized with Renilla luciferase activities. All transfections were performed in triplicate. Mouse Feeding Experiments—Experiments were performed with male C57BL/6-specific pathogen-free mice (3–4 months old) maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed standard mouse chow and water ad libitum. Mice were assigned to two dietary groups and were fed AIN93G-purified isoenergetic diets (Dyets, Inc., Lehigh Valley, PA). The control group received a folate-replete diet containing 2 mg/kg folic acid. The experimental group received a folate-deficient diet containing 0 mg/kg folic acid. All diets were supplemented with 1% succinyl sulfathiazole. The experimental diets were continued for 8 weeks, at which time animals were anesthetized under CO2 and sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and tissues were collected (see below). Serum folates were measured with the SimulTRAC-SNB radioassay kit for vitamin B12 (57Co) and folate (125I) (ICN Diagnostics, Orangeburg, NY), as described previously (28Cabelof D.C. Raffoul J.J. Nakamura J. Kapoor D. Abdalla H. Heydari A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36504-36513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Eighteen kidney and small intestine samples (nine from mice fed folate-deficient diets, nine from mice fed normal folate-replete diets) were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the small intestine, a 4-cm section was collected and rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to freezing; a 1-cm segment ∼1 cm proximal to the stomach was used for preparing RNA, as described above. RNAs were used to prepare cDNAs for real time RT-PCR analysis of total mRFC transcripts and mRFC 5′-UTRs, along with transcript levels for MRP1, -3, and -4 and FBP-α (see above). Immunohistochemistry—Cryosections were prepared from small intestines, fixed, and treated with affinity-purified primary mouse RFC antibody (AE390) (27Wang Y. Zhao R. Russell R.G. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1513: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Slides were developed with a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Comparative Promoter Analysis of Human and Mouse RFC—Homology analysis of the mouse and human RFC upstream regulatory regions was performed with the mVISTA program (available on the World Wide Web at www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista/index.shtml). Putative or confirmed regulatory sequences for mouse (a, b, c, and d) and human (A1/A2, A, B, C, D) RFC promoters were analyzed for transfactor binding sites with the GenomatiX MatInspector program (available on the World Wide Web at www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin/./eldorado/main.pl). Identification of Heterogeneous 5′-UTRs Transcribed from Four Distinct Noncoding Exons in the mRFC Gene—5′-RACE was used to characterize the extent of 5′-UTR heterogeneity for mRFC transcripts from seven mouse tissues (liver, lung, muscle, testis, brain, kidney, and uterus) and four mouse stage embryos (7, 11, 15, and 17-day). 16–27 5′-RACE clones for each tissue/embryo were subjected to DNA sequencing for a total of 234 5′-RACE clones. DNA sequences were aligned with a mouse chromosome 10 genomic contig (positions 2860047–2904354; accession number GI28497897). 5′-RACE clones clustered over four regions (designated a–d), spanning 2055 bp and up to 6270 bp upstream of the translation start in coding exon 1 (see schematic in Fig. 1A). The composite sequences for the a, b, c, and d groups of 5′-RACE clones are shown in Fig. 1B and are characterized by multiple and reproducible 5′ termini in separate tissues, consistent with the presence of multiple transcriptional start sites. The distribution of 5′-RACE clones showed tissue/embryo specificity (not shown). Over 95% of the clones fell into groups b and c, corresponding to the mRFC noncoding exons 1 and 1a previously reported by Tolner et al. (16Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Group b is composed of two apparent splice forms including a major form (designated bi and underlined in Fig. 1B) that has a 3′-end identical to that for the major mRFC noncoding exon 1 previously reported (16Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), along with 51 additional 5′ nucleotides. A less frequent form, designated bii, included an additional 105 bp of 3′ sequence (Fig. 1B). The majority of the 5′-RACE clones in group c had 5′-ends within 20 bp of that originally reported for exon 1a by Sirotnak and co-workers (16Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), although another form included 70 bp of additional upstream sequence (Fig. 1B). Finally, two novel groups of 5′-RACE clones were detected in assorted tissues, including group a in brain and testis (147 and 132 bp, respectively), mapping between group b and the mRFC coding exon 1, and group d, identified in nine clones from assorted tissues and embryos and mapping upstream of group c (Fig. 1A). To further confirm the presence of the four unique 5′-UTRs identified by 5′-RACE in mRFC transcripts, RNAs from testis and a 15-day embryo that expressed particular sequences by 5′-RACE (forms a, b, and c and forms b, c, and d, respectively) were reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified with upstream primers to each of the mRFC noncoding exons and downstream primers to the mRFC coding sequence in exon 1. For the a and d 5′-UTRs, a secondary amplification step was also performed. For all four 5′-UTRs, specific products of the expected sizes were amplified (mRFC-a, 135 bp; mRFC-b, 245 and 348 bp; mRFC-c, 223 bp; and mRFC-d, 140 bp; results not shown). These were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Tissue-specific Expression of Total mRFC Transcripts and mRFC 5′-UTRs by Real Time RT-PCR—5′-RACE has an inherent statistical bias, since 5′-RACE results can be significantly impacted by template secondary structures (29Turner F.B. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35960-35968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, to better quantitate mRFC transcript levels and the individual 5′-UTRs identified by 5′-RACE, we used real time RT-PCR. Individual 5′-UTRs were screened with upstream primers to the noncoding sequences and a common downstream coding sequence primer, whereas total mRFC transcripts were assayed with sense and antisense coding sequence primers. Transcripts were normalized to levels of 18 S RNA. Commercial RNAs were analyzed for the assorted mouse tissues used for 5′-RACE, along with RNAs from mouse small intestine and L1210 murine leukemia and BNL CL.2 murine liver cells in culture. mRFC transcripts were detected in all RNA samples yet spanned a 36-fold range (Fig. 2). The highest mRFC levels were detected in kidney and brain, and low but still detectable levels were detected in lung, small intestine, and uterus. These results generally parallel those for mRFC transcripts on Northern blots of total RNAs from select normal mouse tissues (30Said H.M. Nguyen T.T. Dyer D.L. Cowan K.H. Rubin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1281: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the results shown in Fig. 2, appreciable levels of mRFC transcripts were present in the four-stage (7-, 11-, 15-, and 17-day) embryos; however, changes in mRFC levels were insignificant as a function of embryo stage. Among the mRFC-a, -b, -c, and -d 5′-UTRs, exon b was the predominant form in 7 of 10 tissues and cell lines examined (Fig. 3). Exon b also predominated in mRFC transcripts from the early stage embryos. However, there was no change in 5′-UTR usage with embryo stage. For the lung and kidney RNAs, 5′-UTR sequence derived from exon c clearly predominated, although these tissues expressed the lowest and highest mRFC transcripts, respectively, among our tissue cohort. An appreciable amount of the mRFC-c 5′-UTR (>50% of exon b) was also detected in other tissues. Low levels of exons a and d were detected in assorted tissues by real time PCR (≤15% of total mRFC transcripts), with the highest level of mRFC-a transcripts in testis, and in L1210 and BNL CL.2 cells. The highest levels of mRFC-d transcripts were detected in kidney and small intestine. Identification of Four mRFC Promoters—By analogy with hRFC and other multipromoter genes, the unique noncoding exons for mRFC are likely to be transcribed from unique promoters. In previous studies, promoter activity was localized to the 5′-flanking regions immediately upstream of the mRFC-b a"
https://openalex.org/W2038370775,"Axin is a major scaffold protein, interacting with diverse molecules involved in a number of signaling pathways. Axin can undergo dimer/oligomerization via its DIX domain. Here we show that whereas deletion of the DIX domain at the C terminus rendered Axin incapable of forming dimer, a larger deletion of the C-terminal region restored the ability of Axin to form dimers. Detailed analyses revealed that Axin actually contains two separate domains (D and I) in addition to the DIX domain for homodimerization. The D, I, and DIX domains alone can form homodimers. Interestingly, D and I domains strongly interact with each other, suggesting that Axin can form an intramolecular structure through D and I interaction in the absence of DIX. We also found that DIX-DIX homodimeric interaction is weak but that point mutations in the DIX domain abolished Axin homodimerization. We propose a model to suggest that Axin forms homodimeric interactions through three domains, D, I, and DIX. More importantly, lack of DIX-DIX interaction caused by point mutations in the DIX domain or deletion causes Axin to form an intramolecular loop through the D and I domains, disallowing homodimer formation. Ccd1 interacts with Axin D domain yet fails to interact with AxinΔDIX, confirming that D is masked after D-I looping. The Axin mutants that are defective in homodimer formation fail to activate JNK but have no effect on β-catenin signaling. Our findings have thus provided a structural basis of conformational changes in Axin, which may underlie the diversity of Axin functions.

Our findings have thus provided a structural basis of conformational changes in Axin, which may underlie the diversity of Axin functions. Axin plays a central role in the regulation of Wnt signaling, in which it serves as a scaffold to assemble the APC-glycogen synthase kinase-3β-β-catenin complex for down-regulation of β-catenin (1Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry W.L. II I Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). It contains respective binding sites for APC, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, β-catenin, and casein kinases (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

At the C terminus, it contains a DIX domain, known for its conservation between dishevelled (Dvl) 1The abbreviations used are: Dvl, dishevelled; aa, amino acid(s); MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney. and Axin (1Zeng L.

The Dvl proteins contain a DIX domain at the N terminus and two additional highly conserved domains: a central PDZ domain, and a DEP domain (8Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 9Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Dvl in cells induces the accumulation of β-catenin and the activation of TCF (10Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 11Yanagawa S. Lee J. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In response to Wnt signals, Dvl forms a heterodimer with Axin through their DIX domains, leading to enhanced association of glycogen synthase kinase-3β with Frat and decreased phosphorylation of β-catenin (6Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14066-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, Axin interacts with a recently identified DIX domain protein, Ccd1, which is a positive Wnt regulator (14Shiomi K. Uchida H. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Wong C.K. Luo W. Deng Y. Zou H. Ye Z. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39366-39373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Axin association with Dvl also appears to play a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics in a β-catenin-independent manner (16Ciani L. Krylova O. Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Salinas P.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Clearly, the DIX domain plays an important role linking the DIX domain proteins in controlling Wnt signaling. In addition to the Wnt pathways, protein complex formations via the DIX domain also exert regulatory roles in Axin-mediated JNK activation. First of all, Axin needs to be homodimerized via an intact DIX domain. DvlΔDEP (a mutant Dvl that loses the ability to activate JNK) heterodimerization with Axin via their DIX domains abolishes JNK activation by Axin (17Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The DIX domain of Ccd1 binds to an Axin domain, albeit not to the DIX domain of Axin, and inhibits MEKK binding to Axin and JNK activation (15Wong C.K. Luo W. Deng Y. Zou H. Ye Z. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39366-39373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions must elicit conformational changes to modulate distinctive functions in controlling different signaling pathways. Conformational changes in Axin have been manifested by the following observations as well. First of all, the particular deletion of the MEKK1 binding site (AxinΔMID) failed to activate JNK, but other deletions around this region can activate JNK perfectly well (18Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Luo W. Ng W.W. Jin L.H. Ye Z. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Second, Wnt pathway factors including glycogen synthase kinase-3β, CKI, and Ccd1, can compete against MEKK1 binding, despite the fact that they bind to Axin domains far apart from their respective binding regions (15Wong C.K. Luo W. Deng Y. Zou H. Ye Z. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39366-39373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Third, MEKK1 and MEKK4, which bind to Axin through distinct domains, also compete against each other for Axin binding (19Luo W. Ng W.W. Jin L.H. Ye Z. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importantly, in response to Wnt signals, Axin can be relocated to plasma membrane together with Dvl (21Cliffe A. Hamada F. Bienz M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 960-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although it is generally agreed that DIX domain proteins rely on their DIX domains for mutual interactions, detailed information is lacking and even controversial (6Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, Axin formed homodimer via its DIX domain (23Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We found recently that Axin actually did not utilize its DIX domain to interact with Ccd1; rather, a region N-terminal to the DIX domain is critical for Axin-Ccd1 interaction (15Wong C.K. Luo W. Deng Y. Zou H. Ye Z. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39366-39373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whereas it was shown that the DIX domain of Axin is sufficient for complex formation with Dvl, the region of amino acid (aa) residues 530–712 of Axin, N-terminal to the DIX domain, was also important for its direct interaction with Dvl (6Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Advance in understanding the structure and function of Axin has been hindered by lack of the crystal structure of the entire Axin protein, although the domains for interacting with APC and glycogen synthase kinase-3β have been resolved (24Spink K.E. Polakis P. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2270-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Yeo M. Good V.M. Thompson V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the course of characterization of the Axin DIX domain mutants identified from cancer tissues (26Jin L.H. Shao Q.J. Luo W. Ye Z.Y. Li Q. Lin S.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and during domain mapping for HIPK2 binding that lies in region N-terminally adjacent to the DIX domain (27Rui Y.N. Xu Z. Lin S.Y. Li Q. Rui H. Luo W. Zhou H-M. Cheung P.-Y. Wu Z. Ye Z. Li P. Han J. Lin S.-C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4583-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we found that single mutations in the DIX domain could abolish dimer formation and observed perplexing or even contradictory patterns of dimerization among different C-terminal deletion mutants. As a result, we carried out thorough studies to identify the determinants involved in Axin dimer formation. In the present study, we unexpectedly found that Axin contains at least three separable domains for homodimer formation that are termed the D, I, and DIX domains, in order from N-proximal to C-proximal. The Axin DIX-DIX interaction is weak; nevertheless, it seems to augment or prime a conformation for D and I domains to form intermolecular homodimer. In the absence of the DIX domain, the I domain loops back to interact with D domain, explaining why AxinΔDIX cannot form homodimer. Furthermore, these three domains in fact also participate in interaction with the other two DIX domain proteins, Dvl and Ccd1. We have thus provided the structural basis that endows Axin with the ability to form diverse complexes in mediating multiple biological functions. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (18Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J.

Transfection into 293T cells was carried out by the calcium method as described previously. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 4 μg per 60-mm dish using empty vector when necessary. Plasmid Construction—Plasmids pCMV5-HA-Axin, pCMV5-Myc-A-xin, pCMV5-HA-AxinC1, pCMV5-HA-AxinC2, pCMV5-Myc-Dvl2, and pCMV5-Myc-Ccd1 were constructed as described elsewhere (15Wong C.K. Luo W. Deng Y.

To construct pCMV5-HA/Myc-Axin DIX, mouse Axin cDNA was digested with EcoRI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and digested with BamHI. The EcoRI-BamHI C-terminal fragment of Axin was inserted into pCMV5-HA or pCMV5-Myc vector digested with NcoI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and digested with BamHI. To create pCMV5-HA/Myc-AxinCD1, pCMV5-HA/Myc-AxinCD2, and pCMV5-HA/Myc-Axin-CD3, fragments of aa 600–633, aa 600–667, and aa 600–700 were generated using PCR and inserted into pCMV5-HA-Axin or Myc-Axin digested with SpeI and SmaI. The oligonucleotides for PCR were 5′-tattcaccgtctagaggctgtcc-3′ and 5′-gggctatgtgggatcttggatgaaaag-3′ for pCMV5-HA/Myc-AxinCD1, 5′-tattcaccgtctagaggctgtcc-3′ and 5′-actagttttaccaccaaaggg-3′ for pCMV5-HA/Myc-Axin CD2, and 5′-tattcaccgtctagaggctgtcc-3′ and 5′-gggctatgtgggatcttggatgaaaag-3′ for pCMV5-HA/-Myc-AxinCD3. To generate pCMV5-HA-AxinCD4, the fragment of aa 634-EcoRI was created by PCR and inserted into pCMV5-HA-AxinΔDIX digested with SpeI and SmaI. The oligonucleotides for PCR were 5′-atgcagtggatcattgagggag-3′ and 5′-actagttttaccaccaaaggg-3′. The constructs pCMV5-HA/Myc-GFP-AxinD and AxinI were made by fusing the PCR-generated Axin fragment C-terminally to the GFP. The oligonucleotides for PCR were 5′-catatggtgagcaagggcgaggagctg-3′, 5′-tggaaggtgccttgtacagctcgtccatgc-3′, 5′-ctgtacaaggcaccttccaaaagaaacacc-3′, and 5′-gggctagatcttctggttcttctc-3′ for GFP-AxinD; and 5′-catatggtgagcaagggcgaggagctg-3′, 5′-tggacaagggcttgtacagctcgtccatgc-3′, 5′-ctgtacaagcccttgtccatcgagcgtcc-3′, and 5′-aggggtcacagggatgccacccg-3′ for GFP-AxinI. For construction of pCMV5-HA-Axin MD1 and MD2, Axin regions of aa 600–667 and aa 600–700 were generated by PCR, and the oligonucleotides for PCR were 5′-tattcaccgtctagaggctgtcc-3′ and 5′-cctggagctttcatgggcctgc-3′ for aa 600–667 and 5′-tattcaccgtctagaggctgtcc-3′ and 5′-tgtgggatcttggatgaaaag-3′ for aa 600–700. These fragments, together with the PCR-generated Axin region of aa 752-CT, were cloned into CMV5-HA-Axin digested with XbaI and BamHI to create pCMV5-HA-Axin MD1 and MD2, respectively. The oligonucleotides for aa 752-CT (C-terminal) were 5′-agcattgttgtggcctactattt-3′ and 5′-aggggtcacagggatgccacccg-3′. Point Mutagenesis—To construct full-length Axin constructs containing point mutations in the DIX domain (pCMV5-HA/Myc-AxinF759R, AxinF780R, AxinK796A, AxinF807R, and AxinL817E), PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate C-terminal fragments, which were then fused to the wild-type 5′-flanking sequence. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested at 40 h after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated 10 times for 1 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. HA- or Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-HA, anti-Myc (9E10), antibody-linked protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After separation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Diagnostics), the proteins in immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using the respective antibodies as described previously. Immunokinase Assays—Approximately 40 h after transfection, 293T cells were lysed, and assays for the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated FLAG-JNK1 protein were performed in a kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2) using 0.5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1–79) as substrate, as described previously (18Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Phospho-c-Jun antibody was used in subsequent Western blotting to examine the phosphorylation of c-Jun. TOPFLASH Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—HEK 293T cells were transfected in 6-well dishes at 90% confluence with 0.5 μg of TOPFLASH luciferase reporter (Upstate Biotechnology) and 0.2 μg of LEF-1 together with 2.0 μg of the expression plasmids indicated. After 24 h, cells were treated with Wnt3a-conditioned medium. At 12 h after the additional incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed. Lysates were then collected and assayed for luciferase activity by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All transfections were carried out in triplicate at least five independent times, and error bars represent S.E. DIX Domain Is Not Sufficient for Maximal Axin Homodimerization—Axin is a polypeptide with 832 amino acid residues for the short and most predominant form, with a DIX domain located at the extreme C terminus. It was found previously that Axin lacking the DIX domain failed to form homodimer/oligomer (17Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 28Sakanaka C. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14090-14093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that the DIX domain is critical for homodimerization. In order to clarify the importance of the DIX domain in homodimer/oligomerization, we first tested whether DIX domain alone was sufficient for Axin dimer formation. Axin DIX domain was fused to HA tag and Myc tag, generating HA-AxinDIX and Myc-AxinDIX, respectively. We transiently cotransfected both the HA-tagged and Myc-tagged AxinDIX into 293T cells and carried out coimmunoprecipitation. For comparison, we also cotransfected HA-tagged and Myc-tagged full-length Axin, or we cotransfected the full-length Axin with the DIX domain alone. Myc-tagged full-length Axin (Myc-Axin) was effectively coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged full-length Axin (HA-Axin), whereas Myc-AxinDIX was poorly coprecipitated with either HA-Axin or HA-AxinDIX (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the DIX domain alone is a weak homodimerization domain.Fig. 1The DIX domain is not sufficient for maximal Axin homodimerization. A, Axin DIX domain alone confers weak Axin homodimerization. HA-Axin, Myc-Axin, HA-AxinDIX, and Myc-AxinDIX (2 μg of each) were cotransfected into HEK 293T cells in different combinations. Cells were lysed 40 h after transfection. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA for 3 h. Proteins in immunoprecipitates and total cell lysates were separated using 4–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with anti-HA for HA-tagged proteins or anti-Myc for Myc-tagged proteins. B, deletions with DIX and upstream DIX domains removed retained their ability to homodimerize. Top panel, the schematic representation indicates Axin mutants with different deletions used in transient transfection of 293T cells for Axin homodimerization. Cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of HA-tagged Axin deletions and 2 μg of corresponding Myc-tagged Axin deletions. Bottom panel, after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc, followed by immunoblotting for HA-tagged proteins using anti-HA. C, homodimerization is enhanced with regard to Axin deletion mutants with the I domain removed. Cells were cotransfected with 2 μg each of HA-tagged Axin deletion mutants and 2 μg of Myc-Axin. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-Myc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Two Novel Domains for Axin Homodimer Formation, Which Can Also Form Intramolecular Loop and Prevent AxinΔDIX from Forming Homodimer—We then created fine deletion mutants, as depicted on the top of Fig. 1B, and tested whether Axin contains other sequences that are important for its homodimer formation. As expected, AxinC2 did not form homodimer. Removal of aa 701–832 made Axin regain its ability to form dimer; gradual deletions from the C-terminal (AxinCD3 to AxinCD1) increased homodimer further until deletions reached amino acid residue 600 (AxinC1), at which point dimerization ability was lost. These results indicate that the area of aa 601–633 contains the sequence for dimerization (defined as the D domain) and that a sequence in the region of aa 634–751 contains an inhibitory domain for dimer formation (hence the I domain), at least in the context of AxinC2. Consistent with a possible inhibitory role of the I domain, AxinMD1 with the I domain deleted increased homodimer formation (Fig. 1C). However, when both the D and DIX domains were deleted (AxinCD4), the mutant Axin could, albeit with slightly weaker affinity, readily form dimer, indicating that the I domain in fact is also a dimerization domain (Fig. 1B). To further verify that the two newly identified areas are bona fide dimerization domains for Axin, we generated constructs that contain isolated D domain (GFP-Axin601–633 and GFP-AxinD) and I domain (GFP-Axin667–751 and GFP-AxinI), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, HA-GFP-AxinD was coprecipitated with Myc-GFP-AxinD, and the I domain was also capable of forming homodimer. Next, we asked whether the I domain exerted its inhibitory function by forming an intramolecular loop with the D domain. We cotransfected HA- and Myc-tagged GFP-AxinD, HA- and Myc-tagged GFP-AxinI, and HA-tagged DIX (HA-AxinDIX) in different combinations, as indicated in Fig. 2B. Results showed that the I domain (aa 667–751) could indeed interact with the D domain; however, neither D domain nor I domain could interact with the DIX domain. Because the D and I domains form dimer, we next tested whether the isolated D and I domains could mutually compete for homodimer formation. Whereas an increasing amount of D domain could not significantly compete against I-I homodimer formation (data not shown), overexpression of I domain decreased D-D homodimer formation (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the D and I domains are homodimerization domains and that they can interact with each other. Moreover, the I-I interaction seems to have a higher affinity than the D-D interaction. Point Mutations in the Axin DIX Domain Abolished Axin Homodimerization—We previously identified several point mutations that occurred to the DIX domain of the Axin1 gene from human cancer tissues (26Jin L.H. Shao Q.J. Luo W. Ye Z.Y. Li Q. Lin S.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Axin mutants harboring those mutations or with other alterations in the conserved residues were generated and tested for their ability to form homodimer, among other assays. Among the point mutations tested, F759R formed homodimer as effectively as wild-type Axin, and K796A exhibited diminished ability to form homodimer (Fig. 3A). In contrast, F780R, F807R, and L817E virtually lost their ability to form homodimer (Fig. 3A). Loss of the ability to form homodimer in the three mutants with a single amino acid alteration in the DIX domain is reminiscent of the situation seen with AxinC2. In other words, these three point mutations have each further drastically weakened the ability of the respective DIX domain to form homodimer. Further inference is that these mutant DIX domains could not form homodimer because they instead allow the I domain to loop back to form an intramolecular D-I interaction. In support of these notions is the observation that the isolated DIX domains of these mutants (F780R, F807R, and L817E) alone failed to interact with the D domain alone (Fig. 3B) or form DIX-DIX homodimeric interaction (Fig. 3C). The Axin D Domain Interacts with Ccd1—We showed previously that Axin does not utilize its DIX domain for heterodimeric interaction with Ccd1; rather, a region N-terminal to the DIX domain is critical for Axin-Ccd1 interaction. The Ccd1-interacting domain appeared to coincide with the D domain. We verified this by testing whether the D domain alone could interact with Ccd1. Indeed, the Axin D domain, but not the I or DIX domain, interacted strongly with Ccd1 (Fig. 4A). Next, we determined how Axin deletion constructs behave in the interaction with Ccd1. As shown in Fig. 4B, Ccd1 coimmunoprecipitated well with full-length Axin but failed to interact with AxinC1 or AxinC2, displaying an interaction pattern that mirrored that of homodimeric interaction of these mutants exactly (compared with the data shown in Fig. 1). These results suggested that the Ccd1-interacting site in AxinC2 also might be masked by the I domain, as seen with AxinC2 homodimer formation, and that AxinC1 does not contain the Ccd1-interacting site. We further utilized Axin point mutations in the DIX domain to test the intramolecular masking hypothesis in the Axin-Ccd1 interaction. The Axin point mutants that failed to form homodimer were also unable to interact with Ccd1 (Fig. 4C). Axin D, I, and DIX Domains Interact Separately with Distinct Domains of Dvl—Because some previous studies have indicated that domains other than the DIX domain of Axin may contribute to interaction with Dvl (12Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Julius M.A. Schelbert B. Hsu W. Fitzpatrick E. Jho E. Fagotto F. Costantini F. Kitajewski J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we also carried out interaction assays of the isolated Axin D and I domains with Dvl. Indeed, GFP-AxinD and GFP-AxinI each coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type Dvl (Fig. 5A). Similarly to the Axin-DIX interaction with Axin, Axin-DIX also weakly interacts with Dvl, again indicating that the DIX domain in fact plays a minor role in protein interaction. In parallel, the three isolated Axin domains were tested for their ability to interact with different Dvl deletion mutants, as indicated in Fig. 5B. Axin-DIX coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type Dvl, DvlΔPDZ, and DvlΔDEP, but not with DvlΔDIX, in line with previous studies showing that AxinDIX interacts with DvlDIX (Fig. 5B). Whereas the I domain of Axin seems to interact with a region not included in DIX, PDZ, or DEP, Axin D domain did not form complex with DvlΔDEP. Next, we assayed whether Axin constructs with point mutations in their DIX domain interact with Dvl. In drastic contrast to their interaction with Ccd1, all the Axin mutants effectively interacted with Dvl (Fig. 5C). JNK Activation Requires Homodimerized Axin—Because homodimerization is required for Axin to activate JNK based on the observation that AxinC2 failed to activate JNK, we tested the effect of point mutations in the DIX domain of Axin, which could not form dimer, on JNK activation (Fig. 6A). Results showed that F780R, F807R, and L817E that fail to form homodimer completely lost their ability to activate JNK, displaying a remarkable positive correlation between the ability to form homodimer (Fig. 3A) and the ability to activate JNK (Fig. 6A). In contrast, these mutants had little effect, if any, on their ability to down-regulate β-catenin (Fig. 6B), in agreement with their intact ability to form heterodimer with Dvl. Finally, to determine whether an intact C-terminal region is required for JNK activation, we assayed for JNK activation by AxinΔI and ΔD and found that they activated JNK as effectively as wildtype Axin (Fig. 6C), showing for the first time that amino acid sequences inside the C-terminal region can be dispensable for JNK activation. Axin is a master scaffolding protein, regulating multiple signaling pathways, including the Wnt, JNK, tumor growth factor β, and p53 signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 4Luo W. Lin S.C. Neurosignals. 2004; 13: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 5Tolwinski N.S. Wieschaus E. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 177-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, and 27Rui Y.N. Xu Z. Lin S.Y. Li Q. Rui H. Luo W. Zhou H-M. Cheung P.-Y. Wu Z. Ye Z. Li P. Han J. Lin S.-C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4583-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A critical question is how Axin forms distinct complexes with such a diverse array of proteins. In Wnt signaling, one possible mechanism to stabilize β-catenin is through recruitment of the Dvl-Axin complex by activated Frizzled-low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein receptor complex to the plasma membrane, where Axin is degraded (29Jones W.M. Bejsovec A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R479-R481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The relocation of Axin to the plasma membrane depends on Dvl, emphasizing the importance of their mutual interaction (21Cliffe A. Hamada F. Bienz M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 960-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Dvl requires its DIX domain to inhibit Axin-promoted β-catenin degradation (6Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that Axin is in a homodimeric configuration for activation of JNK because AxinC2 that cannot form dimer fails to activate JNK. However, little information by systematic analysis of how DIX domain proteins form complex is available. In particular, our previous finding that Ccd1 does not interact with the DIX domain of Axin raises concerns that distinct modes of proteinprotein interactions may exist among the DIX domain proteins. Here we show that Axin at its C-terminal region actually possesses three separable domains for homodimeric interaction, which are the D, I, and DIX domains, respectively. In fact, the DIX domain of Axin can only form weak homodimer, in agreement with the apparent lack of stable structure in solution structure of the Dvl DIX domain (30Capelluto D.G.S. Kutateladze T.G. Habas R. Finkielstein C.V. He X. Overduin M. Nature. 2002; 419: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The D and I domains can form D-D and I-I interactions, with the latter having higher affinity than the former based on a competition assay. Moreover, the D and I domains can form D-I intramolecular interaction, although the DIX domain cannot interact with D or I domain. How do our current findings reconcile with the previous observation that deletion of the DIX domain alone renders Axin monomeric? The answer lies in the observation that the D and I domains can interact with each other. It is proposed here that in intact Axin, the DIX-DIX domain interaction serves to weaken the intramolecular interaction between the D and I domains, allowing for D-D and I-I homodimeric interactions (Fig. 7). In other words, when the DIX domain is absent, the D and I domains have a greater propensity to form an intramolecular loop. When I and DIX are deleted, Axin can resort to its ability to form dimer via the D domain alone. In support of this notion are the following two additional observations. First, D-I interaction is in fact stronger than D-D interaction because D fails to compete against D-I formation. Second, AxinC2 fails to interact with Ccd1, despite the fact that the actual interaction domain of Axin for Ccd1 is mapped to the D domain, confirming that the D domain in AxinC2 is masked by the I domain. In sum, to form an Axin homodimer, DIX interacts with DIX and generates a conformation that favors I to interact with I and D to interact with D, resulting in intramolecular Axin-Axin interaction (Fig. 7). Another intriguing aspect of our current finding is that the D and I domains of Axin can also interact with Dvl, although Axin and Dvl do not have any apparent sequence similarity besides their DIX domains. This raises a provocative possibility that Axin may form many more as yet unidentified protein interactions. In fact, MEKK4 binds to the I domain, although the exact interaction interface has yet to be revealed by structural analysis. Moreover, our current finding that Axin possesses self-dimerization domains other than the DIX domain is consistent with the dominant negative phenotypes such as kinky tails seen in mature heterozygous Fused mice (31Vasicek T.J. Zeng L. Guan X.J. Zhang T. Costantini F. Tilghman S.M. Genetics. 1997; 147: 777-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Fused mutation results from an insertion of intracisternal A particle retrotransposon into intron 6 of the Axin gene, which yields an aberrant protein product that lacks the DIX domain but not the D and I domain. Our results also reinforce our previous notion that Axin requires homodimerization for JNK activation (17Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Axin with point mutations in the DIX domain (F780R, F807R, and L817E) that cannot form homodimer fail to activate JNK, whereas AxinΔD and AxinΔI can effectively activate JNK. The common denominator among these constructs is that those that can form homodimer can activate JNK. In the case of DvlΔDEP inhibition of Axin-mediated JNK activation (17Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is now understood that DvlΔDEP heterodimerizes with the I and DIX domains of Axin and effectively prevents Axin from forming homodimer. Moreover, DvlΔDEP does not compete for MEKK binding to inhibit Axin-mediated JNK activation, but it requires its DIX domain to form heterodimer with Axin (17Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All lines of evidence point to the same scenario: Axin has to form a homodimer for JNK activation. Interestingly, the Axin point mutants that drastically affect DIX-DIX interaction and JNK activation had virtually no effect on down-regulation of β-catenin, indicating that Axin homodimeric formation might not be needed for β-catenin down-regulation. Questions still remain as to how Wnt regulators such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β and casein kinase I, which bind to sites distinct from that for MEKK1, can prevent MEKK1 binding to Axin (20Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Chan S.C. Han J. He X. Lin S.C.

In summary, we have identified two additional domains for protein interactions that confer upon Axin the ability to form intramolecular, homodimeric, and heterodimeric interactions. Given the fact that Axin can exert diverse functions through different signaling cascades, our data have provided novel structural insights for the ultimate understanding of how Axin can adopt versatile conformations for different functions, which inevitably involve distinct complex formations with diverse proteins.

However, BLM stimulation of FEN1 cleavage of foldback flaps, bubbles, or triplet repeats was increased by an additional increment when ATP was added. Helicase-dependent stimulation of FEN1 cleavage was robust over a range of sizes of the single-stranded part of bubbles. However, increasing the length of the 5′ annealed region of the bubble ultimately counteracted the stimulatory capacity of the BLM helicase.

Blastocysts defective in FEN1 are unable to synthesize DNA and die by extensive apoptosis upon treatment with γ-radiation (8Larsen E. Gran C. Saether B. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5346-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Chicken cells lacking FEN1 were viable but exhibited a lower proliferation rate than wild-type cells. A defect in chicken FEN1 also caused hypersensitivity to methylating agents and H2O2 (12Matsuzaki Y. Adachi N. Koyama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that FEN1 plays an essential role not only in DNA replication but also in repair. Defects in RAD27, the FEN1 homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are not lethal (13Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J.

However, growth of RAD27-null deletion mutants is restricted at 37 °C and reduced even at the permissive temperature of 30 °C. When transferred to the restrictive temperature, RAD27-null deletion mutants arrested with cell cycle morphology similar to that of cells containing mutations in DNA replication proteins, verifying a role for RAD27 in DNA replication (13Reagan M.S.

In addition, it was demonstrated that both RAD27 and mammalian FEN1 are critical in suppressing mutations (9Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M. Zhao J. Lia M. Heyer J. Kane M. Fan K. Russell R.

RAD27 deletion mutants exhibit elevated sensitivity to methylmethanesulfonate but not x-rays or UV light, indicating that FEN1 is involved in DNA base excision repair (14Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Increased homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining events have been reported in RAD27 deletion mutants (17Negritto M.C. Qiu J. Ratay D.O. Shen B. Bailis A.M. Mol. Cell.

Importantly, several independent studies showed that duplication of sequences frequently occurs due to RAD27 mutation (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 20Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) In addition, repetitive DNA is unstable in RAD27-null deletion mutants. RAD27 deletion leads to a dramatically increased expansion in sequences flanked by direct repeats (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and trinucleotide repeats, and the expansion was biased to the 5′-end of the repeat tract (2Lieber M.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 21Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

A widely accepted model describes this process. During lagging strand synthesis, the displaced single strand can equilibrate to form foldback and bubble structures that inhibit FEN1. Ligation of a flap with a bubble to the upstream primer creates an expanded sequence (18Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 24Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies further support this mechanism of repetitive sequence expansion. Flaps with increasing lengths of complementarity or CTG repeats are cleaved by FEN1 at reduced rates (25Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that a flap in the bubble configuration can produce an expansion product (26Liu Y. Zhang H. Veeraraghavan J. Bambara R.A. Freudenreich C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4049-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, neither proliferating cell nuclear antigen nor RPA was found to assist FEN1 in cleaving hairpin substrates (25Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These data imply that there are other accessory proteins assisting FEN1 in resolving secondary structures. Recently, it was reported that two members of the RecQ helicase family, BLM and WRN, interact with FEN1 and suppress the phenotypes of DNA2–1 mutants (27Imamura O. Campbell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A.

BLM is a 3′-5′ DNA helicase that, when mutated, is responsible for Bloom's syndrome (30Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Knocking out BLM caused embryonic lethality in mice (31Chester N. Kuo F. Kozak C. O'Hara C.D. Leder P.

Humans with heterozygous BLM have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (33Gruber S.B. Ellis N.A. Scott K.K. Almog R. Kolachana P. Bonner J.D. Kirchhoff T. Tomsho L.P. Nafa K. Pierce H.

BLM-mutated mouse or chicken cells exhibit a high level of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal breaks as well as interexchanges as seen in human BS cells (31Chester N. Kuo F. Kozak C.

In addition, immunodepletion of Xenopus BLM inhibits the replication of DNA in reconstituted nuclei, providing direct evidence that BLM is involved in DNA replication (37Liao S. Graham J. Yan H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2570-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). BS cells were found to grow slower than wild-type cells, elongation of nascent DNA strands was retarded, and abnormal replication intermediates were accumulated (38Hand R. German J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was suggested that BLM plays a role in recovering stalled replication forks (35Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Sonoda E. Takeda S. Yamada K. Masuko T. Katada T. Enomoto T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 39Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It was reported in BS cells that relative amounts of total ribosomal DNA decreased, but telomere DNA increased. Both ribosomal DNA and telomere DNA contain repeated sequences (40Schawalder J. Paric E. Neff N.F. BMC Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data imply that BLM acts to stabilize repeated sequences. Recently, human BLM was reported to restore the phenotypes of the yeast Dna2-1 mutant, but not the FEN1 (RAD27) deletion mutant (27Imamura O. Campbell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The complementation was dependent on BLM helicase activity. Dna2p has been suggested to participate with FEN1 in Okazaki fragment maturation (41Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Dna2p is a 5′-3′ helicase and 5′-3′ nuclease. It has been shown that the helicase activity assists the nuclease activity in cleaving structured flaps (43Bae S.H. Kim D.W. Kim J. Kim J.H. Kim D.H. Kim H.D. Kang H.Y. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26632-26641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). BLM interacts with both Dna2p and FEN1 (27Imamura O. Campbell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that BLM participates in Okazaki fragment maturation. In fact, it has been demonstrated that both BLM and WRN stimulate FEN1 by interaction through their C-terminal domains (RQC domains) (28Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 44Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Wu L. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9847-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This stimulation was independent of BLM helicase activity. However, analysis of BS cells showed that the BLM lacking helicase activity could not suppress elevated sister chromatid exchanges in BS cells, indicating that helicase activity is an important BLM function. Although BLM Q672R and C1055S are not mutated within the helicase domain of BLM protein, these two mis-sense mutants lost their helicase activity, similar to K695T, which is mutated in the first helicase motif (45Neff N.F. Ellis N.A. Ye T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The relationship between the RQC domain of BLM and sister chromatid exchanges is still unclear. In vitro, BLM was shown to be a potent helicase that can unwind many kinds of double-stranded DNA including bubbles and G4 quadraplexes (46Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 47Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D.

Suppression of the Dna2-1 mutant but not Rad27 mutants by BLM and suppression of the Dna2-1 mutant by overexpression of FEN1 suggest that Dna2p acts in a different pathway than BLM and FEN1. We considered the possibility that BLM uses its helicase activity to aid FEN1 in resolving structured flaps. Here we examine whether BLM promotes FEN1 cleavage of foldbacks and bubbles associated with DNA expansion (26Liu Y. Zhang H. Veeraraghavan J. Bambara R.A. Freudenreich C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4049-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results reveal that activation of helicase function allows BLM to stimulate the cleavage of foldback flaps, bubbles, or triplet repeats by FEN1. Cleavage after addition of BLM and ATP is distinctly greater than that after addition of only BLM. These results suggest that BLM plays a role in preventing repeat expansion by aiding FEN1 cleavage. Materials—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were bought from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The T4 polynucleotide kinase (labeling grade), the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ATP were from Roche Applied Science. RNase-free solutions and reagents were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). All the other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Enzyme Expression and Purification—Recombinant human FEN1 was expressed with the T7 expression plasmid pET-FCH and purified (49Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recombinant human BLM was expressed in yeast strain JEL1 transformed with pJK1. BLM was purified as described previously (46Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) Oligonucleotide Substrates—Oligomer sequences are listed in Table I. They were designed to form a series of flap or bubble substrates. Each substrate consisted of a downstream primer (D), a template (T), and an upstream primer (U). Substrates were generated including different foldback structures or CTG repeats on the downstream primer. For flap substrates, the 3′-end of each downstream primer was complementary to the 5′-end of its appropriate template. The 5′-end of the downstream primer formed the unannealed 5′-tail or flap. The 5′-end of downstream primers containing secondary structure formed a hairpin loop or foldback. The annealing length of the foldback was 18 nucleotides. Upstream primers were annealed to the 3′-end of the template, forming a 1-nucleotide 3′-flap at the annealing point of the downstream primer. Bubble substrates contained 1–15 nucleotides at the 5′-end of primer and 12–28 nucleotides at 3′-end of the primer, which were complementary to the template. Nucleotides in the middle region were not complementary to the template, allowing the formation of the bubble. Upstream primers were annealed to the 3′-end of the template in most experiments, forming a nick at the 5′-end of the bubble. Substrates were constructed as described in the figure legends. The equilibrating substrates were generated by annealing the downstream primer to the appropriate template and then annealing an upstream primer that contained a 30-nucleotide sequence overlapping with the 5′-end of the downstream primer.Table IOligomucleotide sequences (5′-3′) Open table in a new tab Labeling and purification of substrates were performed as described below. 20 pmol of downstream primer was annealed to 50 pmol of template with a G (or GATC) overhang at the 5′-end of the template. The downstream primer was extended by adding Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP. The radiolabeled primers were purified on 15–18% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Annealing conditions were the same as those described previously (20Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that the annealing ratio was 1:2:5 (downstream/template/upstream). Enzyme Assays—Reactions were performed in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 8 mm MgCl2 with or without 4 mm ATP. Enzyme stocks were diluted in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Each reaction contained 5 fmol of substrates in a 20-μl reaction mix with different amounts of the enzymes as indicated in the figure legends. All the assays, except helicase assays, were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with BLM, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min after addition of FEN-1, and then stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2× termination dye (95% formamide (v/v) with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole). BLM helicase assays were performed at 37 °C for 20 min and then immediately run on a native 12% polyacryamide gel. The denatured reactions were resolved on 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels. Each gel was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software from Amersham Biosciences. In all studies, the quantitated amounts of substrates and products were utilized to calculate the percentage of product formation from the product/(substrate + product) ratio. This method allows for the correction of any loading errors among lanes. All assays were performed at least in triplicate, and representative assays are shown. Genetic analysis showed that BLM helicase activity is essential for maintaining genome stability (36German J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that BLM stimulates both endonuclease and exonuclease activity of FEN1 by direct interaction, independent of BLM helicase function (44Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Wu L. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9847-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that BLM helicase specifically aids FEN1 on a subset of flap substrates that have secondary structure. Ability of FEN1 to Cleave Flaps with Double-stranded Regions Was Increased by BLM—FEN1 has previously been shown to load onto flap substrates by entering from the 5′-end and then tracking to the base of the flap for cleavage (16Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Flaps with annealed primers or foldback structures have been shown to inhibit FEN1 loading, decreasing the efficiency of cleavage (25Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16420-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We examined whether BLM helicase activity increased FEN1 cleavage of foldback flaps. We designed substrates with an 18-nucleotide inverted repeat sequence on the flap. The inverted 18 nucleotides annealed with their complementary sequence to form a foldback stem-loop structure. The loop contained 6 nucleotides. One had a single-stranded region at the 5′-end of the flap, and one lacked this region. We designed another substrate with a 37-nucleotide flap that had an 18-nucleotide blocking primer annealed at its 5′-end. This effectively creates a stem structure without the loop. The same 37-nucleotide flap substrate, but without the 18-nucleotide blocking primer, was used as a control for comparison of cleavage efficiency. All of the downstream primers were labeled at the 3′-end with [α-32P]dCTP. Upstream primers (26 nucleotides in length) designed to form a 1-nucleotide flap at the 3′-end were used to make double flap substrates. Cleavage of these substrates generates a 26-nucleotide labeled product (Fig. 1A). 1 fmol of FEN1 was used for the unstructured flap, and 5 fmol of FEN1 was used for the flaps with structure. Even with the higher amount of nuclease, substrates with blocking primer or foldback structure were cleaved less efficiently than the unstructured flap. In the absence of ATP, the addition of BLM increased amounts of product formation with all substrates (Fig. 1A, lanes 4, 9, 14, and 19). This observation is consistent with the ATP-independent stimulation of FEN1 observed previously (44Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Wu L. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9847-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, an additional increment of cleavage was observed with the structured flap substrates that was not observed with the unstructured flap substrate (Fig. 1A, lanes 5, 10, 15, and 20). We also tested 1-, 4-, and 11-nucleotide unstructured flap substrates. In each case, BLM stimulated cleavage by FEN1, but there was no further increment of stimulation when ATP was added to activate helicase function (data not shown). These results suggest that BLM uses its helicase activity to unwind structured flaps. This allows FEN1 to load more effectively, resulting in more efficient cleavage. To examine helicase activity directly, we measured disassembly of the blocking primer substrate by BLM. As a 3′ to 5′ helicase, BLM is expected to bind at the base of the flap and then move toward the 5′-end, displacing the blocking primer. Increased primer displacement was observed with BLM and ATP but not with BLM alone (Fig. 1B, lane 3, BLM alone; lane 5, BLM and ATP). This result indicates that BLM helicase function can remove the primer. BLM Increased the Ability of FEN1 to Cleave Bubble Substrates—Another abnormal flap intermediate that could form in regions with sequence flanked by a direct repeat or short sequence repeats is the bubble. Natural bubbles would form by misaligned annealing of the 5′-end region of the flap. It has also been proposed that foldback structures of triplet repeats form bubble structures, which are sealed into the double helix to produce sequence expansion (24Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Bubble structures have been shown to be effective inhibitors of FEN1 (25Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y.

A 24-nucleotide oligo(dT) bubble was designed into the downstream primer. 7 nucleotides were annealed to the template at the 5′-end, followed by the bubble and a 28-nucleotide region annealed at the 3′-end. The reaction was carried out under the same conditions used with the structured flaps, with si"
https://openalex.org/W2053467415,"The Src-activating and signaling molecule (Srcasm) is a recently described activator and substrate of Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs). When phosphorylated at specific tyrosines, Srcasm associates with Grb2 and p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase; however, little is known about the role of Srcasm in cellular signaling. Data presented here demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligands promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous and adenovirally transduced Srcasm in keratinocytes, and that increased levels of Srcasm activate endogenous SFKs, with a preference for Fyn and Src. In addition, Srcasm potentiates EGF-dependent signals transmitted by SFKs in keratinocytes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcasm is dependent on growth factors and the activity of EGFR and SFKs. Increased Srcasm expression enhances p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and Elk-1-dependent transcriptional events. Elevated Srcasm levels inhibit keratinocyte proliferation while promoting specific aspects of keratinocyte differentiation. Lastly, Srcasm levels are decreased in human cutaneous neoplasia. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Srcasm plays a role in linking EGF receptor- and SFK-dependent signaling to differentiation in keratinocytes.

Data presented here demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligands promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous and adenovirally transduced Srcasm in keratinocytes, and that increased levels of Srcasm activate endogenous SFKs, with a preference for Fyn and Src. In addition, Srcasm potentiates EGF-dependent signals transmitted by SFKs in keratinocytes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcasm is dependent on growth factors and the activity of EGFR and SFKs. Increased Srcasm expression enhances p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and Elk-1-dependent transcriptional events. Elevated Srcasm levels inhibit keratinocyte proliferation while promoting specific aspects of keratinocyte differentiation. Lastly, Srcasm levels are decreased in human cutaneous neoplasia. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Srcasm plays a role in linking EGF receptor- and SFK-dependent signaling to differentiation in keratinocytes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation are fundamental biological questions important within metazoans, and tyrosine kinases play critical roles in regulating these processes (1Blume-Jensen P.

In addition, increased activity of the SFKs has been associated with a variety of epithelial tumors, including colonic adenocarcinoma, mammary carcinoma, and murine cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (9Park J. Meisler A.I. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2627-2635PubMed Google Scholar, 10Muthuswamy S.K. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1801-1810PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cartwright C.A. Meisler A.I.

Given the importance of SFKs in cellular physiology, cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to regulate their activity. Structural analyses have shown that SFKs can form an inactive “closed” configuration, with the SH2 domain bound to the phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-527) and the SH3 domain associated with a polyproline motif in the linker region; this configuration prevents phosphorylation at tyrosine 416 in the activation loop rendering the kinase inactive (14Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 15Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Given these structural data, it has been hypothesized that molecules containing ligands for the SH2 and SH3 domains of SFKs may disrupt the SH2-dependent and SH3-dependent intramolecular interactions and promote opening of the “closed” configuration, phosphorylation of tyrosine 416, and activation of the kinase (14Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 15Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Theoretically, if a molecule contained a stronger ligand for the SFK SH2 domain than the C-terminal pTyr-527 motif, then such a molecule could activate Src kinases regardless of Csk activity (the kinase that induces Tyr-527 phosphorylation), thereby independently promoting important regulatory signals (2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biology. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar, 16Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some SFK-activating molecules have been identified, including FAK and Sin; however, these molecules do not contain the highest affinity ligands for the SFK SH2 domain, a pYEEI motif (17Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

The Src-activating and signaling molecule (Srcasm) is a recently described activator and substrate of SFKs that contains the optimal ligands for the SH2 and SH3 domains of SFKs, and thus can activate SFKs in vitro (20Seykora J.T. Mei L. Dotto G.P. Stein P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2812-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylated Srcasm can associate in vitro with Grb2 and p85 (the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase), molecules that regulate important signaling pathways involving RAS-MAP kinases and Akt, respectively (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleiter R.J.

Given the molecular attributes of Srcasm, we speculated that it may represent an important regulator of SFKs in cells. In this report, we provide evidence to support such a role of Srcasm in keratinocytes. Srcasm is an SFK substrate downstream of the EGF receptor, and it activates endogenous cellular SFKs with a preference for Fyn and Src. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcasm is dependent on the presence of EGFR ligands, EGFR activity, and SFK activity. In addition, Srcasm appears to modulate p44/42 MAP kinase activity in a manner dependent on EGF stimulation. Srcasm also promotes downstream signaling events such as stimulation of Elk-1-dependent transcription, and it decreases the S-phase fraction of keratinocytes under a variety of conditions. Increased levels of Srcasm promoted expression of differentiation markers in primary keratinocytes, and Srcasm protein levels were found to be decreased in lesions of keratinocytic neoplasia. The data presented provide a molecular context for Srcasm signaling in keratinocytes and suggest that Srcasm may play an important role regulating SFKs and differentiation in epithelial cells. Adenovirus Construction—Srcasm adenovirus (Ad-Srcasm) was made by the adenovirus vector core at the University of Pennsylvania by cloning hemagglutinin-tagged Srcasm (HA-Srcasm) into a shuttle vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter. The expression cassette was excised and ligated into an adenoviral backbone vector (pAdX), and the intactness of the coding region was performed by restriction analysis. DNA was amplified and linearized with PacI, then transfected into 293 cells. Viral induced cytopathic change was confirmed microscopically, and the virus was amplified then purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. The control adenovirus (Ad-Con) contains the green fluorescent protein coding region driven by a bacterial LacZ promoter. Hence, it expresses only in bacterial cells, and serves as a control for adenoviral infection. Primary Human Keratinocyte Culture, Infections/Transfections, and Pharmacological Manipulations—Cultures of neonatal human keratinocytes were obtained from foreskins. After isolation, the cells were cultured in MCDB-153 medium, supplemented with 0.1 mm ethanolamine (Sigma), 0.1 mmO-phosphoethanolamine (Sigma), 10 μg/liter hEGF (Invitrogen), 5 × 10-7m hydrocortisone (Sigma), 5 mg/liter insulin (Sigma), bovine pituitary extract (BPE) (150 μg/ml), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 70 μm calcium, and maintained at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Growth factor depletion was conducted in MCDB base lacking insulin, EGF, and BPE. All keratinocytes analyzed were less than passage 4. Keratinocytes at ∼60–70% confluence were infected with Ad-Srcasm or Ad-Con at the indicated m.o.i. under the culture conditions described above and usually analyzed or manipulated 16 h after infection. Luciferase assays utilized the Pathdetect Elk-1 trans-reporting assay (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were transfected in MCDB (without penicillin/streptomycin) using a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were allowed to recover for 18 h before virus infection and subsequent experimentation. Prior to EGF, TGF-α, KGF stimulation, cells were deprived of growth factors for 24 h, then incubated with hEGF (10 or 100 ng/ml, Invitrogen), hTGF-α (0.1 ng/ml, Sigma #T7924), hKGF (10 ng/ml, Research Diagnostics Inc.) for the indicated times. Some cells were incubated with Src family kinase-selective inhibitor PP2 (10 μm), or its negative control PP3 (10 μm), or specific EGFR kinase inhibitor AG112 (20 μm)or its negative control AG9 (20 μm), or the MEK 1/2 inhibitors U0126 (10 μm) or its negative control U0124 (10 μm) 60 min before cell lysis (all from Calbiochem). Antibodies—α-Phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, 4G10) was used at 1/1000 for Western blotting. α-Phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation of endogenous Srcasm was performed overnight at 4 °C using 1.5 mg of protein lysate and 2.5 μg of antibody; α-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation for transduced Srcasm was performed using 0.5 mg of lysate for 15 min with 1.5 μg of antibody using the Catch and Release Reversible Immunoprecipitation system (Upstate Biotechnology). High affinity α-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 1/1000 for Western blotting and at 2 μg/ml for immunoprecipitations. α-Activated Src family kinase antibody (phosphor-Tyr-416) (Cell Signaling) was used at 1/1000 for Western blotting. α-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody and α-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (Cell Signaling) were used at 1/1000 to detect total or phosphorylated p44/42 MAP kinase. α-Fyn (SC-16), α-Src (SC-19), and α-Yes (SC-14, all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were all used at 1:1000 for Western blotting, and 3 μg was used for immunoprecipitation. α-Src2 antibody (SC-8056) that detects Src, Fyn, and Yes was used at 1:500. α-Srcasm antibody is a polyclonal antibody that was generated by incubating rabbits with three purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins spanning murine Srcasm (aa 1–200, aa 150–400, and aa 389–474). For Western blotting, the Srcasm antisera was diluted 1:1000. For endogenous Srcasm immunoprecipitation, IgG was purified from the crude serum via Protein A affinity chromatography; 6 μg of this IgG fraction was used for each immunoprecipitation. The specificity of the α-Srcasm antibody was demonstrated by Western blotting COS protein lysates overexpressing Srcasm; preincubating the antisera with the 1 μm Srcasm fusion proteins for 30 min at room temperature ablates detection of Srcasm (Fig. 8A). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4). Tissue samples of normal skin and squamous cell carcinoma tissue were obtained after Moh's surgery and frozen at -80 °C until use (Internal Review Board protocols 707777 and 706409). The tissue samples were diced and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and assayed for protein content using the MicroBCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). For immunoprecipitation with α-HA antibody, typically 1 mg of pre-cleared lysates was sequentially incubated with α-HA, rabbit α-Rat IgG, and protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitation with α-pY antibody was carried out with the Catch and Release reversible immunoprecipitation system (Upstate). For α-Srcasm immunoprecipitation of Srcasm, typically 1.5 mg of keratinocyte lysate were utilized, and the immunoprecipitations were carried out for ∼16 h. Equal amounts of lysates or washed immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For filaggrin detection, Western blots were conducted in a standard manner with the indicated antibodies and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit as described by the manufacturer (Lumilight Plus, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were cultured in 2-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) and infected with Ad-Srcasm or Ad-Con (m.o.i. 200). Cells were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min on ice then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton/PBS for 10 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature, followed by washing, and incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies in the same manner. Primary antibodies used at a 1:100 dilution included: phospho-Y416 (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho p44/42 (Cell Signaling Technology), HA-high affinity (Roche Applied Science), Src (SC-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Fyn (SC-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Yes (SC-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). α-Filaggrin (PRB-417P, Covance) was used at 1:200. α-BrdUrd (#1299964, Roche Applied Science) was used at 1:50. Secondary antibodies were species-specific for the primary antibodies and conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red; these antibodies were used at 1:100 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were counterstained using DAPI. Imaging was performed on an IX-81 inverted fluorescence scope under oil coupled with a Cooke Sensicam digital camera. Where indicated, deconvolved, confocal images (nearest neighbors algorithm) and image overlay were performed using Slide-book, version 4, at × 600 magnification. In Vitro Kinase Assays—PHKs were infected with Ad-Con or Ad-Srcasm at m.o.i. 200 and cultured in MCDB complete media. Sixteen hours post-infection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 1 mg of cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of α-Fyn, α-Src, or α-Yes for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated Fyn, Src, and Yes were subjected to in vitro kinase assays according to manufacturer's specifications (Src Assay kit #17-131, Upstate Biotechnology). Phosphocellulose filters with bound 32P-labeled substrate were assessed by liquid scintillation using Econofluor-2 (Packard Instrument Co., Cat. no. 6NE9699) in a Beckman LS-6500 instrument. Background cpm activity (from a no kinase control reaction) was subtracted from all values. cpm values of assays of SFKs from control cells was set equal to 1; values of assays from Ad-Srcasm cells were divided by the corresponding value from control infected cells to obtain -fold stimulation. Data presented are from two independent experiments. Luciferase Assays—Human primary keratinocytes were plated in complete MCDB media, allowed to reach 50% confluency, and then transfected with plasmids from the Pathdetect trans-reporting system (Stratagene), specific for assaying Elk-1-dependent transcription from serum-response elements. Primary keratinocytes plated at 5 × 104 per 35-mm well were transfected using Lipofectamine (5 μl/μg of DNA) with 0.5 μg of pFA2-Elk-1 and 1.0 μg of pFR-Luc. Approximately 16 h after transfection, cells were not infected or infected with Ad-Srcasm or Ad-Con at an m.o.i. of 200. After 18 h of infection, some cells were stimulated for 5 h with 100 μg/liter hEGF. Luciferase activity in equivalent amounts of cell lysates was determined using the firefly luciferase assay system (Promega) in a Monolight 3096 luminometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with Simplicity 2.0 software. Relative luciferase units reflect the numerical values obtained from the luminometer; values represent the averages of three experiments with the standard deviation indicated by bars. Equivalent amounts of cell lysate were subjected to Western blotting to detect Srcasm. Flow Cytometry Proliferation Assay—Sub-confluent PHKs infected with Ad-Srcasm or Ad-Con (m.o.i. 200) 18 h prior were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 3h under standard MCDB culture conditions (see above). Then, cells were harvested and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody and 7-amino-actinomycin D following the BrdUrd flow kit instruction (BD Pharmingen); the analysis parameters used are those recommended by the manufacturer. The stained cells were analyzed by FACScan machine (BD Pharmingen); the cell populations were sorted into G0/G1 (gate R2), G2/M (gate R3), and S phase (gate R4) according to the manufacturer's specifications. In Fig. 6C, subconfluent PHKs were infected as above and deprived of growth factors for 16 h, and then some cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. These cells were collected, washed in PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol, overnight at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted then washed in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum, and subjected to passage through a 0.2-μm filter. Cells were treated with RNase A and stained with propidium iodide. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan machine using ModFit LT 3.1 (Verity Software House) to determine S-phase fraction. Data are representative of two experiments. BrdUrd Labeling and Filaggrin Blotting—Cells were cultured in 2-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) and infected with Ad-Srcasm or Ad-Con (m.o.i. 200) in MCDB complete media. 24 h after infection, cells were labeled with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 3 h and then fixed and permeabilized with 50 mm glycine, 70% ethanol, pH 2, for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were stained for BrdUrd, filaggrin, or Srcasm as indicated under “Immunofluorescence Analysis.” Cells stained for filaggrin and Srcasm were fixed and permeabilized also as indicated under “Immunofluorescence Analysis.” For filaggrin Western blotting, PHKs were plated on collagen-coated dishes and infected with Ad-Srcasm or Ad-Con (m.o.i. 200). Cells were cultured in MCDB complete media. At the times indicated (post-infection), cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay, and equivalent protein amounts were subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical Detection of Srcasm in Formalin-fixed Biopsy Specimens—Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, in situ, invasive squamous cell carcinoma and unremarkable skin were collected from the dermato-pathology archives of the University of Pennsylvania Department of Dermatology with Internal Review Board approval under protocol 704450. Biopsy specimens containing unremarkable epidermis adjacent to lesional skin were selected as normal skin provides an internal control. For immunohistochemical staining, tissue samples were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% horse serum, then incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Srcasm antibody (4 μg/ml). The antibody was affinity-purified by incubating anti-sera with glutathione S-transferase immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes followed by the Srcasm fusion proteins immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The anti-Srcasm antibody was eluted and handled as previously discussed (22Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Control preimmune IgG was purified using protein A-agarose and used at the same concentration as the affinity purified antibody. Immunostaining was performed using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Roche Applied Science). Increases or decreases in expression were made by comparing lesions with adjacent normal skin from the same tissue section and with normal skin from separate biopsies. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the average ± S.D. of the indicated number of samples for each experiment. Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. EGFR Ligands and SFKs Promote Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Srcasm in Primary Human Keratinocytes—Because EGF stimulation of cells can activate Src kinases, the effect of EGF on the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Srcasm was evaluated in primary human keratinocytes (Fig. 1) (23Osherov N. Levitzki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 24Stover D.R. Becker M. Liebetanz J. Lydon N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15591-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with α-Srcasm followed by Western blotting with α-phosphotyrosine demonstrated increased levels of Srcasm tyrosine phosphorylation in EGF-treated keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). Similarly, immunoprecipitation with α-phosphotyrosine from EGF-treated cells followed by Western blotting using α-Srcasm demonstrated more phospho-Srcasm present in EGF-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Parallel experiments with TGF-α and KGF were performed; TGF-α treatment of keratinocytes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcasm, whereas KGF treatment did not (Fig. 1B). These results show that EGF and TGF-α, both EGFR ligands, induce tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Srcasm. The behavior of adenovirally transduced HA-Srcasm was examined in PHKs. PHKs transduced with HA-Srcasm adenovirus and cultured in complete media exhibited readily detectable levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Srcasm (Fig. 1C), whereas PHKs deprived of growth factors (EGF, insulin, and bovine pituitary extract) for 24 h contained very low levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Srcasm. PHKs stimulated with EGF demonstrated a rapid and significant increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated Srcasm (Fig. 1C); these results for transduced Srcasm parallel those for endogenous Srcasm. Upstream signaling events necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcasm were explored using pharmacological inhibitors of EGFR and SFKs. Treatment of keratinocytes with inhibitors of SFKs (PP2) and EGFR (AG112) ablated the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcasm (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Srcasm requires the activity of both EGFR and SFKs. In addition, these data show that adenoviral HA-Srcasm appears to be a useful model for characterizing the effect of increased Srcasm levels on keratinocyte signaling. Srcasm Promotes Cellular Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Activates SFKs in Keratinocytes—EGF treatment and elevated Srcasm levels correlate with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins (Fig. 2A). Notably, a doublet at ∼70 kDa show increased tyrosine phosphorylation with EGF treatment or increased Srcasm levels. Because Srcasm can activate SFKs in vitro, the effect of Srcasm on endogenous keratinocyte SFK activation was evaluated. In non-infected PHKs, the levels of activated SFKs were low (Fig. 2B); similar results were seen with control adenovirus. In contrast, infection of the keratinocytes with Ad-Srcasm led to significantly higher levels of activated SFKs (Fig. 2B). Increased levels of Srcasm also potentiated the ability of EGF to activate Src-kinases (Fig. 2B). These results show that increased levels of Srcasm are associated with activation of endogenous SFKs in PHKs and that increased Srcasm level can lead to higher levels of activated SFKs secondary to EGF treatment. The ability of Srcasm to activate SFKs is dose-dependent; the level of activated SFKs is proportional to the level of cellular Srcasm (Fig. 2C). Association of increased Srcasm levels with SFK activation was evaluated at the cellular level via immunofluorescence. Cells containing higher amounts of Srcasm have higher levels of activated SFKs (Fig. 2D). Srcasm Differentially Activates SFKs in Primary Keratinocytes—Because keratinocytes express Fyn, Src, and Yes, the effect of increased Srcasm levels on each SFK family member was evaluated. Immunoprecipitation of Fyn from keratinocytes containing higher levels of Srcasm followed by Western blotting to assess levels of activated kinase demonstrated increased Fyn activation when compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Activation of Src was also seen in similar experiments. Interestingly, Yes showed decreased activation in Ad-Srcasm-infected cells relative to controls (Fig. 3A). The effect of increased Srcasm levels on SFK activity was also evaluated using in vitro kinase assays. Both Fyn and Src showed increased kinase activity in PHKs infected with Ad-Srcasm compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). The kinase activity of Yes was mildly decreased in Ad-Srcasm-infected PHKs compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). Using two different experimental methods, increased Srcasm levels are associated with increased Fyn and Src activity but with decreased Yes activity. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated more prevalent co-localization of Fyn and Src with Srcasm, as indicated by increased yellow color in the merged confocal images (Fig. 3C). In contrast, relatively little co-localization of Yes and Srcasm was seen in similar experiments (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the degree of cellular co-localization between Srcasm and Fyn, Src, or Yes"
https://openalex.org/W1848900308,"Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) has two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, an N-terminal domain and a split PH domain. Here we show that pull down of NIH3T3 cell extracts with PLC-γ1 PH domain-glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry, identified β-tubulin as a binding protein of both PLC-γ1 PH domains. Tubulin is a main component of microtubules and mitotic spindle fibers, which are composed of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers in all eukaryotic cells. PLC-γ1 and β-tubulin colocalized in the perinuclear region in COS-7 cells and cotranslocated to the plasma membrane upon agonist stimulation. Membrane-targeted translocation of depolymerized tubulin by agonist stimulation was also supported by immunoprecipitation analyses. The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolyzing activity of PLC-γ1 was substantially increased in the presence of purified tubulin in vitro, whereas the activity was not promoted by bovine serum albumin, suggesting that β-tubulin activates PLC-γ1. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescent microscopy showed that PLC-γ1 was highly concentrated in mitotic spindle fibers, suggesting that PLC-γ1 is involved in spindle fiber formation. The effect of PLC-γ1 in microtubule formation was assessed by overexpression and silencing PLC-γ1 in COS-7 cells, which resulted in altered microtubule dynamics in vivo. Cells overexpressing PLC-γ1 showed higher microtubule densities than controls, whereas PLC-γ1 silencing with small interfering RNAs led to decreased microtubule network densities as compared with control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that PLC-γ1 and β-tubulin transmodulate each other, i.e. that PLC-γ1 modulates microtubule assembly by β-tubulin, and β-tubulin promotes PLC-γ1 activity. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) has two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, an N-terminal domain and a split PH domain. Here we show that pull down of NIH3T3 cell extracts with PLC-γ1 PH domain-glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry, identified β-tubulin as a binding protein of both PLC-γ1 PH domains. Tubulin is a main component of microtubules and mitotic spindle fibers, which are composed of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers in all eukaryotic cells. PLC-γ1 and β-tubulin colocalized in the perinuclear region in COS-7 cells and cotranslocated to the plasma membrane upon agonist stimulation. Membrane-targeted translocation of depolymerized tubulin by agonist stimulation was also supported by immunoprecipitation analyses.

Activated PLC-γ1 hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. These second messengers regulate the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activate protein kinase C, respectively (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 has two Src homology (SH) 2 domains and an SH3 domain, both responsible for protein-protein interactions, and two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, responsible for protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. Of these, one PH domain is located in the 150 N-terminal amino acid residues, whereas the other is split by the SH2-SH2-SH3 domain (3Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). PH domains bind with high specificity and affinity to phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol phosphate, PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and IP3 (4Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and the PH domains of signaling molecules are often involved in targeted translocation of molecules to cell membranes (6Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). PH domains can also specifically bind cellular signaling proteins, such as the βγ-subunit of the heteromeric G-protein (8Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (9Yao L. Suzuki H. Ozawa K. Deng J. Lehe C. Fukamachi H. Anderson W.G. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13033-13039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have investigated protein-protein interactions via the SH domain of PLC-γ1, the PH domain-mediated signaling of PLC-γ1 has not yet been elucidated. Here we sought to identify proteins that specifically associate with the PLC-γ1 PH domains in cells, and we found that both PH domains of PLC-γ1 specifically bind to β-tubulin.Heterodimers of α- and β-tubulin are essential cytoskeletal components of the microtubules in all eukaryotes. Microtubules regulate cell division, cell shape, and cell motility via cycles of tubulin polymerization and depolymerization called microtubule instability (10Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar, 11Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). The mitotic spindle, which is a dynamic array of microtubules, is responsible for chromosome segregation into daughter cells during mitosis. Therefore, numerous studies have sought to identify proteins controlling microtubule instability. Two major groups of these proteins have been identified. The microtubule destabilizers, capable of depolymerizing microtubules into α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, include XKCM1 (12Walczak C.E. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 943-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), XKIF2 (13Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E.

Gilli R. Lopez C. Peyrot V. Briand C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Gβγ subunit (21Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Because PLC-γ1 plays pivotal roles in the cellular signaling pathways responsible for triggering the production of second messengers including Ca2+ and IP3, and because overexpression of PLC-γ1 results in cellular transformation (24Chang J.-S. Noh D.Y. Park I.A. Kim M.J. Song H. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5465-5468PubMed Google Scholar), it is critical to identify the proteins that regulate activity of PLC-γ1. Here we sought to identify proteins that specifically interact with the PH domains of PLC-γ1, and we showed for the first time that β-tubulin can bind both PH domains of PLC-γ1. In addition, we determined that PLC-γ1 and β-tubulin transmodulate each other in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Monoclonal anti-β-tubulin and anti-α-tubulin were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and Sigma, and polyclonal anti-β-tubulin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-FLAG M5, polyclonal anti-PLC-γ1, and highly purified tubulin from bovine brain were obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA).In Vitro Binding Assay with GST Fusion Proteins—By using rat PLC-γ1 cDNA (25Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) as the template, GST constructs for fusion proteins were generated by PCR as described previously (26Chang J.-S. Seok H. Kwon T.K. Min D.S. Ahn B.H. Lee Y.H. Suh J.W. Kim J.W. Iwashita S. Omori A. Ichinose S. Numata O. Seo J.K. Oh Y.S. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19697-19702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, then washed extensively with Igepal buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Igepal CA-630, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membrane-bound proteins were detected with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using monoclonal anti-FLAG and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies.DNA Construction and Expression—PCR-amplified mouse cDNAs encoding various tubulin isotypes (Mβ1, Mβ2, Mβ3, Mβ6, and Mα1, kindly provided by Dr. Sally Lewis, New York University) (27Wang D. Villasante A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) were ligated into the EcoRI/SalI restriction sites of the N-terminal epitope tagging vector, pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). When expressed, all α- and β-tubulin cDNAs encoded an N-terminal 9-amino acid FLAG epitope tag. Similarly, the rat cDNA encoding PLC-γ1 was inserted into the HindIII/XbaI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector for mammalian expression. For localization studies in COS-7 cells, we constructed vectors in which the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused with the PH domains of PLC-γ1. cDNAs encoding the PH domains of PLC-γ1 were subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). Expression of GFP-PH1 (amino acids 25–145 of PLC-γ1) and GFP-nPH2 (amino acids 477–547 of PLC-γ1) was assessed by immunofluorescent microscopy and immunoblotting using an anti-GFP antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). All constructs were prepared using the plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing of the ligation sites. COS-7 cells were transfected with the various constructs using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were either harvested for immunoblotting/immunoprecipitation or fixed for indirect immunofluorescent microscopy.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells transfected with plasmids encoding the various FLAG-tagged mouse tubulin constructs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For agonist stimulation, cells were serum-starved for 30 h and then stimulated with either 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 0.2 μg/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 10–20 min. The lysate supernatants were precleared by incubation with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 30 min. Precleared cell lysates were then incubated for 2 h with anti-FLAG antibodies conjugated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, then resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted to a PVDF membrane. The blot was probed with either anti-PLC-γ1 or anti-FLAG antibodies, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL detection using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG.Far Western Blot Analysis—Purified bovine tubulin (0.2 μg per lane) was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation of membranes in 2% skim milk in Tris-buffered Tween 20 (TBT) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with the GST, GST-PH1, GST-nPH2, or GST-SH3 fusion proteins (0.5 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 14 h at 4 °C. After washing in TBT buffer, the membranes were incubated with anti-GST antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed in TBT buffer, and bound proteins were detected by incubation with a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-goat antibody and visualized with an ECL detection system.Expression and Purification of PLC-γ1—The cDNAs for the wild type PLC-γ1 was introduced into the HindIII/XbaI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector. The recombinant PLC-γ1 proteins contained a 9-amino acid FLAG epitope at their N termini. COS-7 cells grown on 100-mm culture dishes were transfected with 5 μg of recombinant plasmid and 10 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested, and the recombinant PLC-γ1 proteins were recovered using a pFLAG-CMV-2 purification kit (Sigma).Sedimentation Experiments—Purified tubulin (10 μm) was incubated with 0.5 μm of PLC-γ1 or BSA (control) in tubulin polymerizing buffer (0.1 m MES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 m glycerol and 0.1 mm GTP, pH 6.5) for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for visualization. A separate fractionation was performed; the resulting supernatant was mixed with 20% glycerol and 1 mm GTP, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for polymerization for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold tubulin polymerizing buffer, homogenized, incubated on ice for depolymerization, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. These polymerization/depolymerization cycles were repeated two times, and the supernatants and pellets from each step were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for Western immunoblotting using an anti-PLC-γ1 antibody.Immunofluorescent Microscopy—COS-7 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 5 μl of Lipofectamine and one of the following: 2 μg of the pFLAG-CMV-2-PLC-γ1 vector, small interfering RNA (siRNA) for PLC-γ1, or empty pFLAG-CMV-2 vector. The siRNAs for human PLC-γ1 were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO); the SMARTpool siRNAs consisted of combinations of GGAAGAAGCAGCTGTGGTT, CCAACCAGCTTAAGAGGAA, GAAGTGAACATGTGGATCA, and GAGCAGTGCCTTTGAAGAA. Following transfection, the cells were grown for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% FBS. For agonist stimulation, the cells were serum-starved for at least 30 h and then stimulated with either 20% FBS (Invitrogen) or 0.2 μg/ml EGF (Sigma) for 10–20 min. The cells were fixed at 37 °C for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with affinity-purified monoclonal anti-FLAG or polyclonal anti-PLC-γ1 antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber. Following complete washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG or rhodamine-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunostained cells were observed with a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600 Epifluorescence Microscope), and the images were captured with a digital image microscope camera.Mass Spectrometry—Gel slices corresponding to the appropriate protein bands were crushed and destained by washing with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mm NH4HCO3. The gel slices were then incubated overnight with trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were eluted with matrix solution (5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 50% acetonitrile) and applied to the MALDI target plate. Peptide molecular weights were measured on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Peptide mass maps were searched against theoretically derived maps from proteins found in the nonredundant protein data base (NCBI) using the ProFound online program (www.proteometrics.com).Fractionation of Monomeric and Polymeric Tubulin—Polymerized (polymeric) and depolymerized (monomeric) tubulins were differentially fractionated from COS-7 cells transfected with vector alone, pFLAG-CMV-2-PLC-γ1, and siRNA for PLC-γ1 according to procedures described previously (28Breitfeld P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfected cells on a 6-well plate were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.3 ml of tubulin polymerizing buffer plus 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 37 °C. The supernatant from a 6-well plate was removed carefully as monomeric tubulin fractions. Polymeric tubulin was extracted from the remaining Triton X-100-insoluble fraction by extracting in SDS lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS) for 10 min at 37 °C. Aliquots from each fraction were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotted with anti-tubulin and anti-PLC-γ1 antibodies.PLC-γ1 Activity Assay—PLC-γ1 activity was measured as described previously (29Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the substrate was prepared as sonicated vesicles of 75 mm PIP2, 75 mm [3H]PIP2 (9,000–10,000 cpm/assay), and 750 mm phosphatidylethanolamine in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0. Reactions were performed for 20 min at 30 °C in a 100-μl final volume containing 10 or 100 ng of PLC-γ1 and 2 mm Ca2+, and terminated by addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:50:0.5) and 400 μl of 1 n HCl. The mixtures were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm. The aqueous phase containing [3H]IP3 was collected and subjected to scintillation counting. The effect of β-tubulin was examined by adding the indicated amounts of α- and β-tubulin to the PLC-γ1 assay mixture.RESULTSThe PH Domains of PLC-γ1 Directly Bind to β-Tubulin—To identify new PLC-γ1-associated proteins, the two PH domains of PLC-γ1 were fused to GST and used for pull-down assays. GSH-Sepharose-coupled GST-PH1 and GST-nPH2 proteins were incubated with NIH3T3 cell lysates (Fig. 1A), using the technique that had been used previously to isolate eukaryotic translational elongation factor (EF)-1α as a PH domain-associated protein (26Chang J.-S. Seok H. Kwon T.K. Min D.S. Ahn B.H. Lee Y.H. Suh J.W. Kim J.W. Iwashita S. Omori A. Ichinose S. Numata O. Seo J.K. Oh Y.S. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19697-19702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the GST-cPH2 fusion protein did not show any visible protein band on our SDS-polyacrylamide gel (26Chang J.-S. Seok H. Kwon T.K. Min D.S. Ahn B.H. Lee Y.H. Suh J.W. Kim J.W. Iwashita S. Omori A. Ichinose S. Numata O. Seo J.K. Oh Y.S. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19697-19702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we used the GST-PH1 and GST-nPH2 fusion proteins in this experiment. As shown in Fig. 1A, the GST-nPH2 fusion protein specifically pulled down a prominent 48-kDa protein band that had been identified previously as EF-1α (26Chang J.-S. Seok H. Kwon T.K. Min D.S. Ahn B.H. Lee Y.H. Suh J.W. Kim J.W. Iwashita S. Omori A. Ichinose S. Numata O. Seo J.K. Oh Y.S. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19697-19702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, both the GST-PH1 and GST-nPH2 fusion proteins specifically pulled down a 55-kDa protein that was not pulled down by the control GST fusion protein. This band was excised from the gel and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry.Table I shows the peptide sequences and mass data derived from a trypsin digest of the 55-kDa protein. When the peptide mass maps were searched against the NCBI protein data base, the 55-kDa protein was identified as mouse β-tubulin. This identification was confirmed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Fig. 1B). We further confirmed that the interaction between PLC-γ1 and β-tubulin occurs in vivo by reciprocal immunoprecipitations: anti-β-tubulin immunoprecipitated PLC-γ1 and vice versa (Fig. 1C and see Fig. 4B). To examine whether the binding is direct or not, we performed far Western blot analysis using purified tubulin. The result shows that GST-PH1 and GST-nPH2 directly bind to β-tubulin, whereas GST alone or GST-SH3 does not (Fig. 1D). Finally, we performed a sedimentation experiment to verify the interaction between PLC-γ1 and β-tubulin. Because self-assembled tubulin microtubules can be pelleted by centrifugation, we incubated purified tubulin (α- and β-tubulin heterodimers) and allowed them to polymerize into microtubules in the presence of PLC-γ1 or BSA (control). As shown in Fig. 1E, PLC-γ1 coprecipitated with polymerized tubulin, whereas BSA did not, indicating that PLC-γ1 binds to microtubules and tubulin heterodimers in vivo. Moreover, when further polymerization and depolymerization cycles were performed with the polymerized tubulin precipitates, PLC-γ1 was found to consistently coexist with tubulin in the supernatant and pellet fractions (Fig. 1E).Table ITryptic peptides of β-tubulin identified by MALDI-TOFPeptide sequenceaAmino acid residues derived from the 55-kDa proteinStart-endbPosition of the amino acid residue in the deduced peptide sequence of mouse β-tubulinMonoisotopic mass ([M + H+])TheoreticalExperimentalFWEVISDEHGIDPTGTYHGDSDLQLER11-373115.423115.37SGPFGQIFRPDNFVFGQSGAGNNWAK69-942797.342797.30GHYTEGAELVDSVLDVVR95-1121957.971957.97LTTPTYGDLNHLVSATMSGVTTCLR208-2322707.332707.29FPGQLNADLR233-2421129.591129.62LAVNMVPFPR244-2531142.631142.65LHFFMPGFAPLTSR254-2671619.831619.84YLTVAAVFR301-3091038.591038.61NSSYFVEWIPNNVK328-3411695.831695.83MSATFIGNSTAIQELFK354-3701856.931856.94ISEQFTAMFR372-3811228.591228.61a Amino acid residues derived from the 55-kDa proteinb Position of the amino acid residue in the deduced peptide sequence of mouse β-tubulin Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Immunofluorescence of transfected FLAG-Mβ-tubulin isotypes in COS-7 cells.A, cells transfected with N-terminal FLAG-tagged mouse α- and β-tubulin isotypes were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. cDNAs encoding FLAG-Mα1(a), -Mβ1(b), -Mβ2(c), -Mβ3(d), and -Mβ6 (e) were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. After 48 h, the cells were fixed and stained with anti-FLAG antibodies. B, FLAG-Mβ2-tubulin coimmunoprecipitates with FLAG-PLC-γ1 in COS-7 cell lysates. COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged mouse β2-tubulin and rat PLC-γ1 were used for immunoprecipitations (IP) of FLAG-Mβ2-tubulin and FLAG-PLC-γ1 using their antibodies. The membrane was probed with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. C, to examine the domain specificity of β-tubulin association, various GST fusion proteins were incubated with COS-7 cell lysates containing each FLAG-Mβ tubulin protein. The bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody.

As shown in Fig. 2A, PLC-γ1 and β-tubulin were localized in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Overlays of the fluorescent microscopy images showed that both proteins dominantly colocalized in the perinuclear region of the COS-7 cells. Generally, agonist treatment results in translocation of PLC-γ1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it binds to receptor tyrosine kinase (30Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev.

We previously demonstrated that in keratinocytes, haptotactic migration on laminin-5 was stimulated by anti-β1 integrin-activating antibody TS2/16, whereas antibodies to α6 and β4, respectively, blocked TS2/16-induced, α3β1-dependent migration. Moreover, α6β4-associated haptotaxis inhibition was linked to a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and required erbB2 activation. erbB2, the ligand-less member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, was shown to form a complex with the hemidesmosomal integrin α6β4. Here, we demonstrate that α6β4 inhibitory effects on haptotaxis are abolished by an anti-E-cadherin antibody, which interferes with cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, antibodies to α6 and β4 stimulated adhesion to an E-cadherin-Fc recombinant protein. In addition, anti-α6/β4 antibodies increased colony size in plated cells, stimulated cell-cell aggregation, and up-regulated E-cadherin localization to cell-cell contacts. These effects were abolished when erbB2 or PI3K were blocked. These results indicate that stimulation of α6β4 increases E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and that this mechanism depends on erbB2 activation. The molecule that links α6β4 with E-cadherin may be the small GTPase cdc42, an effector of PI3K, because dominant-negative cdc42 abolished the inhibitory effect of anti-α6/β4 antibodies and increased basal migration, whereas constitutively active cdc42 prevented the TS2/16-induced increase in haptotaxis. These findings suggest a model whereby α6β4 can augment cell-cell adhesion and slow down haptotaxis over laminin-5 and point to the α6β4-erbB2 heterodimer as an important signaling complex for the formation of cohesive keratinocyte layers.

These findings suggest a model whereby α6β4 can augment cell-cell adhesion and slow down haptotaxis over laminin-5 and point to the α6β4-erbB2 heterodimer as an important signaling complex for the formation of cohesive keratinocyte layers. Epithelia are cohesive sheets of cells that form a protective barrier between the body interior and either the outside environment or organ lumen. To build such tissues, cells must be incorporated into a collective and the whole cell population must stably adhere to the underlying substrate, the basement membrane (BM). 1The abbreviations used are: BM, basement membrane; AJ, adherens junction; ECM, extracellular matrix; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; HDs, hemidesmosomes; Ln-5, laminin-5; p120, p120-catenin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; NHEK, normal human epidermal keratinocyte; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBD, p21-binding domain of PAK1; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. In general, cell-BM and cell-cell adhesion are mediated by distinct receptor systems, among which integrins and cadherins, respectively, play a decisive role (1Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Integrins are αβ heterodimers with large extracellular domains and short, but functionally essential cytoplasmic domains (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Interactions between integrins and the BM not only determine structural features of a tissue but also transmit signals about the surrounding microenvironment to epithelial cells, which in turn determine cellular behavior. BM-binding integrins include α3β1 and α6β4, which are both receptors for the extracellular matrix (ECM) component laminin-5 (Ln-5) (3Burgeson R.E. Christiano A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) but are recruited to different cell adhesion structures. Integrin α3β1 is localized to focal contacts (4DiPersio C.M. Shah S. Hynes R.O. J. Cell. Sci. 1995; 108: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and links Ln-5 to the actin cytoskeleton, mediating cell spreading and migration (5Fuchs E. Dowling J. Segre J. Lo S.H. Yu Q.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas α6β4 is a component of hemidesmosomes (HDs), connecting Ln-5 to the keratin filament network (5Fuchs E. Dowling J. Segre J. Lo S.H. Yu Q.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). HDs are specialized anchoring complexes that allow static adhesion of epithelial cells to the BM and thus guarantee high mechanical stability (7Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In the absence of integrin β4, stratified epithelia, i.e. consisting of several layers like the epidermis of the skin (8O'Brien L.E. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), detach from the BM, leading to the severe blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa (7Borradori L. Sonnenberg A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Therefore, α6β4 may play an essential role during the integration of cells into epithelial sheets. Binding to Ln-5 via α3β1 in focal contacts or α6β4 in HDs transmits distinct molecular signals, which control keratinocyte haptotactic (ECM-directed) migration differently (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This may be the reason why Ln-5 was found to support both static adhesion and cell migration (9De Arcangelis A. Mark M. Kreidberg J. Sorokin L. Georges-Labouesse E. Development. 1999; 126: 3957-3968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Goldfinger L.E. Hopkinson S.B. deHart G.W. Collawn S. Couchman J.R. Jones J.C. J. Cell. Sci. 1999; 112: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nguyen B.P. Ryan M.C. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Clustering of α3β1 by Ln-5 stimulates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is involved in the turnover of focal adhesions and modifications of the cytoskeleton, leading to an increase in cell motility (12Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell. Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 are stimulated (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which are mitogen-activated protein kinases found to up-regulate cell migration (13Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Thus, α3β1 is the integrin that acts in response to the role of Ln-5 as a migratory substrate. In contrast, stimulation of α6β4 inhibits α3β1-controlled cell motility via an increase in PI3K activity (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This result correlates with the finding that Ln-5 may slow down keratinocyte migration, probably due to the formation of cell anchoring hemidesmosomal complexes (10Goldfinger L.E. Hopkinson S.B. deHart G.W. Collawn S. Couchman J.R. Jones J.C. J. Cell. Sci. 1999; 112: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nguyen B.P. Ryan M.C. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, it is in contradiction to the observation that α6β4 activation leads to a PI3K-dependent increase in Matrigel invasion of breast and colon cancer cells (14Mercurio A.M. Rabinovitz I. Shaw L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to the different migratory substrates tested (Ln-5 versus Matrigel), the level of β4 expression (endogenous protein versus overexpressed protein), the mechanism of migration (haptotaxis versus chemotaxis or invasion), or the different cell lines analyzed (keratinocytes versus breast and colon cells). To trigger PI3K activation that leads to a decrease in haptotaxis, α6β4 uses erbB2, a member of the epidermal growth factor/erbB receptor family (15Holbro T. Beerli R.R. Maurer F. Koziczak M. Barbas 3rd, C.F. Hynes N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8933-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), as an adapter protein to interact with downstream signaling pathways (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nistico P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated specific complex formation between α6β4 and erbB2 (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Falcioni R. Antonini A. Nistico P. Di Stefano S. Crescenzi M. Natali P.G. Sacchi A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 236: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), as well as α6β4-dependent activation of erbB2 kinase activity (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cooperation between integrins and growth factor receptors is a common theme and may be a prerequisite for ECM-dependent control of biological processes such as cell motility during wound repair, inflammation, or organogenesis (17Schwartz M.A. Baron V. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Besides cell-BM association, cell-cell contact formation is essential for the assembly of cohesive epithelial sheets and is mediated by several types of junctions, including tight junctions, desmosomes, and adherens junctions (AJs). Recent evidence has exposed a key role for AJs in the regulation of intercellular adhesion as formation of tight junctions and desmosomes depends on the preceding assembly of AJs (18Braga V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). AJs are composed of the transmembrane protein E-cadherin and associated cytoplasmic proteins, like β- or γ-catenin and p120-catenin (p120). The β- and γ-catenins interact with α-catenin, which links the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton, whereas p120 has regulatory functions (20Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Studies in primary keratinocytes underscore the importance of actin in initiating cell-cell adhesion, because cells send out filopodia, which penetrate and project into neighboring cells. Clustered at the filopodia tips are AJs, which zip opposing cell surfaces together and seal them into continuous sheets (21Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Formation of AJs is regulated by several different mechanisms, including phosphorylation of components of the complex or alterations in the interaction with actin (20Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the small GTPases rac1, rhoA and cdc42, which are known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and various cell adhesion events, have been shown to play an active role in the regulation of AJs (18Braga V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Fukata M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that clustering α6β4 can stimulate E-cadherin-controlled cell-cell adhesion in an erbB2-dependent manner and that this event blocks α3β1-mediated keratinocyte haptotaxis. Thus, α6β4 is an integrin that triggers both cell-BM and cell-cell adhesion by binding to the same ECM component Ln-5. These characteristics make α6β4 the ideal regulator of epithelial sheet formation, controlling important processes such as wound healing and cancer invasion. Our results further point to a unique role for erbB2 as signaling adaptor in the regulation of α6β4-controlled cellular behavior. Cell Lines, Constructs, and Retroviral Infections—HaCaT (23Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar) and A431 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were purchased from Vanderbilt University, Skin Diseases Research Center/Phenotype Core, Nashville, TN. Cells from several donors were pooled and cultured in completely defined medium (KGM BulletKit, Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Passages 2 and 3 were used in the described assays. The cDNA encoding the p21-binding domain of PAK1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-PBD) was provided by Dr. X.-D. Ren (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). Constructs encoding dominant-negative cdc42(N17) and constitutively active cdc42(V12) fused to a HA tag were gifts from Dr. K. Mizuno (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). Constructs encoding dominant-negative PI3K regulatory subunit p85ΔiSH2-N and dominant-negative erbB2 (HER2VEK753A) have been described previously (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All cDNAs were subcloned into the retroviral vector pLNCX (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Virus production in PT67 packaging cells (Clontech) and HaCaT infection were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol. A retroviral vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein was used to assess infection efficiency, which was at least 95% in each experiment. Stable HaCaT clones were selected with 0.7 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen). Antibodies, Extracellular Matrix Molecules, and Reagents—The anti-β1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) TS2/16 and the anti-α3 mAb A3-X8 were gifts from Dr. M. E. Hemler (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Anti-α5 mAb KH72 was provided by Dr. Y. Takada (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Anti-β4 mAb AA3 and anti-α6β4 mAb S3–41 were produced in our laboratory. Commercially available are anti-α6 mAb GoH3 (BD Pharmingen) and anti-α3 mAb P1B5 (Chemicon). Anti-E-cadherin mAb DECMA-1 (Sigma) was purified from ascites, using Protein G-Sepharose. mAbs to E-cadherin and p120 (BD Transduction Laboratories) were used for immunoprecipitations and rabbit IgGs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for Western blotting. The same anti-α-, anti-β-, anti-γ-, and p120 catenin IgGs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Bovine fibronectin was from Sigma, and rat Ln-5 was purified in our laboratory. The E-cadherin-Fc fusion protein was produced as described (24Higgins J.M. Mandlebrot D.A. Shaw S.K. Russell G.J. Murphy E.A. Chen Y.T. Nelson W.J. Parker C.M. Brenner M.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Human IgG, LY294002, and Tyrphostins AG 825 and AG1478 were from Calbiochem. Migration and Adhesion Assays—Transwell migration assays were performed as described (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Filters were coated with 0.25 μg/ml (HaCaT and A431) or 0.4 μg/ml (NHEK) Ln-5 in PBS. Cells (HaCaT and NHEK: 1.2 × 105 cells/100 μl/filter; A431: 6 × 104 cells/100 μl/filter) in migration medium, MM (culture medium without fetal calf serum or Single-Quots) were preincubated with mAbs, reagents, or vehicle for 30 min at room temperature before plating. Each experiment was done at least three times, and results are expressed as mean ± S.D. of relative cell migration with non-stimulated cells set as 1. Adhesion assays were performed as described in Higgins et al. (24Higgins J.M. Mandlebrot D.A. Shaw S.K. Russell G.J. Murphy E.A. Chen Y.T. Nelson W.J. Parker C.M. Brenner M.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Microtiter 96-well plates were coated with 5 ng/well (HaCaT), 7 ng/well (A431), or 10 ng/well (NHEK) E-cadherin-Fc protein in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) overnight at 4 °C. Then, wells were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached and washed twice in adhesion buffer (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Next, cells (7.5 × 104 HaCaT/NHEK cells/100 μl/well; 5 × 104 A431 cells/100 μl/well) were preincubated with mAbs for 30 min at room temperature before plating in wells, which were washed twice with adhesion buffer after blocking. Cells were maintained at 37 °C for 40 min, then 2 × 100 μl of Percoll floatation medium (10% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, density 1.13 g/ml) for HaCaT, 35% Percoll for A431, or 40% Percoll for NHEK containing 9 mg/ml NaCl) were added to each well. Adherent cells were fixed for 15 min with 50 μl/well of 25% glutaraldehyde, washed with PBS and stained with crystal violet (0.5% in 20% MeOH) for 10 min. Excess dye was washed off with water, cells were solubilized in 1% SDS, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm. Bars represent mean percentage of control adhesion ± S.D. (n = 3) with non-treated control cells set at 100%. All values have had background subtracted, which represents cell adhesion to wells blocked with milk. Aggregation Assays—Microtiter 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 5% dry milk in PBS. HaCaT cells (1.2 × 105 cells/100 μl/well) in MM were preincubated with AG825, AG1478, or vehicle (Me2SO) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by mAbs (TS2/16, 40 μg/ml; GoH3, 30 μg/ml; AA3, 50 μg/ml) for an additional 15 min. Cells were seeded and immediately processed to evaluate the number of isolated cells at time 0, or they were allowed to aggregate at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, 150 μl of PBS was added, and the cells were passed three times through a 1000-μl pipette tip and then transferred to a 48-well plate containing 250 μl of 6% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Photographs of six fields in each well were taken and cells were counted. Aggregation was quantified using the index (N0 - Nt)/N0. N0 is the number of isolated cells at time 0 and Nt the number of isolated cells after 2 h. Each experiments was done at least three times. Immunofluorescence Studies—Glass coverslips were coated overnight at 4 °C with Ln-5 (1 μg/ml), fibronectin (10 μg/ml), or mAbs (P1B5, 20 μg/ml; A3X8, 20 μg/ml; TS2/16, 40 μg/ml; GoH3, 30 μg/ml; AA3, 50 μg/ml). Cells were detached and washed in MM as described for migration assays. Then, 8 × 104 cells/500 μl/coverslip were seeded, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. Then, F-actin was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and E-cadherin with DECMA-1, which was labeled with the Alexa Fluor488 mAb labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Samples were analyzed by sequential scanning, using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser scanning microscope. Immunoprecipitations—Cell culture dishes (6 cm) were coated with 1 μg of Ln-5/dish in PBS at 4 °C overnight and then prewarmed to 37 °C for 1 h. HaCaT cells (2 × 106) in MM were preincubated with mAbs for 30 min at 37 °C in suspension before plating onto ligand-coated dishes. (If cells were co-stimulated with TS2/16 and a second antibody, the latter was added 10 min before TS2/16.) After 5 h at 37 °C, attached cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed for 1 h on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 6 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 tablet/50 ml of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min, and mAbs were added to the supernatant for 3 h at 4 °C. Then, protein-mAb complexes were collected with Protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Complexes were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer before boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and blotted, and blots were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted 1:2000 in 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Each sample was divided in two and analyzed for α-catenin and β-catenin content or for E-cadherin and α-, β-, γ-, or p120 catenin content, using the ECLplus system (Amersham Biosciences) and a STORM 860 fluorometer. Production of GST-PBD and GTPase Assays—Production of GST-PBD protein and GTPase assays were performed as described in del Pozo et al. (25del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Detached cells were pretreated with mAbs as described in immunoprecipitation experiments and were seeded in Ln-5-coated dishes. After 5 h at 37 °C, cells were chilled on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were then incubated with 20 μg of GST-PBD-glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. Bound protein was washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted with SDS sample buffer. Bound cdc42 or rac1 was detected by Western blotting using an anti-cdc42 or anti-rac1 mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories). Total lysates were also analyzed for the presence of cdc42 or rac1 for normalization. Stimulation of α6β4 Establishes Cell Morphology and Cell-Cell Contact Formation Similar to Ln-5—Given the role of BM components in establishing an epithelial phenotype, e.g. the formation of cohesive sheets, cells should form better organized, tighter monolayers when plated on Ln-5 than on other, non-BM, ECM components. To test this, we plated HaCaT keratinocytes on Ln-5 and on fibronectin and stained the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1A). On Ln-5, cells were neatly positioned next to each other, forming a cobblestone-like monolayer with well developed cell-cell contacts. Actin was generally organized as a cortical ring. On fibronectin, cell boundaries were less well pronounced, and in many instances cells overlapped each other. Actin formed a robust network of stress fibers. Thus, Ln-5 and fibronectin induce distinct cell morphologies in HaCaT. Next, we analyzed the relative contribution of the two Ln-5-binding integrins to the Ln-5-specific effect. Because the sites on Ln-5, which are specifically bound by either α3β1 or α6β4, are only broadly defined yet (26Hintermann E. Quaranta V. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), there are no peptides available that could be used to stimulate α3β1 and α6β4 individually. Therefore, we made use of mAbs to α3, β1, α6, and β4 to selectively cluster α3β1 or α6β4 (Table I). Anti-α3 mAb A3-X8 has no effect on adhesion to Ln-5 but blocks haptotaxis due to inhibition of ERK1/2 stimulation (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Anti-α3 mAb P1B5 interferes with adhesion to Ln-5 and thus inhibits migration (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TS2/16, an anti-β1 mAb, stimulates adhesion and migration on Ln-5 and increases ERK1/2 and FAK activity (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because keratinocytes express several different β1 integrins, e.g. α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1, treatment with TS2/16 may stimulate all β1 integrins simultaneously, leading to a phenotype, which is not exclusively α3β1-controlled, even when cells are plated on Ln-5. Anti-α6/β4 mAbs GoH3 and AA3 show no effect on adhesion to Ln-5, however, they inhibit haptotaxis by stimulating erbB2 phosphorylation and PI3K activity (6Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell. Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We plated cells on the described mAbs to see whether clustering of α3β1 or α6β4 would lead to the same morphology as triggered by Ln-5 (Fig. 1B). We found that cells on mAbs to α3 and β1 were rather round and formed cell-cell contacts over short distances only. In contrast, cells plated on the anti-α6 mAb, and even more so on the anti-β4 mAb, were much more spread, and cell-cell contacts were well developed. Thus, clustering of α6β4, especially when performed with the anti-β4 mAb, induced the same cell morphology as Ln-5. Importantly, the effect of mAbs to α6 and β4 was not blocked by β1 integrin clustering (Fig. 1B).Table IIntegrin-specific antibodies and role in adhesion and motility regulation on Ln-5AntibodyAntigenImpact on adhesionImpact on haptotaxisImpact on signalingA3-X8α3No effectInhibitionInhibition (ERK1/2)P1B5α3InhibitionInhibitionNot analyzedTS2/16β1StimulationStimulationStimulation (ERK1/2, FAK)S3-41α6β4No effectInhibitionStimulation (erbB2, PI3K)GoH3α6No effectInhibitionStimulation (erbB2, PI3K)AA3β4No effectInhibitionStimulation (erbB2, PI3K) Open table in a new tab Ligation of α6β4 Induces the Formation of Larger Cell Clusters Than Ligation of α3β1, and This Process Needs Active erbB2 and PI3K—Looking at larger numbers of cells plated on anti-integrin mAbs, it became apparent that anti-α6 or anti-β4 mAbs, alone or together with anti-β1 mAb, induced cells to form clusters, which we term colonies, that contained more cells than colonies on anti-β1 mAb only (Fig. 2A). In an attempt to quantify this phenomenon, we counted single cells and doublets per microscopic field, assuming that a decrease in the number of single cells and doublets is the result of an increase in colony size, if the total number of plated cells is constant. Such analysis revealed that, when plated on anti-β1 mAb, 54.33 ± 3.38 cells existed as single cells or doublets, whereas the remaining cells formed larger colonies. This number decreased to 29.00 ± 2.33 and 18.33 ± 1.37 single cells or doublets on anti-α6 mAb and anti-β4 mAb, respectively, and was even lower when plated simultaneously on mAbs to α6 and β1 (15.00 ± 1.38) or mAbs to β4 and β1 (12.56 ± 0.84) (Fig. 2B). In summary, α6β4 is the major Ln-5-binding integrin that triggers cell-cell adhesion. Preincubating cells with inhibitors of erbB2 or PI3K had no effect on the number of single cells and doublets on the anti-β1 mAb (Fig. 2, A and B). However, these inhibitors reduced the size and number of colonies on anti-α6 or anti-β4 mAbs, whether or not anti-β1 mAb was present, as judged by an increase in the number of single cells and doublets compared with each Me2SO control (Fig. 2, A and B). These data indicate that clustering of α6β4 triggers an increase in cell-cell adhesion, which results in the formation of larger colonies and a decrease in the number of single cells or doublets. This event depends on active erbB2 and PI3K, because inhibition of these kinases increases the number of single cells and doublets, an indication of a decrease in cell-cell adhesion.

This polynucleotide kinase was demonstrated to have a 5′-kinase domain as well as a 3′-phosphohydrolase domain. The RM378 polynucleotide kinase had limited sequence similarity to the 5′-kinase domain of the T4 bacteriophage polynucleotide kinase, but apparent homology was not evident within the 3′-phosphohydrolase domain. The domain order of RM378 polynucleotide kinase was reversed relative to that of the T4 polynucleotide kinase. The RM378 phosphohydrolase domain displayed some sequence similarity with the bacterial poly(A) polymerase family, including an HD motif characteristic of the diverse superfamily of metal-dependent HD phosphohydrolases. The RM378 polynucleotide kinase was biochemically characterized and shown to possess 5′-kinase activity on RNA and single- and double-stranded DNA at elevated temperatures. It also showed phosphohydrolase activity on 2′:3′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. This description of the RM378 polynucleotide kinase, along with the recently described RM378 RNA ligase, suggests that the RM378 bacteriophage has to counter a similar anti-phage mechanism in <i>R. marinus</i> as the one that the T4 phage has to counter in <i>Escherichia coli</i>."

Recent high-profile outbreaks have highlighted the global risk that infectious agents, both new and old, represent for society. The experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) shows the risk posed by emerging infectious diseases, but also the power of strongly coordinated global surveillance and public health measures, coupled with scientific research, to keep infection under control1,2. Diseases such as drug-resistant malaria continue to be threats. There is a need to enhance global resources to investigate, detect and respond to emerging infections, and to appropriately coordinate and direct research efforts to meet the challenges presented by these diseases."

The accumulated evidence has proved that GSH interacts with MRP1 and stimulates drug transport. However, the mechanism of GSH-dependent drug transport by MRP1 remains unclear. In this study, we used limited tryptic digestion of MRP1 in isolated membrane vesicles, in the presence and absence of GSH, to investigate the influence of GSH on MRP1 conformation. We found that GSH inhibited the generation of an ∼35-kDa C-terminal tryptic fragment (including a C-terminal His tag) termed C2 from MRP1. This effect of GSH was not because of direct inhibition of trypsin activity, and agosterol A enhanced the inhibitory effect of GSH. The main cleavage site in MRP1 for the generation of the C2 fragment by trypsin resided between TMD2 and NBD2 of MRP1. Limited tryptic digestion of membrane vesicles expressing various truncated and co-expressed MRP1 fragments in the presence and absence of GSH revealed that GSH inhibited the production of the C2 fragment only in the presence of the L0 region of MRP1. Thus the L0 region is required for the inhibition of trypsinization of the C-terminal half of MRP1 by GSH. These findings, together with previous reports, suggest that GSH induces a conformational change at a site within the MRP1 that is indispensable for the interaction of MRP1 with its substrates.

Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar). MRP1 (multidrug resistance protein 1) is a 190-kDa glycoprotein that belongs to a family of membrane proteins referred to as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that typically contain two transmembrane domains (TMD) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD) (4Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar). In most ABC transporters, hydrolysis of ATP by the NBDs is believed to provide energy for substrate transport (4Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar). MRP1 is distinguished from the other ABC transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), by an extra N-terminal TMD that is connected to the core region (ΔMRP) by a cytoplasmic linker region (L0) (5Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar). The human MRP1 is frequently overexpressed in cells whose MDR is not mediated by P-gp (2Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Semin.

As an organic anion transporter, MRP1 actively transports a wide variety of diverse anionic compounds (6Zaman G.J. Flens M.J. van Leusden M.R. de Haas M. Mulder H.S. Lankelma J. Pinedo H.M.

It was also found that although GSH is a poor substrate for MRP1, it can stimulate the ATP-dependent transport of certain non-anionic organic drugs such as vincristine (VCR) (9Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar), adriamycin (ADM) (10Renes J. de Vries E.G. Nienhuis E.F. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Br. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6404-6411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and a tobacco-specific carcinogen, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (14Leslie E.M. Ito K.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that GSH is required for vesicular transport of VCR by MRP1 and for inhibition by VCR of the transport of organic anions by MRP1. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]GSH into membrane vesicles from MRP1-transfected cells was stimulated by VCR in a dose-dependent manner (9Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment, however, did not answer the question of whether GSH is an activator or a co-transported substrate of MRP1. To clarify the role of GSH in MRP1 drug transport, we synthesized a photoaffinity analog of AG-A (azido-AG-A) that could reverse MRP1-mediated MDR (15Chen Z.S. Aoki S. Komatsu M. Ueda K. Sumizawa T. Furukawa T. Okumura H. Ren X.Q. Belinsky M.G. Lee K. Kruh G.D. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We reported recently (16Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Aoki S. Nakajima T. Sumizawa T. Haraguchi M. Chen Z.S. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23197-23206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that GSH was required for the binding of azido-AG-A to the C-terminal half of MRP1. A similar conclusion was reached in another study by using a drug known as LY475776 (17Mao Q. Qiu W. Weigl K.E. Lander P.A. Tabas L.B. Shepard R.L. Dantzig A.H. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28690-28699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the stimulation of azido-AG-A binding to MRP1 by GSH remains unclear. Recently, it has been reported that a photoactive analog of GSH (azidophenacyl-[35S]GSH) photolabels MRP1 at two sites that reside in the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein. No stimulation of photolabeling of MRP1 with azidophenacyl-[35S]GSH could be detected following treatment with varying concentrations of LY475776 (18Qian Y.M. Grant C.E. Westlake C.J. Zhang D.W.

These observations suggested that the first event in GSH-dependent drug transport is the interaction of GSH with MRP1. GSH may then induce a conformational change in MRP1 that is required for drug binding. Ligand-induced conformational change is a common mechanism for the modulation of protein function (19Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Dover Publications, Mineola, NY1987: 282-319Google Scholar). For example a cyclic pentapeptide ligand can induce a conformational change in the extracellular segment of the integrin αvβ3 as shown by crystal structure analysis (20Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Analyses of proteins by protease digestion in the presence and absence of ligands have proved to be extremely useful techniques for the detection of ligand-induced protein conformational changes (21Tan S. Richmond T.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 367-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Ishii S. Hayashi H. Okamoto A. Kagamiyama H.

In the present study, we have performed limited tryptic digestion of MRP1 in the presence or absence of GSH and found that GSH inhibited tryptic digestion of the C-terminal half of the protein.

Autoradiograms were exposed for 10 h. [3H] LTC4 Uptake by Membrane Vesicles—The extent of [3H] LTC4 uptake was measured using a rapid filtration technique as described previously (26Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated membrane vesicles (25 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence or absence of 4 mm ATP in 50 μl of transport buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2,10 mm phosphocreatine, and 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase) with 100 nm [3H]LTC4 for the indicated times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped at the indicated times with 3 ml of ice-cold stop solution (0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). The samples were passed through Millipore filters (GVWP, 0.22 μm pore size) under a light vacuum. Following three rinses with 3 ml of cold stop solution, the filters were immersed in liquid scintillation fluid, and their radioactivity was measured. GSH Inhibits the Generation of a C-terminal Tryptic Fragment of MRP1—To use protease digestion as a tool to monitor conformational changes induced by GSH in MRP1, we first established the cleavage fragments generated by limited tryptic digestion of MRP1. It has been shown, using N- and C-terminal MRP1-specific monoclonal antibodies, that the most accessible trypsin site on MRP1 lies within the cytoplasmic linker region between NBD1 and TMD2 (16Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Aoki S. Nakajima T. Sumizawa T. Haraguchi M. Chen Z.S. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23197-23206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tryptic cleavage at this site generates a 67-kDa fragment termed C1. When the concentration of trypsin was increased, or the incubation time with trypsin was extended, the C-terminal C1 band was further degraded to an ∼35-kDa C2 fragment that could be detected with the C-terminal m6 antibody (Fig. 1, A and B, left). We then determined whether GSH-MRP1 interaction could induce a conformational change in MRP1 detectable by the generation of altered tryptic fragments. For this experiment KB/MRP membrane vesicles (50 μg of protein) were digested with trypsin at 20 ng/ml over a 90-min period in the presence or absence of 10 mm GSH and immunoblotted with the C-terminal antibody m6. As shown in Fig. 1B, the presence of GSH (right) suppressed the generation of the C2 tryptic fragment. The addition of GSH had no effect on the tryptic digestion pattern when assayed with an N-terminal MRP1 antibody r1 (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of GSH on the generation of the C2 fragment by trypsin was dose-dependent with decreasing amounts of the C2 fragment generated as the GSH concentration was increased from 0.5 to 10 mm (Fig. 1C). We next investigated whether the inhibitory effect of GSH on trypsin digestion of MRP1 might be due to a decreased enzymatic activity of trypsin in the presence of GSH. We therefore assayed the effect of GSH on trypsin activity by using BAEE as a substrate. As controls, we also tested the effect of other reducing agents such as cysteine and DTT, the nonreducing GSH analogs methyl-GSH and ethyl-GSH, and glycine and glutamic acids (the amino acids that constitute GSH) on trypsin activity. The mean of three independent experiments was analyzed. As shown in Table I, agents with reducing activities do inhibit trypsin activity. GSH, cysteine, and DTT at a concentration of 10 mm decreased trypsin activity by 15.5, 16.8, and 65.4%, respectively. In contrast, methyl-GSH at a concentration of 10 mm decreased trypsin activity by only 3.7%, and ethyl-GSH at a concentration of 10 mm had no effect on trypsin activity. We therefore determined whether 10 mm methyl-GSH or 10 mm ethyl-GSH could also suppress the generation of the C2 tryptic fragment of MRP1. As shown in Fig. 2A, both methyl- and ethyl-GSH inhibited the generation of the C2 tryptic fragment to a similar extent as GSH. In contrast, 10 mm DTT had a lesser effect on the generation of the C2 fragment, even though it inhibited trypsin activity to a greater extent than the GSH derivatives. Similarly the addition of cysteine, glycine, or glutamic acid, the amino acids that constitute GSH, had a much weaker effect on the generation of the C2 fragment by trypsin, even though cysteine could inhibit trypsin activity to a similar extent as GSH (Fig. 2B).Table IModulation of trypsin activity by GSH and other agents Trypsin activity was assayed using BAEE as substrate, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in the absence (control) and in the presence of various agents. Residual trypsin activity (mean of three experiments ± S.E.) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”AgentsResidual activity% controlControl10050 mm GSH53.5 ± 6.810 mm GSH84.5 ± 3.52 mm GSH95.4 ± 1.310 mmS-methyl GSH96.3 ± 3.910 mmS-ethyl GSH100.7 ± 4.910 mm glycine98.1 ± 0.910 mm glutamic acid100.7 ± 0.510 mm cysteine83.2 ± 0.310 mm DTT34.6 ± 5.61 mm AG-A105.3 ± 2.91 mm VCR95.7 ± 6.0 Open table in a new tab These data are consistent with our previous observation that GSH stimulates azido-AG-A photolabeling of MRP1 independently of its reducing activity (16Ren X.Q.

They also indicate that GSH inhibition of the generation of the C2 tryptic fragment is not due to the direct inhibition of trypsin activity. The most likely explanation is that the binding of GSH to MRP1 may inhibit access of trypsin to MRP1 and the consequent cleavage reaction leading to generation of the C2 band. We have found previously (30Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Haraguchi M. Nakajima T. Ikeda R. Kobayashi M. Akiyama S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14132-14140Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that GSH was required for the binding of a photoactive analog of AG-A to the C-terminal half of MRP1, and that amino acids 1223–1295 of MRP1 were required for GSH-dependent binding of AG-A to MRP1. Based on the molecular size of the C2 fragment, the cleavage site that leads to the generation of C2 must be close to this region. Therefore, we investigated whether the VCR that is transported by MRP1 in the presence of GSH or AG-A might affect the generation of the C2 fragment. Limited trypsinization of MRP1 was conducted in the presence of the drugs alone or in combination with GSH, and the generation of the C2 fragment was monitored. As indicated in Fig. 3A, the addition of AG-A or VCR alone had no effect on the generation of the C2 fragment by trypsin. However, when AG-A was added in combination with GSH, AG-A considerably attenuated the generation of the C2 fragment (Fig. 3A). The effect of various concentrations of AG-A, ranging from 10 μm to 1 mm, on the generation of the C2 band in the presence of 2 mm GSH was investigated (Fig. 3B). Increasing AG-A concentrations enhanced the suppressive effect of 2 mm GSH on the tryptic generation of the C2 fragment. Because AG-A does not inhibit trypsin activity as shown in Table I, AG-A must enhance the suppressive effect of GSH by a different mechanism. The GSH-sensitive Tryptic Site Is Located in the Cytoplasmic Region of MRP1 between TMD2 and NBD2—We next investigated the location in MRP1 of the cleavage site that generates the C2 fragment. Because C2 has a molecular mass of about 35 kDa in SDS-PAGE, the cleavage site that generates the C2 fragment should be located about 350 amino acids upstream of the C-terminal end (1531) of MRP1. This would localize the C2 tryptic site within TMD2 of MRP1. If this is the case, then the C2 fragment should be associated with the membrane fraction. We therefore investigated the potential membrane association of the cleaved C2 fragment. KB/MRP membrane vesicles were digested with trypsin at 20 ng/ml for 30 min and then centrifuged to separate the membrane and soluble fractions. As indicated in Fig. 4A, most of the C2 tryptic fragments were detected in the soluble fraction, and the residual membrane-bound C2 fragments were released from the membrane by washing with the high concentration of NaCl, indicating that the tryptic site suppressed by GSH must be located in the cytoplasmic region of MRP1 between TMD2 and NBD2. To localize more exactly the cleavage site that generates the C2 fragment, we made use of a C-terminally His-tagged MRP1 expressed in Sf21 insect cells. This expression system allows dissection of the functional domains of MRP1. We have shown previously that a 10xHis tag inserted into the C terminus of MRP1 has no effect on the function of the transporter (26Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We first determined the expression of the His-tagged MRP1 in insect cells. Because MRP1 in Sf21 insect cells is less glycosylated than in KB/MRP cells, it migrates as an ∼170-kDa band (26Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Chen Z.S. Okumura H. Aoki S. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Komatsu M. Mei X.D. Akiyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). We then determined whether trypsin digestion of insect-expressed MRP1 could generate a C2 fragment similar to that generated in KB/MRP cells and, if so, whether this digestion was GSH-sensitive. KB/MRP and Sf/MRP membrane vesicles (50 μg of protein) were therefore digested with trypsin at 20 ng/ml for 90 min in the presence or absence of 10 mm GSH. Tryptic fragments were immunoblotted with either the C-terminal antibody m6 or an anti-His tag mAb as appropriate. As shown in Fig. 4C, the C2 fragment was detected with both of these antibodies, although the size of the C2 band derived from Sf/MRP membrane vesicles was slightly larger than that from KB/MRP probably due to the presence of the 10xHis tag in the C terminus of MRP1. The generation of the C2 fragment in Sf/MRP membrane vesicles was also inhibited in the presence of 10 mm GSH (Fig. 4C). Thus the His-tagged MRP1 expressed in insect cells can be used as a model of GSH suppression of MRP tryptic digestion. Because amino acid sequencing of the C2 fragment was difficult (data not shown) and the C2 fragment was not associated with membrane, the cleavage site probably resides within the cytoplasmic region close to the C terminus of TM17. We expressed a C-terminal fragment, MRP1-(1264–1531), containing a His tag in Sf21 insect cells. MRP1-(1264–1531) had an electrophoretic migration similar to that of the C2 tryptic fragment generated from Sf/MRP membrane vesicles (Fig. 4D). These data suggested that the main cleavage site in MRP1 for the generation of the C2 fragment resides between TMD2 and NBD2.

To determine the role of the 15 cysteine residues in the heart/skeletal muscle isoform of CPTI (M-CPTI) on catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, we constructed a 6-residue N-terminal, a 9-residue C-terminal, and a 15-residue cysteineless M-CPTI by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. Both the 9-residue C-terminal mutant enzyme and the complete 15-residue cysteineless mutant enzyme are inactive but that the 6-residue N-terminal cysteineless mutant enzyme had activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to those of wild-type M-CPTI. Mutation of each of the 9 C-terminal cysteines to alanine or serine identified a single residue, Cys-305, to be important for catalysis. Substitution of Cys-305 with Ala in the wild-type enzyme inactivated M-CPTI, and a single change of Ala-305 to Cys in the 9-residue C-terminal cysteineless mutant resulted in an 8-residue C-terminal cysteineless mutant enzyme that had activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to those of the wild type, suggesting that Cys-305 is the residue involved in catalysis. Sequence alignments of CPTI with the acyltransferase family of enzymes in the GenBank™ led to the identification of a putative catalytic triad in CPTI consisting of residues Cys-305, Asp-454, and His-473. Based on the mutagenesis and substrate labeling studies, we propose a mechanism for the acyltransferase activity of CPTI that uses a catalytic triad composed of Cys-305, His-473, and Asp-454 with Cys-305 serving as a probable nucleophile, thus acting as a site for covalent attachment of the acyl molecule and formation of a stable acyl-enzyme intermediate. This would in turn allow carnitine to act as a second nucleophile and complete the acyl transfer reaction.

The molecular/structural basis for the differences in malonyl-CoA sensitivity between M-CPTI and L-CPTI was established recently by our demonstration that substitution of the conserved C-terminal L-CPTI residue Glu-590 with alanine increased its malonyl-CoA sensitivity close to that observed with M-CPTI (9Napal L.

For M-CPTI, our site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that in addition to Glu-3 and His-5, Val-19, Leu-23, and Ser-24 are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high-affinity binding but not for catalysis (19Shi J.

It has been generally predicted that the catalytic and substrate binding sites in both L-CPTI and M-CPTI reside in the C-terminal region of the enzymes. Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that mutations of conserved arginine and tryptophan residues in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI abolish catalytic activity (21Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the major effect of the mutations was on the Vmax, we predict that the conserved arginine and tryptophan residues stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex by charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions (21Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that deletion of the conserved C-terminal M-CPTI residue Leu-764 or mutation to Arg inactivates the enzyme (22Dai J. Zhu H.

CPTI is an active acyltransferase that belongs to the acyltransferase family of enzymes; however, the molecular mechanism by which CPTI transfers the acyl group from the acyl-CoA to carnitine remains to be elucidated. In this study, our cysteine-scanning mutagenesis demonstrates that a single substitution mutation of Cys-305 to alanine abolishes M-CPTI catalytic activity. Construction of Human Heart M-CPTI Cysteineless Mutants—Mutants were constructed using the QuikChange™ multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with plasmid p12E (for N-terminal mutagenesis) and p13E (for C-terminal mutagenesis) as the templates. Plasmid p12E is a derivative of pTZ18U, containing wild-type N-terminal human M-CPTI from ATG downstream to 622 bp and a fragment of the vector pHWO10 in the extreme 5′-end, whereas plasmid p13E is a derivative of pTZ18U, containing the C-terminal end of M-CPTI from 623 bp to the stop codon. The mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutants were in the vectors p12E and p13E. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For construction of the N-terminal 6-residue cysteineless mutant, plasmid 12E containing the substitution mutants C75A, C86K, C90T, C95G, C133S, and C155M was digested with AgeI-EcoRI and subcloned into AgeI-EcoRI-cut wild-type M-CPTI cDNA in the pGAP yeast expression vector (6Zhu H.

The EcoRI-cut 5′ M-CPTI cDNA fragment containing the six cysteine mutants was then ligated into an EcoRI-cut 3′ M-CPTI cDNA fragment of wild-type p-GAP-M-CPTI to generate the N-terminal cysteineless mutant M-CPTI, N6C. For construction of the C-terminal cysteineless M-CPTI, an EcoRI fragment of plasmid 13E containing the 9 mutated C-terminal M-CPTI cysteines (C305A, C448A, C504A, C526A, C548S, C562A, C586A, C608A, and C659A) was ligated to EcoRI-cut wild-type p-GAP-M-CPTI to generate C9C, the 9-residue cysteineless mutant M-CPTI in pHW010. For construction of the cysteineless M-CPTI mutant, a 1.7-kb EcoRI fragment of the mutant C9C containing mutations of all the C-terminal cysteines was used to replace the corresponding EcoRI fragment of the plasmid N6C that contains the N-terminal six cysteine mutants to generate the 15-residue cysteineless M-CPTI mutant in pHW010. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All the primers used for cysteine mutagenesis are listed in Table I, and the mutations are highlighted in bold. All the cysteine residues in human M-CPTI were either altered to alanine (if human L-CPTI has a cysteine residue at the corresponding position) or to the corresponding amino acid residue in human L-CPTI.Table IPrimers used for construction of M-CPTI cysteine mutantsMutationPrimerPrimers used for QuikChange™ multisite-directed mutagenesis N-terminal cysteine mutants C75A5′-GAGATGTCCACGTTGGCGAAGGAGGAACCCAC-3′ C133S5′-CATCCACCCATGGTAGCTGAGAAGCAGCTTCAG-3′ C155M5′-CTGGATAGAAGGCGGATCATCATAGCCCAGATCCTGGTC-3′ CKTG (C86K,C90T,C95G)5′-TGCGGGGTCTGGTAGGGGCCACCCCCCTGAGGGAGGGTTCTCTGGATCTTACTGACCAGCCCCA-3′ C-terminal cysteine mutation C305A5′-CTCCATCTGGTAGGAGGCCATAGGCACTATGCC-3′ C448A5′-CAAACCACCTGTTGTAGGCGTTGCCATGTAGCAG-3′ C504A5′-GTTCGGTTTGCCCAGGGCGTGCCCGGTCTCCGT-3′ C526A5′-CTCGATGACCGCCTGGGCCTGTTTTGGAATGTC-3′ C548S5′-GGGCAGGAACTGGAAGGAGTACAACTCCACGTC-3′ C562A5′-CATCAGGGCTGGTCCGGGCCTTCTTCTTGATGAGGCC-3′ C586A5′-GGCCTCATAGGTCAGGGCGAACTTACCCCTGTC-3′ C608A5′-GTGGACTCGCTGGTAGCGGAACGCACAGTCTCAG-3′ C659A5′-GGAGACCAAGTAAAGGGCGAAGAGGTGCCTGTC-3′Primers used for the single overlap mutations C-terminal single cysteine mutation C305AF5′-GGCATAGTGCCTATGGCCTCCTACCAGATGGAG-3′ C305AR5′-CTCCATCTGGTAGGAGGCCATAGGCACTATGCC-3′ C305ACK5′-GGCATAGTGCCTATGGC-3′ C448AR5′-CAAACCACCTGTTGTAGGCGTTGCCATGTAGCAG-3′ C448ACK5′-CTGCTACATGGCAACG-3′ C504AF5′-ACGGAGACCGGGCACGCCCTGGGCAAACCGAAC-3′ C504AR5′-GTTCGGTTTGCCCAGGGCGTGCCCGGTCTCCGT-3′ C504ACK5′-ACGGAGACCGGGCACGC-3′ C526AF5′-GACATTCCAAAACAGGCCCAGGCGGTCATCGAG-3′ C526AR5′-CTCGATGACCGCCTGGGCCTGTTTTGGAATGTC-3′ C526ACK5′-GACATTCCAAAACAGGC-3′ C548SF5′-GACGTGGAGTTGTACTCCTTCCAGTTCCTGCCC-3′ C548SR5′-GGGCAGGAACTGGAAGGAGTACAACTCCACGTC-3′ C548SCK5′-GACGTGGAGTTGTACTC-3′ C562AF5′-GGCCTCATCAAGAAGGCCCGGACCAGCCCTGATG-3′ C562AR5′-CATCAGGGCTGGTCCGGGCCTTCTTGATGAGGCC-3′ C562ACK5′-GGCCTCATCAAGAAGGC-3′ C586AF5′-GACAGGGGTAAGTTCGCCCTGACCTATGAGGCC-3′ C586AR5′-GGCCTCATAGGTCAGGGCGAACTTACCCCTGTC-3′ C586ACK5′-GACAGGGGTAAGTTCGC-3′ C608AF5′-CTGAGACTGTGCGTTCCGCTACCAGCGAGTCCAC-3′ C608AR5′-GTGGACTCGCTGGTAGCGGAACGCACAGTCTCAG-3′ C608ACK5′-CTGAGACTGTGCGTTCCGC-3′ C659AR5′-GGAGACCAAGTAAAGGGCGAAGAGGTGCCTGTC-3′ C659ACK5′-GACAGGCACCTCTTCC-3′ R35′-ACCAAGTAAAGGCAGAAG-3′ F25′-TCATGTATCGCCGTAAAC-3′ Over EF25′-GCCCGCTCGAGATGGCGGAAGCTCACCAGGC-3′Primers used for the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit A305C revertant mutation A305CF25′-CTGGGCATAGTGCCTATGTGCTCCTACCAGATGGAGAGG-3′ A305CR25′-CCTCTCCATCTGGTAGGAGCACATAGGCACTATGCCCAG-3′ A305CCK5′-CTGGGCATAGTGCCTATGTG-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of the Single C-terminal M-CPTI Cysteine Mutants C504A, C526A, C548S, C562A, C586A, and C608A—Mutants were constructed by the overlap extension PCR method using the primers shown in Table I with the wild-type plasmid DNA (pGAP M-CPTI) as template (23Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology: Current Innovations. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar). For example, to construct the C562A mutant, the primers F2-C562AR and C562AF-R3 were used to generate 840- and 300-bp PCR products, respectively, using the wild-type M-CPTI cDNA as template. The two PCR products were purified, mixed, and used as template for a second-round PCR with the primer F2-R3. The 1.13-kb PCR product was digested with SphI-BglII and ligated into SphI-BglII-cut wild-type M-CPTI cDNA in the pGAP expression vector. The construction of C504A, C526A, C548S, C586A, and C608A mutants was similar to that of C562A using the primers listed in Table I, F2 and R3. The C305A mutant was constructed by the overlap extension PCR method using the primers F2-C305AR and C305AF-C608AR with the wild-type M-CPTI plasmid DNA as template. The 926 and 940-bp PCR products were purified as described above, mixed, and used as a template for a second-round PCR with the primer F2-C608AR. The 1860-bp PCR product was digested with AflIII-SphI and ligated to AflIII-SphI-cut wild-type pGAP-M-CPTI. Mutants C448A and C659A were constructed using the QuikChange™ multisite-directed mutagenesis kit with plasmid p13E (containing wild-type C-terminal human M-CPTI cDNA in pTZ18U vector) as the template. Primers C448AR and C659AR were each used to separately generate the C448A and C659A mutants. The mutated fragments in p13E were cut with EcoRI and used to replace the corresponding EcoRI fragment in the wild-type plasmid pGAP-M-CPTI. Construction of the Revertant Mutant A305C—The QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit was used with plasmid 13E9C41 (containing C-terminal human M-CPTI with 9 mutated cysteines in vector pTZ18U). The primers used were PAGE-purified A305CF2 and A305CR2. The mutants in the plasmid 13E9C41 were EcoRI-cut and used to replace the corresponding EcoRI fragment in the wild-type plasmid pGAP-M-CPTI. Bacterial colonies obtained upon transformation of the mutagenesis reactions were screened for the ability to productively serve as templates for PCR using forward primers with 3′-end specific to each of the mutants. For example, the C305A mutant was screened with the primer C305ACK. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme BspEI and integrated into the His4 locus of P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation (18Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G.

Histidine prototrophic transformants were selected on YND (yeast nitrogen base with dextrose) plates and grown on YND medium. Mitochondria were isolated by disrupting the yeast cells with glass beads (14de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G.

The Km for carnitine was determined by varying the carnitine concentration from 100 μm to 4.0 mm at a fixed concentration (100 μm) of palmitoyl-CoA. 150 μg of mitochondrial protein were used, and all incubations were performed at 30 °C for 3 min. The malonyl-CoA inhibition was determined by varying the concentration of malonyl-CoA from 50 nm to 10 μm at fixed concentrations of carnitine (1.0 mm) and palmitoyl-CoA (100 μm). The incubations were performed at 30 °C for 5 min. Labeling of Wild-type and Mutant M-CPTI with [U-14C]Palmitic Acid—Isolated mitochondria (100 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing the wild-type and mutant M-CPTI were incubated with 50 μm [U-14C]palmitic acid (specific activity, 824 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and 250 μm CoA and 5 mm ATP for 3 h at 30 °C (42Lewin T.M.

At the end of the incubation, the samples were divided into two fractions of equal volume, and one fraction was treated with 2.0 m hydroxylamine (adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) at 30 °C for 3 h. Hydroxylamine-treated and untreated samples were heat-denatured and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were dried and exposed to screens of Amersham Biosciences phosphorimaging plates for 1–7 days, and signals were analyzed in a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager SI. Western Blot—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were developed by incubation with the M-CPTI-specific polyclonal antibodies as described previously (6Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem.

Preincubation of isolated mitochondria from the yeast strain expressing human heart M-CPTI with 250 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), an -SH-specific modifying reagent, at 4 °C for 30 min caused a 75% loss in CPTI activity, indicating that there are cysteine residues in M-CPTI that are important for catalysis and/or substrate binding. These preliminary chemical modification studies with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) by us and others provided evidence that CPTI may contain a cysteine residue that is important for catalysis (27Saggerson E.D.

Yeast transformants with the wild-type M-CPTI gene and the mutants were grown in liquid medium supplemented with glucose (14de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed proteins of predicted sizes with similar steady-state levels of expression. Effect of Mutations on M-CPTI Activity and Malonyl-CoA Sensitivity—The C-terminal 9-residue cysteineless M-CPTI and the complete 15-residue cysteineless M-CPTI were inactive, despite the high level of protein expression observed for the mutants on the Western blot. The N-terminal 6-residue cysteineless mutant M-CPTI had activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to that of the wild type as shown in Table II, suggesting that 1 or more of the 9 cysteine residues in the C-terminal region of M-CPTI may be important for activity. Separate substitution mutation of C305A, C448A, C504A, C526A, C548S, C562A, C586A, C608A, and C659A showed that of the nine cysteine mutants, only the substitution mutant C305A was inactive, demonstrating that a single change of Cys-305 to Ala (or serine) 2H. Liu, G. Zheng, M. Treber, J. Dai, and G. Woldegiorgis, unpublished observations. resulted in complete loss in M-CPTI activity. As shown in Table II, a change of cysteine to either alanine or serine of the other 8 C-terminal cysteines had no effect on activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. A single change of Ala-305 to Cys, A305C, in the 9-residue C-terminal cysteineless mutant resulted in a mutant enzyme with similar activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (Table II) as the wild-type M-CPTI, demonstrating that Cys-305 (but not the other 8 C-terminal cysteine residues) is essential for M-CPTI activity. In short, our studies identify for the first time that Cys-305 in the C-terminal region of M-CPTI is essential for catalytic activity because mutation of this residue to Ala inactivated M-CPTI.Table IICPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity of wild-type and mutant M-CPTIStrainActivityIC50nmol/mg·minμmWT2.90 ± 0.100.50 ± 0.04C305AInactiveA305C2.80 ± 0.030.52 ± 0.05N6C2.82 ± 0.140.50 ± 0.04C9CInactiveCys-lessInactiveC448A2.83 ± 0.200.55 ± 0.05C504A2.75 ± 0.190.50 ± 0.02C526A2.90 ± 0.150.20 ± 0.03C548S2.80 ± 0.130.50 ± 0.04C562A3.75 ± 0.140.20 ± 0.02C586A3.75 ± 0.030.70 ± 0.04C608A2.61 ± 0.200.52 ± 0.01C659A3.50 ± 0.370.24 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Characteristics of Wild-type and Mutant M-CPTIs— Mutant A305C exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration was varied relative to a constant second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA, a property identical to that of the wild-type M-CPTI. For the mutant A305C, the calculated Km value for carnitine was only 12% higher and the Vmax was 15% lower compared with the wild-type M-CPTI, as shown in Table III, indicating almost complete restoration of catalytic activity and no major effect of substitution of the 8 C-terminal cysteine residues with Ala or Ser on M-CPTI activity. The catalytic efficiency as estimated by Vmax/Km for mutant A305C decreased by 24% compared with the wild type. With respect to the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA, mutant A305C exhibited normal saturation kinetics similar to that of the wild type when the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin was fixed at 6.1:1. The calculated Km and Vmax values for the A305C mutant were only 10% lower than those for the wild type, and the catalytic efficiency was similar to that of the wild type. Thus, substitution of Ala-305 with cysteine in the inactive 9-residue C-terminal cysteineless M-CPTI resulted in a mutant, A305C, that had activity, malonyl-CoA sensitivity, and kinetic properties similar to those of wild-type M-CPTI, demonstrating for the first time that of the 9 C-terminal cysteine residues present in M-CPTI, only Cys-305 is essential for catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity.Table IIIKinetic characteristics of yeast-expressed wild-type and mutant human M-CPTIsStrainCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAKmVmaxKmVmaxμmnmol/mg·minμmnmol/mg·minWT824.2 ± 8.23.4 ± 0.373.0 ± 3.117.5 ± 0.5A305C920.0 ± 10.52.9 ± 0.266.0 ± 1.915.8 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Acylation of Wild-type and Mutant M-CPTI—The loss in CPTI activity in the C305A mutant and the recovery of activity in the A305C revertant suggested that an acyl-enzyme intermediate may be involved in the catalytic mechanism of M-CPTI. We therefore investigated whether the loss in activity in the C305A mutant was due to the failure of an acyl-enzyme intermediate formation in the catalytic mechanism of M-CPTI by incubation of the wild-type and mutant M-CPTI with [U-14C]palmitic acid in the presence of CoA and ATP, but in the absence of carnitine and measurement of covalent incorporation of labeled palmitate into the enzyme. Both the wild-type and A305C revertant were strongly labeled with radioactive palmitate (Fig. 1) but the C305A mutant was not. Furthermore, the [U-14C]palmitate was covalently bound because the labeling could be removed by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine (Fig. 1). These results provide strong support for an acyl-enzyme intermediate in the catalytic mechanism of M-CPTI. Our cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of M-CPTI demonstrated that both the 9-residue C-terminal and the complete 15-residue cysteineless mutant enzymes are inactive but that the 6-residue N-terminal cysteineless mutant enzyme had activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to those of wild-type M-CPTI. These results suggested that 1 or more of the 9 C-terminal cysteine residues was important for catalysis. Separate substitution mutation of each of the 9 C-terminal cysteines to alanine or serine identified a single residue, Cys-305, to be essential for catalysis. Substitution of Cys-305 with Ala in the wild-type enzyme inactivated M-CPTI, and a single change of Ala-305 to Cys in the 9-residue C-terminal cysteineless mutant resulted in an 8-residue C-terminal cysteineless mutant enzyme that had activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to those of the wild type. Cys-305 is a conserved residue within the family of enzymes that includes CPTI, carnitine acetyltransferase, and choline acetyltransferase from different species, but it is not conserved in CPTII or carnitine octanoyltransferase, in which the corresponding Cys-305 is replaced by Asp as shown in Fig. 2. Of the remaining 8 C-terminal cysteine residues in M-CPTI, 7 are conserved in both M-CPTI and L-CPTI but not in the other acyltransferase-family enzymes. The 8th residue, Cys-548, is only present in M-CPTI, and Ser replaces Cys in wild-type L-CPTI. The M-CPTI mutant C548S had activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to those of the wild type. Human heart M-CPTI has 6 N-terminal cysteine residues that are absent in L-CPTI. Because M-CPTI is much more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition than L-CPTI, we hypothesized that the differences in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed between the two isoforms could be due to the presence of the 6 additional N-terminal cysteine residues in M-CPTI compared with L-CPTI. However, our cysteine-scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that the N-terminal cysteineless M-CPTI had activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that these residues do not play a role in M-CPTI activity and inhibitor sensitivity. More recently, in a patient with CPTI deficiency disease, a complete loss in L-CPTI activity was reported, which was due to substitution of Cys-305 with Trp, the conserved cysteine residue corresponding to that of human L-CPTI and M-CPTI that we demonstrated to be essential for human heart M-CPTI activity by our cysteine-scanning mutagenesis (29Brown N.F. Mullur R.S. Subramanian I. Esser V. Bennett M.J. Saudubray J.M. Feigenbaum A.S. Kobari J.A. Macleod P.M. McGarry J.D. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the acyltransferase family of enzymes, including M-CPTI and L-CPTI, contain a highly conserved His residue (Fig. 2) at the active site pocket, His-473, a general acid/base that, when mutated to Ala in CPTI, was shown to cause complete loss in activity (30Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a general acid/base, His-473 may form a hydrogen-bonding network or a salt bridge to a nearby conserved aspartate residue. There are also three highly conserved Asp residues within the family of acyltransferases, namely, Asp-323, Asp-454, and Asp-567, which are present in both CPTI and CPTII, as shown in Fig. 2. In a patient with hepatic CPTI deficiency disease who was homozygous for a D454G missense mutation, the yeast-expressed mutant L-CPTI exhibited only 2% of the wild-type L-CPTI activity, demonstrating that a change of D454 to Gly in CPTI was the cause for the disease (31Ijist L. Mandel H. Oostheim W. Rutler J.P.N. Gutman A. Wanders R.J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the conserved Asp-454 is closer to the conserved CPTI active site residue (His-473) that may form a hydrogen-bonding network or a salt bridge to Asp-454, the loss in activity observed in the D454G mutant may be due to disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network or salt bridge to His-473. Asp-323 and Asp-567 may be too far from the conserved His-473 at the active site pocket and thus may not be ideally positioned for such an interaction due to their location. Furthermore, the recent three-dimensional structure of carnitine acetyltransferase, a membrane-associated enzyme that belongs to the acyltransferase family of enzymes, suggests that Asp-567 may hydrogen-bond with Glu-590 (32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and more recent data from our laboratory 3Y. L. Yang, M. Treber, and G. Woldegiorgis, unpublished observations. show that a change of Asp-567 to Ala or His but not Glu resulted in a significant loss in CPTI activity. Our cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and the His-473 and Asp-454 mutation studies with CPTI suggest that there are at least two conserved residues, namely, Cys-305 and His-473, at the active site pocket of CPTI that are essential for catalysis because separate mutation of these residues to Ala inactivates CPTI. In addition, Asp-454 may interact with His-473 and indirectly facilitate catalysis because a mutation of this conserved residue that is located close to the active site His-473 caused a significant loss in CPTI activity (33Pazirandeh M.

As a rate-limiting enzyme that transports long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix, CPTI in the presence of carnitine catalyzes the conversion of long-chain acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines. However, the molecular mechanism by which CPTI transfers the acyl group from the acyl-CoA to carnitine remains to be elucidated. We have hypothesized previously that the reaction catalyzed by CPTI at the active site, conversion of palmitoyl-CoA to palmitoylcarnitine in the presence of l-carnitine, involves deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of carnitine by the catalytic base, His-473, and attack by the resultant oxyanion at the carbonyl of the thioester of palmitoyl-CoA to generate palmitoylcarnitine and free CoA (39Lewendon A. Murray I.A. Shaw W.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on our cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and acylation studies with CPTI and studies by others, we now propose a mechanism for the acyltransferase activity of CPTI that uses a catalytic triad composed of residues Cys-305, His-473, and Asp-454 as shown in Fig. 3. The cysteine residue forms a more stable acyl-enzyme intermediate that may allow the acceptor molecule, carnitine, to act as a second nucleophile and complete the acyl transfer reaction. We propose a mechanism for the catalysis whereby the active site catalytic base His-473 aided by Asp-454 abstracts a proton from the -SH group of Cys-305 to generate a reactive thiolate anion that carries out a nucleophilic attack on the substrate acyl-CoA, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is subsequently converted to a thioacyl-enzyme covalent intermediate (acyl-S-enzyme). It is envisaged that the negative charge from the carboxyl ion of Asp-454 is transferred to His-473 and then to Cys-305 to enhance the power of the nucleophile (33Pazirandeh M. Chirala S.S.

Deacylation and transfer of the acyl group to carnitine occur by a nucleophilic attack of the thioester bond of the acyl-S-enzyme intermediate with the reactive carnitine oxyanion generated by abstraction of a proton from the hydroxyl group of carnitine by the general base catalyst at the active site, His-473, assisted by Asp-454, resulting in the formation of a second tetrahedral intermediate that breaks down to yield the product acylcarnitine and regenerate the enzyme as shown in Fig. 3. CPTII and carnitine octanoyltransferase, membrane-associated enzymes located on the matrix face of the inner mitochondrial membrane, contain Asp instead of Cys at the corresponding position for Cys-305, as shown in Fig. 2. This is probably due to the differences in the reaction mechanisms catalyzed by CPTI and CPTII, generally referred to as the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. In vivo, CPTII catalyzes the transfer of an acyl group from acylcarnitine to CoA-SH, which is the reverse of the reaction catalyzed by CPTI resulting in the regeneration of acyl-CoA on the matrix side, thus completing the transport of long-chain acyl-CoAs from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix (40Brown N.F.

The conserved active site His-373 in CPTII shown in Fig. 3 probably abstracts a proton from the CoA-SH to generate a nucleophile that attacks the acylcarnitine, resulting in the transfer of the acyl group to CoA and formation of the acyl-CoA. Sequence alignments of CPTI with the acyltransferase family of enzymes in the GenBank™ led to the identification of a putative catalytic triad in CPTI consisting of residues Cys-305, Asp-454, and His-473. This catalytic triad was found to be conserved in human, rat, and mouse CPTI and other acyltransferases, with the exception of CPTII and carnitine octanoyltransferase. Mutation of Cys-305, Asp-454, and His-473 results in loss of CPTI activity, which strongly suggests that CPTI is an enzyme containing a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad, providing a possible mechanism for the acyltransferase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of His-473 and Asp-454 to alanine resulted in inactivation of CPTI, suggesting that these two residues are critical for CPTI activity. Because the Asp and His residues are responsible for providing the nucleophile negative charge and relaying it to the cysteine residue, their mutation would be expected to destroy the charge relay system, thereby inactivating the enzyme. Whereas Cys-305 is important for CPTI activity, it is clear that none of the remaining 8 C-terminal cysteine residues are important for CPTI activity, and the disulfide bond formation involving these residues also must not be important for catalytic activity, although they may be involved in mediating the interaction of CPTI with other proteins. In short, our studies demonstrate that CPTI is a thiol acyltransferase and that Cys-305 is the essential nucleophilic residue critical for catalysis. In the presence of both substrates, carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA, CPTI acts primarily as an acyltransferase, but in the absence of either carnitine or CoA, CPTI may exhibit low hydrolase activity, resulting in the breakdown of palmitoyl-CoA or palmitoylcarnitine by a mechanism similar to that of the cysteine proteases and hydrolases, which utilize a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad (33Pazirandeh M.
