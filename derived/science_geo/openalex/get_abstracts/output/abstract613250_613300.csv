We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology."

https://openalex.org/W2808847099,"Many eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) contain intrinsically disordered low-complexity sequence domains (LCDs), but how these LCDs drive transactivation remains unclear. We used live-cell single-molecule imaging to reveal that TF LCDs form local high-concentration interaction hubs at synthetic and endogenous genomic loci. TF LCD hubs stabilize DNA binding, recruit RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), and activate transcription. LCD-LCD interactions within hubs are highly dynamic, display selectivity with binding partners, and are differentially sensitive to disruption by hexanediols. Under physiological conditions, rapid and reversible LCD-LCD interactions occur between TFs and the RNA Pol II machinery without detectable phase separation. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms underpinning transcriptional control and suggest a framework for developing single-molecule imaging screens for drugs targeting gene regulatory interactions implicated in disease."
https://openalex.org/W3100474188,"The dielectric constant of interfacial water has been predicted to be smaller than that of bulk water (= 80) because the rotational freedom of water dipoles is expected to decrease near surfaces, yet experimental evidence is lacking. We report local capacitance measurements for water confined between two atomically-flat walls separated by various distances down to 1 nm. Our experiments reveal the presence of an interfacial layer with vanishingly small polarization such that its out-of-plane dielectric constant is only approximately 2. The electrically dead layer is found to be two to three molecules thick. These results provide much needed feedback for theories describing water-mediated surface interactions and behavior of interfacial water, and show a way to investigate the dielectric properties of other fluids and solids under extreme confinement."

Ma et al. studied a variety of three-dimensional COFs based on imine linkages (see the Perspective by Navarro). They found that the addition of aniline inhibited nucleation and allowed the growth of crystals large enough for single-crystal x-ray diffraction studies. Evans et al. describe a two-step process in which nanoscale seeds of boronate ester–linked two-dimensional COFs can be grown into micrometer-scale single crystals by using a solvent that suppresses the nucleation of additional nanoparticles. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed superior charge transport in these crystallites compared with that observed in conventional powders. Science , this issue p. 48 , p. 52 ; see also p. 35"
https://openalex.org/W2808857148,"Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO2 from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems."

We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling seasonal expression of the Agouti gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic variation at Agouti clustered by winter coat color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter coats in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments."

The behavioral repertoire of people confronted with opportunities to consume alcohol involves numerous choices between this drug reward and healthy alternatives. Augier et al. established a choice procedure that begins to address alcohol addiction in rats (see the Perspective by Spanagel). They found that a minority of outbred rats continued to self-administer alcohol even when a high-value alternative (such as sugar) was available. That minority displayed a remarkable constellation of behavioral traits resembling the human clinical condition, including a high motivation to obtain alcohol and continued use despite adverse consequences. The cause was impaired GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) clearance in the central amygdala. Postmortem tissue analysis supported the possibility of a similar pathology in human alcoholism.

When these masses are removed, the crust rebounds at a time scale determined by the viscosity of the upper mantle. Using GPS, Barletta et al. found that the viscosity of the mantle under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is much lower than expected. This means that as ice is lost, the crust rebounds much faster than previously expected. Although estimates of total ice loss have to be revised upward, the surprising finding indicates that the ice sheet may stabilize against catastrophic collapse. Science , this issue p. 1335"

However, it has been difficult to test GR on the scale of an individual galaxy. Collett et al. exploited a nearby gravitational lens system, in which light from a distant galaxy (the source) is bent by a foreground galaxy (the lens). Mass distribution in the lens was compared with the curvature of space-time around the lens, independently determined from the distorted image of the source. The result supports GR and eliminates some alternative theories of gravity. Science , this issue p. 1342"

We aimed to investigate the frequency of MPO-ANCA positivity, as well as MPA incidence and risk factors for development in patients initially diagnosed with IIP.We retrospectively analysed 305 consecutive patients who were initially diagnosed as IIP and had MPO-ANCA results available.Of the 305 patients, 26 (8.5%) were MPO-ANCA-positive. Baseline characteristics were similar between the MPO-ANCA-positive and -negative patients. The cumulative 5-year MPA incidence was 24.3% in the MPO-ANCA-positive patients and 0% in the -negative patients (P < 0.0001). MPO-ANCA was positive in 15 of 133 (11.3%) patients initially diagnosed with IPF and in 11 of 172 (6.3%) patients initially diagnosed with non-IPF (P = 0.56), with cumulative 5-year MPA incidence of 6.2% and 1.0%, respectively (P = 0.10). Multivariate analysis revealed that UIP pattern on HRCT (HR = 3.20, P < 0.01) and no treatment for IIP (HR = 3.52, P < 0.01) were independently associated with MPA development in MPO-ANCA-positive patients.MPO-ANCA positivity was uncommon, but was associated with subsequent MPA development in patients initially diagnosed with IIP, including both IPF and non-IPF cases. The study suggested that attention should be paid to MPA development in MPO-ANCA-positive IIP patients with UIP pattern on HRCT and those without treatment for IIP."
https://openalex.org/W2808800485,"Schwann cells actively interact with axons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication by transferring their biomaterials, including microRNAs (miRs) into recipient cells. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from Schwann cells stimulated by high glucose (HG) exosomes accelerate development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and that exosomal cargo miRs contribute to this process. We found that HG exosomes contained high levels of miR-28, -31a, and -130a compared to exosomes derived from non-HG-stimulated Schwann cells. In vitro, treatment of distal axons with HG exosomes resulted in reduction of axonal growth, which was associated with elevation of miR-28, -31a, and -130a and reduction of their target proteins of DNA methyltransferase-3α, NUMB (an endocytic adaptor protein), synaptosome associated protein 25, and growth-associated protein-43 in axons. In vivo, administration of HG exosomes to sciatic nerves of diabetic db/db mice at 7 wk of age promoted occurrence of peripheral neuropathy characterized by impairment of nerve conduction velocity and induction of mechanic and thermal hypoesthesia, which was associated with substantial decreases in intra-epidermal nerve fibers. Our findings demonstrate a functional role of exosomes derived from HG-stimulated Schwann cells in mediating development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.—Jia, L., Chopp, M., Wang, L., Lu, X., Szalad, A., Zhang, Z.

Objective To assess preventive effects of meditation and exercise on acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness. Design Randomized controlled prevention trial with three parallel groups. Setting Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Participants Community-recruited adults who did not regularly exercise or meditate. Methods 1) 8-week behavioral training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR); 2) matched 8-week training in moderate intensity sustained exercise (EX); or 3) observational waitlist control. Training classes occurred in September and October, with weekly ARI surveillance through May. Incidence, duration, and area-under-curve ARI global severity were measured using daily reports on the WURSS-24 during ARI illness. Viruses were identified multiplex PCR. Absenteeism, health care utilization, and psychosocial health self-report assessments were also employed. Results Of 413 participants randomized, 390 completed the trial. In the MBSR group, 74 experienced 112 ARI episodes with 1045 days of ARI illness. Among exercisers, 84 had 120 episodes totaling 1010 illness days. Eighty-two of the controls had 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness. Mean global severity was 315 for MBSR (95% confidence interval 244, 386), 256 (193, 318) for EX, and 336 (268, 403) for controls. A prespecified multivariate zero-inflated regression model suggested reduced incidence for MBSR (p = 0.036) and lower global severity for EX (p = 0.042), compared to control, not quite attaining the p<0.025 prespecified cut-off for null hypothesis rejection. There were 73 ARI-related missed-work days and 22 ARI-related health care visits in the MBSR group, 82 days and 21 visits for exercisers, and 105 days and 24 visits among controls. Viruses were identified in 63 ARI episodes in the MBSR group, compared to 64 for EX and 72 for control. Statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements in general mental health, self-efficacy, mindful attention, sleep quality, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were observed in the MBSR and/or EX groups, compared to control. Conclusions Training in mindfulness meditation or exercise may help protect against ARI illness. Limitations This trial was likely underpowered. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01654289"
https://openalex.org/W2809339027,"Core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1) controls the crucial step of GalNAc-type O-glycosylation and is overexpressed in various human malignancies. However, its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that C1GALT1 expression is upregulated in HNSCC tumors and is associated with adverse clinicopathologic features. Moreover, high C1GALT1 expression predicts poor disease-free and overall survivals. C1GALT1 overexpression enhances HNSCC cell viability, migration, and invasion, which can be reversed by erlotinib. Silencing of C1GALT1 suppresses the malignant behavior both in vitro and in vivo. Mass spectrometry and lectin pull-down assays demonstrate that C1GALT1 modifies O-glycans on EGFR. Blocking O-glycan elongation on EGFR by C1GALT1 knockdown decreases EGF-EGFR binding affinity and inhibits EGFR signaling, thereby suppressing malignant phenotypes. Using molecular docking simulations, we identify itraconazole as a C1GALT1 inhibitor that directly binds C1GALT1 and promotes its proteasomal degradation, leading to significant blockade of C1GALT1-mediated effects in HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a critical role of O-glycosylation in HNSCC progression and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting C1GALT1 in HNSCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2809634620,"Cardiovascular diseases are a health problem throughout the world, especially in people with diabetes. The identification of cardiovascular disease biomarkers can improve risk stratification. Sclerostin is a modulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in different tissues, and it has recently been linked to vascular biology. The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between circulating sclerostin levels and cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. We followed up a cohort of 130 participants (mean age 56.8 years; 48.5% females; 75 with type 2 diabetes; 46 with prevalent cardiovascular disease) in which serum sclerostin levels were measured at the baseline. Time to death (both of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes) was assessed to establish the relationship between sclerostin and mortality. We found that serum sclerostin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with prevalent cardiovascular disease (p<0.001), and independently associated with cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.008), showing sclerostin to be a stronger predictor of mortality than other classical risk factors (area under the curve = 0.849 vs 0.823). The survival analysis showed that an increase of 10 pmol/L in the serum sclerostin level resulted in a 31% increase in cardiovascular mortality. However, no significant association was observed between sclerostin levels and non-cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.346). From these results, we conclude that high sclerostin levels are related to mortality due to cardiovascular causes. The clinical implication of these findings is based on the possible use of serum sclerostin as a new biomarker of cardiovascular mortality risk in order to establish preventive strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2952381571,"Although extensively studied for three decades, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the RAF/MEK/ERK kinase cascade remain ambiguous. Recent studies identified the dimerization of RAF as a key event in the activation of this cascade. Here, we show that in-frame deletions in the β3-αC loop activate ARAF as well as BRAF and other oncogenic kinases by enforcing homodimerization. By characterizing these RAF mutants, we find that ARAF has less allosteric and catalytic activity than the other two RAF isoforms, which arises from its non-canonical APE motif. Further, these RAF mutants exhibit a strong oncogenic potential, and a differential inhibitor resistance that correlates with their dimer affinity. Using these unique mutants, we demonstrate that active RAFs, including the BRAF(V600E) mutant, phosphorylate MEK in a dimer-dependent manner. This study characterizes a special category of oncogenic kinase mutations, and elucidates the molecular basis that underlies the differential ability of RAF isoforms to stimulate MEK-ERK pathway. Further, this study reveals a unique catalytic feature of RAF family kinases that can be exploited to control their activities for cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2809115411,"In this work, we aim to analyze and compare the mechanisms controlling the volume of mucus in the bronchial region of the lungs of a healthy human adult, at rest and in usual atmospheric conditions. This analysis is based on a balance equation for the mucus in an airway, completed by a computational tool aiming at characterizing the evaporation, during respiration, of the water contained in the bronchial mucus. An idealized representation of the lungs, based on Weibel’s morphometric model, is used. The results indicate that the mechanisms controlling the volume of mucus in an airway depend on the localization of the airway in the bronchial region of the lungs. In the proximal generations, the volume of mucus in an airway is mainly controlled by the evaporation of the water it contains and the replenishment, with water, of the mucus layer by epithelial cells or the submucosal glands. Nevertheless, cilia beating in this part of the bronchial region remains of fundamental importance to transport the mucus and hence to eliminate dust and pathogens trapped in it. On the other hand, in the distal generations of the bronchial region, the volume of mucus in an airway is mainly controlled by the mucociliary transport and by the absorption of liquid by the epithelium. This absorption is a consequence of the mucus displacement by the cilia along generations with an interface between the epithelium and the airway surface layer of decreasing area. The numerical results obtained are in good agreement with previously published experimental data, thus validating our approach. We also briefly discuss how our results can improve the understanding and, possibly, the treatment of pulmonary diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2809046230,"Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) is a tumor suppressor that catalyzes the de-phosphorylation of the AGC kinases, while p27 acts as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell motility. Our previous studies have identified that PHLPP2 participates in inhibition of transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells following lung carcinogen B[a]P/B[a]PDE exposure. However, nothing was known about the association of p27 with regulation of PHLPP2 expression and the role of PHLPP2 in bladder cancer (BC) invasion. In our current studies, we demonstrated that PHLPP2 inhibited BC invasion through promoting MMP2 degradation via p62-mediated autophagy; and p27 expression was able to stabilize PHLPP2 protein by inhibiting protein degradation of Hsp90, which could directly bind to PHLPP2 and protect it from degradation. More in-depth studies discovered that stabilization of Hsp90 by p27 was mediated by calpain1 proteolysis system, whereas p27 inhibited calpain1 gene transcription by attenuating Jak1/Stat1 cascade in human invasive BC cells. Collectively, we for the first time revealed PHLPP2 downregulation in BCs and its participating in promotion of BC invasion, as well as novel role of p27 and mechanisms underlying its regulation of PHLPP2 protein degradation through Hsp90-dependent manner. Our findings improve our understanding of p27 and PHLPP2 roles and their crosstalk in regulation of BC invasion, which further contributes to improve the current strategy for invasive bladder cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2809409155,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are essential for local skeletal muscle growth and organismal physiology, but these actions are entwined with glucose homeostasis through convergence with insulin signaling. The objective of this work was to determine whether the effects of IGF-I on growth and metabolism could be separated. We generated muscle-specific IGF-I-deficient (MID) mice that afford inducible deletion of Igf1 at any age. After Igf1 deletion at birth or in young adult mice, evaluations of muscle physiology and glucose homeostasis were performed up to 16 wk of age. MID mice generated at birth had lower muscle and circulating IGF-I, decreased muscle and body mass, and impaired muscle force production. Eight-wk-old male MID had heightened insulin levels with trends of elevated fasting glucose. This phenotype progressed to impaired glucose handling and increased fat deposition without significant muscle mass loss at 16 wk of age. The same phenotype emerged in 16-wk-old MID mice induced at 12 wk of age, compounded with heightened muscle fatigability and exercise intolerance. We assert that muscle IGF-I independently modulates anabolism and metabolism in an age-dependent manner, thus positioning muscle IGF-I maintenance to be critical for both muscle growth and metabolic homeostasis.—Vassilakos, G., Lei, H., Yang, Y., Puglise, J., Matheny, M., Durzynska, J., Ozery, M., Bennett, K., Spradlin, R., Bonanno, H., Park, S., Ahima, R.

Previous studies have shown that TLR2 inhibition protects the heart from acute stress, including myocardial infarction and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in animal models. However, the role of TLR2 in the development of aging-associated heart failure is not known. In this work, we studied aging-associated changes in structure and function of TLR2-deficient mice hearts. Whereas young TLR2-KO mice did not develop marked cardiac dysfunction, 8- and 12-month-old TLR2-KO mice exhibited spontaneous adverse cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in an age-dependent manner. The hearts of the 8-month-old TLR2-KO mice had increased fibrosis, cell death, and reactivation of fetal genes. Moreover, TLR2-KO hearts displayed reduced infiltration by macrophages, increased numbers of myofibroblasts and atrophic cardiomyocytes, and higher levels of the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and atrogin-1. Mechanistically, TLR2 deficiency impaired the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, leading to hyperactivation of the transcription factor Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) and, in turn, to elevated expression of FoxO target genes involved in the regulation of muscle wasting and cell death. AS1842856-mediated chemical inhibition of FoxO1 reduced the expression of the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligases and significantly reversed the adverse cardiac remodeling while improving the contractile functions in the TLR2-KO mice. Interestingly, TLR2 levels decreased in hearts of older mice, and the activation of TLR1/2 signaling improved cardiac functions in these mice.

https://openalex.org/W2808757684,"Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (ECG) is based on the acquisition of signals from abdominal surface electrodes. The composite abdominal signal consists of the maternal electrocardiogram along with the fetal electrocardiogram and other electrical interferences. These recordings allow for the acquisition of valuable and reliable information that helps ensure fetal well-being during pregnancy. This paper introduces a procedure for fetal heart rate extraction from a single-channel abdominal ECG signal. The procedure is composed of three main stages: a method based on wavelet for signal denoising, a new clustering-based methodology for detecting fetal QRS complexes, and a final stage to correct false positives and false negatives. The novelty of the procedure thus relies on using clustering techniques to classify singularities from the abdominal ECG into three types: maternal QRS complexes, fetal QRS complexes, and noise. The amplitude and time distance of all the local maxima followed by a local minimum were selected as features for the clustering classification. A wide set of real abdominal ECG recordings from two different databases, providing a large range of different characteristics, was used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The accuracy achieved shows that the proposed technique exhibits a competitve performance when compared to other recent works in the literature and a better performance over threshold-based techniques."

This study assessed the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of single-dose denosumab (60 and 120 mg) in healthy Chinese volunteers. Methods This randomized (3:3:2), single-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled healthy Chinese volunteers to receive single subcutaneous injection of denosumab 60 mg, 120 mg, or placebo. Study consisted of screening period (up to 21 days), treatment and assessment period (19 weeks), and an end-of-study visit (at week 26). Denosumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study. Results A total of 63 volunteers received the study treatment and 62 (98.4%) completed the study. Denosumab serum concentrations peaked at around Day 10 with dose-proportional increase from 60 mg to 120 mg. The mean terminal half-life of denosumab 60 mg and 120 mg was 15 days and 26 days, respectively. The serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen concentration-time profiles were similar (>80% decrease within 5 days) between denosumab 60 mg and 120 mg groups. The most commonly reported adverse event (AE) was decreased blood calcium levels (denosumab 60 mg, n = 13; denosumab 120 mg, n = 13; placebo, n = 1); however only one volunteer had calcium level below the abnormality value of potential clinical importance and none of the volunteers developed symptoms of hypocalcemia. The majority of AEs were of mild to moderate intensity. There were no deaths, serious AEs, or withdrawal from study due to AEs. No clinically significant findings in vital signs or electrocardiogram were observed. Conclusions Both denosumab 60 mg and 120 mg were well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in healthy Chinese volunteers with similar pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles to that of Caucasians.

Here, we investigated the effects of bile acid (BA)-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) on the metabolism of 17β-estradiol (E2) during blockage of bile flow (cholestasis). Correlations between BA levels and E2 concentrations were established in patients with cholestasis, and hepatic expression profiles of key genes involved in estrogen metabolism were investigated in both WT and FXR−/− mice. We found that the elevated E2 level positively correlated with BA concentrations in the patients with cholestasis. We further observed that bile duct ligation (BDL) increases E2 levels in mouse serum, and this elevation effect was alleviated by deleting the FXR gene. Of note, FXR down-regulated the expression of hepatic sulfotransferase SULT1E1, the primary enzyme responsible for metabolic estrogen inactivation. At the molecular level, we found that FXR competes with the protein acetylase CREB-binding protein (CBP) for binding to the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). This competition decreased HNF4α acetylation and nuclear retention, which, in turn, repressed HNF4α-dependent SULT1E1 gene transcription. These findings suggest that cholestasis induces BA-activated FXR activity, leading to downstream inhibition of SULT1E1 and hence impeding hepatic degradation of estrogen.

In addition, FXR plays a critical role in glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and atherosclerosis (17.Sonoda J. Pei L. Evans R.M.

However, how activated FXR regulates estrogen metabolism in the liver remains unknown. In this study, we reported that the elevated BA increases the E2 level via FXR activation during cholestasis. FXR competed with CREB-binding protein (CBP) for HNF4α binding, and hence, decreased HNF4α acetylation and nuclear retention, which in turn, led to the repression of HNF4α-dependent sulfotransferase 1E1 (SULT1E1) transcription. It is consistently noticed that patients suffering from obstructive cholestasis exhibited clinically very high levels of estrogen. We conducted a systematic analysis of the molecules, such as BA, bilirubin, and γ-GT, which might correlate with the estrogen levels in these patients. Table S1 lists the results from 40 postmenopausal female patients suffering from biliary obstruction due to pancreatic, gallbladder, bile duct cancer, or choledocholithiasis. All patients showed elevated serum bilirubin concentrations (201 ± 88 μmol/liter) and raised γ-GT level (195 ± 69 μmol/liter). After successful surgical or endoscopic treatment of biliary obstruction, bilirubin, γ-GT, and total BA levels returned to normal. Notably, the serum total bile acid levels were 125.2 ± 47.3 μmol/liter before therapy and 16.8 ± 18.4 μmol/liter after therapy (Fig. 1A, left panel). Interestingly, the serum E2 level in these patients also decreased about 5-fold after therapy from 738.7 ± 222.4 to 130.2 ± 69.8 pmol/liter, which were reduced following therapy (Fig. 1A, right panel). The serum estrogen concentrations were positively correlated with serum BA levels before therapy (R2 = 0.2402, p = 0.0013) (Fig. 1B). We next investigated the effect of BA on the E2 level in patients with PBC. The baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table S2. Thirty-six postmenopausal female patients with PBC were divided in two groups: patients with normal serum BA level (low BA group, n = 22) and patients with high serum BA level (high BA group, n = 14) (Fig. 1C, left panel). The high BA group was associated with significantly elevated E2 level (454.5 ± 151.8 pmol/liter), whereas the low group is associated with low E2 level (91 ± 41.5 pmol/liter) (Fig. 1C, right panel). After appropriate treatment, the BA concentrations of 8 patients from the high BA group returned to normal levels (Fig. 1D, left panel). Interestingly, serum E2 levels in those 8 patients also dropped from 492.9 ± 159 to 185.5 ± 86.5 pmol/liter (Fig. 1D, right panel). Moreover, the serum E2 level is positively correlated with serum BA concentrations in the high BA group (R2 = 0.317, p = 0.0361) (Fig. 1E). Overall, these data suggested that BA might increase the E2 level. To determine the effects of obstructive cholestasis on serum E2 level, wildtype (WT) and FXR−/− female mice were subjected to biliary obstruction by common bile duct ligation (BDL) for 3 days. BDL resulted in significantly elevated serum liver enzymes, bilirubin (Fig. S1, A–C, hepatic and serum total bile acids (Fig. 2, A, B, D, and E) in WT and FXR−/− mice. The accumulation of endogenous BA in WT mice led to a significant elevation of serum E2 by 143% (Fig. 2C), compared with the 31% increase in FXR−/− mice (Fig. 2F), which might be due to inflammation and hepatic injury. Likewise, BDL-induced hepatic and serum total bile acids increase was also accompanied with an elevation of serum E2 in ovariectomized female mice (Fig. 2, A–C). In conclusion, in the BDL mice model, high BA is associated with a high E2 level, an effect that can be dampened by the loss of FXR. To investigate the role of FXR in regulating E2 metabolism in vivo, we first studied the BA and E2 concentrations in WT and FXR−/− female mice. Compared with WT mice, FXR−/− mice showed elevated serum BA (Fig. 3A, left panel), which is consistent with a previous report that FXR deficiency leads to cholestasis (20.Kim I. Morimura K. Shah Y. Yang Q. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Spontaneous hepatocarcinogenesis in farnesoid X receptor-null mice.Carcinogenesis. 2007; 28 (17183066): 940-94610.1093/carcin/bgl249Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a decreased E2 level was observed in FXR−/− mice (Fig. 3A, right panel). We next scanned the expression of key genes involved in estrogen metabolism in hepatic cells. Among the 8 primary estrogen-metabolizing enzymes, the transcription level of SULT1E1 in FXR−/− mice increased dramatically by about 500-fold compared with that in WT mice (Fig. 3C). Aside for a slightly higher expression of Hsd17b1 and Sts in FXR−/− mice, no difference in hepatic expression of Ugt1a1, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, and Cyp19a1 between FXR−/− mice and WT mice was observed (Fig. 3D). The observed decrease of the small heterodimer partner (Shp, −94%), a known FXR target gene, in FXR−/− mice confirmed FXR deficiency (Fig. 3B). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting confirmed the protein level increase of SULT1E1 in FXR−/− mice compared with that in WT mice (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, no difference was observed between FXR−/− mice and WT mice in Hsd17b1 and Sts protein expression levels (data not shown). SULT1E1 is a key enzyme in estrogen metabolism, and is responsible for the inactivation and elimination of E2 at physiological concentrations (21.Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Chae K. Song W.C. Leblanc D. London R. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Mouse steroid sulfotransferases: substrate specificity and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis.Biochem.

We subsequently examined the SULT1E1 protein level in a panel of tissues from female mice. The SULT1E1 protein level was significantly increased in the kidney, liver, and colon from FXR−/− mice compared with that from WT mice (Fig. S3). We also measured FXR function in the clearance of exogenously administrated E2 in female mice. At 6 h after E2 administration, the E2 level in FXR−/− mice was significantly lower than that in the WT mice, whereas at 12 h no difference was observed (Fig. 3F). We studied the effect of FXR agonists on SULT1E1 expression in human liver carcinoma Huh7 cells. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting revealed a significant decrease of SULT1E1 in both transcript and protein levels upon FXR agonist treatment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, FXR knockdown in Huh7 cells led to a significant increase of SULT1E1 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4B). We further studied the regulation of the SULT1E1 by bile acids in a noncholestatic model, WT and FXR−/− mice were fed for 5 days with either a normal chow diet (control) or a chow diet supplemented with 0.2% cholic acid (CA) (w/w). Upon CA feeding, reduced serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were observed in WT mice but not in FXR−/− mice (Fig. S4, A–D). A 0.2% CA supplementation led to a significant increase in serum E2 level and decrease in the hepatic Su1t1e1 level in WT mice (Fig. 4C, left panel), but not in FXR−/− mice (Fig. 4D, left panel). No difference in hepatic expression of Ugt1a1, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, Hsd17b1, Cyp19a1, and Sts was observed between these two groups (Fig. 4, C and D, right panels). Similar findings were observed when WT and FXR−/− female mice were treated with either vehicle or WAY-362450 (30 mg/kg/day), a synthetic nonsteriodal FXR agonist (Fig. S5, A–D) (21.Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Chae K. Song W.C. Leblanc D. London R. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Mouse steroid sulfotransferases: substrate specificity and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis.Biochem.

We further transduced the SULT1E1-expressing recombinant adenovirus (Ad-SULT1E1), which primarily targets the liver, into mouse through tail vein injection (22.Flatt B. Martin R. Wang T.L. Mahaney P. Murphy B. Gu X.H. Foster P. Li J. Pircher P. Petrowski M. Schulman I. Westin S. Wrobel J. Yan G. Bischoff E. Daige C. Mohan R.

Chem. 2009; 52 (19159286): 904-90710.1021/jm8014124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that liver-specific SULT1E1 overexpression abolished the 0.2% CA supplementation-induced E2 increase (Fig. 4E) and facilitated the clearance of exogenously administrated E2 in mice (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these data indicated that the FXR-induced E2 elevation is mediated through suppression of hepatic SULT1E1. We next searched for the putative FXR-binding sites in the intragenic regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of the SULT1E1 gene in the human and mouse genome. No conservative FXR response element was present in the SULT1E1 promoter. We then searched for the occurrence of putative FXR response elements of the SULT1E1 promoter using the genome wide ChIP-seq datasets published by Thomas et al. (23.Thomas A.M. Hart S.N. Kong B. Fang J. Zhong X.B. Guo G.L.

The FXR UCSC genome browser tracks did not show any FXR-binding signal in the intragenic regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of the SULT1E1 gene. Kodama et al. (25.Kodama S.

Our results indicated that FXR activation can suppress SULT1E1 expression, an effect that cannot be reversed by co-treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 5A). This indicated that mRNA synthesis, but not protein synthesis, was required for FXR-mediated repression of the SULT1E1 gene. Interestingly, we also found that FXR strongly repressed HNF4α-stimulated SULT1E1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, qChIP assay demonstrated that the occupancies of FXR were not changed at the SULT1E1 promoter after treatment with WAY-362450 (Fig. 5C, upper panel). However, agonist-activated FXR remarkably reduced the binding of HNF4α to SULT1E1 promoter (Fig. 5C, middle panel). Moreover, activated FXR enriched the H3K27me3 repressive mark in the SULT1E1 promoter (Fig. 5C, lower panel). In contrast, FXR knockdown augmented the binding of HNF4α to the SULT1E1 promoter and removed the H3K27me3 repressive mark in the SULT1E1 promoter (Fig. 5D). The repressive function of agonist-activated FXR on SULT1E1 promoter activity was abolished by deletion of the direct repeat half-sites (DRs), which were composed of three direct repeats of the motif GGACC and referred to as an HNF4α-response element (Fig. 5E)(25.Kodama S.

EMSA experiments, using nuclear extract from FXR-transfected or FXR-activated Huh7 cells, demonstrated decreased binding capacity of HNF4α to the SULT1E1 promoter via the HNF4α-response element (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, despite the observed direct interaction between FXR and HNF4α, we found that FXR did not inhibit the binding of HNF4a with HNF4α-response element in vitro (Fig. 6, B and C), a phenomenon that prompted us to examine whether FXR inhibited the HNF4α transactivation activity in an indirect way.Figure 6FXR competed with CBP for HNF4α binding, decreased HNF4α acetylation level, and increased its translocation to cytoplasm. A, EMSA demonstrated decreased HNF4α-binding activity to the HNF4α-response element in the SULT1E1 promoter after FXR overexpression or WAY-362450 (WAY, 3 μm) treatment. B, co-immunoprecipitation in Huh7 cells and glutathione S-transferase–pulldown assay demonstrated the interaction of FXR and HNF4α. C, EMSA demonstrated that FXR or the FXR-RXR heterodimer did not interfere with the binding of HNF4α to the HNF4α-response element in the SULT1E1 promoter. Normal IgG or anti-HNF4α antibody were used to verify the specific formation of the DNA–protein complex as indicated. D, decrease in the HNF4α/CBP interaction and HNF4α acetylation by the binding of FXR with HNF4α. Acetylation assay demonstrated the decreased HNF4α acetylation after treatment with DMSO or WAY-362450 (left panel). Huh7 cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]acetate (1 mCi/ml), and whole cell extracts were pre-prepared, immunoprecipitated with HNF-4α antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (autoradiograph). Parts of the extracts were used for Western blotting with the same antibody (Western blotting). Immunoblottings (IB) for acetylated lysine, FXR, or CBP were performed on FXR immunoprecipitates prepared from Huh7 cells treated with DMSO or WAY-362450 (right panel).

CBP-mediated acetylation is required for the proper nuclear retention of HNF-4α (26.Soutoglou E. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. Acetylation regulates transcription factor activity at multiple levels.Mol.

In an attempt to identify the molecular basis of FXR-mediated inhibition of HNF4α transactivation activity, we examined the effect of FXR on the status of HNF4α acetylation in Huh7 cells. FXR activation decreased HNF4α acetylation (Fig. 6D, left panel). This event was not reversed by Sirtinol, an inhibitor of the Sirtuin class of deacetylases (data not shown), suggesting that deacetylation of HNF4α elicited by FXR activation might not result from an increase in deacetylase activity. Because both FXR and CBP can interact with HNF4α, we examined whether FXR competed with CBP for HNF4α binding. As expected, FXR activation increased its association with HNF4α, and prevented the interaction between CBP and HNF4α (Fig. 6D, right panel). Because the sites of acetylation are located at the HNF4α nuclear localization sequence region, we tested the role of FXR in HNF4α nuclear localization sequence. In situ immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionation experiments showed that FXR activation resulted in the translocation of HNF4α from the nucleus to cytoplasm in Huh7 cells (Fig. 6, E and F). In addition, FXR activation led to the translocation of HNF4α from the nucleus to cytoplasm in primary hepatocytes from WT mice, but not that from FXR−/− mice (Fig. S6). Based on the previous studies, we hypothesized that FXR-mediated SULT1E1 suppression might be involved in BA-induced E2 levels of elevation during cholestasis. To test this hypothesis, SULT1E1 expression was examined in liver tissues from patients suffering from biliary obstructions. In line with the increased level of total bile acids, the level of γ-GT, bilirubin, and E2 was also significantly higher in patients with cholestasis (Fig. 7A and Table S3). The levels of estrone sulfate, a SULT1E1 substrate, were also decreased in patients with cholestasis versus controls (Fig. 7B). In cholestasis patients, the SULT1E1 mRNA level decreased by 89%, compared with controls (Fig. 7C, left panel). Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical detection revealed reduced protein levels of SULT1E1 in cholestatic patients versus controls (Fig. 7D, Fig. S7). Meanwhile, the expression of CYP7A1 and NTCP, genes negatively regulated by FXR, decreased by 75 and 74%, respectively, in cholestatic patients. Furthermore, the expression of BSEP, a gene positively regulated by FXR, increased by 59% in cholestatic patients (Fig. 7C, right panel). These results indicated that FXR was activated in cholestatic patients. Moreover, EMSA demonstrated that the binding of HNF4α to the SULT1E1 promoter in liver samples from cholestatic patients was decreased compared with that from control livers (Fig. 7E, upper panel). Finally we demonstrated that obstructive cholestasis led to impaired HNF4α acetylation and the reduced HNF4α nuclear retention in liver, which was consistent with our in vitro studies (Fig. 7E, middle and lower panels). In this study, we identified the bile acid-activated nuclear receptor FXR as a major regulator of estrogen metabolism in liver. An elevated serum E2 level was observed in patients with high bile acid level. Notably, AST and ALT enzymes, which are specific markers for liver cell injury, were within normal range in 8 of 40 cholestatic patients who have elevated BA and E2 levels. In addition, no statistically significant difference of AST and ALT was observed between two groups of PBC patients, although their level of BA and E2 were significantly different. These results suggest that a high E2 level in cholestasis might be mainly due to a bile acid-activated regulatory cascade rather than due to liver cell injury. Indeed, therapeutic normalization of bile acid concentrations led to decreased serum estrogen levels. In addition, cholestatic patients' bile acid concentrations positively correlated with E2 levels. Moreover, BDL-treated mice showed an increased E2 level, and this effect was alleviated by FXR deletion. Because toxic bile acids may induce hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, we cannot exclude the possibility that, in addition to the primary effect of FXR, cholestatic hepatocellular injury could partially contribute to the E2 up-regulation during cholestasis. And the small increase of serum E2 level in BDL-treated FXR−/− mice might be due to toxicity of bile acid, which could direc"

The final steps of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine biosynthesis in members of the plant genus Ephedra involve N-methylation of norephedrine and norpseudoephedrine, respectively. Here, using a plant transcriptome screen, we report the isolation and characterization of an N-methyltransferase (NMT) from Ephedra sinica able to catalyze the formation of (pseudo)ephedrine and other naturally occurring phenylalkylamines, including N-methylcathinone and N-methyl(pseudo)ephedrine. Phenylalkylamine N-methyltransferase (PaNMT) shares substantial amino acid sequence identity with enzymes of the NMT family involved in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (BIA) metabolism in members of the higher plant order Ranunculales, which includes opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). PaNMT accepted a broad range of substrates with phenylalkylamine, tryptamine, β-carboline, tetrahydroisoquinoline, and BIA structural scaffolds, which is in contrast to the specificity for BIA substrates of NMT enzymes within the Ranunculales. PaNMT transcript levels were highest in young shoots of E. sinica, which corresponded to the location of NMT activity yielding (pseudo)ephedrine, N-methylcathinone, and N-methyl(pseudo)ephedrine, and with in planta accumulation of phenylalkylamines. Co-expression of recombinant genes encoding PaNMT and an ω-transaminase (PP2799) from Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli enabled the conversion of exogenous (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) and (S)-PAC to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, respectively. Our work further demonstrates the utility of plant biochemical genomics for the isolation of key enzymes that facilitate microbial engineering for the production of medicinally important metabolites."

Sifuvirtide (SFT) is a peptide-based HIV-1 fusion inhibitor approved for phase III clinical trials in China. Here, we focused on characterizing HIV-1 variants highly resistant to SFT to gain insight into the molecular resistance mechanism. Three primary substitutions (V38A, A47I, and Q52R) located at the inhibitor-binding site of HIV-1's envelope protein (Env) and one secondary substitution (N126K) located at the C-terminal heptad repeat region of the viral protein gp41, which is part of the envelope, conferred high SFT resistance and cross-resistance to the anti-HIV-1 drug T20 and the template peptide C34. Interestingly, SFT's resistance profile could be dramatically improved with an M–T hook structure–modified SFT (MTSFT) and with short-peptide inhibitors that mainly target the gp41 pocket (2P23 and its lipid derivative LP-19). We found that the V38A and Q52R substitutions reduce the binding stabilities of SFT, C34, and MTSFT, but they had no effect on the binding of 2P23 and LP-19; in sharp contrast, the A47I substitution enhanced fusion inhibitor binding. Furthermore, the primary resistance substitutions impaired Env-mediated membrane fusion and cell entry and changed the conformation of the gp41 core structure. Importantly, whereas the V38A and Q52R substitutions disrupted the N-terminal helix of gp41, a single A47I substitution greatly enhanced its thermostability. Taken together, our results provide crucial structural insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 resistance to gp41-dependent fusion inhibitors, which may inform the development of additional anti-HIV drugs.

In a generally accepted model, the viral envelope (Env) surface glycoprotein gp120 binds sequentially to cell receptor CD4 and a coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4), which triggers huge conformational changes in the Env complex. The transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 is released from the gp120 constraint and undergoes a structural rearrangement to activate its fusogenic activity. First, the N-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 inserts into the cell membrane, resulting in an extended, membrane-bridging prehairpin structure; then its C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) 3The abbreviations used are: CHRC-terminal heptad repeatNHRN-terminal heptad repeat6-HBsix-helix bundlePBDpocket-binding domainSFTsifuvirtideMTSFTM–T hook structure–modified SFTSIVsimian immunodeficiency virusDSPdual split proteinN-PAGEnative PAGE. packs in an antiparallel manner into the internal hydrophobic grooves created by trimeric N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) coiled coils, resulting in a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) conformation (Fig. 1). Thus, the viral and cellular membranes are driven together for bilayer fusion and viral entry.

The M–T hook–modified SFT, termed MTSFT, also showed greatly increased anti-HIV activity and genetic barrier to inducing drug resistance (25.Chong H. Yao X. Qiu Z. Sun J. Qiao Y. Zhang M. Wang M.

Among the newly designed fusion inhibitor peptides, SFT was engineered on the basis of a C34-based gp41 core structure, in which the charged glutamic acid and lysine residues were introduced into the solvent-accessible site while the residues responsible for the NHR binding were maintained unchanged (Fig. 1). Further, a serine residue was added to the N terminus of SFT to increase its helical stability, and Glu119 was substituted by threonine to enhance its binding with the NHR pocket site. We previously determined the crystal structure of SFT bound to a target mimic peptide, which verified an electronically constrained α-helical peptide with significantly improved binding stability (26.Yao X.

In the phase I clinical trials, SFT demonstrated its good safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, especially with a dramatically prolonged half-life (19.He Y. Xiao Y. Song H. Liang Q. Ju D. Chen X.

In an advanced stage, SFT has been evaluated in clinical phase II trials and approved for clinical phase II trials in China, and thus it will hopefully become the next fusion inhibitor for clinical application. In this study, we focused on characterizing SFT-induced HIV-1 variants to gain new insights into the genetic pathways and mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance to newly developed fusion inhibitors. Several new mutations were identified as conferring high resistance to SFT and cross-resistance to T20 and C34. The mechanisms underlying the resistance were further characterized from multiple aspects, including the binding stability of inhibitors, the functionality of viral Env glycoproteins, the conformation of gp41 core structure, and the structural changes of the NHR helices. The data have provided critical information for the structure–function relationship of HIV-1 Env and gp41-dependent fusion inhibitors and will definitely aid in the development of new anti-HIV drugs. To characterize the structure–activity relationship of newly designed HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, we previously performed the in vitro selection of escape HIV-1 variants to SFT, in which the drug concentration was raised from 0.2 to 9,600 nm after 38 generations of virus passage over 9 months (25.Chong H. Yao X. Qiu Z. Sun J. Qiao Y. Zhang M. Wang M. Cui S. He Y. The M-T hook structure increases the potency of HIV-1 fusion inhibitor sifuvirtide and overcomes drug resistance.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2014; 69 (24908047): 2759-276910.1093/jac/dku183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To identify the genetic pathway of SFT-induced resistance, the entire env genes of resistant viruses were amplified by PCR and cloned for DNA sequencing. As shown in Fig. 2, two Env clones (M1 and M2) carry a single V38A mutation; one Env clone (M3) carries a single A47I mutation; 12 Env clones (M4–M15) carry V38A/A47I/N126K mutations, and three Env clones (M16–M18) carry V38A/A47I/Q52R/N126K quaternary mutations. Therefore, four mutant viruses were finally identified from the pool of SFT-resistant HIV-1 variants. The V38A, A47I, and Q52R located within the inhibitor-binding site of gp41 might determine the resistance as primary mutations, whereas the N126K in the CHR served as a secondary mutation. After analyzing all of the cloned Env sequences, no consistent substitutions that apparently caused the resistance were identified in the other sites of gp41 or in gp120 sequence (Fig. S1), and we thus focused on the mutations on the NHR and CHR sequences of gp41. To identify the mutations responsible for SFT-induced resistance, we generated a panel of HIV-1NL4-3 Env mutants carrying the amino acid substitutions either singly or in combination (Table 1). The corresponding pseudoviruses were then produced and used in a single cycle infection assay to determine the inhibitory activity of SFT. Among the single mutations, V38A, A47I, and Q52R conferred 7.93-, 4.58-, and 39.49-fold resistance to SFT, respectively, whereas N126K had minor effect on the inducer (1.7-fold). Apparently, the mutant viruses carrying the combined mutations resulted in dramatically increased -fold changes in resistance to SFT, as shown by the mutants with V38A/A47I (41.61-fold), V38A/A47I/N126K (81.2-fold), V38A/A47I/Q52R (1107.19-fold), and V38A/A47I/Q52R/N126K (1316.01-fold). Therefore, the mutant virus with V38A/A47I/Q52R/N126K mutations might finally dominate the resistance phenotype to SFT.Table 1Resistance profiles of HIV-1 mutants to SFT and the first-generation fusion inhibitorsHIV-1NL4-3 virusSFTT20C34MT-SFT2P23LP-19IC50-FoldIC50-FoldIC50-FoldIC50-FoldIC50-FoldIC50-FoldnmnmnmnmnmnmWT1.84 ± 0.271.0070.74 ± 0.541.001.17 ± 0.011.000.93 ± 0.071.000.59 ± 0.111.000.09 ± 0.041.00V38A14.59 ± 1.797.931874.68 ± 252.5326.5014.9 ± 4.0712.791.78 ± 0.201.910.71 ± 0.211.200.10 ± 0.041.11A47I8.42 ± 2.144.5825.87 ± 3.490.372.51 ± 0.382.151.45 ± 0.221.560.75 ± 0.271.270.10 ± 0.051.11Q52R72.67 ± 6.9639.491241.32 ± 242.7517.5540.75 ± 10.4534.981.62 ± 0.461.742.78 ± 0.424.710.08 ± 0.020.89N126K3.12 ± 0.051.70113.5 ± 27.421.605.36 ± 0.94.583.03 ± 0.293.260.98 ± 0.441.660.22 ± 0.142.44V38A/A47I76.56 ± 13.2841.61962.33 ± 217.7313.6011.21 ± 2.249.584.20 ± 0.374.521.10 ± 0.361.860.14 ± 0.061.56V38A/A47I/Q52R2037.22 ± 434.21107.192196.33 ± 211.1331.0583.03 ± 26.6370.97154.14 ± 36.99165.740.78 ± 0.121.320.07 ± 0.010.78V38A/A47I/N126K149.42 ± 12.3681.211262.67 ± 253.0117.8520.79 ± 3.1417.7711.51 ± 0.9812.381.66 ± 0.382.810.34 ± 0.133.78V38A/A47I/Q52R/N126K2421.46 ± 827.821316.012503.34 ± 227.3235.39142.57 ± 16.63121.85136.27 ± 27.10146.531.46 ± 0.532.470.15 ± 0.031.67 Open table in a new tab We next analyzed the cross-resistance profiles of SFT-induced mutants to the drug T20 and the template peptide C34. As shown in Table 1, the single mutants V38A and Q52R also mediated high level resistance to T20 and C34. Specifically, whereas V38A conferred 26.5-fold resistance to T20 and 12.79-fold resistance to C34, Q52R rendered 17.55-fold resistance to T20 and 34.98-fold resistance to C34. Interestingly, whereas the virus with A47I had slight resistance to C34 (2.15-fold), it exhibited markedly increased susceptibility to T20. Among the variants with multiple mutations, V38A/A47I, V38A/A47I/N126K, V38A/A47I/Q52R, and V38A/A47I/Q52R/N126K showed 13.6-, 17.85-, 31.05-, and 35.39-fold resistance to T20, respectively, and 9.58-, 17.77-, 70.97-, and 121.85-fold resistance to C34, respectively. Therefore, these results suggested that SFT-resistant mutants also displayed high cross-resistance to the first-generation fusion inhibitors T20 and C34. We previously demonstrated that adding an M–T hook structure to the CHR-derived peptide fusion inhibitors could greatly enhance their binding and antiviral activities as well as the genetic barriers to resistance (24.Chong H.

Herein, it was interesting to know the cross-resistance profile of SFT-induced HIV-1 mutants to the MTSFT. As shown in Table 1, the single mutations (V38A, A47I, Q52R, and N126K) conferred little resistance to MTSFT, whereas the combined mutations (V38A/A47I, V38A/A47I/Q52R, V38A/A47I/N126K, and V38A/A47I/Q52R/N126K) resulted in the resistance with dramatically decreased -fold changes relative to that of SFT. In particular, the single Q52R mutation could result in ∼40-fold resistance to SFT, but it had no obvious effect on the inhibitory potency of MTSFT, verifying the importance of the M–T hook structure in overcoming the resistance. Afterward, we also characterized the cross-resistance of SFT-induced mutants to the short-peptide fusion inhibitor 2P23 and its lipid derivative LP-19. As illustrated in Fig. 1, 2P23 is a 23-mer peptide with the M–T hook residues at its N terminus, and LP-19 has been further developed by conjugating a C16 fatty acid group to the C terminus of 2P23. Both inhibitors mainly target the gp41 pocket rather than the T20-resistant site and possess potent inhibitory activities against HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (23.Xiong S.

A helical short-peptide fusion inhibitor with highly potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus.J.

Impressively, we found that all of the mutant viruses with single or multiple mutations had no or minor resistance to 2P23 and LP-19. To understand the mechanisms underlying the SFT-selected resistance, we sought to determine the effects of the resistance mutations on the binding stability of inhibitors. To this end, the NHR-derived peptide N36 with a WT sequence (N36wt) or its mutants with single or multiple amino acid substitutions (N36V38A, N36A47I, N36Q52R, N36V38A/A47I, and N36V38A/A47I/Q52R) were synthesized as target surrogates, and the interactions between SFT and target mimic peptides were initially measured by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, CD spectra of all of the peptide pairs displayed typical double minima at 208 and 222 nm, which indicated that SFT interacted with each of the N36 peptides to form 6-HB structures. The V38A and Q52R mutations resulted in decreased α-helical contents of the 6-HBs, but the A47I mutation might enhance the α-helicity. Defined as the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm), the thermostability of 6-HBs demonstrated the binding stability of SFT. It was found that V38A and Q52R severely reduced the Tm value, whereas A47I conversely increased it.Table 2Effects of SFT-induced mutations on the α-helicity and thermostability of 6-HB structurePeptide complex[θ]222Helix content (%)Tm%°CSFT–N36−30,1379171SFT–N36V38A−27,7948464SFT–N36A47I−31,7489673SFT–N36Q52R−25,9897961SFT–N36V38A/A47I−25,4197766SFT–N36V38A/A47I/Q52R−22,3466853C34–N36−33,08710064C34–N36V38A−29,7919054C34–N36A47I−34,56010573C34–N36Q52R−27,7118456C34–N36V38A/A47I−31,6379665C34–N36V38A/A47I/Q52R−24,8887553T20–N36−13,8893352T20–N36V38A−22,25014NAT20–N36A47I−8,7843967T20–N36Q52R−10,04715NAT20–N36V38A/A47I−12,3689NAT20–N36V38A/A47I/Q52R−5,4843NAMTSFT–N36−30,5569378MTSFT–N36V38A−28,1678572MTSFT–N36A47I−33,41710180MTSFT–N36Q52R−25,5697768MTSFT–N36V38A/A47I−30,1819176MTSFT–N36V38A/A47I/Q52R−20,61162652P23–N36−24,48678802P23–N36V38A−23,30876802P23–N36A47I−24,78879892P23–N36Q52R−22,31773792P23–N36V38A/A47I−24,94582892P23–N36V38A/A47I/Q52R−21,2947186LP19–N36−27,91585NALP19–N36V38A−31,06894NALP19–N36A47I−36,102109NALP19–N36Q52R−28,37386NALP19–N36V38A/A47I−29,23789NALP19–N36V38A/A47I/Q52R−24,88175NA Open table in a new tab We also examined the helical interaction and binding stability of all of the other inhibitors by CD spectroscopy (Table 2). Consistently, the V38A and Q52R mutations reduced the α-helical content and Tm value of the 6-HBs formed by C34, T20, and MTSFT, whereas the A47I mutation did enhance their α-helicity and thermostability. In sharp contrast, V38A and Q52R had no apparent effect on the interactions of 2P23 and LP-19, as shown by the α-helical contents and Tm values of their 6-HBs, whereas A47I still enhanced the binding stability of inhibitors. As shown by N36 with combined mutations, the A47I mutation could counteract the negative effects of the V38A and Q52R mutations for the binding of inhibitors. We next focused on investigating the effects of SFT-induced resistance mutations on the functionality of viral Env glycoprotein by two approaches. First, the infectivity of HIV-1NL4-3 pseudoviruses carrying single or combined mutations was determined by a single-cycle infection assay, in which the cell entry efficiency of WT virus was normalized to 100% and the relative virus entry of other mutants was calculated accordingly. As shown in Fig. 4A, all of the pseudoviruses with the Env carrying single resistance mutations (V38A, A47I, or Q52R) or combined mutations (V38A/A47I or V38A/A47I/Q52R) showed markedly decreased cell entry efficiency. Apparently, the Q52R mutation dramatically impaired the functionality of viral Env, and the secondary N126K mutation exhibited a compensatory effect. Second, we measured Env-mediated cell–cell fusion by a dual split protein (DSP)-based fusion assay. It was found that single or combined mutations of V38A and A47I had minor effect on the Env's fusion activity, but Q52R resulted in a dramatic"

The more future oriented facets of psychological capital, i.e. optimism, hope and self-efficacy have been shown in several studies to be positively related to subjective well-being and negatively to ill-being. Furthermore, recent studies suggest coping strategies as mediators for these relationships. In our study, we examined the longitudinal relation of optimism, hope and self-efficacy with subjective well-being and ill-being in a German panel dataset and tested the mediating effect of flexible goal adjustment in a path model. Our results show a statistically significant positive effect of self-efficacy and optimism on subjective well-being as well as a statistically significant negative effect of optimism on depression over three years. All three predictors show a statistically significant relation with flexible goal adjustment, but flexible goal adjustment did not mediate the effect on subjective well-being or depression."

A total of 64 isolates from 51 patients identified as C. striatum by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were assessed. More than two blood cultures were positive in 25 (48.1%) patients. Diabetes, solid tumor, and a history of previous exposure to antibiotics were more common in patients with multiple positive blood cultures. Charlson comorbidity scores were also higher, and more isolates were recovered after 48 hours of hospital stay in patients with multiple positive blood cultures. Strains recovered from patients with multiple positive blood cultures produced significantly more biofilm. Based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST), sequence type (ST) 20 (31.3%) was the most dominant, followed by ST2 (20.3%) and ST23 (10.9%). There was no relationship between the number of positive blood culture sets and sequence typing. In multivariate analyses, Carlson comorbidity score (odds ratio [OR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-3.36; P = 0.03) and biofilm formation were associated with multiple positive blood cultures (OR, 17.43; 95% CI, 3.71-81.91; P = 0.03). This study provides evidence that the biofilm phenotype could contribute to determining the clinical significance of C. striatum in patients with severe underlying conditions. The predominance of certain STs suggests the relatedness of C. striatum infection and the nosocomial environment."

We detected significantly more neutrophils in the airways of Rgs5−/− mice than WT counterparts following acute respiratory virus infection and in the peritoneum in response to injection of thioglycollate, a biochemical proinflammatory stimulus. RGS5-deficient neutrophils responded with increased chemotaxis elicited by the chemokines CXC motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL2, and CXCL12 but not fMLP. Moreover, adhesion of these cells was increased in the presence of both CXCL2 and fMLP.

GTP–Gαi is activated and dissociates from the remaining G protein subunits (Gβγ). Both Gαi–GTP and Gβγ activate distinct downstream effectors that modify cell polarity and induce motility, such as phospholipase Cβ, which leads to activation of effectors crucial to chemotaxis, including Ca2+, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (5.de Oliveira S. Rosowski E.E. Huttenlocher A. Neutrophil migration in infection and wound repair: going forward in reverse.Nat. Rev.

Desensitization of most GPCRs occurs through binding to β-arrestins, which leads to receptor phosphorylation and internalization. In neutrophils, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton may also desensitize signals by physically separating receptor and G protein (6.Holdfeldt A. Dahlstrand Rudin A. Gabl M. Rajabkhani Z. König G.M.

Another mechanism of GPCR desensitization involves the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, a large family of complex, heterogeneous intracellular proteins with pleiotropic functions in both innate and adaptive immune responses (7.Druey K.M. Emerging roles of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins in the immune system.Adv.

Among their critical functions, canonical RGS proteins inactivate Gαi and Gαq subunits through their GTPase-accelerating (GAP) activity. By augmenting the intrinsic capacity of Gα to hydrolyze GTP, RGS proteins decrease the lifetime of activated (GTP-bound) Gα, thereby inhibiting the signaling pathways leading to leukocyte migration (7.Druey K.M. Emerging roles of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins in the immune system.Adv.

Several physiological functions of RGS proteins in the immune system have been identified. RGS1 and -13 regulate localization of B cells in lymphoid follicles and humoral immune responses (9.Hwang I.Y. Park C. Harrision K.A. Huang N.N. Kehrl J.H. Variations in Gnai2 and Rgs1 expression affect chemokine receptor signaling and the organization of secondary lymphoid organs.Genes Immun. 2010; 11 (20508603): 384-39610.1038/gene.2010.27Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10.Hwang I.Y.

Genetic manipulation of RGS13 levels in mast cells has strong effects on chemotaxis and chemokine-induced signaling (11.Bansal G. DiVietro J.A. Kuehn H.S. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Gilfillan A.M. Druey K.M. RGS13 controls G protein-coupled receptor-evoked responses of human mast cells.J. Immunol. 2008; 181 (19017978): 7882-789010.4049/jimmunol.181.11.7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, expression and functions of RGS proteins in neutrophils have not been evaluated directly. Interestingly, Cho et al. (12.Cho H. Kamenyeva O. Yung S. Gao J.L. Hwang I.Y. Park C. Murphy P.M. Neubig R.R. Kehrl J.H. The loss of RGS protein-Gαi2 interactions results in markedly impaired mouse neutrophil trafficking to inflammatory sites.Mol. Cell.

These findings suggest an important role for RGS proteins in the modulation of neutrophil trafficking. RGS5 is a member of the R4/B subfamily of RGS proteins. RGS5 is among the simplest members of the superfamily as it contains only an RGS box, the motif common to all RGS proteins mediating binding to Gα (13.Xie Z. Chan E.C. Druey K.M. R4 regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins in inflammation and immunity.AAPS J. 2016; 18 (26597290): 294-30410.1208/s12248-015-9847-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but no other well defined domains. RGS5 is expressed constitutively in relatively few tissues in mice, including vascular and bronchial smooth muscle (14.Arnold C. Demirel E. Feldner A. Genové G. Zhang H. Sticht C. Wieland T. Hecker M. Heximer S. Korff T.

Rgs5−/− mice at baseline were underweight and hypotensive compared with controls, suggesting critical roles for RGS5 in metabolism and cardiovascular homeostasis (17.Cho H. Park C. Hwang I.Y. Han S.B. Schimel D. Despres D. Kehrl J.H. Rgs5 targeting leads to chronic low blood pressure and a lean body habitus.Mol. Cell.

Routine immunophenotyping uncovered reduced neutrophil counts in peripheral blood of Rgs5−/− mice compared with controls. Furthermore, RNA-Seq and microarray analysis of FACS-purified leukocytes from C57BL/6 mice revealed expression of RGS5 in neutrophils from spleen and bone marrow (Immunological Genome (ImmGen) Project Consortium). These results prompted us to examine the expression of RGS5 in mouse neutrophils and explore its role in chemotaxis and trafficking in vivo. We first characterized RGS5 expression in neutrophils purified from bone marrow (BM) of wildtype (WT) mice using Ly6G microbeads. On average, cells isolated by this method were of 93.2 ± 3% purity based on high forward and side scatter and high CD11b surface expression as indicated by flow cytometry (n = 3) (Fig. 1A). Cells from WT and Rgs5−/− mice had comparable polymorphonuclear morphology by light microscopy (Fig. 1A). We detected relatively low amounts of RGS5 in BM-derived neutrophils by immunoblotting, which might be due to rapid degradation by the proteasome (18.Bodenstein J. Sunahara R.K. Neubig R.R. N-terminal residues control proteasomal degradation of RGS2, RGS4, and RGS5 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71 (17220356): 1040-105010.1124/mol.106.029397Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To increase steady-state levels of RGS5 and to enhance detection, we treated cells with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132), which permitted detection of RGS5 in unstimulated neutrophils from bone marrow (Fig. 1B). RGS proteins are highly regulated at the transcriptional level, and expression of some RGS proteins changes rapidly in response to cellular stimulation (19.Alqinyah M. Hooks S.B. Regulating the regulators: epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-translational regulation of RGS proteins.Cell. Signal. 2018; 42 (29042285): 77-8710.1016/j.cellsig.2017.10.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although RGS5 expression was not significantly affected by treatment of neutrophils with chemokines, including CXCL1 and CXCL2, fMLP treatment was associated with modest up-regulation of the RGS5 polypeptide. Immunoreactive RGS5 was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of purified neutrophils of WT but not Rgs5−/− mice (Fig. 1C). Cytoplasmic localization of RGS5 has been reported previously for RGS5 detected in airway smooth muscle cells (15.Balenga N.A. Jester W. Jiang M. Panettieri Jr, R.A. Druey K.M. Loss of regulator of G protein signaling 5 promotes airway hyperresponsiveness in the absence of allergic inflammation.J. Allergy Clin.

To evaluate neutrophil hematopoiesis and homeostatic neutrophil localization in the absence of inflammatory challenge, we compared numbers of mature neutrophils in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and various tissues of WT and Rgs5−/− mice by flow cytometry. Examination of peripheral blood revealed comparable hemoglobin concentrations, hematocrit (not shown), and platelet counts in WT and Rgs5−/− mice, results suggesting that these mice did not have a global hematopoietic defect (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, total peripheral white blood cell counts were significantly lower in Rgs5−/− mice than in WT controls (Fig. 2C). Although there were equivalent numbers of monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils in the blood of WT and mice, Rgs5−/− mice had both peripheral blood neutropenia and lymphopenia relative to controls (Fig. 2D). At the same time, we detected comparable numbers of Ly6GhiCD11b+ mature neutrophils in BM; these results suggest that neutrophil maturation was not affected by the loss of RGS5 (Fig. 2E). Given the abundant evidence that RGS proteins regulate leukocyte trafficking in vivo (23.Kehrl J.H. The impact of RGS and other G-protein regulatory proteins on Gαi-mediated signaling in immunity.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2016; 114 (27071343): 40-5210.1016/j.bcp.2016.04.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the reduction in circulating neutrophils in Rgs5−/− mice represented increased migration into tissues and/or clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. However, under baseline conditions, there were similar numbers of neutrophils in spleen (site of clearance by reticuloendothelial system) or in lungs of naïve WT and Rgs5−/− mice (Fig. 2, F and G). To assess neutrophil migration in response to an inflammatory stimulus, we infected mice with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a natural mouse pathogen that replicates in mouse lung tissue and elicits production of neutrophil chemoattractants, notably CCL3 and CXCL1 (24.Domachowske J.B.

The chemokine macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha and its receptor CCR1 control pulmonary inflammation and antiviral host defense in paramyxovirus infection.J.

The severity of PVM infection was similar in WT and Rgs5−/− mice as assessed by peribronchial and alveolar accumulation of neutrophils in lungs (Fig. 3A), equivalent virus recovery (Fig. 3B), and similar levels of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytokines (CXCL1 and CCL3) (Fig. 3C). However, although PVM infection elicited robust neutrophil recruitment to lung tissue in both strains, there were nearly 8 times more neutrophils in the airways (BALF) of Rgs5−/− mice than in WT controls at the same time point (Fig. 3, D and E). Likewise, although the numbers of neutrophils detected in BM in WT and Rgs5−/− mice were indistinguishable from one another (Fig. 3F), there were significantly more neutrophils in peripheral blood and spleens of Rgs5−/− mice (Fig. 3, G and H). These findings raise the possibility that alveolar reverse transmigration (26.Hirano Y. Aziz M. Wang P. Role of reverse transendothelial migration of neutrophils in inflammation.Biol.

The increased accumulation of neutrophils in the airways of PVM-infected Rgs5−/− mice suggests enhanced extravasation into the airway lumen due to increased chemotaxis, adhesion, demargination, transendothelial migration, or a combination of these mechanisms. The lung microvasculature has specific, unique properties; the diameter of some alveolar capillary segments (6–7 μm) is frequently smaller than that of neutrophils (6–7.5 μm), which can prolong transendothelial transit times (28.Gane J. Stockley R. Mechanisms of neutrophil transmigration across the vascular endothelium in COPD.Thorax. 2012; 67 (21543441): 553-56110.1136/thoraxjnl-2011-200088Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29.Doerschuk C.M.

To determine whether neutrophils from Rgs5−/− mice exhibited a similar behavior in tissues with larger blood vessels, we used a model of sterile peritonitis induced by thioglycollate (TG). Intraperitoneal injection of TG induces rapid, transient infiltration of both macrophages and neutrophils into the peritoneal space through local production of chemoattractants, such as CXCL1 and CXCL2 (30.Call D.R. Nemzek J.A. Ebong S.J. Bolgos G.L. Newcomb D.E. Remick D.G. Ratio of local to systemic chemokine concentrations regulates neutrophil recruitment.Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158 (11159209): 715-72110.1016/S0002-9440(10)64014-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Injection of TG induced a dramatic increase in the total number of peritoneal cells within 2–4 h; the numbers of total cells and total neutrophils were nearly double in Rgs5−/− mice compared with WT (Fig. 4A). There were no significant differences in levels of CXCL1 in the peritoneum post-TG injection (Fig. 4B) nor any difference in surface CXCR2 expression on TG-elicited peritoneal neutrophils of WT or Rgs5−/− mice (Fig. 4C). Thus, we hypothesized that enhanced responsiveness to TG-evoked chemokines accounts for the increased recruitment of neutrophils observed in the RGS5-gene deleted mice. To assess the effects of RGS5 deficiency on TG-induced neutrophil migration directly, we isolated BM neutrophils from WT and Rgs5−/− mice and labeled cells from the two strains with different fluorophores. We then injected a 50:50 mixture of cells into WT recipients and assessed accumulation in the peritoneum by flow cytometry following intraperitoneal injection of TG. We detected more than double the number of RGS5-deficient neutrophils compared with WT in the peritoneum after TG injection (70.2 ± 2.5 versus 29.3 ± 1.5%) (Fig. 4D). This result is consistent with the interpretation that deficiency of RGS5 in neutrophils, rather than the microenvironment of Rgs5−/− mice, accounts for their increased recruitment to sites of inflammation. Our cumulative results using two distinct models of inflammation suggested that neutrophils from Rgs5−/− mice migrate much more effectively into inflamed tissue than do their WT counterparts. We hypothesized that RGS5-deficient neutrophils have increased chemotactic and/or adhesive properties that could account for these findings. To assess the chemotaxis of RGS5-deficient neutrophils, we first measured migration of BM-derived neutrophils in Transwell assays. Neutrophils from WT mice underwent chemotaxis to CXCL1 or CXCL2 (CXCR2 ligands) and CXCL12 (CXCR4 ligand) (Fig. 5A). Neutrophils from Rgs5−/− mice demonstrated significantly increased chemotaxis to all three chemokines compared with WT neutrophils, consistent with their responses in vivo. Expression of both CXCR2 and CXCR4 was similar in naïve bone marrow–derived neutrophils from WT and Rgs5−/− mice at baseline (Fig. 5B). In addition, both the magnitude and kinetics of down-regulation of CXCR2 in neutrophils from WT and Rgs5−/− mice following chemokine stimulation were comparable with one another (Fig. 5C). To assess chemokine-induced signaling downstream of receptors, we measured Akt phosphorylation induced by CXCL2 by immunoblotting. Ligand-bound chemokine receptor activates Gαi, the target of RGS5, which dissociates from Gβγ. Free Gβγ then activates PI3Kγ, which catalyzes production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate at the cell membrane, a key step in cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to polarization of the neutrophil in the direction of a chemoattractant gradient (31.Wang F. The signaling mechanisms underlying cell polarity and chemotaxis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1 (20066099): a00298010.1101/cshperspect.a002980Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylation induced by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate binding is a surrogate for PI3K activity and is typically increased in cells with reduced RGS protein expression compared with WT (11.Bansal G. DiVietro J.A. Kuehn H.S. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Gilfillan A.M. Druey K.M. RGS13 controls G protein-coupled receptor-evoked responses of human mast cells.J.

Although CXCL2 induced comparable peak Akt phosphorylation in neutrophils from WT and Rgs5−/− mice at 1 min, Akt phosphorylation was significantly prolonged in RGS5-deficient cells compared with WT (Fig. 6A). To confirm that chemokine-induced signaling was increased in RGS5-deficient neutrophils, we analyzed intracellular Ca2+ flux. Gβγ released from activated Gα stimulates phospholipase Cβ, which in turn leads to the generation of inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (32.Khan S.M. Sleno R. Gora S. Zylbergold P. Laverdure J.P. Labbé J.C. Miller G.J. Hébert T.E. The expanding roles of Gβγ subunits in G protein-coupled receptor signaling and drug action.Pharmacol. Rev. 2013; 65 (23406670): 545-57710.1124/pr.111.005603Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both CXCL1 and CXCL2 induced a rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ in neutrophils from WT mice, but the magnitude and duration of the response were significantly greater in RGS5-deficient neutrophils (Fig. 6, B and C). By contrast, receptor-independent Ca2+ flux evoked by ionomycin stimulation was equivalent in neutrophils from WT and Rgs5−/− mice (Fig. 6D). These studies support the hypothesis that that increased chemotaxis of RGS5-deficient neutrophils was due to augmented chemokine-evoked signaling.Figure 6RGS5 negatively regulates chemokine-induced Ca2+ signaling and Akt phosphorylation in neutrophils.

In this assay, the velocity determined for neutrophils from Rgs5−/− mice responding to CXCL2, but not fMLP, was significantly greater than that of WT mice under the same conditions, even at submaximal concentrations of fMLP (Fig. 7, A and B). Directional error, a measure of the ability of the cells to faithfully track a linear gradient of chemoattractant, was reduced in neutrophils from Rgs5−/− mice exposed to CXCL2 gradients compared with control, whereas directional error in response to fMLP was equivalent. Next, we characterized adhesion of RGS5-deficient and WT neutrophils by measuring binding to immobilized ICAM-1. This interaction is mediated by β2 integrins, such as LFA1, expressed on the neutrophil surface (33.Lomakina E.B. Waugh R.E. Signaling and dynamics of activation of LFA-1 and Mac-1 by immobilized IL-8.Cell. Mol. Bioeng. 2010; 3 (21532911): 106-11610.1007/s12195-009-0099-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We observed significantly increased binding of neutrophils lacking RGS5 to ICAM-1 in the presence of either CXCL2 or fMLP compared with neutrophils from WT mice (Fig. 7C).

These countries show meaningful variation in terms of the Human Development Index (HDI), ranging from very poor, developing countries to prosperous, developed countries. We found evidence of cross-level interactions, consistently showing that individuals' level of education was associated with an increase in their liberalization values in higher HDI societies, whereas this relationship was curbed in lower HDI countries. This enhanced liberalization mindset of individuals in high HDI countries, in turn, was related to better scores on national indices of innovation. We conclude that this 'education amplification effect' widens the gap between lower and higher HDI countries in terms of liberalized mentality and economic growth potential. Policy implications for how low HDI countries can counter this gap are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2809422701,"Hunger-sensing agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons ensure survival by adapting metabolism and behavior to low caloric environments. This adaption is accomplished by consolidating food intake, suppressing energy expenditure, and maximizing fat storage (nutrient partitioning) for energy preservation. The intracellular mechanisms responsible are unknown. Here we report that AgRP carnitine acetyltransferase (Crat) knockout (KO) mice exhibited increased fatty acid utilization and greater fat loss after 9 d of calorie restriction (CR). No differences were seen in mice with ad libitum food intake. Eleven days ad libitum feeding after CR resulted in greater food intake, rebound weight gain, and adiposity in AgRP Crat KO mice compared with wild-type controls, as KO mice act to restore pre-CR fat mass. Collectively, this study highlights the importance of Crat in AgRP neurons to regulate nutrient partitioning and fat mass during chronically reduced caloric intake. The increased food intake, body weight gain, and adiposity in KO mice after CR also highlights the detrimental and persistent metabolic consequence of impaired substrate utilization associated with CR. This finding may have significant implications for postdieting weight management in patients with metabolic diseases.—Reichenbach, A., Stark, R., Mequinion, M., Lockie, S. H., Lemus, M.

https://openalex.org/W2809401115,"The inflammasome is a major component of the innate immune system, and its main function is to activate caspase-1, a cysteine protease that promotes inflammation by inducing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) maturation and release into the extracellular milieu. To prevent uncontrolled inflammation, this complex is highly regulated. When it is assembled, the inflammasome is insoluble, which has long precluded the analysis of its interactions with other proteins. Here we used the proximity-dependent biotinylation assay (BioID) to identify proteins associated with caspase-1 during inflammasome activation. Using the BioID in a cell-free system in which the inflammasome had been activated, we found that a caspase-1–biotin ligase fusion protein selectively labeled 111 candidates, including the p62/sequestosome-1 protein (p62). Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated that p62 interacts with caspase-1. This interaction promoted caspase-1–mediated cleavage of p62 at Asp-329. Mechanistic and functional analyses revealed that caspase-1–mediated cleavage of p62 leads to loss of its interaction with the autophagosomal protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β (LC3B). Strikingly, overexpression of a p62 N-terminal fragment generated upon caspase-1 cleavage decreased IL-1β release, whereas overexpression of p62's C-terminal portion enhanced IL-1β release, by regulating pro-IL1β levels. Overall, the overexpression of both fragments together decreased IL-1β release. Taken together, our results indicate that caspase-1–mediated p62 cleavage plays a complex role in balancing caspase-1–induced inflammation. The inflammasome is a major component of the innate immune system, and its main function is to activate caspase-1, a cysteine protease that promotes inflammation by inducing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) maturation and release into the extracellular milieu. To prevent uncontrolled inflammation, this complex is highly regulated. When it is assembled, the inflammasome is insoluble, which has long precluded the analysis of its interactions with other proteins. Here we used the proximity-dependent biotinylation assay (BioID) to identify proteins associated with caspase-1 during inflammasome activation. Using the BioID in a cell-free system in which the inflammasome had been activated, we found that a caspase-1–biotin ligase fusion protein selectively labeled 111 candidates, including the p62/sequestosome-1 protein (p62). Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated that p62 interacts with caspase-1. This interaction promoted caspase-1–mediated cleavage of p62 at Asp-329. Mechanistic and functional analyses revealed that caspase-1–mediated cleavage of p62 leads to loss of its interaction with the autophagosomal protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β (LC3B). Strikingly, overexpression of a p62 N-terminal fragment generated upon caspase-1 cleavage decreased IL-1β release, whereas overexpression of p62's C-terminal portion enhanced IL-1β release, by regulating pro-IL1β levels. Overall, the overexpression of both fragments together decreased IL-1β release. Taken together, our results indicate that caspase-1–mediated p62 cleavage plays a complex role in balancing caspase-1–induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2808819825,"Five in vitro experiments were conducted with the following objectives: 1) To evaluate the ruminal fermentation of three different single ingredients: corn, glycerin, and starch (Exp. 1 and 2); 2) To assess effects of partially replacing corn with glycerin in beef cattle diets on ruminal fermentation pattern (Exp. 3 and 4); and 3) To evaluate the effects of glycerin inclusion on the extension of ruminal DM digestibility of feeds with high (orchard hay) and low (corn) fiber content (Exp. 5). For Exp. 1 and 2, two in vitro systems (24-bottle AnkomRF and 20-serum bottles) were used in four consecutive fermentation batches to evaluate gas production (GP), fermentation profiles, enteric methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) of corn, glycerin, and starch. The 24 h total GP, acetate concentration, and acetate: propionate ratio decreased only when glycerin was added to the diet (P < 0.01). The 48-h total GP and metabolizable energy were greatest for corn (P < 0.01), and similar between glycerin and starch. The starch treatment had the lowest total volatile fatty acids concentration (P = 0.01). Glycerin had greatest CH4 production, lag time, and maximum gas volume of the first pool (P < 0.05). However, the maximum gas volume of the second pool was greatest for corn (P < 0.05), and similar between glycerin and starch. The starch treatment had the greatest specific rates of digestion for first and second pools (P < 0.05). Production of CO2 (mL/g) was greater for corn (P < 0.01), but similar for glycerin and starch. For Exp. 3 and 4, the same systems were used to evaluate four different levels of glycerin [0, 100, 200, and 300 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] replacing corn in beef cattle finishing diets. Glycerin levels did not affect 24 and 48 h total GP, CH4, and CO2 (P > 0.05). The inclusion of glycerin linearly decreased acetate concentration (P = 0.03) and acetate: propionate ratio (P = 0.04). For Exp. 5, two DaisyII incubators were used to evaluate the in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of the following treatments: orchard hay; corn; orchard hay + glycerin; and corn + glycerin. Glycerin inclusion decreased orchard hay IVDMD (P < 0.01) but did not affect corn IVDMD (P > 0.05). We concluded that, under these experimental conditions, glycerin has similar energy efficiency when used in replacement of corn and included at up to 300 g/kg in beef cattle diets."
https://openalex.org/W2809033229,"The actin-binding protein cortactin promotes the formation and maintenance of actin-rich structures, including lamellipodial protrusions in fibroblasts and neuronal dendritic spines. Cortactin cellular functions have been attributed to its activation of the Arp2/3 complex, which stimulates actin branch nucleation, and to its recruitment of Rho family GTPase regulators. Cortactin also binds actin filaments and significantly slows filament depolymerization, but the mechanism by which it does so and the relationship between actin binding and stabilization are unclear. Here we elucidated the cortactin regions that are necessary and sufficient for actin filament binding and stabilization. Using actin cosedimentation assays, we found that the cortactin repeat region binds actin but that the adjacent linker region is required for binding with the same affinity as full-length cortactin. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to measure the rates of single filament actin depolymerization, we observed that cortactin–actin interactions are sufficient to stabilize actin filaments. Moreover, conserved charged residues in repeat 4 were necessary for high-affinity actin binding, and substitution of these residues significantly impaired cortactin-mediated actin stabilization. Cortactin bound actin with higher affinity than did its paralog, hematopoietic cell-specific Lyn substrate 1 (HS1), and the effects on actin stability were specific to cortactin. Finally, cortactin stabilized ADP–actin filaments, indicating that the stabilization mechanism does not depend on the actin nucleotide state. Together, these results indicate that cortactin binding to actin is necessary and sufficient to stabilize filaments in a concentration-dependent manner, specific to conserved residues in the cortactin repeats, and independent of the actin nucleotide state.

https://openalex.org/W2809163547,"Neuroblastoma is the most common cancer in infants and the third most common cancer in children after leukemia and brain cancer. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of estrogen receptor (ER)-α36 gene silencing on tau protein phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with estrogen or left untreated, to investigate the effects of estrogen stimulation on ERα36 and the ERK/protein B kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. ERα36 mRNA expressions were detected by quantitative RT-PCR. A phosphatase kit was used to test protein phosphatase (PP)-2A activity before and after treatment. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect protein expression of ERα36; tau protein; phosphorylated- tau (p-tau) at site Thr231 [p-tau (Thr231)]; glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β and its specificity sites (Tyr216 and Ser9); Cyclin Dl; proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2; and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). A cell-counting kit (CCK)-8 assay was used to determine cell viability. Cell apoptosis and rate of tumor growth and volume were determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and a xenotransplanted tumor model in nude mice. Results show that without estrogen stimulation, ERα36 was inactivated. When stimulated by estrogen, expression of ERα36, PP2A, p-GSK3β (Ser9)/total protein ( t)-GSK3β, Cyclin Dl, PCNA, and Bcl-2 were up-regulated, and p-GSK3β (Tyr216)/ t-GSK3β expression was down-regulated, as was p-tau (Thr231) and Bax expression. The expression of p-ERK/ERK, p-AKT/AKT, p-methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)/MEK, and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/mTOR expression was up-regulated, suggesting that the ERK/AKT signaling pathway is activated. Cell proliferation was also accelerated, whereas apoptosis was inhibited with stimulation by estrogen. However, we found that the effects of silencing ERα36 on the expression of related intracellular factors had no association with estrogen. Our study demonstrates that ERα36 gene silencing can inhibit the activation of the ERK/AKT signaling pathway, increase tau protein phosphorylation, decrease cell vitality and tumorigenicity, and promote apoptosis of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.-Wang, H.-B., Li, T., Ma, D.-Z., Zhi, H.

https://openalex.org/W2808770209,"The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumors are associated with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, drug resistance, and poor prognosis, necessitating the development of reagents for unambiguous detection of CSC- and EMT-associated proteins in tumor specimens. To this end, we generated novel antibodies to EMT- and CSC-associated proteins, including Goosecoid, Sox9, Slug, Snail, and CD133. Importantly, unlike several widely used antibodies to CD133, the anti-CD133 antibodies we generated recognize epitopes distal to known glycosylation sites, enabling analyses that are not confounded by differences in CD133 glycosylation. For all target proteins, we selected antibodies that yielded the expected target protein molecular weights by Western analysis and the correct subcellular localization patterns by immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA); binding selectivity was verified by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and by immunohistochemistry and IFA peptide blocking experiments. Finally, we applied these reagents to assess modulation of the respective markers of EMT and CSCs in xenograft tumor models by IFA. We observed that the constitutive presence of human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) in the tumor microenvironment of H596 non-small cell lung cancer tumors implanted in homozygous hHGF knock-in transgenic mice induced a more mesenchymal-like tumor state (relative to the epithelial-like state when implanted in control SCID mice), as evidenced by the elevated expression of EMT-associated transcription factors detected by our novel antibodies. Similarly, our new anti-CD133 antibody enabled detection and quantitation of drug-induced reductions in CD133-positive tumor cells following treatment of SUM149PT triple-negative breast cancer xenograft models with the CSC/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor VS-6063. Thus, our novel antibodies to CSC- and EMT-associated factors exhibit sufficient sensitivity and selectivity for immunofluorescence microscopy studies of these processes in preclinical xenograft tumor specimens and the potential for application with clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W2809474402,"Objectives The effects of socio-demographic and economic factors on institutional long-term care (LTC) among people with dementia remain unclear. Inconsistent findings may relate to time-varying effects of these factors as dementia progresses. To clarify the question, we estimated institutional LTC trajectories by age, marital status and household income in the eight years preceding dementia-related and non-dementia-related deaths. Methods We assessed a population-representative sample of Finnish men and women for institutional LTC over an eight-year period before death. Deaths related to dementia and all other causes at the age of 70+ in 2001–2007 were identified from the Death Register. Dates in institutional LTC were obtained from national care registers. We calculated the average and time-varying marginal effects of age, marital status and household income on the estimated probability of institutional LTC use, employing repeated-measures logistic regression models with generalised estimating equations (GEE). Results The effects of age, marital status and household income on institutional LTC varied across the time before death, and the patterns differed between dementia-related and non-dementia-related deaths. Among people who died of dementia, being of older age, non-married and having a lower income predicted a higher probability of institutional LTC only until three to four years before death, after which the differences diminished or disappeared. Among women in particular, the probability of institutional LTC was nearly equal across age, marital status and income groups in the last year before dementia-related death. Among those who died from non-dementia-related causes, in contrast, the differences widened until death. Conclusions We show that individuals with dementia require intensive professional care at the end of life, regardless of their socio-demographic or economic resources. The results imply that the potential for extending community living for people with dementia is likely to be difficult through modification of their socio-demographic and economic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2809415192,"Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are important innate pattern recognition receptors and regulators of inflammation or play a role during development. We systematically analysed 41 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 NLR genes in a Czech discovery cohort of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) (1237 cases, 787 controls) for their association with CRC risk and survival. Five SNPs were found to be associated with CRC risk and eight with survival at 5% significance level. In a replication analysis using data of two large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from Germany (DACHS: 1798 cases and 1810 controls) and Scotland (2210 cases and 9350 controls) the associations found in the Czech discovery set were not confirmed. However, expression analysis in human gut-related tissues and immune cells revealed that the NLRs associated with CRC risk or survival in the discovery set were expressed in primary human colon or rectum cells, CRC tissue and/or cell lines, providing preliminary evidence for a potential involvement of NLRs in general in CRC development and/or progression. Most interesting was the finding that the enigmatic development-related NLRP5 (also known as MATER) was not expressed in normal colon tissue but in colon cancer tissue and cell lines. Future studies may show whether regulatory variants instead of coding variants might affect the expression of NLRs and contribute to CRC risk and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2809681378,"DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic mechanism in obesity and fat distribution. We explored the Sarcospan ( SSPN) gene locus by using genome-wide data sets comprising methylation and expression data, pyrosequencing analysis in the promoter region, and genetic analysis of an SNP variant rs718314, which was previously reported to associate with waist-to-hip ratio. We found that DNA methylation influences several clinical variables related to fat distribution and glucose metabolism, while SSPN mRNA levels showed directionally opposite effects on these traits. Complete DNA methylation of the SSPN promoter construct suppressed the gene expression of firefly luciferase in MCF7 cells. Moreover, rs718314 was associated with waist and with DNA methylation at CpG sites. Our data strongly support the role of the SSPN locus in body fat composition and glucose homeostasis, and suggest that this is most likely the result of changes in DNA methylation of SSPN in adipose tissue.-Keller, M., Klös, M., Rohde, K., Krüger, J., Kurze, T., Dietrich, A., Schön, M.
