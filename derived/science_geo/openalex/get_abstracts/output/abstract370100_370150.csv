To achieve this goal it will be necessary to determine which cancers follow a cancer stem cell model and which do not, to address technical issues related to tumorigenesis assays, and to test the extent to which cancer cell heterogeneity arises from genetic versus epigenetic differences."
https://openalex.org/W2114589447,"Leptin inhibition of bone mass accrual requires the integrity of specific hypothalamic neurons but not expression of its receptor on these neurons. The same is true for its regulation of appetite and energy expenditure. This suggests that leptin acts elsewhere in the brain to achieve these three functions. We show here that brainstem-derived serotonin (BDS) favors bone mass accrual following its binding to Htr2c receptors on ventromedial hypothalamic neurons and appetite via Htr1a and 2b receptors on arcuate neurons. Leptin inhibits these functions and increases energy expenditure because it reduces serotonin synthesis and firing of serotonergic neurons. Accordingly, while abrogating BDS synthesis corrects the bone, appetite and energy expenditure phenotypes caused by leptin deficiency, inactivation of the leptin receptor in serotonergic neurons recapitulates them fully. This study modifies the map of leptin signaling in the brain and identifies a molecular basis for the common regulation of bone and energy metabolisms.For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file with the Supplemental Data available online."

The Dual-Leucine zipper Kinase MAPKKK (DLK) has been previously implicated in synaptogenesis and axon outgrowth in C. elegans and other animals. Here we show that in C. elegans DLK-1 regulates not only proper synapse formation and axon morphology but also axon regeneration by influencing mRNA stability. DLK-1 kinase signals via a MAPKAP kinase, MAK-2, to stabilize the mRNA encoding CEBP-1, a bZip protein related to CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, via its 3′UTR. Inappropriate upregulation of cebp-1 in adult neurons disrupts synapses and axon morphology. CEBP-1 and the DLK-1 pathway are essential for axon regeneration after laser axotomy in adult neurons, and axotomy induces translation of CEBP-1 in axons. Our findings identify the DLK-1 pathway as a regulator of mRNA stability in synapse formation and maintenance and also in adult axon regeneration.

Our findings identify the DLK-1 pathway as a regulator of mRNA stability in synapse formation and maintenance and also in adult axon regeneration. Neurons respond to environmental stimuli and insults in a compartmentalized manner. Local protein synthesis in dendrites and axonal growth cones has emerged as a major mechanism allowing compartmentalized responses in growth cone guidance (Piper and Holt, 2004Piper M. Holt C. RNA translation in axons.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 505-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and neuronal plasticity (Sutton and Schuman, 2005Sutton M.A. Schuman E.M. Local translational control in dendrites and its role in long-term synaptic plasticity.J. Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Several mRNAs are known to be transported and localized to growth cones or axons; transport of such mRNAs often is mediated by their 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) (Lin and Holt, 2008Lin A.C. Holt C.E. Function and regulation of local axonal translation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, it remains controversial whether mature neurons employ axonal regulation of mRNA and local protein synthesis. mRNA-binding proteins, such as Zip-code binding proteins (ZBPs) and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding proteins (CPEBs), are abundant in growing neurites but are mostly undetectable in axons and synapses of mature neurons (Brittis et al., 2002Brittis P.A.

Nonetheless, several reports suggest that axonal mRNA regulation must occur in mature neurons. In Aplysia neurons, mRNA for the peptide neurotransmitter Sensorin is concentrated at synapses upon contact with target motor neurons (Lyles et al., 2006Lyles V. Zhao Y. Martin K.C. Synapse formation and mRNA localization in cultured Aplysia neurons.Neuron. 2006; 49: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and local translation and secretion of Sensorin promote synapse maturation and plasticity (Hu et al., 2004Hu J.Y.

Synapse- and stimulus-specific local translation during long-term neuronal plasticity.Science. 2009; 324: 1536-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A number of mRNAs are upregulated in axons of injured adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (Wang et al., 2007Wang W. van Niekerk E. Willis D.E. Twiss J.L. RNA transport and localized protein synthesis in neurological disorders and neural repair.Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 1166-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Regulation of Ran GTPase via local translation of RanBP1 is implicated in retrograde signaling of axon injury (Yudin et al., 2008Yudin D. Hanz S. Yoo S. Iavnilovitch E. Willis D. Gradus T. Vuppalanchi D. Segal-Ruder Y. Ben-Yaakov K. Hieda M. et al.Localized regulation of axonal RanGTPase controls retrograde injury signaling in peripheral nerve.Neuron. 2008; 59: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Local translation thus can transmit injury signals and initiate local repair processes. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) are widely expressed basic-leucine-zipper (bZip) domain transcription factors with long-studied roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress (Ramji and Foka, 2002Ramji D.P. Foka P. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins: structure, function and regulation.Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons the transcriptional roles of C/EBP proteins have been linked to learning and memory (Alberini et al., 1994Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R.

Learning and memory tasks trigger activation of Erk or p38 kinases, leading to phosphorylation of specific C/EBP isoforms. mRNAs of murine and leech C/EBP are also upregulated following axonal injury, and murine C/EBPβ can activate the transcription of an α-tubulin gene associated with injury responses (Korneev et al., 1997Korneev S. Fedorov A. Collins R. Blackshaw S.E. Davies J.A. A subtractive cDNA library from an identified regenerating neuron is enriched in sequences up-regulated during nerve regeneration.Invert.

A transcriptional role for C/EBP beta in the neuronal response to axonal injury.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The pathways that induce C/EBP after injury are largely unknown. We have been studying the function of the conserved ubiquitin E3 ligase RPM-1 in synaptogenesis and axon formation in C. elegans. C. elegans neurons have simple unipolar or bipolar axon trajectories and form synapses en passant. For example, the ALM and PLM mechanosensory neurons have a long axon that bifurcates into a branch exclusively forming synapses and another branch transducing mechanoreception (Chalfie, 1995Chalfie M. The differentiation and function of the touch receptor neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans.Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 105: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RPM-1 regulates the organization and stabilization of presynaptic terminals and axon termination in both mechanosensory and motor neurons (Schaefer et al., 2000Schaefer A.M. Hadwiger G.D.

A major target of RPM-1 ubiquitination is the Dual-Leucine zipper Kinase DLK-1 MAPKKK, which acts in a MAPK cascade consisting of the MAPKK MKK-4 and the p38 kinase PMK-3 (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y.

By controlling the level of DLK-1, RPM-1 keeps the activity of the DLK-1 cascade at optimal levels. This negative regulation of the DLK pathway by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is conserved in Drosophila and mammalian neurons (Collins et al., 2006Collins C.A. Wairkar Y.P. Johnson S.L.

The ubiquitin ligase Phr1 regulates axon outgrowth through modulation of microtubule dynamics.Neuron. 2007; 56: 604-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The targets of the DLK-1/p38 cascade have not previously been identified. Here we report the identification of MAK-2, a member of the MAPKAP kinase family, and CEBP-1, a member of the C/EBP class of bZip factors, as effectors of the C. elegans DLK-1 cascade. MAPKAPKs are conserved Ser/Thr kinases that are direct targets of p38 and Erk kinases (Gaestel, 2006Gaestel M. MAPKAP kinases - MKs - two's company, three's a crowd.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We find that cebp-1 mRNA is destabilized by RPM-1 via the DLK-1/MAK-2 cascade, acting on the cebp-1 3′UTR. The DLK-1/MAK-2/CEBP-1 pathway is essential for regenerative regrowth of mature axons following laser axotomy, in part by regulating axonal cebp-1 mRNA stability and translation. Previous screens for suppressors of rpm-1(lf) neuronal defects uncovered many alleles of the MAPK genes dlk-1, mkk-4, and pmk-3 (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). By analyzing a large number of additional rpm-1 suppressors, we identified two new loci (see Supplemental Data available online). The suppressor mutation ju637 was mapped to a region containing mak-2, which encodes a MAP kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK) related to murine MAPKAPK2 (MK2) (Figures 1A and S1A). ju637 results in a replacement of Phe at an invariant Leu (L219) in the kinase domain (Figure 1A). Two deletion alleles of mak-2 suppressed rpm-1(lf) to a similar degree as did ju637 (Figures 1C and S1A), suggesting that all three alleles eliminate mak-2 function. A mak-2 reporter was expressed in the nervous system (Figure S1B). By expressing mak-2 under the control of neuron-type-specific promoters we found that mak-2 functions autonomously in neurons (Figures 1B and 1C). These results show that, like dlk-1, mkk-4, and pmk-3, loss of mak-2 function suppresses the synaptic and axon defects of rpm-1 mutants. mak-2 mutants did not exhibit overt neuronal or behavioral phenotypes (Figures 1B and 1C). MAPKAPKs are activated by p38-dependent phosphorylation of Thr and Ser residues (Gaestel, 2006Gaestel M. MAPKAP kinases - MKs - two's company, three's a crowd.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), two of which are conserved among all MAPKAPKs and correspond to Thr250 and Thr362 of MAK-2 (Figure 1A). In a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that MAK-2 interacted with PMK-3 (Figure S2A). This interaction was also observed in coimmunoprecipitation studies in HEK293T cells (Figure S2B), consistent with the idea that MAK-2 is a target of PMK-3. We next tested whether MAK-2 function depends on phosphorylation. Transgenes expressing a predicted nonphosphorylatable form of MAK-2, in which both Thr residues were mutated to Ala, failed to rescue suppression of rpm-1(lf) by mak-2(lf); mutation of either Thr residue partially abrogated rescuing activity (Figure 1E). In contrast, a phosphomimetic form of MAK-2, in which both Thr were mutated to Glu, caused gain-of-function defects resembling those of rpm-1(lf) mutants (Figure 1D). The AA and EE mutations did not appear to alter MAK-2 expression levels (Figure S1E). Further, a kinase-dead MAK-2(K103R) lacked rescuing activity (Figure 1E). These data suggest that MAK-2 activation via phosphorylation of the two Thr residues is critical for its function in synapse development and axon termination. We mapped the rpm-1 suppressor mutations ju659 and ju640 to the left arm of chromosome X (Figure S3A). Transgenes containing cosmid W05H7 rescued suppression of rpm-1(lf) by ju659 (not shown). We localized rescuing activity to a 7.5 kb DNA region containing the gene D1005.3, which encodes a protein of 358 aa containing a bZip domain most closely related to those of the C/EBP family (Figures 2A, S3B, and S3C) (Landschulz et al., 1988Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Isolation of a recombinant copy of the gene encoding C/EBP.Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). We refer to this gene as cebp-1. ju659 changes Arg290 to Cys and ju640 changes Ser289 to Leu in the basic region of the bZip domain (Figures 2A and S3B). Both residues are highly conserved among bZip proteins; previous studies have shown that the Arg is critical for DNA binding (Kim et al., 1993Kim J. Tzamarias D. Ellenberger T. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Adaptability at the protein-DNA interface is an important aspect of sequence recognition by bZIP proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 4513-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cebp-1(tm2807) deletion allele suppressed rpm-1(lf) to a similar degree as did ju659 (Figures 2C and S3A). Neuronal expression of cebp-1 rescued the suppression of rpm-1(lf) in a cell-autonomous manner (Figure 2C). CEBP-1 lacking the bZip domain lacked rescuing activity (Figure 2D). bZip proteins usually function as dimers, and mutations impairing DNA binding often have dominant-negative effects (Ramji and Foka, 2002Ramji D.P. Foka P. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins: structure, function and regulation.Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic overexpression of cebp-1 containing either the ju659 (R290C) or ju640 (S289L) mutation partly suppressed rpm-1(lf) defects (Figure 2E). Although ju659 and ju640 are recessive to wild-type for suppression of rpm-1, these findings suggest that both mutations may have dominant-negative activities by inhibiting either endogenous CEBP-1 or its binding partners. These data indicate that CEBP-1 acts similarly to MAK-2 and the MAP kinases in neurons. To establish the order of mak-2 and cebp-1 function in the dlk-1 pathway, we performed genetic epistasis analysis. Double mutants between null mutations in mak-2, cebp-1, or pmk-3 developed superficially normal synapses and axons (not shown). pmk-3;mak-2 or mak-2;cebp-1 double mutants suppressed the neuronal defects of rpm-1(lf) to a level comparable to that of each single mutant (Figure S4A). Overexpression of dlk-1 causes abnormal synapse development and axon termination defects resembling those of rpm-1(lf) (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This gain-of-function effect was largely eliminated in mak-2(lf) or cebp-1(lf) mutants (Figure S4B). Additionally, the gain-of-function effect of phosphomimetic mak-2(EE) in wild-type animals was suppressed by cebp-1(lf) but not by pmk-3(lf) (Figure S4B). Thus, both mak-2 and cebp-1 act downstream of the dlk-1/mkk-4/pmk-3 cascade, and cebp-1 acts downstream of mak-2 (Figure S4C). In the course of transformation rescue of cebp-1, we observed that cebp-1 transgenes lacking the 3′UTR often caused gain-of-function defects such as touch axon overextension and uncoordinated movement, reminiscent of those resulting from constitutive activation of the DLK-1 pathway (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Analysis of cebp-1 cDNAs revealed that cebp-1 transcripts contain a long 3′UTR (Figure S5A). To test whether the DLK-1 pathway might regulate cebp-1 mRNA levels, we first performed quantitative RT-PCR and found that cebp-1 mRNA was increased in rpm-1(lf) mutants compared to wild-type animals or MAP kinase mutants (Figure 3A). The increase of cebp-1 mRNA levels in rpm-1(lf) mutants was eliminated by loss of function in dlk-1, pmk-3, or mak-2 (Figure 3A), indicating that activation of the MAP kinases caused by rpm-1(lf) results in upregulation of cebp-1 mRNA. cebp-1(ju659) did not affect the increase of cebp-1 mRNA level caused by rpm-1(lf) (Figure 3A), suggesting that the effect on cebp-1 mRNA does not involve transcriptional autoregulation of cebp-1. Expression of a cebp-1 promoter reporter was unaltered in rpm-1(lf) compared to the wild-type (Figures S6A and S6B). We further compared the stability of cebp-1 mRNA by qRT-PCR on animals cultured in the presence of α-amanitin to block transcription (Sanford et al., 1983Sanford T. Golomb M. Riddle D.L. RNA polymerase II from wild type and alpha-amanitin-resistant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12804-12809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of cebp-1 mRNA was increased 3-fold in rpm-1 mutants compared to wild-type (Figure S6C). This increase in stability was abolished in dlk-1;rpm-1 animals but not in rpm-1;cebp-1 animals. We infer that RPM-1 acts via the DLK-1 pathway to regulate cebp-1 mRNA stability. To test whether the 3′UTR of cebp-1 is required for cebp-1 mRNA regulation, we expressed mCherry-tagged full-length cebp-1 with its own 3′UTR or with a heterologous 3′UTR, driven by the unc-25 promoter (Supplemental Data). In rpm-1(lf) mutants the fluorescence intensity of mCherry::CEBP-1 with the cebp-1 3′UTR was over 6-fold higher than in wild-type (Figure 3B). This increase in fluorescence intensity reflected a corresponding increase in transgene mRNA levels in rpm-1 (Figures S6D and S6E). mCherry::CEBP-1 fluorescence intensity was also significantly increased by transgenic expression of MAK-2(EE) but not MAK-2(AA) (Figure 3B). The 3′UTR of the myosin gene unc-54 is known to stabilize mRNAs (Fire et al., 1990Fire A. Harrison S.W. Dixon D. A modular set of lacZ fusion vectors for studying gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans.Gene. 1990; 93: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). However mCherry::CEBP-1 transgenes containing the unc-54 3′UTR did not show increased fluorescence intensity in rpm-1(lf) (Figure 3C). Indeed, the cebp-1 3′UTR was sufficient to confer rpm-1-dependent regulation on mCherry (Figure 3D). Transgenic expression of cebp-1 with the unc-54 3′UTR consistently caused more severe defects in motor neuron synapses (Figure 3E) and touch neuron morphology (Figure 3F) than did transgenic expression of cebp-1 with the cebp-1 3′UTR. Overexpression of cebp-1 in muscles did not generate neuronal abnormalities (Figure 3F), suggesting that regulation of cebp-1 mRNA by rpm-1 and the MAP kinases occurs in neurons. Thus, activation of the DLK-1 cascade, either by loss of function in rpm-1 or by constitutive activation of MAK-2, can stabilize the cebp-1 mRNA via its 3′UTR. We next examined localization of MAK-2 and CEBP-1 proteins in touch and motor neurons. Expression of mCherry-tagged MAK-2 or CEBP-1 in motor neurons fully rescued rpm-1 suppression phenotypes of mak-2(lf) or cebp-1(lf), respectively (Figures 1B and 2B), and did not cause overt defects in wild-type animals (Figures 4A and 4B), suggesting that the expression levels were close to physiological. mCherry::MAK-2 was consistently present in cell bodies and synapses (Figure 4A) but rarely seen in axon commissures (not shown). MAK-2 was broadly localized at motor neuron synapses and significantly colocalized with synaptobrevin/SNB-1 but not with RPM-1 (Figures 4A and S7A–S7C). Unexpectedly, mCherry::CEBP-1 was also detected at synapses, in addition to the cytoplasm and nucleus of the soma (Figure 4B). At synapses, mCherry::CEBP-1 colocalized with SNB-1, but not with RPM-1 (Figure S7D and S7E). MAK-2 and CEBP-1 partly colocalized at synapses (Figure S7F). In touch neurons, CEBP-1 was present in the soma, in the synaptic area, and at discrete regions along axons (Figure 5A).Figure 5cebp-1 Protein and mRNA Are Localized in Touch Neuron Axon and SynapsesShow full caption(A) Expression of functional GFP::CEBP-1 in touch neurons.

As RPM-1 and DLK-1 are present at synapses (Abrams et al., 2008Abrams B. Grill B. Huang X. Jin Y.

We first tested this by manipulating MAK-2 localization. As predicted, removing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) caused MAK-2 to accumulate in the somatic cytoplasm, whereas removing the nuclear export signal (NES) confined MAK-2 to the nucleus (Figure S1D). Neither manipulation affected the synaptic localization of MAK-2 (Figure S1D). Both constructs could fully rescue the rpm-1 suppression phenotype of mak-2(lf) (Figure 1E). Phosphomimetic MAK-2(EE), which causes abnormalities in synapses, was also localized at synapses but excluded from the nucleus (Figure S1E). These data suggest that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may not affect MAK-2 synaptic function and that activated MAK-2 might function at synapses. We therefore attempted to target activated MAK-2(EE) to motor neuron synapses by tagging MAK-2 with the PHR domain from RPM-1, which can target GFP to synapses (Abrams et al., 2008Abrams B. Grill B. Huang X. Jin Y. Cellular and molecular determinants targeting the Caenorhabditis elegans PHR protein RPM-1 to perisynaptic regions.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). mCherry::PHR::MAK-2 was concentrated at synapses, adjacent to SNB-1::GFP, and weakly detected in the somatic cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus (Figure 4C). Synaptic targeting of activated MAK-2(EE), but not of wild-type MAK-2 or inactive MAK-2(AA), disrupted presynaptic morphology to a degree similar to those caused by untargeted MAK-2(EE) (Figures 4D and 4E). These results suggest that, in addition to possible roles in the soma and nucleus, MAK-2 function may be regulated at synapses. The above observations raised the possibility that cebp-1 mRNA might be localized at synapses. To test this, we used an in vivo mRNA imaging method based on the high-affinity binding of the coat protein of the MS2 bacteriophage to a 19 nucleotide RNA stem-loop structure (Bernardi and Spahr, 1972Bernardi A. Spahr P.F. Nucleotide sequence at the binding site for coat protein on RNA of bacteriophage R17.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1972; 69: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Bertrand et al., 1998Bertrand E. Chartrand P. Schaefer M. Shenoy S.M. Singer R.H. Long R.M. Localization of ASH1 mRNA particles in living yeast.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). GFP::NLS::MS2 fluorescence was observed in cell bodies and only faintly along the axons of touch neurons and motor neurons (Figures 5B, S8A, and S8B). As background fluorescence of GFP::NLS::MS2 in touch neuron axons was much lower than in motor neurons, we focused on cebp-1 mRNA in the touch neurons. Upon coexpression of cebp-1 mRNA containing six copies of the MS2-binding site in the 3′UTR, we detected punctate GFP::NLS::MS2 fluorescence along axons and at synapses (Figures 5B, S8A, and S8B). A control reporter containing MS2-binding sites in the unc-54 3′UTR did not cause an increase of GFP::NLS::MS2 in axons (Figure 5B). The intensity of GFP::NLS::MS2 in axons was further increased in rpm-1(lf) mutants and reduced in dlk-1(lf) mutants (Figures 5B and 5C). The half-lives of the transgenic MS2-binding site-tagged cebp-1 transcripts were similar to those of endogenous cebp-1 mRNA and were likewise increased in rpm-1 mutants (Figure S8C). We also saw GFP::NLS::MS2 fluorescence increase in the synaptic regions of the motor neurons upon coexpression with MS2-binding site-tagged cebp-1 mRNA (Figure S8A). These findings suggest that cebp-1 mRNAs may be present in axons and presynaptic regions, and that activation of the DLK-1 cascade could locally stabilize cebp-1 mRNA. Our observations that MAK-2 and CEBP-1 are present at synapses of adult neurons raised the possibility that this pathway may also act in adults. To test this, we examined the effects of acute adult overexpression of cebp-1 on synaptic morphology, exploiting the temperature-sensitive splicing of a mec-2 intron (Poon et al., 2008Poon V.Y. Klassen M.P. Shen K. UNC-6/netrin and its receptor UNC-5 locally exclude presynaptic components from dendrites.Nature."

Here, we show that high-fat diet can increase NF-κB activation in mice, which leads to a sustained elevation in level of IκB kinase ɛ (IKKɛ) in liver, adipocytes, and adipose tissue macrophages. IKKɛ knockout mice are protected from high-fat diet-induced obesity, chronic inflammation in liver and fat, hepatic steatosis, and whole-body insulin resistance. These mice show increased energy expenditure and thermogenesis via enhanced expression of the uncoupling protein UCP1. They maintain insulin sensitivity in liver and fat, without activation of the proinflammatory JNK pathway. Gene expression analyses indicate that IKKɛ knockout reduces expression of inflammatory cytokines, and changes expression of certain regulatory proteins and enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Thus, IKKɛ may represent an attractive therapeutic target for obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and other complications associated with these disorders.

Despite strong evidence for an inflammatory link between obesity and diabetes, the primary site or sites at which the inflammatory response occurs has not yet been established. Adipose tissue responds to overnutrition by secreting cytokines or chemokines that recruit proinflammatory, M1 polarized macrophages to adipose tissue (Lumeng et al., 2007bLumeng C.N. Deyoung S.M. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Increased inflammatory properties of adipose tissue macrophages recruited during diet-induced obesity.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). These in turn secrete more cytokines that attenuate insulin action in adipocytes, resulting in increased lipolysis and free fatty acid release (Feingold et al., 1992Feingold K.R. Doerrler W. Dinarello C.A. Fiers W. Grunfeld C.

Tumor necrosis factor increases the rate of lipolysis in primary cultures of adipocytes without altering levels of hormone-sensitive lipase.Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the molecular details underlying macrophage recruitment and activation, the subtypes involved, their crosstalk with muscle, fat and liver cells, and the manner by which they regulate energy expenditure and storage remain uncertain. Here, we report that high-fat diet induces the expression of the NF-κB target IKKɛ in both liver and white adipose tissue, and further that mice bearing a targeted deletion of IKKɛ are surprisingly protected from diet-induced obesity, liver and adipose inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance, providing an appealing therapeutic target for obesity and type 2 diabetes. While NF-κB activation has been implicated in obesity, the range of tissues involved is unknown. We analyzed the effect of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on transgenic mice engineered with a luciferase construct driven by an NF-κB-responsive promoter (HLL mice) (Sadikot et al., 2001Sadikot R.T. Jansen E.D. Blackwell T.R. Zoia O. Yull F. Christman J.W. Blackwell T.S. High-dose dexamethasone accentuates nuclear factor-kappa b activation in endotoxin-treated mice.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After injection with a luciferin substrate, high-fat diet (HFD)-fed HLL mice demonstrated an approximate 2-fold increase in abdominal luminescence compared to chow-fed controls (Figure 1A). The reporter was activated 5-fold in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue after HFD; this activation persisted after correction for tissue weight (Figures 1B, 1C, and Figure S1A available with this article online). Less pronounced transgene activation was seen in the liver, kidney and quadriceps muscle. Surprisingly, NF-κB transgene activation was similar in both subcutaneous and visceral fat depots, suggesting that the documented inflammatory differences between these depots may be independent of NF-κB. It has been proposed that obesity-induced inflammation is chronic and low-grade compared to other inflammatory stimuli (Hotamisligil, 2006Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammation and metabolic disorders.Nature. 2006; 444: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (5602) Google Scholar, Shoelson et al., 2007Shoelson S.E. Herrero L. Naaz A.

Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammation, stress, and diabetes.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar). We compared the degree of NF-κB activation in normal chow and HFD HLL mice before and after injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Figure S1B). For all tissues examined (except muscle), LPS injection activated the transgene far above basal levels, supporting the notion that NF-κB activation is sub-maximally but chronically activated in obesity. We performed immunohistochemical analyses in adipose tissue of HLL mice on control and HFD (Figure 1D). The luciferase reporter was specifically enriched in adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) clusters and adipocytes in epididymal fat pads from only HFD mice. NF-κB expression (RelA/p65) was also more concentrated in the nuclei of F4/80+ ATM clusters by immunofluorescence in HFD mice, while the protein remained cytoplasmic in macrophages from chow-fed mice (Figure 1E). We measured the expression of the gene encoding the inducible IKK family member IKKɛ in liver and white adipose tissue by real-time PCR and then compared this to the levels of other IKKs. HFD produced a small increase in the expression of IKKα, β, and TBK1 in liver, but it produced a 2.6-fold increase in IKKɛ mRNA (Figure 2A). In white adipose tissue (WAT), IKKα was slightly reduced, whereas HFD increased IKKβ 1.7-fold, and IKKɛ and TBK1 by 12- and 9-fold, respectively. To determine the cell types in adipose tissue responsible for these changes, we separated by centrifugation adipocytes from the SVF. HFD produced a 2- to 3-fold increase in expression of IKKα, IKKβ and TBK1 mRNA in adipocytes, whereas IKKɛ expression was increased up to 28-fold (Figure 2B). However, only IKKɛ was upregulated in SVF isolated from WAT, although the number of macrophages in adipose tissue was also significantly increased (Weisberg et al., 2003Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. Obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2003Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. Chronic inflammation in fat plays a crucial role in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). We also performed immunohistochemistry by confocal microscopy (Lumeng et al., 2007bLumeng C.N. Deyoung S.M. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Increased inflammatory properties of adipose tissue macrophages recruited during diet-induced obesity.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). WAT from control diet-fed mice exhibited M2 polarized, MGL1+ ATMs (Lumeng et al., 2007aLumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Obesity induces a phenotypic switch in adipose tissue macrophage polarization.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (2970) Google Scholar), whereas HFD produced increased infiltration of M1 polarized, MGL1- macrophages, detected in crown-like structures (Figure 2C). While IKKɛ was barely detected in adipose tissue from control mice, the protein was observed in adipocytes and MGL1-, F4/80+, but not MGL1+ ATMs in adipose tissue from HFD mice. Thus, HFD induction of IKKɛ occurred mainly in M1, but not M2-polarized ATMs, although it remains uncertain whether diet produces an increase in expression of the kinase in proinflammatory M1 ATMs or rather reflects the different activation state of these cells. We also monitored IKKɛ protein levels by western blotting (Figure 2D). IKKɛ expression was low in liver or WAT from wild-type mice on a chow diet, but was markedly increased in both tissues after HFD, correlating well with RNA levels. Interestingly, none of the other IKK isoforms were upregulated in IKKɛ KO mice, suggesting that no compensation occurred (Table S1). IKKɛ kinase activity increased by 3.7-fold and 1.5-fold in liver and WAT from HFD mice (Figure 2E). Treatment of COS cells overexpressing IKKɛ with LPS produced a time-dependent increase in activity (Supplementary Figure 2). The increased expression of IKKɛ after HFD led us to wonder if this protein represented a link between obesity and insulin resistance. We therefore evaluated mice with a targeted deletion in the IKKɛ gene (Tenoever et al., 2007Tenoever B.R. Ng S.L. Chua M.A. McWhirter S.M. Garcia-Sastre A. Maniatis T. Multiple functions of the IKK-related kinase IKKepsilon in interferon-mediated antiviral immunity.Science. 2007; 315: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). On normal chow, weights, circulating levels of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids did not differ significantly between IKKɛ KO mice and their wild-type counterparts, although triglycerides were lower and fasting insulin levels slightly higher in KO mice (Table 1). However, after exposure for 3 months to HFD, wild-type controls gained near 20 g, whereas IKKɛ KO mice gained only 12 g (Figures 3A and S3). Body weight and percentage of lean and fat mass was similar between wild-type and IKKɛ KO mice on chow (Table S2). HFD increased lean and fat mass in wild-type mice, with a statistically smaller increase in KO mice. HFD produced a large increase in liver weight in control but not in KO mice (Figure S4). Adipocytes from IKKɛ KO mice were significantly smaller than those from wild-type mice on HFD (Figures 3B and 3C), although there was a 10%–15% increase in the number of cells in the epididymal fat pad (Figure 3D). Together these data suggest that deletion of the IKKɛ gene prevents the increase in liver mass induced by high-fat diet, and maintains adipose tissue mass by increasing adipogenesis, reflected by more, smaller fat cells.Table 1Metabolic Parameters of Wild-Type and IKKɛ-KO Mice in Normal DietParametersWild-TypeIKKɛ KOP ValueBody weight (g)32.02 ± 0.9032.71 ± 0.580.525Glucose (mg/dL)159.3 ± 5.2144.0 ± 11.20.26Insulin (pg/ml)619.3 ± 89.2916.4 ± 96.20.051NEFA (mM)0.969 ± 0.0770.840 ± 0.0370.175Triglyceride (mg/dL)50.39 ± 3.1340.49 ± 2.310.03∗Cholesterol (mg/dL)82.5 ± 3.2478.2 ± 2.020.292 Open table in a new tab While no differences were detected in mice on a chow diet, the serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in KO mice on HFD compared to wild-type controls (Figure S5A). As previously reported (Kadowaki et al., 2006Kadowaki T. Yamauchi T. Kubota N. Hara K. Ueki K. Tobe K. Adiponectin and adiponectin receptors in insulin resistance, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar), adiponectin levels per body weight were decreased by approximately 33% in wild-type mice after HFD. Interestingly, this HFD-induced decrease was almost completely prevented in IKKɛ KO mice. HFD increased serum leptin levels by 8.5-fold in wild-type mice (Figure S5B), while leptin levels were approximately 40% lower in IKKɛ KO mice exposed to normal chow or HFD, probably reflecting smaller adipocyte size and increased leptin sensitivity. Body weight represents a net balance of food intake and energy expenditure. IKKɛ KO mice showed higher daily food intake per body weight compared to wild-type mice, either on chow or HFD (Figure 3E), perhaps due to lower circulating leptin levels. O2 consumption was similar in both wild-type and IKKɛ KO mice on a chow diet (Figure 3F). Wild-type mice on HFD showed little change in O2 consumption, whereas IKKɛ KO mice demonstrated a significant increase. This difference was consistent throughout light and dark phases, indicating an increase in energy expenditure. We also compared the respiratory quotient (RQ = VCO2/VO2), as a measure of fuel-partitioning patterns. RQ fluctuated between 0.85 and 1.0 in mice on a chow diet, and fluctuated between 0.8 and 0.9 in mice on HFD for both genotypes (Figure 3G). The lack of effect of IKKɛ KO on RQ suggested that there was no difference in fuel selection between carbohydrates and lipids, leading us to explore whether the increase in energy expenditure might occur secondarily to increased thermogenesis, and we thus evaluated the expression of uncoupling proteins (Figure 3H). In chow-fed mice, UCP1 mRNA was barely detectable in WAT from wild-type or IKKɛ KO mice. HFD produced a 2-fold increase in UCP1 mRNA in wild-type mice, but generated a 10-fold increase in KO mice. UCP1 protein levels in WAT of KO mice on HFD were similarly higher. The expression of UCP2 was similar between wild-type and KO mice on either diet (Figure S6A), and UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in brown fat were unchanged (Figure S6B). A significant increase in body temperature was also noted in IKKɛ KO mice (Figure 3I). IKKɛ KO mice were 1.5°C warmer than their wild-type counterparts on HFD, with a smaller 0.5°C increase seen under chow-fed conditions. However, there was no apparent increase in the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis proteins in muscle, WAT or BAT in IKKɛ KO mice (Figure S6C). Because IKKɛ KO mice were protected from DIO, we investigated whether this gene might play a role in glucose homeostasis. As mentioned above, chronic exposure to HFD increased fasting glucose and insulin levels in wild-type but not KO mice (Figure 4A). IKKɛ KO mice exhibited reduced fasting serum free fatty acid and cholesterol levels on HFD (Figure 4B), but were similar to wild-types regarding fasting serum triglyceride levels. We performed intraperitoneal (IP) glucose and insulin tolerance tests after 3 months of chow or HFD (Figures 4C and 4D). While wild-type mice were glucose intolerant on HFD, IKKɛ KO mice maintained normal glucose tolerance and lower insulin levels. Although there were no differences detected between the genotypes on a normal diet, HFD IKKɛ KO mice were more sensitive to IP injection of insulin (Figure 4E) and pyruvate (Figure 4F) compared to wild-type controls. To investigate the mechanisms by which targeted disruption of the IKKɛ gene protects mice from the deleterious effects of HFD, we investigated insulin signaling in liver, fat and muscle ex vivo. In liver from both wild-type and IKKɛ KO mice fed a normal chow diet, insulin injection stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Figure S7A). While HFD produced a blunted insulin response in wild-type mice (Khamzina et al., 2005Khamzina L. Veilleux A. Bergeron S. Marette A. Increased activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in liver and skeletal muscle of obese rats: possible involvement in obesity-linked insulin resistance.Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), the IKKɛ KO mice exhibited normal insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Figure 5A). Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was similarly reduced in WAT after HFD in wild-type but not KO mice (Figure 5B), but was similar between genotypes in gastrocnemius muscle (Figure 5C). The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, and levels of IRS-1 were similarly restored in KO mice in liver and fat, but not muscle (Figure S7B), suggesting that IKKɛ may be a local negative regulator of insulin signaling. Indeed, HFD had no effect on the expression of IKKɛ in muscle (data not shown). Hepatic gene expression microarray analyses showed significant differences between IKKɛ KO and wild-type controls on HFD in levels of mRNA encoding several proteins (Table S3), including two genes involved in glucose homeostasis, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4) (Figure 5D) and glucokinase (Figure 5E), with smaller changes in fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase and malate dehydrogenase. Interestingly, there was little if any change observed in pyruvate kinase, PEPCK or glucose-6-phosphatase mRNAs (Figure S8). The reduction in PDK4 and increase in glucokinase could produce increased flux of glucose through glycolysis, and may account for the improvement in pyruvate tolerance and the reduced level of free fatty acids observed in IKKɛ KO mice. In addition to direct effects on hepatic gene expression, the increased hepatic insulin sensitivity in IKKɛ KO mice might also occur secondarily to increased circulating levels of adiponectin, which correlates inversely with insulin resistance (Kadowaki et al., 2006Kadowaki T. Yamauchi T. Kubota N. Hara K. Ueki K. Tobe K. Adiponectin and adiponectin receptors in insulin resistance, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). Adiponectin mRNA was reduced in WAT from HFD wild-type but not KO mice (Figure 5F), correlating well with circulating levels (Supplementary Figure 5A). Because adiponectin is regulated by the activity of PPARγ (Semple et al., 2006Semple R.K. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. PPAR gamma and human metabolic disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), we also examined whether PPARγ expression is induced in KO mice. PPARγ mRNA and protein levels in WAT were reduced by HFD in wild-type mice, but elevated in IKKɛ KO mice (Figure 5G). The PPARγ-regulated genes CD36, CAP and GLUT4 were also upregulated in adipocytes from these mice, as were the encoded proteins (Figure 5H), further indicating that PPARγ activity is increased in adipose tissue from these mice. Recent studies showed that lipin1 directly interacts with PPARγ and increases its transcriptional activity (Koh et al., 2008Koh Y.K. Lee M.Y. Kim J.W. Kim M. Moon J.S. Lee Y.J. Ahn Y.H. Kim K.S. Lipin1 is a key factor for the maturation and maintenance of adipocytes in the regulatory network with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2.J.

IKKɛ KO mice expressed nearly 2-fold greater levels of lipin1 mRNA and protein compared to control mice on HFD (Figure S9), providing a clue to the improved insulin responsiveness in adipose tissue of the KO mice. We next measured the insulin sensitivity of isolated adipocytes in vitro by assaying rates of lipogenesis at low concentrations of glucose, as a surrogate for glucose transport (Lesniewski et al., 2007Lesniewski L.A. Hosch S.E. Neels J.G. de Luca C. Pashmforoush M. Lumeng C.N. Chiang S.H. Scadeng M. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Bone marrow-specific Cap gene deletion protects against high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Adipocytes derived from wild-type mice on a control diet responded to insulin with 2-fold increase in lipogenesis (Figure 5I), but those from HFD mice were almost completely unresponsive to insulin. In contrast, adipocytes isolated from IKKɛ KO mice on HFD remained insulin responsive. To determine whether the resistance of adipocytes from IKKɛ KO mice to the deleterious effects of high-fat diet is cell autonomous, we mimicked the HFD-induced expression of IKKɛ by overexpressing the enzyme in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and then assayed for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Min et al., 1999Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E.

Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Figure 5J). Insulin produced a 10-fold increase in glucose transport in these cells. Transfection of cells with wild-type IKKɛ reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 50%, whereas the expression of kinase-dead IKKɛ mutant produced only a small inhibitory effect. No significant differences in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor or IRS-1 were detected (Figure S10), suggesting that IKKɛ overexpression did not directly influence this signaling pathway. These data, along with the changes in the expression of CAP (Ribon et al., 1998Ribon V. Johnson J.H. Camp H.S. Saltiel A.R.

Chronic exposure of mice to HFD causes enlarged liver mass and accumulation of lipids, leading to fatty liver (steatosis) (Bradbury, 2006Bradbury M.W. Lipid metabolism and liver inflammation. I.

Girard J. Contribution of de novo fatty acid synthesis to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance: lessons from genetically engineered mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). HFD increased liver mass in wild-type controls but not in IKKɛ KO mice (Figure 6A). The absence of steatosis in KO mice was apparent from examination of the liver, which was considerably darker than that of the wild-type counterparts (Figure 6B). The triglyceride content of livers from IKKɛ KO mice was significantly lower than those of wild-type mice after HFD, either in fed or fasted conditions (Figure 6C). Additionally, high-fat diet caused abundant macrosteatosis in wild-type but not KO livers, as visualized by H-E staining (Figure 6D), correlating well with reduced hepatic triglycerides. Excessive fat accumulation in the liver can occur as a result of increased fat delivery or synthesis, reduced oxidation, and/or reduced fat export in the form of VLDL (Postic and Girard, 2008Postic C.

Interestingly, we did not detect significant differences between wild-type and KO mice in the expression of lipogenic enzymes, including FAS, ACC1, and Scd1, or those involved in beta-oxidation, including Acox1, Acad1, CPT1a, and MCAD, although all of these genes showed the expected response to nutritional status (Figure S11).

Here we report that srGAP2 negatively regulates neuronal migration and induces neurite outgrowth and branching through the ability of its F-BAR domain to induce filopodia-like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by I-BAR domains in vivo and in vitro. Previous work has suggested that in nonneuronal cells filopodia dynamics decrease the rate of cell migration and the persistence of leading edge protrusions. srGAP2 knockdown reduces leading process branching and increases the rate of neuronal migration in vivo. Overexpression of srGAP2 or its F-BAR domain has the opposite effects, increasing leading process branching and decreasing migration.

During brain development, neural progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, and differentiation require considerable changes in cell shape involving coordinated cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling (Ayala et al., 2007Ayala R.

Neuronal migration involves the coordinated extension and adhesion of the leading process (LP) along the radial glial scaffold with the forward translocation of the nucleus, which requires regulation of centrosome and microtubule dynamics by proteins such as Lis1, Doublecortin, and Nudel among others (Ayala et al., 2007Ayala R.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane dynamics during neuronal migration and morphogenesis. The basis of neurite initiation, outgrowth, and branching is rooted in the ability of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton to undergo dynamic changes (Gupton and Gertler, 2007Gupton S.L.

Downregulation of the actin anti-cappers ENA/VASP proteins, which are potent inducers of filopodia, resulted in failed neurite initiation and also in defects in cortical lamination (Kwiatkowski et al., 2007Kwiatkowski A.V. Rubinson D.A. Dent E.W. Edward van Veen J. Leslie J.D. Zhang J. Mebane L.M. Philippar U. Pinheiro E.M.

Classically, filopodia formation is thought to be primarily dependent on proteins that regulate actin polymerization at the barbed end of actin filaments and proteins bundling F-actin (Gupton and Gertler, 2007Gupton S.L. Gertler F.B. Filopodia: the fingers that do the walking.Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the BAR superfamily member IRSp53 has been shown to induce filopodia through membrane deformation independently of its F-actin bundling activity (Lim et al., 2008Lim K.B. Bu W.

The BAR domain superfamily contains three main groups: (1) the Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain subfamily (Itoh and De Camilli, 2006Itoh T. De Camilli P.

In addition to sharing the general fold and quaternary organization of the BAR domain superfamily, F-BAR domains share functional properties with “classical” BAR domains, most notably the ability to bind and deform membranes in vitro and in living cells (Frost et al., 2008Frost A.

However, to date, the in vivo functions of F-BAR domain-containing proteins are largely unknown (Frost et al., 2009Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. The BAR domain superfamily: membrane-molding macromolecules.Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Here we identify slit-robo GTPase activating protein (srGAP2) as a regulator of neuronal migration and morphogenesis through the unexpected ability of its N-terminal F-BAR domain to induce filopodia-like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by I-BAR domains. Our results highlight the functional importance of proteins directly regulating membrane deformation for proper neuronal migration and axon-dendrite morphogenesis. To begin our study of the role of srGAP2 in cortical development, we first examined its pattern of expression. srGAP1–3 have recently been reported to be expressed throughout the cortex during and after radial migration (Bacon et al., 2009Bacon C. Endris V. Rappold G. Dynamic expression of the Slit-Robo GTPase activating protein genes during development of the murine nervous system.J. Comp.

Regulated shuttling of Slit-Robo-GTPase activating proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm during brain development.Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2008; 28: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our analysis confirmed that srGAP2 mRNA is expressed throughout the developing cortex and is found both in proliferative zones (ventricular zone [VZ] and subventricular zone [SVZ]) at embryonic day 13 (E13) and E15 and in postmitotic regions (cortical plate [CP]) at E15 and postnatal day 1 (P1) (Figure 1A). In order to determine the pattern of srGAP2 protein expression, we used a polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of srGAP2 (Figures 1B and 1C; Yao et al., 2008Yao Q. Jin W.L. Wang Y. Ju G. Regulated shuttling of Slit-Robo-GTPase activating proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm during brain development.Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2008; 28: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). srGAP2 protein is expressed throughout cortical development culminating at P1 corresponding to the peak of neuronal migration in the cortex. Its expression is maintained at P15 and reduced, but still present, in adult cortex (Figure 1C). Immunofluorescent staining for srGAP2 shows that it is ubiquitously expressed in the cortical wall (Figure 1D) being found both in Nestin-positive neuronal progenitors in the VZ (Figures 1H–1J) and MAP2-positive postmitotic neurons in the CP (Figures 1E–1G). At the subcellular level, endogenous srGAP2 is found at the cell periphery (Figures 1K–1M, arrows) and was often localized along F-actin-rich filopodia-like protrusions (arrowhead in Figures 1K–1P) in acutely dissociated E15 cortical neurons. Overexpression of F-BAR domain-containing proteins such as FBP17 or CIP4 have been shown to cause membrane invagination and tubulation in cell lines (Itoh et al., 2005Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton cooperatively regulate plasma membrane invagination by BAR and F-BAR proteins.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, Tsujita et al., 2006Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Sasaki N. Furutani M. Oikawa T. Takenawa T. Coordination between the actin cytoskeleton and membrane deformation by a novel membrane tubulation domain of PCH proteins is involved in endocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, expression of srGAP2 did not induce any membrane invaginations but instead induced filopodia formation (see Figures S1D–S1F and S1P available online). This effect requires its F-BAR domain since deletion of the F-BAR domain (srGAP2ΔF-BAR-EGFP) does not induce filopodia formation in COS7 cells (Figures S1G–S1I and S1P). Interestingly, unlike the F-BAR domains of FBP17 and CIP4 (Itoh et al., 2005Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton cooperatively regulate plasma membrane invagination by BAR and F-BAR proteins.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), expression of the F-BAR domain of srGAP2 did not inhibit endocytosis, as assessed using Alexa546-Transferrin uptake assay (Figure S2). Furthermore, expression of the isolated F-BAR domain fused to EGFP induced filopodia formation similar to full-length srGAP2 (Figures S1J, S1K, and S1P). Of note, the F-BAR domain is a potent membrane-targeting motif (Figure S1J). These data suggest that the F-BAR domain of srGAP2 is necessary and sufficient for membrane localization and the induction of filopodia-like membrane protrusions. In order to distinguish the membrane-targeting function of the F-BAR domain from its membrane deformation activity, we identified a small truncation of the last C-terminal 49 amino acids (F-BARΔ49) (Figure S3A and Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Expression of F-BARΔ49-EGFP results in significant membrane targeting (Figure S4) but fails to induce filopodia in COS7 cells (Figures S1M–S1P). We do not currently know the structural basis for the inability of this truncation to elicit filopodia but we can at least exclude two possibilities: (1) instability of the F-BARΔ49 protein since it expresses at a level comparable to full-length srGAP2 or its F-BAR domain in cells (Figure S5) and (2) this truncation does not disrupt its dimerization properties since F-BARΔ49 can dimerize with F-BAR or full-length srGAP2 (data not shown). Interestingly, these 49 amino acids reside in an extension specific to the srGAP subfamily (α6–8; Figure S3A) that is C-terminal to the minimal, predicted F-BAR domain (amino acids 1–358; Itoh et al., 2005Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton cooperatively regulate plasma membrane invagination by BAR and F-BAR proteins.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) (Figure S3B). Indeed, we were unable to obtain stable protein expression of this minimal predicted F-BAR domain (amino acids 1–358) in mammalian cells or bacteria (data not shown). Furthermore, as shown for other F-BAR domains (Frost et al., 2008Frost A. Perera R. Roux A. Spasov K. Destaing O. Egelman E.H. De Camilli P. Unger V.M.

Altogether, these data suggest that all eight predicted α helices are likely to be required for formation of the functional F-BAR domain of srGAP2. The ability of srGAP2 or its F-BAR domain to induce filopodia in COS7 cells is reminiscent of the activity of the structurally related I-BAR domain-containing proteins (Mattila et al., 2007Mattila P.K.

Interestingly, F-actin depolymerization prevents the dynamics and formation of new filopodia but does not affect the maintenance of preexisting filopodia induced by the I-BAR domains of IRSp53 or MIM (Mattila et al., 2007Mattila P.K.

Strikingly, this treatment had no effect on membrane localization of the F-BAR domain or on the maintenance of filopodia-like protrusions (Figures 2D–2F). F-BAR-induced filopodia were highly dynamic in COS7 cells (Figures 2G–2J and Movie S1). Treatment with cytochalasin D significantly impaired the extension and retraction of F-BAR-induced filopodia (Figures 2K–2N and Movie S2), suggesting that F-actin is required for the dynamics of these protrusions. In order to directly test the membrane deformation properties of the F-BAR domain of srGAP2, we incubated purified F-BAR domain with preformed liposomes. As visualized by negative stain transmission electron microscopy, this did not result in liposome outward tubulation as has been reported for other F-BAR domains (see Figure S5B). Rather, the F-BAR domain of srGAP2 induced an inward dimpling or “scalloping” of the liposome surface (Figures 2O and 2P), which is reminiscent of the activity of I-BAR domains in the same conditions (Suetsugu et al., 2006Suetsugu S. Murayama K. Sakamoto A. Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Seto A. Oikawa T. Mishima C. Shirouzu M. Takenawa T. Yokoyama S. The RAC binding domain/IRSp53-MIM homology domain of IRSp53 induces RAC-dependent membrane deformation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35347-35358Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that the F-BAR domain of srGAP2 can induce “inverse” membrane tubulation. These results suggested the possibility that if the purified F-BAR domain of srGAP2 could be exposed to the inside surface of liposomes, then protrusive tubules would form (Figure 2Q). To test this hypothesis, mixtures of the F-BAR domain with intact, large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were briefly sonicated, which presumably resulted in transient pore formation in liposomes and introduction of the recombinant F-BAR inside LUVs. Following a wash, liposomes were fixed, negatively stained, and imaged using transmission electron microscopy. As predicted by the I-BAR model, this resulted in numerous long tubular extensions emerging from LUVs (Figure 2R), which is in stark contrast with control sonicated liposomes not incubated with recombinant protein (Figure S6A). Consistent with the dimensions of tubules induced by other members of the F-BAR and I-BAR families (Frost et al., 2008Frost A. Perera R. Roux A. Spasov K. Destaing O. Egelman E.H. De Camilli P.

Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the srGAP2 F-BAR-induced tubules were 83 nm ± 15 nm (average ± SD, n = 38) in diameter. Importantly, at higher magnification, the tubules observed by negative staining electron microscopy after sonication do not have an obvious protein coat surrounding the liposomes (Figure 2R). This is in contrast with tubules induced by other F-BAR and BAR domains that coat the outer surface of the tubule (Figure S6B; Frost et al., 2008Frost A. Perera R. Roux A. Spasov K. Destaing O.

Together, these results suggest that unlike previously characterized F-BAR domains, the F-BAR domain of srGAP2 functions as an I-BAR domain (Mattila et al., 2007Mattila P.K. Pykalainen A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 35347-35358Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We next tested the function of srGAP2 in neuronal morphogenesis by designing short hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) in order to acutely knock down srGAP2 expression (Figure 3A). We found that srGAP2 knockdown in E15 cortical neurons led to a significant decrease in both axonal (Figures 3C, 3D, and 3F) and dendritic branching after 5 days in vitro (DIV) (Figures 3G, 3H, and 3J). Both of these effects were rescued by cotransfection of a shRNA-resistant form of srGAP2 (srGAP2∗; Figures 3B, 3E, 3F, 3I, and 3J), demonstrating that this is not an off-target effect. The fact that srGAP2 knockdown reduced branching in cortical neurons, a process previously shown to require filopodia formation (Dent et al., 2004Dent E.W. Barnes A.M. Tang F. Kalil K. Netrin-1 and semaphorin 3A promote or inhibit cortical axon branching, respectively, by reorganization of the cytoskeleton.J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5403-5414PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that srGAP2 may promote neurite branching through its ability to induce filopodia in neurons. To test this hypothesis, we performed a structure/function analysis using electroporation of E15 cortical progenitors with various srGAP2 constructs followed by dissociation and culture, which induces rapid differentiation. First, we restricted our analysis to stage 1 neurons (Dotti et al., 1988Dotti C.G. Sullivan C.A. Banker G.A. The establishment of polarity by hippocampal neurons in culture.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1454-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), when immature postmitotic neurons produce a significant number of filopodia-like protrusions (Dent et al., 2007Dent E.W. Kwiatkowski A.V. Mebane L.M. Philippar U. Barzik M. Rubinson D.A. Gupton S. Van Veen J.E. Furman C. Zhang J. et al.Filopodia are required for cortical neurite initiation.Nat.

Burds A.A. et al.Ena/VASP Is Required for neuritogenesis in the developing cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 441-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our analysis shows that expression of full-length srGAP2 induced a significant increase in filopodia-like protrusions in stage 1 cortical neurons compared to control EGFP (Figures 4A–4C and 4F). This effect requires the F-BAR domain since deletion of the F-BAR domain (srGAP2ΔF-BAR) significantly reduced the ability of srGAP2 to induce filopodia in stage 1 neurons (Figures 4C and 4F). As in COS7 cells, expression of the F-BAR domain alone potently induces formation of F-actin-rich filopodia (Figures 4D and 4F). Again, the effect of the F-BAR domain requires its membrane deformation properties and not simply its membrane targeting property since expression of F-BARΔ49 does not induce filopodia in stage 1 cortical neurons (Figures 4E and 4F) and instead induces large lamellipodia (arrowhead in Figure 4E). These data suggest that s"

Two major complexes, Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2), are thought to mediate PcG-dependent repression in flies and mammals. In Drosophila, PcG/trxG protein complexes are recruited by PcG/trxG response elements (PREs). However, it has been unclear how PcG/trxG are recuited in vertebrates. Here we have identified a vertebrate PRE, PRE-kr, that regulates expression of the mouse MafB/Kreisler gene. PRE-kr recruits PcG proteins in flies and mouse F9 cells and represses gene expression in a PcG/trxG-dependent manner. PRC1 and 2 bind to a minimal PRE-kr region, which can recruit stable PRC1 binding but only weak PRC2 binding when introduced ectopically, suggesting that PRC1 and 2 have different binding requirements. Thus, we provide evidence that similar to invertebrates, PREs act as entry sites for PcG/trxG chromatin remodeling in vertebrates.

Chromatin remodeling mediated by Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) complexes acts to stabilize transcriptional states of cells and plays key roles in development, stem cell pluripotency, and cancer. Seminal studies in Drosophila suggested that PcG proteins act to maintain silenced transcriptional states and trxG proteins promote expression by keeping specific enhancers accessible (Grimaud et al., 2006Grimaud C.

PcG and trxG proteins are highly conserved between flies and mammals, but sometimes their roles in mammals may be counter to those in Drosophila. For example, some trxG brahma-related proteins act primarily as repressors in mammalian ES cells (Ho et al., 2009Ho L. Jothi R. Ronan J.L. Cui K. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R.

In Drosophila, most known PcG and trxG genes encode chromatin-associated proteins, which bind as complexes to specific DNA elements, known collectively as PcG/trxG response elements (PREs). Whereas genome-wide profiling of PcG targets suggests that mammalian PREs exist, so far PREs have been functionally validated only in the fly (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J.

The core components of the two major polycomb complexes, the Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2), are highly conserved (Levine et al., 2002Levine S.S. Weiss A. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6070-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). PRC2 core subunits are present in animals and plants, whereas those of PRC1 are present in flies, C. elegans, and vertebrates (Karakuzu et al., 2009Karakuzu O. Wang D.P. Cameron S. MIG-32 and SPAT-3A are PRC1 homologs that control neuronal migration in Caenorhabditis elegans.Development. 2009; 136: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the fly, core subunits of PRC2 are Enhancer of zeste (E(z)), Extra sex combs (Esc), Suppressor of Zeste 12 (SUZ12), and NURF-55. E(z) and Esc proteins form a histone methyltransferase complex that methylates lysines 27 and 9 of histone H3, creating an epigenetic mark that can be bound by Polycomb (Pc) proteins in the fly and mouse (Cao et al., 2002Cao R.

Pc is a core component of PRC1, which also contains polyhomeotic (Ph), Posterior sex combs (Psc), and dRing. These and other observations have led to a “hierarchical recruitment” model, which proposes that PcG-dependent silencing depends on sequential action of first PRC2 and then PRC1 (Wang et al., 2004Wang L.

Cell. 2004; 14: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The PRC1 and PRC2 core complexes do not bind DNA directly, but the pleiohomeotic (Pho) PcG protein, its vertebrate homolog YinYang1 (YY1), and related Pho-like proteins bind a specific DNA motif (Atchison et al., 2003Atchison L.

Although many PREs contain Pho-binding sites, these alone cannot tether PcG proteins to DNA in vivo (Brown et al., 2003Brown J.L. Fritsch C. Mueller J. Kassis J.A. The Drosophila pho-like gene encodes a YY1-related DNA binding protein that is redundant with pleiohomeotic in homeotic gene silencing.Development. 2003; 130: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and overall, no unifying sequence requirements for PREs have emerged. The first PREs identified reside in fly homeotic segment selector (Hox) gene complexes (Chan et al., 1994Chan C.S. Rastelli L. Pirrotta V.

In Bmi1 and Ring1b (Rnf2) mutants, proliferative deficits can be resued by silencing the DNA-damage response Chk2 or tumor suppressor Ink4a/Arf genes, respectively (Liu et al., 2009Liu J. Cao L.

USA. 2003; 100: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, axial patterning defects were not rescued, and thus, the key developmental PcG targets remain unknown. Many mouse mutations in PcG and trxG genes affect segmentation of the embryonic hindbrain, which is transiently subdivided along its antero-posterior axis into eight compartments, known as rhombomeres (r1–r8) (Lumsden and Krumlauf, 1996Lumsden A. Krumlauf R. Patterning the vertebrate neuraxis.Science. 1996; 274: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Many gene expression patterns, including those of Hox genes, are limited to specific rhombomeres. Transplantation experiments have shown that cells from adjacent rhombomeric domains cannot intermingle but sort themselves according to rhombomeric identity and transcriptional profiles (Guthrie and Lumsden, 1991Guthrie S. Lumsden A. Formation and regeneration of rhombomere boundaries in the developing chick hindbrain.Development. 1991; 112: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar), providing a direct, easily visualized record of transcriptional states on a cell-by-cell basis. In mice and flies, mutations in PcG genes often shift segmentation gene expression anteriorly.

Dyn. 2003; 227: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MafB misexpression is caused by an effect on cis-acting regulatory element(s), as MafB expression is unaffected by the severely hypomorphic krenu allele (Sadl et al., 2003Sadl V.S. Sing A. Mar L. Jin F. Cordes S.P. Analysis of hindbrain patterning defects caused by the kreisler enu mutation reveals multiple roles of Kreisler in hindbrain segmentation.Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We postulated that the kr inversion might anteriorize MafB expression by affecting a PRE. Analyses of the kr allele and of the effects of chromatin-remodeling agents and M33 polycomb gene dosage on MafB expression in normal and kr/kr embryos, assays for PcG- and trxG-dependent PRE activity in Drosophila, transgenic analyses in the mouse, and chromatin immunoprecitation assays in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells have all enabled us to identify and validate a bona fide mammalian PRE, referred to as PRE-kr, that regulates rhombomere-specific MafB expression. The kr inversion breakpoints lie ∼51 kb upstream of the MafB transcriptional start and ∼45 kb upstream of the paternally imprinted Neuronatin (Nnat) gene (Figures 1A and 1B) (Wijnholds et al., 1995Wijnholds J. Chowdhury K. Wehr R. Gruss P. Segment-specific expression of the neuronatin gene during early hindbrain development.Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nnat is expressed in r3 in 10–12 somite stage embryos (Figure 1C), in r3 and r5 by the 16–18 somite stage (Figure 1F), and then only in r5 by 20–22 somites (Figure 1I; Wijnholds et al., 1995Wijnholds J. Chowdhury K. Wehr R. Gruss P. Segment-specific expression of the neuronatin gene during early hindbrain development.Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The kr inversion does not disrupt Nnat imprinting since Nnat is expressed normally in kr/+ embryos from kr/+ mothers (data not shown). However, in 10–12 somite stage kr/+ embryos derived from kr/kr males, Nnat was expressed faintly in r3, prematurely in r5, and ectopically in r6 and part of r7 (Figure 1D). This expression persisted at the 16–18 somite stage (Figure 1G). By 20–22 somites, Nnat was downregulated in r5 but still present in r6 and r7 (Figure 1J). Ectopic Nnat expression was also seen in r6-derived neural crest, which normally expresses MafB. In kr/kr embryos, in which r5 and r6 do not develop properly (Frohman et al., 1993Frohman M.A. Martin G.R. Cordes S.P. Halamek L.P. Barsh G.S. Altered rhombomere-specific gene expression and hyoid bone differentiation in the mouse segmentation mutant, kreisler (kr).Development. 1993; 117: 925-936PubMed Google Scholar), Nnat was expressed in a narrower region of the posterior hindbrain (Figures 1E, 1H, and 1K) but otherwise as in paternally derived kr/+ embryos. In summary, the kr inversion disrupts rhombomere-specific Nnat and MafB expression in an incompletely reciprocal manner leading to anteriorization of MafB and a posterior shift of Nnat expression. In part, these observations might be explained by translocation of hindbrain-specific MafB enhancers to Nnat and vice versa. Alternatively, translocation of a PRE from MafB into the vicinity of Nnat could explain the posterior and anterior shifts and altered timing of gene expression patterns. To assess whether chromatin remodeling might underlie the r5/6-specific MafB repression in kr/kr embryos, we tested whether chromatin-remodeling agents could reactivate MafB expression. In +/+ embryos, histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine treatment did not affect MafB expression (Figure S1A available online). However, TSA treatment of kr/kr embryos reactivated MafB in the posterior hindbrain and increased ectopic expression in r3 (Figure S1C), whereas 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine increased MafB expression in r3 and not in r5/6 (Figure S1B). Thus, under permissive chromatin conditions, the S5 enhancer, which is located 21 kb upstream of MafB, activates MafB expression in the posterior hindbrains of kr/kr embryos. To test whether PcG genes regulate MafB expression, we examined the effects of reducing the dosage of M33/Cbx2, a murine homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb gene. M33 was selected as a candidate MafB regulator because, in M33−/− embryos, retinoic acid (RA) responsiveness is enhanced and expression of a MafB target gene, Hoxb3, is shifted anteriorly (Bel-Vialar et al., 2000Bel-Vialar S.

Normally, MafB shows an intense uniform band of r5/6-specific expression with well-defined boundaries in 8–10 somite stage embryos (Figure 2A). In M33 mutant embryos, the self-sorting behavior of MafB+ and MafB− cells permitted us to detect changes in MafB gene expression on a cell-by-cell basis. We found that MafB expression was affected in a variable manner in M33−/− and M33−/+ embryos (Figure 2). In some embryos, small MafB-expressing (MafB+) cell clusters were seen anterior to the boundary between r4 and r5 (Figures 2C, 2F, 2H, and 2H′). In others, cell clusters lacking MafB expression (MafB−) were found in r5 and r6 (Figures 2D, 2D′, 2E, 2G, 2H, and 2H′), particularly in their dorsal regions (Figures 2D, 2D′, and 2G). Most notably, some M33−/− embryos showed ectopic MafB expression in r3 (Figure 2H), similar to that seen in kr/kr and kr/+ embryos (Sadl et al., 2003Sadl V.S. Sing A. Mar L. Jin F. Cordes S.P. Analysis of hindbrain patterning defects caused by the kreisler enu mutation reveals multiple roles of Kreisler in hindbrain segmentation.Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, M33 governs rhombomere-specific MafB expression in a dose-dependent manner. In general, mutations in PcG proteins lead to ectopic expression of their targets. Here loss of MafB expression in r5/r6 of M33 mutants likely reflects conversion of r5/6 cells to a posterior r7/8-like fate caused by altered expression of M33-dependent segmentation genes. Consistent with this expectation, we found that Hoxb4, which is normally restricted to r7/8, was expressed ectopically in cell clusters in r5/6 of M33+/− and −/− embryos (Figure S2). Next we examined the effects of M33 dosage on MafB expression in kr/+ and kr/kr mice. Overall MafB expression was similarly affected in kr/+;M33+/− and M33+/− embryos (Figures 2I–2K). However, in one out of five kr/kr;M33+/− embryos, MafB was reactivated in r5/6 (Figures 2M and M′). While reactivated, MafB expression in this embryo was not restored to wild-type: MafB+ cell clusters were present anterior of the boundary between r4 and r5 and MafB− cells were present within the r5/6 domain. Nevertheless, decreasing M33 levels did reactivate MafB expression from the kr allele. These results are consistent with a model in which the kr inversion has relocated a PRE that facilitates access of PcG/trxG protein complexes to posterior hindbrain-specific enhancers and restricts more anterior expression. In Drosophila, many validated PREs contain binding sites for PHO and the GAGAG motif, which can bind GAGA factor and pipsqueak (Ringrose et al., 2003Ringrose L. Rehmsmeier M. Dura J.M. Paro R.

Of these, Pho and pipsqueak have vertebrate homologs (Brown et al., 1998Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M.L. Kassis J.A.

Three bioinformatics programs, one based on analyses of validated Drosophila PREs (Ringrose et al., 2003Ringrose L. Rehmsmeier M. Dura J.M. Paro R.

Cell. 2003; 5: 759-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and two based on mammalian PcG-protein-binding profiles and the presence of CpG islands (Eden et al., 2007Eden E. Lipson D. Yogev S. Yakhini Z. Discovering motifs in ranked lists of DNA sequences.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e39https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030039Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, Tanay et al., 2007Tanay A. O'Donnell A.H. Damelin M. Bestor T.H.

USA. 2007; 104: 5521-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), were unable to identify any candidate PREs in a 100 kb region upstream of MafB. However, close inspection of the region spanning the distal kr inversion breakpoint (bpt2) revealed several interesting features: First, a 450 bp region near bpt2 shares 92% sequence identity between mouse and human genomic MafB DNA and 82% between mouse and chick DNA (Figures 3B and 3C). Second, the conserved region produces no known or predicted transcripts but contains consensus Pho/YY1-binding sites and GAGAG motifs. Third, in the mouse sequence, we identified a palindromic double PHO-binding site that shares key features with conserved PHO-binding core elements present in Drosophila PREs, which govern expression of Ph and Sex Combs Reduced (Mihaly et al., 1998Mihaly J. Mishra R.K. Karch F. A conserved sequence motif in Polycomb-response elements.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1065-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This Pho/YY1 site is present in the homologous sequence of many other mammals, but not the human one. Recent analyses in Drosophilid species separated by up to 40 million years have shown that conserved PREs can differ widely with regard to the presence of specific motifs (Hauenschild et al., 2008Hauenschild A. Ringrose L. Altmutter C. Paro R. Rehmsmeier M. Evolutionary plasticity of polycomb/trithorax response elements in Drosophila species.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e261https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060261Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, even without conservation in humans, the presence of the palindromic double PHO-binding site in the mouse sequence was striking. We named the potential PRE governing MafB expression “PRE-kr” and began to test an ∼9 kb region (PRE-kr9kb) that spanned the distal inversion breakpoint and conserved sequence for possible PRE activity. A Drosophila-based in vivo assay that tests the ability of a candidate PRE to interfere with reporter gene activation has validated fly PREs, such as the Fab7 silencer of the bithorax complex, and has facilitated identification of repressive activities within the mouse H19 imprinting region (H19-ICR) (Cavalli and Paro, 1998Cavalli G. Paro R. The Drosophila Fab-7 chromosomal element conveys epigenetic inheritance during mitosis and meiosis.Cell. 1998; 93: 505-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, Lyko et al., 1997Lyko F. Brenton J.D. Surani M.A. Paro R. An imprinting element from the mouse H19 locus functions as a silencer in Drosophila.Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We used this assay to test PRE-kr9kb silencing activity. By flanking candidate PRE regions with LoxP sites, we were able to compare reporter gene expression plus or minus the PRE within the same genomic context (Figure 4A). Consistent with the presence of silencing activity, all of the lines carrying PRE-kr9kb had pale orange, rather than red, eyes (Figure 4C) and exhibited low LacZ expression in larval salivary glands (Figure 4B). Cre-mediated PRE-kr9kb excision produced substantial recovery of LacZ expression as well as darker red eyes than seen in PRE-kr9kb-carrying parents and grandparents (Figures 4B and 4C), an effect not seen in control lines carrying the S5 enhancer (Figure 4B). We mapped the silencing activity to PRE-kr3kb, a 3 kb region containing both the conserved sequence and the distal inversion breakpoint (Figure S3). Studies in flies have suggested that PRC1 components and some trxG proteins regulate the anteriorly expressed Hox genes Pb and Dfd (Gellon et al., 1997Gellon G. Harding K.W. McGinnis N. Martin M.M. McGinnis W. A genetic screen for modifiers of Deformed homeotic function identifies novel genes required for head development.Development. 1997; 124: 3321-3331PubMed Google Scholar, Rusch and Kaufman, 2000Rusch D.B. Kaufman T.C. Regulation of proboscipedia in Drosophila by homeotic selector genes.Genetics. 2000; 156: 183-194PubMed Google Scholar). Having demonstrated silencing activity for PRE-kr9kb and PRE-kr3kb, we tested the effects on PRE-kr-mediated repression of mutations in Psc, Pc, Pho, Ph, trithorax-like (Trl), moira, brahma, and, as a negative control, the Histone2a variant, which affects general chromatin compaction (Swaminathan et al., 2005Swaminathan J. Baxter E.M. Corces V.G. The role of histone H2Av variant replacement and histone H4 acetylation in the establishment of Drosophila heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Loss of a single copy of Pc, Ph, or Pho resulted in significant reactivation of LacZ expression (Figures 4D, 4E, 4G, and 4H). In larvae lacking one copy of Psc, LacZ levels could not be assayed, but expression of the adjacent mini-white reporter gene was reactivated in adult fly eyes (Figure 4F). Loss of a single copy of Trl decreased LacZ expression (Figure 4I). Mutations in moira, brahma, or the histone 2A variant had no detectable effect (Figures 4J–4L). Thus, PRE-kr has all of the hallmarks of a PRE in our Drosophila assays. To test whether PRE-kr9kb and PRE-kr3kb could recruit PcG proteins in Drosophila, we combined fluorescent in situ hybridization with immunostaining (iFISH) of polytene chromosomes of PRE-kr9kb-LacZ or PRE-kr3kb-LacZ transgenic flies and observed for both a novel binding site for PC and PH at the transgene insertion site (Figures 5A, 5C, 5E, and 5G). Upon Cre-mediated excision of PRE-kr, the PC and PH binding was lost (Figures 5B, 5D, 5F, and 5H). We conclude that PRE-kr acts as a definitive PRC1-binding target in Drosophila. Next, we examined the effect of PRE-kr3kb on rhombomere-specific LacZ expression in transgenic mice. The rhombomere-specific S5 enhancer from MafB directed LacZ expression in r5 and r6 (Figure 6A) (Kim et al., 2005Kim F.A. Sing A. Kaneko T. Bieman M. Stallwood N. Sadl V.S. Cordes S.P. The vHNF1 homeodomain protein establishes early rhombomere identity by direct regulation of Kreisler expression.Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Addition of PRE-kr3kb resulted in loss of rhombomere-specific LacZ expression (Figure 6B). Because loss of M33 increases embryonic sensitivity to RA, we reasoned that the presence of an RA-receptor-binding element (RARE) might relieve PRE-kr-dependent repression by allowing access to the S5 enhancer and thus directing rhombomere-specific expression. We therefore added an evolutionarily conserved RARE from the Hoxa1 gene whose removal had been shown not to affect the Hoxa1 expression domain but to decrease its overall level and retinoic acid sensitivity (Gavalas et al., 1998Gavalas A. Studer M. Lumsden A. Rijli F.M. Krumlauf R. Chambon P.

https://openalex.org/W2103339246,"Massive palindromes in the human Y chromosome harbor mirror-image gene pairs essential for spermatogenesis. During evolution, these gene pairs have been maintained by intrapalindrome, arm-to-arm recombination. The mechanism of intrapalindrome recombination and risk of harmful effects are unknown. We report 51 patients with isodicentric Y (idicY) chromosomes formed by homologous crossing over between opposing arms of palindromes on sister chromatids. These ectopic recombination events occur at nearly all Y-linked palindromes. Based on our findings, we propose that intrapalindrome sequence identity is maintained via noncrossover pathways of homologous recombination. DNA double-strand breaks that initiate these pathways can be alternatively resolved by crossing over between sister chromatids to form idicY chromosomes, with clinical consequences ranging from spermatogenic failure to sex reversal and Turner syndrome. Our observations imply that crossover and noncrossover pathways are active in nearly all Y-linked palindromes, exposing an Achilles' heel in the mechanism that preserves palindrome-borne genes."
https://openalex.org/W2029824528,"Alternative splicing is a key process underlying the evolution of increased proteomic and functional complexity and is especially prevalent in the mammalian nervous system. However, the factors and mechanisms governing nervous system-specific alternative splicing are not well understood. Through a genome-wide computational and expression profiling strategy, we have identified a tissue- and vertebrate-restricted Ser/Arg (SR) repeat splicing factor, the neural-specific SR-related protein of 100 kDa (nSR100). We show that nSR100 regulates an extensive network of brain-specific alternative exons enriched in genes that function in neural cell differentiation. nSR100 acts by increasing the levels of the neural/brain-enriched polypyrimidine tract binding protein and by interacting with its target transcripts. Disruption of nSR100 prevents neural cell differentiation in cell culture and in the developing zebrafish. Our results thus reveal a critical neural-specific alternative splicing regulator, the evolution of which has contributed to increased complexity in the vertebrate nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2138532429,"The dynein-related AAA ATPase Rea1 is a preribosomal factor that triggers an unknown maturation step in 60S subunit biogenesis. Using electron microscopy, we show that Rea1's motor domain is docked to the pre-60S particle and its tail-like structure, harboring a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), protrudes from the preribosome. Typically, integrins utilize a MIDAS to bind extracellular ligands, an interaction that is strengthened under applied tensile force. Likewise, the Rea1 MIDAS binds the preribosomal factor Rsa4, which is located on the pre-60S subunit at a site that is contacted by the flexible Rea1 tail. The MIDAS-Rsa4 interaction is essential for ATP-dependent dissociation of a group of non-ribosomal factors from the pre-60S particle. Thus, Rea1 aligns with its interacting partners on the preribosome to effect a necessary step on the path to the export-competent 60S subunit."

At presynaptic nerve terminals, synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis and endocytosis are temporally and spatially coupled to sustain transmitter release. At rest, intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are estimated to be between ∼40 and 80 nM (Guo et al., 2005Guo X. Macleod G.T. Wellington A. Hu F. Panchumarthi S. Schoenfield M. Marin L. Charlton M.P.

Moreover, endocytosis is abolished above 1μM [Ca2+]i in synaptic terminals (von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994von Gersdorff H. Matthews G. Inhibition of endocytosis by elevated internal calcium in a synaptic terminal.Nature. 1994; 370: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Hence, endocytosis seems to be triggered in a narrow and low [Ca2+]i range. Massive exocytosis can be induced by black widow spider venom (Henkel and Betz, 1995Henkel A.W. Betz W.J.

Selective replenishment of two vesicle pools depends on the source of Ca2+ at the Drosophila synapse.Neuron. 2002; 35: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. However, extracellular Ca2+ is necessary to initiate endocytosis in these paradigms, suggesting that a Ca2+ influx independent of VGCCs is critical to trigger endocytosis. Some data indicate that Calmodulin may function as a high-affinity sensor required for endocytosis (Cousin, 2000Cousin M.A. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis: calcium works overtime in the nerve terminal.Mol. Neurobiol. 2000; 22: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and that the Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, Calcineurin, forms a complex with Dynamin I at ∼1 μM Ca2+ to promote endocytosis (Lai et al., 1999Lai M.M. Hong J.J. Ruggiero A.M. Burnett P.E. Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Snyder S.H. The calcineurin-dynamin 1 complex as a calcium sensor for synaptic vesicle endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25963-25966Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, Kuromi et al. proposed that a Ca2+ channel must be present at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) to promote endocytosis (Kuromi et al., 2004Kuromi H. Honda A. Kidokoro Y. Ca2+ influx through distinct routes controls exocytosis and endocytosis at drosophila presynaptic terminals.Neuron. 2004; 41: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that an unknown Ca2+ channel may specifically regulate SV retrieval. However, how endocytosis is coupled to exocytosis remains a major question in the SV cycle field. Here, we report the identification of a protein that has not been previously characterized in any species and whose loss affects endocytosis. It contains three or four transmembrane domains and is associated with SVs. Upon fusion of the SVs with the presynaptic membrane, the protein is present in the periactive zones, where endocytosis is known to occur. The protein contains a 9 aa motif in the second transmembrane domain with homology to selectivity filters described in VGCCs and Transient Receptor Potential channels (TRPV5 and 6). We present evidence that it mediates Ca2+ entry in heterologous salivary gland cells and radioactive 45Ca2+ influx in reconstituted proteoliposomes. In addition, its loss also affects resting Ca2+ levels in presynaptic terminals. To identify proteins that affect synaptic transmission in Drosophila, we performed an unbiased forward genetic screen using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) on chromosome 3L. We utilized the eyFLP/FRT system in combination with electroretinogram (ERG) recordings to isolate mutants in which there is a loss of “on-off” transients (Figure 1A) (Stowers and Schwarz, 1999Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. A genetic method for generating Drosophila eyes composed exclusively of mitotic clones of a single genotype.Genetics. 1999; 152: 1631-1639PubMed Google Scholar). We identified several complementation groups from about 49,017 flies screened for this defect (Ohyama et al., 2007Ohyama T. Verstreken P. Ly C.V. Rosenmund T. Rajan A. Tien A.C. Haueter C. Schulze K.L. Bellen H.J. Huntingtin-interacting protein 14, a palmitoyl transferase required for exocytosis and targeting of CSP to synaptic vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1481-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), including the one discussed here. Mutants of one lethal complementation group (3L5) consisting of two alleles, DB25 and DB56, are homozygous lethal. Mutant eyes induced by eyFLP/FRT are morphologically normal (data not shown). However, they display impaired “on-off” transients in ERGs and slightly reduced depolarizations (Figure 1A). Loss of “on-off” transients could be due to a developmental or transmitter release defect. We therefore determined whether photoreceptors (R) exhibit axon guidance defects by staining optic lobes for Chaoptin (Zipursky et al., 1984Zipursky S.L. Venkatesh T.R. Teplow D.B. Benzer S. Neuronal development in the Drosophila retina: monoclonal antibodies as molecular probes.Cell. 1984; 36: 15-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), a photoreceptor membrane specific protein. The synaptic patterns of R7 and R8 photoreceptor subtypes in wild-type control and mutant medulla are indistinguishable (Figures 1B–1D), suggesting that mutations in the 3L5 group do not affect neuronal development and axon guidance. To examine whether the 3L5 alleles affect the ultrastructure of the R1-R6 photoreceptor axon terminals, we carried out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the lamina. The data are summarized in Figure S1 available online. The key observation is that the number of SVs is decreased in 3L5 mutants. In addition, we observed aberrant sizes and numbers of capitate projections. Capitate projections (CP) are glial invaginations that have been implicated in endocytosis in R terminals and a reduced number of SVs in R terminals have so far only been described in the endocytic mutant shibirets (Fabian-Fine et al., 2003Fabian-Fine R.

Endophilin promotes a late step in endocytosis at glial invaginations in Drosophila photoreceptor terminals.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10732-10744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that endocytosis may be impaired in the 3L5 mutant photoreceptors. To identify the gene, we mapped the molecular lesions in 3L5 mutants (Figure S2A) (Zhai et al., 2003Zhai R.G.

Rubin G.M. et al.The BDGP gene disruption project: single transposon insertions associated with 40% of Drosophila genes.Genetics. 2004; 167: 761-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), integrated in the 5′ UTR of CG6151, that causes semilethality and fails to complement the lethality of both 3L5 alleles, suggesting that 3L5 corresponds to CG6151 (Figures 1E and 1H). CG6151 encodes three potential alternatively spliced isoforms, CG6151-RA, -RB, and -RC (Tweedie et al., 2009Tweedie S. Ashburner M. Falls K. Leyland P. McQuilton P. Marygold S. Millburn G. Osumi-Sutherland D. Schroeder A. Seal R. Zhang H. FlyBase: enhancing Drosophila Gene Ontology annotations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D555-D559Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The proteins are predicted to contain three or four transmembrane (TM) domains with distinct C termini (Figures 1E, 1F, and S2B). CG6151 is conserved from worm to human and exhibits 39% identity and 61% similarity between amino acids 25 and 150 of the fly and human homologs (Figure 1G). The DB25 allele contains a G128D mutation, whereas the DB56 allele contains a premature stop codon, Q24∗ (Figures 1F and 1G). These mutations are responsible for the phenotypic defects discussed below, as an 8.2 kb genomic construct rescues the lethality and ERG defects of the mutants (Figures 1A, 1E, and 1H). Complementation tests and lethal phase assays suggest the following allelic series: p < DB25 < DB56 = Df (Figure 1H). Note that the lethality of all allelic combinations shown in Figure 1H is rescued by the 8.2 kb construct. The DB56 premature stop codon is probably the most severe allele. CG6151 is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) starting at embryonic stage 13 (data not shown and Figures S2C and S2D). To determine which isoforms are expressed and required in the nervous system, we expressed the RA, RB, and RC isoforms under the control of the pan-neuronal driver elav-GAL4. We assessed their ability to rescue the lethality and ERG defects associated with the 3L5 mutants. The RA and RB isoforms, but not the RC isoform, are able to efficiently rescue lethality, suggesting that they are mainly required in the nervous system. Expression of RA and RB with the photoreceptor-specific driver GMR-GAL4 also rescues the ERG defects (Figure 1A), indicating that CG6151 is expressed and necessary in photoreceptor cells. To determine the subcellular localization of the three isoforms, we tagged a single genomic rescue construct with three different tags at the different C termini (FLAG for RA, HA for RB, and MYC for RC). Another genomic rescue construct was tagged with three fluorescent tags (YFP for RA, GFP for RB, and RFP for RC) (Figure 1E). These two genomic constructs rescue the lethality associated with 3L5 mutants. We only observed expression of the protein B form tagged with HA (PB-HA) and GFP (PB-GFP) in the neuropils of embryonic, larval, adult CNS, and R1-R6 terminals (Figures S2E–S2L and data not shown), but we did not detect staining for the PA- and PC-tagged isoforms (data not shown). These data suggest that the PB isoform encoded by CG6151 is widely expressed in the nervous system at most stages of development and in adults. We generated two different guinea pig (gp115 and 116) antibodies that specifically identify the PB isoform. The PB protein is localized presynaptically at NMJs (Figure 2A), which are outlined by the postsynaptic marker Discs large (Dlg) (Lahey et al., 1994Lahey T. Gorczyca M. Jia X.X. Budnik V. The Drosophila tumor suppressor gene dlg is required for normal synaptic bouton structure.Neuron. 1994; 13: 823-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The anti-PB antibody fails to detect protein in third instar DB25/DB56 animals (Figure 2B). As shown in Figures 2C–2H, the PB protein colocalizes with the SV markers Synaptotagmin I (SytI) (Littleton et al., 1993Littleton J.T. Stern M. Schulze K. Perin M. Bellen H.J. Mutational analysis of Drosophila synaptotagmin demonstrates its essential role in Ca(2+)-activated neurotransmitter release.Cell. 1993; 74: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and Cysteine string protein (Csp) (Zinsmaier et al., 1994Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Walter N. Benzer S. Paralysis and early death in cysteine string protein mutants of Drosophila.Science. 1994; 263: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Similarly, the PB-HA protein colocalizes with SytI (Figures S2M–S2O). These data suggest that the PB protein is associated with SVs and presynaptic membranes. The association with SVs was corroborated by probing partially purified and base stripped SVs from adult fly brains (Figure 2I), revealing an abundant 21 kDa protein, in agreement with the estimated molecular weight. Hence, the data indicate that the protein is a previously unidentified, integral membrane protein of SVs. If the PB protein is a SV-associated protein, vesicle release in the absence of endocytosis should lead to its redistribution to the presynaptic membrane. The temperature-sensitive mutant shibire (shits1), which encodes Dynamin, is essential for SV retrieval but not for vesicle fusion (Koenig and Ikeda, 1989Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. Disappearance and reformation of synaptic vesicle membrane upon transmitter release observed under reversible blockage of membrane retrieval.J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3844-3860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the nonpermissive temperature (34°C). Hence, a SV-associated protein such as SytI should be redistributed from SVs to the presynaptic membrane at 34°C in shits1 mutants. This effect is indeed observed (Figures 2J and 2M). Similarly, under the same conditions, most PB protein is redistributed to the plasma membrane (Figures 2K, 2L, 2N, and 2O) and localized surrounding active zones labeled with the anti-Bruchpilot (Brp) antibody (nc82) (Figures 2P and 2Q) (Wagh et al., 2006Wagh D.A. Rasse T.M. Asan E. Hofbauer A. Schwenkert I. Durrbeck H. Buchner S. Dabauvalle M.C. Schmidt M. Qin G. et al.Bruchpilot, a protein with homology to ELKS/CAST, is required for structural integrity and function of synaptic active zones in Drosophila.Neuron. 2006; 49: 833-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Hence, the PB isoform is a SV-associated protein that, upon SV exocytosis, becomes enriched in periactive/endocytic zones (Marie et al., 2004Marie B. Sweeney S.T. Poskanzer K.E. Roos J. Kelly R.B. Davis G.W. Dap160/intersectin scaffolds the periactive zone to achieve high-fidelity endocytosis and normal synaptic growth.Neuron. 2004; 43: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We visualized the localization of the PB-HA protein by immunogold EM labeling using an anti-HA antibody with silver enhancement (Koh et al., 2007Koh T.W. Korolchuk V.I. Wairkar Y.P. Jiao W. Evergren E. Pan H. Zhou Y. Venken K.J. Shupliakov O. Robinson I.M. et al.Eps15 and Dap160 control synaptic vesicle membrane retrieval and synapse development.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Control flies that do not contain the PB-HA transgene (Figure S2P) show very few positive signals compared to flies (DB56/DB56) that carry the transgene (Figures 2R–2T). The vast majority of the gold particles are associated with SVs in boutons (Figures 2R–2U). However, some of the gold particles are also observed near the plasma membrane (red arrows). These data show that PB is a SV protein that can also localize to the plasma membrane, consistent with the data presented in Figure 2. The reduced number of SVs and aberrant size and shape of CPs in R1-R6 terminals, as well as the protein localization at nerve terminals, suggest a possible role in endocytosis. Mutations in genes that affect endocytosis, including endophilin, synaptojanin, lap, dynamin, eps15, and dap160, cause an increase in bouton number at NMJs. However, the number of additional satellite boutons varies widely among the different endocytic mutants and does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the endocytic defect (Dickman et al., 2006Dickman D.K. Lu Z. Meinertzhagen I. Schwarz T.L. Altered synaptic development and active zone spacing in endocytosis mutants.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 591-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Koh et al., 2007Koh T.W. Korolchuk V.I. Wairkar Y.P. Jiao W. Evergren E. Pan H. Zhou Y. Venken K.J.

We therefore determined whether the number of boutons at mutant third-instar larvae is altered. As shown in Figures 2V–2X and S3A–S3C, the mutants display numerous extra boutons which are often small, clustered, and flowery in nature. We therefore named the gene flower. However, the total number of active zones as measured with nc82 (Brp) is similar in mutants and wild-type controls (Figures S3D–S3F), suggesting that the number of release sites per muscle is not altered in the mutants. Moreover, the total surface area of the NMJ boutons are also similar in mutants (2104 ± 191 μm2 in muscle 6, n = 6) and wild-type controls (1656 ± 184 μm2 in muscle 6, n = 6). The defect in bouton number in flower mutants is rather severe when compared to most endocytic mutants. Endocytic mutants such as endophilin, synaptojanin, eps15, and dap160 exhibit qualitatively similar defects in synaptic transmission in flies: they display normal excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) at low stimulation frequencies (0.2–1 Hz) and a rundown when stimulated at 10 Hz (Dickman et al., 2005Dickman D.K. Horne J.A. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L.

Synaptojanin is recruited by endophilin to promote synaptic vesicle uncoating.Neuron. 2003; 40: 733-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We therefore recorded evoked EJPs at 0.2 Hz in 0.5 mM or 1 mM extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o). At these [Ca2+]o, the EJP amplitudes from wild-type controls and mutants are similar (Figures 3A–3E). At 10 Hz in 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o, wild-type controls display facilitation (relative amplitude = 120), whereas mutants display a rundown (relative amplitude = 65; Figure 3F). In addition, SV release in wild-type controls exhibits posttetanic potentiation (PTP) immediately after a 1 s pause and shift to 0.2 Hz, probably triggered by elevated [Ca2+]i. This PTP is severely impaired in mutants, and the EJPs recover slowly, similar to other endocytic mutants (Dickman et al., 2005Dickman D.K. Horne J.A. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L. A slowed classical pathway rather than kiss-and-run mediates endocytosis at synapses lacking synaptojanin and endophilin.Cell. 2005; 123: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hence, these data indicate that flower mutants exhibit a defect in endocytosis. To determine whether the endocytic defect is sensitive to different [Ca2+]o, we also recorded at 1 mM [Ca2+]o instead of 0.5 mM (Figure 3G). Upon a 10 Hz stimulation for 10 min in 1 mM [Ca2+]o, control animals sustain transmission better than the two flower mutant combinations. However, the difference between the flower mutants and the wild-type control in 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o is 60%, whereas in 1 mM [Ca2+]o the difference is 20%. More importantly, the recovery after a shift to 0.2 Hz in flower mutants is significantly faster in 1 mM [Ca2+]o than in 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o suggesting that endocytosis is less defective in these conditions. These results indicate that increased extracellular Ca2+ concentrations can partially rescue the endocytic defects. An increase in the SV diameter and quantal size has been reported for many endocytic mutants, including synaptojanin, lap, dap160, eps15, and stonedB mutants (Dickman et al., 2005Dickman D.K. Horne J.A. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L.

Synaptic vesicle size and number are regulated by a clathrin adaptor protein required for endocytosis.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1465-1475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), possibly because of an aberrant recruitment of clathrin and/or an impaired timing of fission, leading to an increased SV size and content. We observed an increase in the quantal size and a decrease in frequency of mEJPs in flower mutants (Figures 3H and 3I). Given the increase in quantal size and similar EJP amplitudes, the junctional quantal content estimated from dividing EJP by mEJP in flower mutants is decreased by ∼29% (Figures 3J and 3K). Note however that the total amount of SV membranes that fuse in flower mutants is estimated to be 109% that of wild-type controls as the SVs are significantly larger in flower mutants (see next section). To establish whether there is a defect in endocytosis, we performed FM1-43 dye uptake assays to label newly formed SVs. We incubated NMJs with FM1-43 dye in 90 mM [K+]o plus 1.5 mM [Ca2+]o and measured total fluorescence of NMJ boutons of the entire muscle 6. As shown in Figures 3L–3N, the mutants exhibit a 57% reduction of dye uptake as compared to wild-type controls. Since the QC is reduced by ∼29% in the mutants (Figure 3K), we estimated the recycling efficiency of SVs by normalizing the fluorescence with the total number of SVs released during stimulation and the total number of release sites in both wild-type controls and mutants (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). After normalization, flower mutant boutons exhibit a 41% reduction in dye uptake compared to wild-type controls (Figure 3O). These data indicate that flower mutants are defective in endocytosis. Endocytic mutants exhibit a reduced number of SVs. In addition, several mutants also exhibit an increased heterogeneity in SV size and an increased number of endocytic intermediates (Dickman et al., 2005Dickman D.K. Horne J.A. Meinertzhagen I.A.

https://openalex.org/W2048945529,"Trigger factor (TF) is a molecular chaperone that binds to bacterial ribosomes where it contacts emerging nascent chains, but TF is also abundant free in the cytosol where its activity is less well characterized. In vitro studies show that TF promotes protein refolding. We find here that ribosome-free TF stably associates with and rescues from misfolding a large repertoire of full-length proteins. We identify over 170 members of this cytosolic Escherichia coli TF substrate proteome, including ribosomal protein S7. We analyzed the biochemical properties of a TF:S7 complex from Thermotoga maritima and determined its crystal structure. Thereby, we obtained an atomic-level picture of a promiscuous chaperone in complex with a physiological substrate protein. The structure of the complex reveals the molecular basis of substrate recognition by TF, indicates how TF could accelerate protein folding, and suggests a role for TF in the biogenesis of protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2113407647,"KillerRed is the only known fluorescent protein that demonstrates notable phototoxicity, exceeding that of the other green and red fluorescent proteins by at least 1,000-fold. KillerRed could serve as an instrument to inactivate target proteins or to kill cell populations in photodynamic therapy. However, the nature of KillerRed phototoxicity has remained unclear, impeding the development of more phototoxic variants. Here we present the results of a high resolution crystallographic study of KillerRed in the active fluorescent and in the photobleached non-fluorescent states. A unique and striking feature of the structure is a water-filled channel reaching the chromophore area from the end cap of the beta-barrel that is probably one of the key structural features responsible for phototoxicity. A study of the structure-function relationship of KillerRed, supported by structure-based, site-directed mutagenesis, has also revealed the key residues most likely responsible for the phototoxic effect. In particular, Glu(68) and Ser(119), located adjacent to the chromophore, have been assigned as the primary trigger of the reaction chain."
https://openalex.org/W1969649885,"Specialized topoisomerases solve the topological constraints arising when replication forks encounter transcription. We have investigated the contribution of Top2 in S phase transcription. Specifically in S phase, Top2 binds intergenic regions close to transcribed genes. The Top2-bound loci exhibit low nucleosome density and accumulate gammaH2A when Top2 is defective. These intergenic loci associate with the HMG protein Hmo1 throughout the cell cycle and are refractory to the histone variant Htz1. In top2 mutants, Hmo1 is deleterious and accumulates at pericentromeric regions in G2/M. Our data indicate that Top2 is dispensable for transcription and that Hmo1 and Top2 bind in the proximity of genes transcribed in S phase suppressing chromosome fragility at the M-G1 transition. We propose that an Hmo1-dependent epigenetic signature together with Top2 mediate an S phase architectural pathway to preserve genome integrity."

Nebulin is one of the least well understood major muscle proteins. Although nebulin is usually viewed as a structural protein, here we investigated whether nebulin plays a role in muscle contraction by using skinned muscle fiber bundles from a nebulin knock-out (NEB KO) mouse model. We measured force-pCa (−log[Ca2+]) and force-ATPase relations, as well as the rate of tension re-development (ktr) in tibialis cranialis muscle fibers. To rule out any alterations in troponin (Tn) isoform expression and/or status of Tn phosphorylation, we studied fiber bundles that had been reconstituted with bacterially expressed fast skeletal muscle recombinant Tn. We also performed a detailed analysis of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain, and myosin light chain 2 phosphorylation, which showed no significant differences between wild type and NEB KO. Our mechanical studies revealed that NEB KO fibers had increased tension cost (5.9 versus 4.4 pmol millinewtons−1 mm−1 s−1) and reductions in ktr (4.7 versus 7.3 s−1), calcium sensitivity (pCa50 5.74 versus 5.90), and cooperativity of activation (nH 3.64 versus 4.38). Our findings indicate the following: 1) in skeletal muscle nebulin increases thin filament activation, and 2) through altering cross-bridge cycling kinetics, nebulin increases force and efficiency of contraction. These novel properties of nebulin add a new level of understanding of skeletal muscle function and provide a mechanism for the severe muscle weakness in patients with nebulin-based nemaline myopathy.

Muscle contraction is based on cyclic interactions between the myosin cross-bridges that are part of the thick filaments and actin, the major protein of the thin filament (1Huxley H.E. Science. 1969; 164: 1356-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar).

Biophys. 1996; 33: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nebulin is a giant filamentous protein that spans the entire thin filament, with its C terminus anchored in the Z-disk and its N-terminal region located near the thin filament pointed end (4Kruger M.

The majority of the nebulin sequence is composed of ∼35-amino acid modules, with the central module 9 (M9) and module 162 (M162) modules arranged into seven-module super-repeats (6Wang K. Knipfer M.

Evidence for the role of nebulin in regulating thin filament activation has been obtained in the following: 1) in in vitro studies that showed that nebulin binds to F-actin with high affinity and that this affinity is reduced by adding Tm and Tn (8McElhinny A.S. Kazmierski S.T. Labeit S. Gregorio C.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Ogut O. Hossain M.M. Jin J.P. J. Biol.

Wang K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12581-12591Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is uncertain how such findings extrapolate to the more complex myofibrillar system, with many geometric and mechanical constraints that are absent in vitro. Thus to establish the role of nebulin in muscle contraction, one needs to study higher order systems. This work has been held back by the lack of methods to specifically extract nebulin. Here we took advantage of our recently developed nebulin KO (NEB KO) mouse model (11Witt C.C. Burkart C. Labeit D. McNabb M. Wu Y. Granzier H. Labeit S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3843-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and studied the role(s) of nebulin in muscle contraction. Our findings reveal a novel role for nebulin in thin filament activation and tuning cross-bridge cycling kinetics. The NEB KO model has been reported earlier (11Witt C.C. Burkart C. Labeit D. McNabb M. Wu Y. Granzier H. Labeit S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3843-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). NEB KO mice were identified through PCR genotyping and further confirmed with protein gels. Tibialis cranialis muscles of 7–9-day-old mice were skinned overnight at 4 °C in relaxing solution (RS) containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (RS: 50 mm BES (pH 7.0), 31 mm potassium propionate, 10 mm NaN3, 20 mm EGTA, 6.29 mm MgCl2, 6.09 mm ATP, 20 mm 2,3-butanedione monoximine, 12 mm creatine phosphate, 10 IU/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (4 μm benzamidine-HCl, 5 μm bestatin, 2 μm E-64, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 200 μm PMSF)). Detergent-skinned muscle preparations were washed thoroughly with the RS buffer and stored in 50% glycerol and RS at −20 °C for not more than 6 weeks. Because the size of single muscle fibers (diameter ∼10 um) was too small for several of our methods (especially the ATPase measurements), we used small muscle fiber bundles (diameter ∼0.1 mm) instead. Fiber length was typically ∼2.0 mm. Experiments had been approved by the IACUC of the University of Arizona. Skinned muscle fiber bundles were attached to a displacement generator (model 300B, Cambridge Technology, Cambridge, MA) at one end and to a force transducer element (AE 801, SensoNor, Horten, Norway) at the other end using aluminum T-clips. The resting sarcomere length (SL) was set to 2.0 μm using a He-Ne laser diffraction system. After two cycles of full activation (pCa 4.3) and relaxation (pCa 8.5), the resting SL was readjusted to 2.0 μm. By using this approach, we found that the resting SL remained stable throughout the experiment. Fiber width and diameter were measured at three points along the fiber, and the cross-sectional area was determined assuming an elliptical cross-section. Tension was expressed as force per cross-sectional area. To determine the pCa-tension relation (pCa = −log of molar free Ca2+ concentration), skinned muscle fiber bundles were sequentially bathed in solutions with pCa values ranging from 4.3 to 8.5 and then back to 4.3, and the corresponding tension was measured. Muscle fibers were discarded if the maximally activated tension at the end of the pCa series had decreased more than 20% of the initial maximally activated tension (average rundown of reconstituted WT (12 ± 2% (n = 8) and NEB KO fibers (14 ± 2% (n = 8)) was not significantly different). Measured tension values were normalized to the maximal tension obtained at pCa 4.3. Because the maximal tension at the end of the experiment was slightly less than that at the beginning, we calculated the maximal active tension for each pCa assuming that rundown varied with the number of activations (this results in ∼1.5% rundown per activation). The obtained pCa-tension data were fit to the Hill equation, providing pCa50 (pCa giving 50% maximal active tension) and the Hill coefficient, nH, as the index of myofilament cooperativity (for additional details see Ref. 14Chandra M. Tschirgi M.L. Tardiff J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H2112-H2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fiber bundles were maximally activated at pCa 4.3. When the muscle fiber reached a steady-state isometric force (F0), the muscle length was changed in a step-like fashion (either increased (+) or decreased (−)) by ±0.5, ±1.0, ±1.5, and ±2.0% of muscle length (Fig. 4A gives an example). Stiffness associated with the number of strongly bound cross-bridges prior to stretch was estimated from the relationship between length change (ΔL) and the peak force response (F1). Stiffness is represented as the slope of the linear regression of the relationship between F1 and ΔL. To measure the rate of tension redevelopment (ktr), we used the large slack/release approach, originally described by Brenner (15Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), to disengage force-generating cross-bridges from the thin filaments, which were isometrically activated. Fast activation of the fiber was achieved by transferring the skinned muscle fibers from the pre-activation solution containing a low concentration of EGTA (pCa 9.0) to a pCa 4.3 activating solution. Once the steady state was reached, a slack equivalent to 10% of the muscle length was rapidly induced at one end of the muscle using the motor. This was followed immediately by an unloaded shortening lasting 20 ms. The remaining bound cross-bridges were mechanically detached by rapidly (1 ms) restretching the muscle fiber to its original length, after which tension redevelops. The rate constant of monoexponential tension redevelopment was determined by fitting the rise of tension to the following equation: F = Fss(1 − e−ktr·t), where F is force at time t and ktr is the rate constant of tension redevelopment. We used a system similar to the one described by de Tombe and Stienen (16de Tombe P.P. Stienen G.J. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To measure the ATPase activity, a near-UV light was projected through the quartz window of the bath (30-μl volume and temperature controlled at 20 °C) and detected at 340 nm. Maximum activation buffer (pCa 4.3) contained (in mm) the following: potassium propionate 31, Na2ATP 5.95, MgCl2 6.61, EGTA 10, CaCl2 10.11, BES 50 (pH 7.0), NaN3 10, NADH 0.9, and phosphoenolpyruvate 10, with 4 mg ml−1 pyruvate kinase (500 units mg−1), 0.24 mg ml−1 lactate dehydrogenase (870 units mg−1), and 20 μm A2P5 as well as a mixture of protease inhibitors. For efficient mixing, the solution in the bath was continuously stirred by means of motor-driven vibration of a membrane positioned at the base of the bath. ATPase activity of the skinned fiber bundles was measured as follows: ATP regeneration from ADP was coupled to the breakdown of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and ATP was catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, which is linked to the synthesis of lactate catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase. The breakdown of NADH, which is proportional to the amount of ATP consumed, was measured on line by UV absorbance at 340 nm. The ratio of light intensity at 340 nm (sensitive to NADH concentration), and the light intensity at 410 nm (reference signal), was obtained by means of an analog divider. After each recording, the UV absorbance signal of NADH was calibrated by multiple rapid injections of 0.25 nmol of ADP (0.025 μl of 10 mm ADP) into the bathing solution, with a motor-controlled calibration pipette. The slope of the [ATP] versus time trace during steady-state tension development of a calcium-induced contraction (see Fig. 3A for an example) was determined from a linear fit, and the value was divided by the fiber volume (in mm3) to determine the ATPase rate of the fiber. ATPase rates were corrected for the basal ATPase in relaxing solution. The ATPase rate and tension at different pCa values were plotted against each other, and the tension cost was determined from the slope of a linear fit to the data. Exchange of endogenous troponin with bacterially expressed recombinant fs troponin complex was based on the method described previously (17Gallon C.E. Tschirgi M.L. Chandra M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 456: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The extraction solution containing a mixture of fsTn was prepared as follows: fsTnT (0.7 mg/ml, w/v) and fsTnI (0.7 mg/ml, w/v) were initially dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 m urea, 1.0 m KCl, 10 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. High salt and urea were removed by successive dialysis against the following buffers: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C), 4 m urea, 0.7 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 0.01% NaN3, followed by 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C), 2 m urea, 0.5 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 0.01% NaN3, and then finally against the extraction buffer containing 50 mm BES (pH 7.0 at 20 °C), 180 mm KCl, 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoximine, 5 mm EGTA, 6.27 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 4 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.01% NaN3. After final dialysis, 5 mm MgATP2− and fresh protease inhibitors were added to the supernatant containing cTnT-cTnI. Any undissolved protein was removed by spinning in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 15 min. The exchange experiment was carried out in the extraction solution containing fsTnT-fsTnI for 3–4 h at room temperature with gentle constant stirring. After extraction, muscle fiber bundles were washed twice with extraction buffer for 15 min. fsTnT-fsTnI-treated fiber bundles were reconstituted overnight (4 °C) with fsTnC (2 mg/ml) prepared in the relaxation buffer (50 mm BES, 51.0 mm potassium propionate, 5.83 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm P-enolpyruvate, 50 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 200 μm PMSF, 10 μm oligomycin, and 20 μm A2P5 (ionic strength 180 mm)). For Tn analysis, Western blotting was performed using fast skeletal and slow skeletal specific antibodies (ss-TnI, cs-20645; fs-TnI, sc-8120; ssTnT, sc-28269; fs-TnT, sc-8123; TnC, sc-8117 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and fsTnT JLT-12 from Sigma). For Tm expression, Western blotting was performed using an antibody directed against both α- and β-Tm (CH1, Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). For MHC analysis, the skinned muscle fiber bundles that had been used for mechanical experiments were detached from the force transducer and servo-motor and placed in SDS sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue at a pH of 6.8. The samples were stored at −80 °C until assayed. The samples were denatured by boiling for 2 min. The stacking gel contained a 4% acrylamide concentration (pH 6.7), and the separating gel contained 7% acrylamide (pH 8.7) with 30% glycerol (v/v). Control samples of mouse soleus and tibialis cranialis muscle (neonatal and adult) were run on the gels for comparison of migration patterns of the myosin heavy chain isoforms. Sample volumes of 10 μl were loaded per lane. The gels were run for 24 h at 15 °C and a constant voltage of 275 V. The gels were silver-stained, scanned, and analyzed with one-dimensional scan EX software. For MLC2 phosphorylation, we used urea/glycerol-PAGE as described previously (18Hidalgo C. Wu Y. Peng J. Siems W.F. Campbell K.B. Granzier H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 456: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The densitometric analysis of protein bands was made with one-dimensional scan EX software. The integrated optical density of the MLC2 and the MLC2-P was used to obtain the percentage of MLC2-P. We also analyzed the levels of phosphorylation using the Pro-Q Diamond stain (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gel was then re-stained with SYPRO Ruby or with silver stain. The Pro-Q Diamond band integrated optical density was normalized to the corresponding total protein integrated optical density. For muscle mechanics experiments, 7–9 fiber muscle bundles were studied per group, and for gel electrophoresis and Western blotting studies, typically 6 muscle fiber bundles were analyzed per group. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by t test between NEB KO and WT mice; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Because differences in thin filament regulatory protein can cause changes in myofilament calcium sensitivity and cross-bridge cycling kinetics (2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), we first examined the protein levels of fast skeletal (fs) and slow skeletal (ss) TnI, TnT, and TnC. High resolution protein gels in the 10–50-kDa range did not reveal major differences between NEB KO and WT muscle fiber bundles (Fig. 1A). To determine whether minor differences existed, we performed Western blot studies with antibodies against fsTnT, ssTnI, fsTnT, ssTnI, and a pan-specific TnC (Fig. 1, B–D). Both WT and NEB KO muscles expressed predominantly fsTn, but a low level of ssTnT and ssTnI was also present (Fig. 1B). The ssTnT and ssTnI level was in each case ∼5% of total fsTnT and fsTnI in WT muscle fibers and ∼15% in KO muscle fibers, a difference that was found to be statistically significant (Fig. 1D, left panels). To rule out the effect of any altered Tn expression or differences in their post-translational modification, we replaced the native Tn complex of WT and NEB KO fibers with bacterially expressed recombinant fsTn (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, reconstituted fibers contained negligible amounts of ssTnT and ssTnI, with no significant differences between WT and NEB KO muscle fiber bundles (Fig. 1, C and D, right panels). We also studied possible shifts in Tm isoforms and found no significant differences between WT and NEB KO fibers (Fig. 1E). MHC isoform expression was also evaluated. The fiber bundles contained predominantly neonatal MHC (53 ± 3 (WT) and 59 ± 6 (KO) % of total), small amounts of MHC IIA (15 ± 8 (WT) and 29 ± 6 (KO) % of total), and MHC IIB (26 ± 8 (WT) and 10 ± 6 (KO) % of total), and barely detectable levels of MHC I (4 ± 1 (WT) and 5 ± 1 (KO) % of total), with no significant differences between WT and NEB KO fibers. Absence of a significant change in MHC isoform expression is consistent with a recent study by Gokhin et al. (19Gokhin D.S. Bang M.L. Zhang J. Chen J. Lieber R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C1123-C1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) on MHC isoform expression in gastrocnemius muscle of WT and NEB KO mice (postnatal day 7) where also no significant differences were found. Finally, we determined the phosphorylation status of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), which is known to affect calcium sensitivity (20Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1085-C1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we determined the MLC3/MLC1 ratio, which in some studies has been shown to affect cross-bridge kinetics (for original citations see Ref. 21Lutz G.J. Bremner S.N. Bade M.J. Lieber R.L. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 4237-4248PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found no significant differences between WT and NEB KO fibers (Fig. 2). In summary, the main difference between WT and NEB KO muscle fibers, in addition to nebulin, was up-regulated ssTnT and ssTnI isoforms in NEB KO mice. This difference was abolished following reconstitution with WT recombinant fsTn. Hence, we used solely fsTn-reconstituted TC fibers from WT and NEB KO mice to study the effect of nebulin on myofilament calcium sensitivity and cross-bridge cycling kinetics.FIGURE 2MLC phosphorylation (A–C) and MLC3/MLC1 expression ratio (D). MLC2 phosphorylation was determined using urea/glycerol-PAGE (A) and Pro-Q diamond phosphoprotein staining (B and C). Urea-glycerol PAGE shows a minor band below MLC2, which based on our previous mass spectrometry work (18Hidalgo C. Wu Y. Peng J. Siems W.F. Campbell K.B. Granzier H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 456: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is identified as MLC2-P. MLC2P makes up ∼10% of total MLC2, with no noticeable difference between WT and NEB KO fiber bundles. B, Pro-Q diamond (left) stains MLC2 (identification based on mobility and Western blots) with no noticeable differences between WT and NEB KO. Pro-Q diamond staining was normalized to SYPRO Ruby (right)-based protein levels, and normalized results are shown in C. MLC phosphorylation is not different in WT and NEB KO fiber bundles. D, MLC3/MLC1 ratio is not different between WT and NEB KO fibers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mechanical experiments on contracting muscle were carried out at a sarcomere length (SL) of 2.0 μm, which was preferred for the following reasons. Using electron microscopy on phalloidin gold-labeled muscle fibers, we showed previously (11Witt C.C. Burkart C. Labeit D. McNabb M. Wu Y. Granzier H. Labeit S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3843-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) that thin filaments in TC WT muscle are 1.2 μm long and that in NEB KO muscle thin filament length varies from 0.5 to 1.2 μm (average ∼0.8 μm). Using these values, we then constructed the force-SL relations for WT and the average curve for NEB KO muscle (details in Fig. 3). Results showed that on the descending limb of WT muscle (SLs >2.5 um) force is much less in NEB KO than in WT muscle. However, on the plateau and ascending limb of the WT muscle, the difference between WT and KO force is much reduced, and at a SL of ∼2.0 μm the WT and NEB KO forces are the same (∼80% of maximal). Thus, by performing our mechanical study at a SL of 2.0 μm, force differences due to thin filament length differences were minimized. An additional reason for using this SL is that passive tension is absent at this length, and our measurements (especially ktr) were therefore not affected by changes in passive tension. Maximal Ca2+-activated active tension (pCa 4.3) was significantly reduced from 84 ± 4 mN/mm2 in WT to 38 ± 2.2 mN/mm2 in the NEB KO muscle fibers, a reduction of ∼50%. We also measured muscle fiber stiffness by imposing rapid changes in muscle length to estimate stiffness associated with the number of strongly bound cross-bridges (Fig. 4). Stiffness was significantly lower in NEB KO muscle fibers (920 ± 23 and 388 ± 29 mN/mm3). The reduction in stiffness for NEB KO muscle fibers was proportional to the reduction in Ca2+-activated maximal tension, and as a result the tension/stiffness ratio was not significantly different between WT and NEB KO muscle fibers (Table 1). This demonstrated that the tension per cross-bridge is the same in NEB KO muscle fibers. Thus, the lower Ca2+-activated maximal tension in NEB KO muscle fibers is due to a reduced number of force-generating cross-bridges.TABLE 1Mechanical measurements in isometrically contracted skinned TC fiber bundles from WT and NEB KO miceWTNEB KOp value1.

The obtained pCa-force relations were shifted to the right in NEB KO muscle fibers (Fig. 5) with a pCa50 value of 5.90 for WT muscle fibers and 5.74 for NEB KO muscle fibers. NEB KO muscle fibers also had an ∼20% reduction in the cooperativity of myofilament activation as reflected by the reduced Hill coefficient (nH) (Fig. 5, inset; Table 1). The tension cost was determined optically by measuring the breakdown of NADH during contraction, with NADH levels enzymatically coupled to ATP utilization (see under “Experimental Procedures”). An example of a maximally activated NEB KO muscle fiber bundle with [ATP] falling linearly during the tension plateau is shown in Fig. 6A. The slope of the [ATP] versus time curve was normalized by the fiber volume to obtain ATP consumption rates that can be compared for differently sized fiber bundles. For each muscle fiber bundle, we measured ATP consumption rates at a range of pCa values, and results were plotted against the active tension of each contraction. A typical result for an NEB KO and WT muscle fiber is shown in Fig. 6B. ATP consumption rates varied linearly with active tension with a slope that reflects tension cost. The tension cost was significantly higher in NEB KO muscle fibers (Fig. 6B, inset; Table 1). Finally, we also measured the rate of tension redevelopment. Muscle fibers were first isometrically activated at pCa 4.3, and when a steady tension was reached, cross-bridges were disengaged by performing a quick release, a brief period of unloaded shortening, and then a rapid restretch to the original length. Following restretch, tension rebuilds with a time course that can be fit with a monoexponential curve with ktr as rate constant. Fig. 7 shows a ktr experiment on a WT and NEB KO muscle fiber bundle, revealing that tension recovers faster in the WT muscle fiber bundle. The summarized results are shown in Fig. 7, inset. ktr is significantly lower in NEB KO muscle fibers (4.7 versus 7.3 s−1). To establish whether nebulin plays a role in skeletal muscle thin filament activation and cross-bridge cycling kinetics, we studied tibialis cranialis muscle fibers from NEB KO mice. NEB KO muscle fibers had reduced myofilament calcium sensitivity, reduced cooperativity of activation, increased tension cost, and a lower ktr. For these effects to be ascribed to nebulin, it is important that no major differences in regulatory proteins exist between WT and NEB KO muscle fibers. No differences were found in MHC isoform composition, MLC composition, or MLC2 phosphorylation levels. The only significant difference that we found in our protein analysis was up-regulated ssTnI and ssTnT in nebulin KO fibers. To rule out that these differences in Tn isoforms gave rise to altered force production and kinetics, we reconstituted all muscle fibers with bacterially expressed"
https://openalex.org/W2000692520,"Long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL) and fatty acid transport proteins (FATP) activate fatty acids to acyl-CoAs in the initial step of fatty acid metabolism. Numerous isoforms of ACSL and FATP exist with different tissue distribution patterns, intracellular locations, and substrate preferences, suggesting that each isoform has distinct functions in channeling fatty acids into different metabolic pathways. Because fatty acids, acyl-CoAs, and downstream lipid metabolites regulate various transcription factors that control hepatic energy metabolism, we hypothesized that ACSL or FATP isoforms differentially regulate hepatic gene expression. Using small interference RNA (siRNA), we knocked down each liver-specific ACSL and FATP isoform in rat primary hepatocyte cultures and subsequently analyzed reporter gene activity of numerous transcription factors and performed quantitative mRNA analysis of their target genes. Compared with control cells, which were transfected with control siRNA, knockdown of acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3) significantly decreased reporter gene activity of several lipogenic transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator activation receptor-gamma, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, and liver X receptor-alpha and the expression of their target genes. These findings were further supported by metabolic labeling studies that showed [1-(14)C]acetate incorporation into lipid extracts was decreased in cells treated with ACSL3 siRNAs and that ACSL3 expression is up-regulated in ob/ob mice and mice fed a high sucrose diet. ACSL3 knockdown decreased total acyl-CoA synthetase activity without substantially altering the expression of other ACSL isoforms. In summary, these results identify a novel role for ACSL3 in mediating transcriptional control of hepatic lipogenesis."

For example, CL is responsible for modulation of the activity of several mitochondrial enzymes involved in the generation of ATP (reviewed in Refs. 8Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 9Hatch G.M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, it has been suggested that CL is the “glue” that holds the mitochondrial respiratory complex together (10Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The role of CL in genetic diseases such as Barth syndrome, a rare X-linked genetic disorder, is beginning to emerge. Barth syndrome is the only known genetic disease in which the specific biochemical defect is a reduction in CL and accumulation of monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) caused by mutations in the TAZ gene (reviewed in Refs. 2Houtkooper R.H. Vaz F.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2493-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 7Chicco A.J. Sparagna G.C. Am. J. Physiol.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5450-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, the role that CL plays in apoptosis is now well documented (reviewed in Ref. 13Ott M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1243-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, maintenance of the appropriate content and fatty acyl composition of CL in mitochondria is essential for proper cellular function. cardiolipin monolysocardiolipin monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase tafazzin matrix activated laser desorption ionization-time of flight Barth syndrome acyllysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 endoplasmic reticulum RNA interference. The molecular composition of CL appears to be important for the biological function of CL. In general, there is a selection of a particular kind of fatty acid as well as restriction of the number of fatty acid species (14Schlame M. Ren M. Xu Y. Greenberg M.L. Haller I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2005; 138: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The major tetra-acyl molecular species found in rat liver (∼57% of total) and bovine heart (∼48% of total) are 18:2 in each of the four fatty acyl positions of the cardiolipin molecule. Remodeling of CL is essential to obtain this enrichment of CL with linoleate because CL synthase has no molecular species substrate specificity for cytidine-5′-diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (15Hostetler K.Y. Galesloot J.M. Boer P. Van Den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, the species pattern of CL precursors is similar enough to imply that the enzymes of the CL synthetic pathway are not molecular species-selective (16Rüstow B. Schlame M. Rabe H. Reichmann G. Kunze D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alterations in the molecular composition of CL are associated with various disease states, including diabetes and Barth syndrome (17Han X. Yang J. Yang K. Zhao Z. Abendschein D.R. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6417-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 18Valianpour F. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Overmars H. van Gennip A.H. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 1390-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Remodeling of CL occurs via at least three enzymes. Mitochondrial CL was shown to be remodeled by a deacylation-reacylation cycle in which newly synthesized CL was rapidly deacylated to MLCL and then reacylated back to CL with linoleoyl-CoA (19Schlame M. Rüstow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A mitochondrial MLCL acyltransferase (MLCL AT) activity was characterized and purified from pig liver mitochondria (20Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An acyl-CoA-dependent reacylation of MLCL to CL was shown to occur in rat liver microsomes (22Eichberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3423-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was identified as acyllysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 (ALCAT1) (23Cao J. Liu Y. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31727-31734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that ALCAT1 expression in endothelial and hematopoietic lineages resulted in elevated hematopoietic and endothelial genes and increased blast colonies and their progenies (24Wang C. Faloon P.W. Tan Z. Lv Y. Zhang P. Ge Y. Deng H. Xiong J.W. Blood. 2007; 110: 3601-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Xiong J.W. Yu Q. Zhang J. Mably J.D. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The opposite effect was observed with ALCAT1 small interfering RNA indicating that ALCAT1 may play a role in the early specification of hematopoietic and endothelial cells (24Wang C. Faloon P.W. Tan Z. Lv Y. Zhang P. Ge Y. Deng H. Xiong J.W. Blood. 2007; 110: 3601-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Xiong J.W. Yu Q. Zhang J. Mably J.D. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to these mitochondrial and microsomal acyltransferase activities, mitochondrial CL may be remodeled by a mitochondrial CL transacylase reaction first described in rat liver (26Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The Barth syndrome gene product tafazzin (TAZ) is a CL transacylase (27Xu Y. Malhotra A. Ren M. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39217-39224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although TAZ specifically remodels mitochondrial CL with linoleic acid, TAZ alone cannot determine the fatty acid profile of mitochondrial CL (3Schlame M. J. Lipid. Res. 2008; 49: 1607-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify a human protein, MLCL AT-1, with a linoleoyl coenzyme A-specific mitochondrial MLCL AT activity. [1-14C]Linoleic acid, [1-14C]linoleoyl coenzyme A, [1-14C]oleoyl coenzyme A, [1-14C]oleic acid, [1-14C]palmitoyl coenzyme A, and [1-14C]palmitic acid were obtained from either DuPont or Amersham Biosciences or American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were products of Invitrogen. Lipid standards were obtained from Serdary Research Laboratories, Englewood Cliffs, NJ. MLCL was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, NY. Thin layer chromatographic plates (silica gel G, 0.25-mm thickness) were obtained from Fisher. Ecolite scintillant was obtained from ICN Biochemicals, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed BTHS lymphoblasts (patient 596) were a generous gift from Dr. Richard Kelley, The John Hopkins University. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed age-matched control lymphoblasts were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ. Western blotting analysis system was used for protein expression studies and was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Kodak X-Omat film was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit was used for PCR studies. All other chemicals were certified ACS grade or better and obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Three kg of pig liver from the local meat packers were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm Tris, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) using a Polytron at medium speed for 5 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min to remove cell membranes and nuclei. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 8,500 rpm for 55 min to isolate the crude mitochondria. One liter of ice-cold buffer A was added and kept at 4 °C for 3 days with intermittent stirring at low speed with a Polytron homogenizer. Thereafter, the extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g to produce a clarified mitochondrial extract (675 ml) that was concentrated to 170 ml by Hollow Fiber (Amicon) concentration and then freeze-dried. The freeze-dried extract was treated with 500 ml of butanol with stirring as described (28Morton R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 26-51Google Scholar). The mitochondrial extract was then subjected to anion exchange chromatography with a Q-Sepharose column that was washed thoroughly with buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. MLCL AT enzyme activity was eluted from the column with 0.3 mm acetyl coenzyme A in buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. This acetyl coenzyme A fraction was dialyzed, freeze-dried, and then applied to a preparatory gel electrophoresis column containing 5% acrylamide. The proteins were separated on the gel with 40 mA constant current with buffer A as the elution buffer. The fractions containing MLCL AT activity were pooled and then applied to a cytidine diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-Sepharose gel and washed with buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. The fraction containing MLCL AT activity was eluted with 5 mm CTP and 0.2 m NaCl in buffer A. The eluted fraction was dialyzed in buffer A and then added to an MLCL-adriamycin affinity column (see below). The MLCL-adriamycin affinity resin was prepared by mixing 30 ml of REACTI-gel (Pierce) with 1.2 mg of adriamycin in 45 ml of 0.1 m borate buffer at 4 °C. Before addition of the partially pure MLCL AT, the gel was mixed with 1 mg of MLCL and washed with 0.1 m borate, pH 8.0. The eluted fraction from above was applied to the MLCL-adriamycin-agarose and washed thoroughly with 0.1 m borate, pH 8.0, until there was no more protein emerging from the column. Finally the MLCL AT activity was eluted from the affinity column with borate buffer containing 1 mm linoleoyl coenzyme A or 1 mm MLCL. A polyvinyl difluoride membrane blot was submitted for MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry analysis (University of Minnesota). The peptide sequences obtained were analyzed by searching the Mascot protein data base for identification of potential homologies with other known proteins. An NCBI BLAST search for known proteins that align with the peptide sequences was performed using the Protein Data Bank. The full-length primers for the human 59-kDa unknown protein (GenBankTM accession number AC011742.3) MLCL AT-1 containing a His6 tag in the reverse primer without stop codon was prepared from Invitrogen (custom primer design) (Table 1). The His tag was required for binding of the protein to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (see below). The primers were amplified using 1 μg of HeLa cell RNA. The cDNAs containing the full-length sequences were inserted into pcDNA 3.1 using the TOPO cloning reaction with pEXP5-CT/TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli One Shot® bacteria (Invitrogen) were transformed with the construct chemically with S.O.C. medium (Invitrogen) and inoculated onto ampicillin containing agar for growth overnight. In the morning, the colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of ampicillin containing LB medium and cultured at 37 °C in an orbital shaker at 220 rpm overnight. The plasmid was purified from the E. coli using the MidiPrep kit (Invitrogen). The sequences of the plasmids were verified by PCR using the specific primers and also by a DNA sequencer (Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology). The recombinant protein was expressed using the cell-free E. coli expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant protein was purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Fisher) when eluted with 200 mm imidazole. When high purity proteins were required, the resin was first of all pre-eluted with high salt (1 m NaCl) and low imidazole concentration (20 mm).TABLE 1Primers used for in vitro protein expression and transfection The cDNA containing the full-length sequence of the human unknown protein, MLCL AT-1, was inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression kit (Invitrogen) and grown in E. coli, and the plasmid was purified and sequence-verified as described above. The plasmid was used for transfection of HeLa cells or BTHS lymphoblasts as described below. RNAi to human MLCL AT-1 was prepared from Invitrogen using the BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer program (Table 1). The RNAi was used for transfection of HeLa cells or lymphoblasts as described below. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To evaluate the effect of the human unknown protein on CL acylation with different species of fatty acid, 13 μg of MLCL AT-1 protein plasmid in 23 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) were added to HeLa cells at 50% confluence. After 24 h, 1 μCi of fatty acid ([1-14C]linoleic acid, [1-14C]oleic acid, or [1-14C]palmitic acid (bound to bovine serum albumin in a 1:1 molar ratio) was added and incubation continued for another 24 h. Cells were then harvested, and radioactivity was incorporated into CL determined as described previously (28Morton R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 26-51Google Scholar). In other experiments, 100 nm of RNAi in 23 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) were added to HeLa cells at 50% confluence. After 24 h, 1 μCi of [1-14C]linoleic acid was added and incubation continued for another 24 h, and radioactivity was incorporated into CL determined as described above. In some experiments, cells were washed twice with ice-cold saline and harvested with 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose) and then homogenized with 30 strokes of a Dounce A homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer and used for assay of mitochondrial enzyme activities as described below. BTHS lymphoblasts and age-matched control lymphoblasts were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum until reaching a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Lymphoblasts were pelleted and placed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) (5 × 106 cells/ml) and incubated with 40 μg of MLCL AT-1 plasmid, and electroporation was performed at 950 microfarads, 250 V, for 23 ms in 800 μl of Opti-MEM using a BTX Electroporation System Electrocell Manipulator 600. Cells were then incubated with 1 μCi [1-14C]linoleic acid for 4 h, and radioactivity was incorporated into CL determined as described above. In other experiments mitochondria from the above cells were prepared as above, and MLCL AT or succinate dehydrogenase activities were determined as described below. In other experiments, 100 nm small interfering RNA was transfected into lymphocytes (5 × 106 cells/ml) by electroporation as described above. Following electroporation the lymphocytes were incubated in 10 ml of Opti-MEM for 19 h. Subsequently the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% each of antimycotic and antibiotic. Incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 was continued for an additional 24 h following which the cells were harvested and the mitochondria isolated as described previously. In other experiments, BTHS lymphoblasts were incubated as above, and CL was isolated and a phosphorous mass of CL determined as described previously (29Hatch G.M. McClarty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25810-25816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MLCL AT activity was determined as described previously (20Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Essentially human recombinant MLCL AT-1 protein (20 ng) or mitochondrial protein (20 μg) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated with 0.3 mm MLCL and [1-14C]linoleoyl coenzyme A (120,000 dpm/nmol) at 37 °C for 1 h or longer for smaller protein quantities. For some reactions [1-14C]linoleoyl coenzyme A was replaced with [1-14C]oleoyl coenzyme A or [1-14C]palmitoyl coenzyme A. The reaction was stopped by the addition of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The organic fraction was isolated by centrifuging the mixture after the addition of 0.9% KCl. After an additional washing of the organic fraction with theoretical upper phase, the chloroform layer was dried with nitrogen, resuspended in 25 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and applied to a Whatman silica gel-coated glass thin layer plate with CL standard. [14C]CL was isolated by two-dimensional chromatography using the following solvent mixtures: first dimension (chloroform/methanol/water, 65:25:4, by volume) and second dimension (chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water, 50:20:10:10:5, by volume). CL was visualized with iodine vapor and silica gel corresponding to the CL spot removed and placed into scintillation vials containing 5 ml of Ecolite scintillant, and radioactivity was determined in an LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). For kinetic analysis in some experiments MLCL AT activity of the recombinant human MLCL AT-1 protein was determined in the presence of a fixed amount of [1-14C]acyl coenzyme A with varying concentrations of MLCL and/or a fixed amount of MLCL with varying concentrations of [1-14C] acyl coenzyme A, and the reciprocal velocity versus substrate concentration was plotted. Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described (30Singer T.P. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1974; 22: 123-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins from the MLCL-adriamycin affinity column eluted with either linoleoyl coenzyme A or MLCL as described above were separated on the Bio-Rad mini gel electrophoresis system using 10% acrylamide containing 0.1% SDS. The disruption buffer (1×, Sigma) included SDS, 2-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue dye. The electrophoresis was performed using synthetic pre-stained molecular markers from Bio-Rad. After the electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, using Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3, with 20% methanol, at 15 V for 1.5 h. The proteins were probed overnight with polyclonal pig liver anti-MLCL AT antibody (21Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The second antibody was anti-rabbit IgG. The protein was visualized on X-Omat film by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In other experiments, 0.5 or 1 μg of recombinant protein from the in vitro protein translation or 12 μg of HeLa cell mitochondrial protein or 1.2 μg of lymphoblast mitochondrial protein was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-MLCL AT-1 antibody as above. The MLCL-AT-1 was visualized by chemiluminescence, and the protein gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein was determined as described (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Student's t test was used for determination of statistical significance. The level of significance was defined as p < 0.05. To identify the human mitochondrial MLCL AT, a pig liver mitochondrial extract was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following elution from the cytidine diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-Sepharose gel the MLCL AT activity containing sample was dialyzed and mixed with MLCL-adriamycin-agarose and then applied to a column and extensively washed with 0.2 m NaCl in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9.0. MLCL AT enzyme activity was eluted with 1.0 mm MLCL (Fig. 1A). The specific activity of fraction 10 was 2,306 pmol/min/mg protein. Western blot analysis of fraction 10 using a polyclonal antibody to the pig liver MLCL AT demonstrated the presence of a protein at 74 kDa (Fig. 1B). In addition, the identical amount of MLCL AT activity could be eluted in fraction 10 with 1.0 mm linoleoyl coenzyme A. Western blot analysis of fraction 10 eluted by linoleoyl-CoA demonstrated the presence of a protein at 74 kDa (Fig. 1B). MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry analysis of the 74-kDa protein revealed peptide matches to enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase, NAD-binding protein containing the Rossmann-fold for NAD(P) binding, and coenzyme A dehydrogenase (Table 2). These motifs are consistent with the 74-kDa pig liver mitochondrial trifunctional protein α (GenBankTM accession number NP_999127). Further peptide analysis indicated the presence of motifs for lipid, coenzyme A, and acyl coenzyme A binding and acyltransferase activity (Table 3). Alignment of human mitochondrial trifunctional protein α (GenBankTM accession number NP_000173) revealed a match with a 59-kDa human unknown protein (GenBankTM protein accession number AAX93141; nucleotide accession number AC011742.3) (Fig. 2). AAX93141 is identical to the C-terminal 59-kDa end of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. Proteins (GenBankTM accession numbers 3BLN_A; 1B3O_A; 2OME_A; and 1IVH_A) identified from the blast search were then aligned using the Cobalt multialignment program in comparison with the NP_000173 and AAX93141 (Fig. 2). Identical amino acids are highlighted, and the location of the peptides and amino acid identities are represented in boldface with the region of agreement underlined (Fig. 2).TABLE 2Trifunctional protein motifs obtained from MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry and BLAST search protein matchesTABLE 2Trifunctional protein motifs obtained from MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry and BLAST search protein matchesTABLE 3Peptide sequences obtained from MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry and BLAST search protein matchesTABLE 3Peptide sequences obtained from MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry and BLAST search protein matchesFIGURE 2Sequence alignment of AAX93141 with proteins identified through peptide matches.

The recombinant protein was then further purified following elution from a nickel resin. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified recombinant protein revealed the 59-kDa protein as a single band (Fig. 3B). Thus, only the 59-kDa protein was present following elution from the nickel resin. Two μg of the purified protein was examined for the ability to acylate MLCL to CL in the presence of [1-14C]linoleoyl coenzyme A. The eluate from the nickel resin prepared from the recombinant protein could acylate MLCL to CL in the presence of [1-14C]linoleoyl coenzyme A (Fig. 3C). No MLCL AT activity was observed in preparations that did not contain expression vector in the in vitro translation system. Thus, the 59-kDa human protein exhibits MLCL AT activity and was termed MLCL"

The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is a predominantly nuclear protein engaged in a number of cellular and viral RNPs for RNA-processing activities, including splicing regulation, nuclear export, microRNA processing, mRNA stability, telomere maintenance, and IRES-mediated translation initiation (7Yang X.

What enables hnRNP A1 to have such broad functions in RNA metabolism is its ability to bind both nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs (10Hamilton B.J. Burns C.M. Nichols R.C. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28732-28741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to its well characterized role in nuclear RNA processing, hnRNP A1 binds to purine-rich sequences of mRNAs for mRNA turnover and translation (13Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G.

Close examination of the HIV-1 vRNA reveals many AG- and AU-rich sequences closely resembling hnRNP A1 binding motifs (15Kotsopoulou E. Kim V.N. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Mitrophanous K.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4839-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In fact, hnRNP A1 binds to a number of sequences on the HIV-1 vRNA such as the cis-acting repressive sequences, instability elements, and exonic splicing silencer elements, and indeed, hnRNP A1 is implicated in the fate of HIV-1 RNA, including splicing regulation, nucleocytoplasmic export, and cytoplasmic stability (16Najera I.

Our previous work demonstrated that hnRNP A1 efficiently immunoprecipitated with the HIV-1 vRNA (22Bériault V. Clément J.F. Lévesque K. Lebel C. Yong X. Chabot B. Cohen E.A. Cochrane A.W. Rigby W.F.

In this work, we show that HIV-1 induces hnRNP A1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in HIV-1-expressing cells hnRNP A1 accumulates in the cytoplasm. Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 is dependent on vRNA nucleocytoplasmic export and a virus-imposed block of hnRNP A1 nuclear import. Additionally, we associate the viral imposed block of hnRNP A1 nuclear import to a significant decrease in the abundance and localization of cellular nuclear pore glycoprotein p62 (Nup62). We also show that the resulting cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 positively regulates HIV-1 IRES-mediated vRNA translation. Thus, we conclude that hnRNP A1 persists as a member of the cytoplasmic HIV-1 RNP due to nuclear pore complex disruption, an effect that directly impacts on HIV-1 expression. Polyclonal anti-hnRNP A2, anti-hnRNP A1, and pan-specific hnRNP antisera were described earlier (22Bériault V. Clément J.F. Lévesque K. Lebel C. Yong X. Chabot B. Cohen E.A. Cochrane A.W. Rigby W.F.

Briefly, 6 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded per well of 6-well plates for Western analysis and IRES activity determination, whereas 3 × 105 cells per well were seeded onto coverslips for imaging studies. Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes (25 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A second transfection with 25 nm siRNA and 2 μg/well of empty vector control, pcDNA3.1, or pNL4-3 proviral DNA was performed 24 h later. In transfections without siRNAs, cells were transfected and collected at the indicated times for analysis. In experiments in which osmotic stress was induced, the growth medium was replaced with one containing 0.6 m d-sorbitol for 1 h prior to harvesting (37Lewis S.M. Veyrier A. Hosszu Ungureanu N. Bonnal S. Vagner S. Holcik M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In studies using LMB, cells were transfected with the bicistronic constructs or pNL4-3, and medium containing 2 nm LMB was added for an additional 12 h prior to cell harvesting (23Lévesque K.

In studies using Mnk kinase inhibitor CGP57380, cells were transfected with the bicistronic constructs or pNL4-3, and DMSO or 20 μm CGP57380 in DMSO containing medium was added to for an additional 20 h after which cells were processed for IF/FISH, IRES activity, and Western analyses. CD4+/CXCR4+ Jurkat CE6.1 T lymphocytes were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 6 × 105 cells were seeded per well of 6-well plates and transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pNL4-3 (2 μg/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were collected at the indicated times, or counted and re-seeded at 6 × 105 cells per well every 3 days. At the indicated collection times, cells were washed and lysed as described above for Western analysis. For T lymphocyte imaging studies, sterile poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were dropped into wells, and cells were allowed to settle onto these for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (38Jolly C. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12088-12094Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), prior to being washed and fixed for analysis. Murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were grown, transfected, and collected for analysis in the same way described for HeLa cells. For Western analysis, cells were collected at 24 h post-transfection, were washed with PBS (pH 7.5), and lysed in NTEN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 Roche Protease inhibitor mixture, and Invitrogen RNaseOUT). Cell lysates were quantified for protein content by the micro Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and equal quantities of protein were loaded into SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall). Blocked membranes were incubated with primary antibodies of interest, and then with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Rockland). The Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cell fractionation studies, the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as previously described prior to Western analysis (39Asai K. Platt C. Cochrane A. Virology. 2003; 314: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For IRES activity determinations, cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 20 μg of cellular protein was used to assess IRES activity with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To calculate IRES activity, IRES-driven Firefly luciferase expression was normalized to cap-dependent Renilla luciferase activity as described (36Brasey A. Lopez-Lastra M. Ohlmann T. Beerens N.

Immunofluorescence (IF) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses have been described elsewhere (22Bériault V. Clément J.F. Lévesque K. Lebel C. Yong X. Chabot B. Cohen E.A.

Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl-Zeiss) or on a WaveFX/Leica spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63× oil immersion objective and an argon/krypton laser. Details on filter sets employed on the Zeiss LSM5 Pascal are described elsewhere (23Lévesque K. Halvorsen M. Abrahamyan L. Chatel-Chaix L. Poupon V. Gordon H. DesGroseillers L. Gatignol A.

Using the WaveFX/Leica spinning disk confocal microscope, AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibody emissions were sequentially captured with 500–550, 570–620, 665–715, or 435–485 nm (for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining) bandpass filters. Images were recorded from laser-scanned cell layers with a thickness of 1 μm and were digitized at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. All images were directly imported into Adobe Photoshop v7.0, processed to generate monochromatic images, and imported into Adobe Illustrator v10.0 for figure montage creation. To calculate the amount of colocalization between antigens of interest, we first used the ImageJ ColocalizeRGB plug-in with default settings to define the overlap between any two antigens of interest (i.e. the pixel ratio between paired channels), then used ImageJ Measure RGB function to get a numerical value for the new color introduced by that overlap. The results of the colocalization analysis were automatically generated as a separate channel by ImageJ. Means and standard deviation were calculated from at least three experiments using 30–50 cells per experimental condition. Colocalization analyses were also confirmed using Imaris version 6.3.1 (Bitplane, Inc.). Surface reconstructions of Nup62 or mab414 staining were generated with Imaris 6.3.1 from the original LSM (Carl-Zeiss, Inc.) image files. The reconstructions were created from a manually selected threshold that defined the objects based on intensity. These reconstructions represent the objects of interest, by bounding the volume of voxels above the manually defined threshold. Then, using the measurement function of Imaris, the relative diameter of the surface staining was measured in 60–80 cross-sections of the nuclear envelope per cell and in 10 cells per experimental condition (±HIV-1) in 4 experiments. We excluded estimations when surface renditions substantially extended into the nucleoplasm. Results are presented as relative thickness of surface renditions of nuclear envelope staining and are not absolute values. We used are artificial, solid objects to visualize the range of interest of a volume object or specific staining. HeLa cells and NIH 3T3 cells were seeded separately (6 × 105 cells seeded per well of 6-well plates) and transfected with constructs of interest 24 h later. In some experiments, HeLa cells were cotransfected with pMyc-A1 and either pcDNA3.1 or pNL4-3, and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pNL4-3. In reverse experimental conditions, NIH 3T3 cells were those cotransfected with pMyc-A1 and either pcDNA3.1 or pNL4-3, and HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pNL4-3. In both cases, cells were washed and trypsinized 24 h later and mixed in equal quantities for re-seeding onto coverslips. After another 20 h of growth, cells were incubated in medium containing 20 μm cycloheximide for 30 min, treated with polyethylene glycol 50% solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 min, and incubated in medium containing 20 μm cycloheximide for an additional 3 h before coverslips were fixed for FISH/IF analysis, where Myc-A1 was identified using a rabbit anti-Myc antibody described above. Statistical significance between means of control and treatment conditions was calculated by using Student's t test with a p < 0.05 judged as significant. Up-regulation of hnRNP A1 has been reported in transformed and rapidly proliferating cells (41Biamonti G. Bassi M.T. Cartegni L. Mechta F. Buvoli M. Cobianchi F. Riva S. J. Mol.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7679-7688PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that hnRNP A1 expression is enhanced during human papilloma virus and HIV-1 infections (43Cheunim T. Zhang J. Milligan S.G. McPhillips M.G. Graham S.V. Virus Res. 2008; 131: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Dowling D. Nasr-Esfahani S. Tan C.H. O'Brien K. Howard J.L. Jans D.A. Purcell D.F. Stoltzfus C.M. Sonza S. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We verified whether hnRNP A1 expression was increased in productively infected T cells by transfecting CD4/CXCR4+ Jurkat CE6.1 T cells with the wild-type proviral HIV-1 DNA construct pNL4-3 and assessing expression levels between 0 and 12 days post-transfection. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting revealed an increase in hnRNP A1 mRNA and protein expression levels at days 6–12 of HIV-1 infection (Fig. 1A, left panel). The peak in hnRNP A1 expression coincided with that of Gag at day 9 post-transfection (Fig. 1A, right panel), and this corresponded to a peak in virus production as determined by p24 in cell supernatants. 4A. Monette and A. J. Mouland, data not shown. Thus, the increases in hnRNP A1 mRNA and protein levels in HIV-1-infected cells coincided with Gag synthesis in these experiments. A number of viral infections are known to induce hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic accumulation (e.g. Refs. 45Gustin K.E. Sarnow P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 46Nelson L.M. Rose R.C. Moroianu J. J. Biol.

Virol. 2009; 83: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been attributed to a disruption in its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity. To determine whether this was true for HIV-1, we transfected Jurkat T lymphocytes with pNL4-3 and collected cells for immunostaining and nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation at 3 days post-transfection. IF/FISH analyses showed that hnRNP A1 accumulated in the cytoplasm of HIV-1-infected cells and colocalized with vRNA (55% ± 5.3 (S.D.)) and to a lesser degree with Gag (42% ± 7.2), but similar to that found between the vRNA and Gag (47% ± 3.7; n = 25 in the experiment shown; Fig. 1B (40Lehmann M.

Interestingly, hnRNP A1 localized in the cytoplasm with both the tetraspanin CD81 and the kinase, Zap-70, host proteins that are both recruited to sites of cell-to-cell contact during HIV-1 transmission (48Sol-Foulon N.

Western analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts revealed that hnRNP A1 is predominantly nuclear in mock or non-infected cells, whereas 60% of the cellular hnRNP A1 is redistributed to the cytoplasm in HIV-1-infected Jurkat T lymphocytes (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, hnRNP A2 was also decreased in the nuclear fraction and was detectable in the cytoplasm of HIV-1-infected cells, but to a lesser extent (i.e. 20%) than hnRNP A1 (Fig. 1C, right panel). Nucleolin and GAPDH served as nuclear and cytoplasmic loading controls. In an earlier report Dowling et al. described an increase in hnRNP A1 expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages. However, in this earlier study (44Dowling D. Nasr-Esfahani S. Tan C.H. O'Brien K. Howard J.L. Jans D.A. Purcell D.F. Stoltzfus C.M. Sonza S. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) hnRNP A1 remained nuclear in contrast to what we observe in T lymphocytes. Based on these conflicting observations we decided to transfect a murine macrophage cell line with pNL4-3. In agreement with Dowling et al., hnRNP A1 expression levels were increased but again remained entirely nuclear (supplemental Fig. S2). In these cells, however, our work shows that vRNA also remained nuclear, and this was reflected in negligible Gag expression. Together these observations suggest that HIV-1-induced hnRNP A1 compartmentalization is cell type-specific. Thus, it is plausible that hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic localization might be important during the course of HIV-1 replication in T lymphocytes. To address the timing of the redistribution of hnRNP A1 during the late expression phase of HIV-1 replication, we followed the fate of hnRNP A1 at various times post-transfection. HeLa cells were transfected with pNL4-3 and processed for IF/FISH at 0–24 h post-transfection. vRNA was detectable in some cells as early as 3 h post-transfection (Fig. 2A). At 6 h, hnRNP A1, Gag, and vRNA accumulated at the nuclear periphery. The immunofluorescence images generated in these experiments show that HeLa cells transfected with HIV-1 exhibited a 44% ± 8.5 (n = 50) increase in hnRNP A1 signal intensity compared with non-transfec"

Behavioral and cell culture experiments suggest an increase in glucose level as a factor in such feeding-induced entrainment. For application of feeding-induced entrainment in humans, nutrient content and dietary variations should be considered.To elucidate the food composition necessary for dietary entrainment, we examined whether complete or partial substitution of dietary nutrients affected phase shifts in liver clocks of mice. Compared with fasting mice or ad libitum fed mice, the liver bioluminescence rhythm advanced by 3-4 h on the middle day in Per2::luciferase knock-in mice that were administered a standard mouse diet, i.e. AIN-93M formula [0.6-0.85 g/10 g mouse BW] (composition: 14% casein, 47% cornstarch, 15% gelatinized cornstarch, 10% sugar, 4% soybean oil, and 10% other [fiber, vitamins, minerals, etc.]), for 2 days. When each nutrient was tested alone (100% nutrient), an insignificant weak phase advance was found to be induced by cornstarch and soybean oil, but almost no phase advance was induced by gelatinized cornstarch, high-amylose cornstarch, glucose, sucrose, or casein. A combination of glucose and casein without oil, vitamin, or fiber caused a significant phase advance. When cornstarch in AIN-93M was substituted with glucose, sucrose, fructose, polydextrose, high-amylose cornstarch, or gelatinized cornstarch, the amplitude of phase advance paralleled the increase in blood glucose concentration.Our results strongly suggest the following: (1) balanced diets containing carbohydrates/sugars and proteins are good for restricted feeding-induced entrainment of the peripheral circadian clock and (2) a balanced diet that increases blood glucose, but not by sugar alone, is suitable for entrainment. These findings may assist in the development of dietary recommendations for on-board meals served to air travelers and shift workers to reduce jet lag-like symptoms."

Mice deficient in TTP develop a severe inflammatory syndrome mainly because of overproduction of tumor necrosis factor α. We report here that TTP also negatively regulates NF-κB signaling at the transcriptional corepressor level, by which it may repress inflammatory gene transcription. TTP expression inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription. However, overexpression of TTP did not affect reporter mRNA stability. Instead, TTP functioned as a corepressor of p65/NF-κB. In support of this concept, we found that TTP physically interacted with the p65 subunit of NF-κB and was also associated with HDAC1, -3, and -7 in vivo. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors or small interfering RNA induced HDAC1 or HDAC3 knockdown completely or partly abolished the inhibitory activity of TTP on NF-κB reporter activation. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed decreased recruitment of HDAC1 and increased recruitment of CREB-binding protein on the Mcp-1 promoter in TTP−/− cells compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, overexpression of TTP blocked CREB-binding protein-induced acetylation of p65/NF-κB.

Accumulating evidence indicates that TTP may have additional functions besides influencing cytokine mRNA stability. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a TTP-related protein is required for effective transmission of a pheromone-induced Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal (11Kanoh J. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, a nim/cdc25 mutant can be complemented by either the Cdc2 kinase or a TTP/TIS11 gene, suggesting a cell cycle effect (12Warbrick E. Glover D. Gene. 1994; 151: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, continuous expression of TTP at physiological levels causes apoptotic cell death (15Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K.

These observations indicate that TTP protein might influence regulatory pathways that regulate survival, differentiation, or proliferation. In a genome-wide analysis of TTP-affected glucocorticoid targets, the half-lives of many TTP target mRNAs were not increased in TTP−/− cells, suggesting a regulatory role for TTP not limited to mRNA turnover (17Ishmael F.T. Fang X. Galdiero M.R. Atasoy U. Rigby W.F. Gorospe M. Cheadle C. Stellato C. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 8342-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, TTP is shuttled between the cytoplasm and nucleus (18Phillips R.S. Ramos S.B. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11606-11613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It promotes mRNA decay in the cytoplasm. However, what it does in the nucleus is unknown.We report here that TTP also negatively regulates NF-κB signaling at the transcriptional corepressor level. It suppresses the transcriptional activity of p65/NF-κB by recruiting HDACs on the NF-κB target gene promoters. These results suggest that TTP may control the inflammatory response through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of transcription in the nucleus and promotion of mRNA decay in the cytoplasm.DISCUSSIONTTP is a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein that was characterized as a destabilizing factor of inflammatory mRNAs (6Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this work, we have provided evidence that TTP also negatively regulates NF-κB signaling in an HDAC-dependent manner. Using reporter assays, we have shown that TTP inhibits NF-κB-mediated gene activation and that such an inhibitory activity of TTP can be overcome by suppressing HDAC activity or expression. By in vivo co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown, TTP was found to physically interact with the p65 subunit of NF-κB and to associate with HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC7. Consistently, TTP did not interfere with NF-κB signaling activation. Instead, TTP diminished p65 acetylation. Furthermore, knockdown of TTP enhanced LPS-induced NF-κB reporter activation, which is consistent with increased CBP recruitment and decreased HDAC1 recruitment on the NF-κB target promoter in TTP−/− cells. Combined with many other reports, these results suggest that TTP may critically regulate inflammatory gene expression through multiple mechanisms, including mRNA transcription and decay. However, the precise mechanisms by which TTP represses mRNA transcription are not completely understood. Our studies suggest that TTP exerts this effect at least partly through recruitment of HDACs to the target promoter and diminishment of p65 acetylation. However, other mechanisms may also exist.Consistent with previously reports, there is low level of TTP protein in resting RAW264.7 cells. LPS treatment caused a marked increase in TTP protein. However, the pattern of p65 co-immunoprecipitation with TTP did not follow the pattern of TTP accumulation (Fig. 4B). It has been reported that LPS regulates TTP at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. LPS-activated signaling pathways can dramatically induce TTP expression, which could also induce phosphorylation of TTP (25Fairhurst A.M. Connolly J.E. Hintz K.A. Goulding N.J. Rassias A.J. Yeager M.P. Rigby W. Wallace P.K. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2003; 5: R214-R225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was observed previously that p38-mediated phosphorylation of TTP can shuttle TTP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and inhibit TTP binding to mRNA (26Johnson B.A. Stehn J.R. Yaffe M.B. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18029-18036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Carballo E. Cao H. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Campbell D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42580-42587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that LPS stimulates the binding of TTP to p65 at an early time point (4 h) by induction of TTP expression and prevents TTP interaction with p65 at a late time point (8 h) by phosphorylation. This may also explain why TNFα treatment reduced TTP interaction with p65 in the overexpressing cell line (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, Zhu et al. (28Zhu W. Brauchle M.A. Di Padova F. Gram H. New L. Ono K. Downey J.S. Han J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L499-L508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also observed that p38-mediated TTP phosphorylation can release the suppressive effect of TTP on TNFα transcription.Our results suggest that TTP may also negatively regulate AP-1- and STAT-mediated signaling pathways, as overexpression of TTP also repressed AP-1 and STAT reporter activity (data not shown). However, there is no direct association of TTP with c-Fos/c-Jun or STAT1, suggesting that TTP may repress AP-1- and STAT-mediated signaling pathways through different mechanisms.One may ask whether the inhibitory effect of TTP on NF-κB signaling is dependent on its RNA-destabilizing activity. We observed that the first zinc finger mutant of TTP also significantly suppressed NF-κB activation with less potency compared with the wild-type TTP protein. Because any zinc finger mutation of TTP protein completely loses its RNA-binding activity (29Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9606-9613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the effect of TTP on NF-κB signaling may be independent of its RNA-destabilizing activity but that its two zinc fingers may be required for transcription repression.As reported previously, expression of TTP not only causes apoptotic cell death but also sensitizes cells to induction of apoptosis by TNFα (15Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Johnson B.A. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4237-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these events are not clear. It was well established that maturing activated monocytes face a choice between NF-κB-dependent survival and differentiation and death by TNFα-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that overexpression of TTP may promote TNFα-induced apoptosis through repression of NF-κB signaling.At least 55 CCCH zinc finger genes exist in the human genome (30Liang J. Song W. Tromp G. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although most of the CCCH proteins have been less characterized, most of the characterized CCCH proteins are RNA-binding proteins and regulate RNA metabolism, including mRNA maturation, export, modification, and turnover (30Liang J. Song W. Tromp G. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, there are also some CCCH proteins that regulate mRNA transcription. For instance, PIE-1 is a Caenorhabditis elegans protein that contains two central CCCH zinc fingers. PIE-1 can function as a transcription repressor by targeting to the basic transcriptional machinery (31Batchelder C. Dunn M.A. Choy B. Suh Y. Cassie C. Shim E.Y. Shin T.H. Mello C. Seydoux G. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified the novel CCCH protein MCPIP1, which also represses TNFα transcription but does not affect its mRNA stability (19Liang J. Wang J. Azfer A. Song W. Tromp G. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6337-6346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Actually, TTP was also reported to interfere with the transcriptional activity of Tax by directly interacting with Tax protein (32Twizere J.C. Kruys V. Lefèbvre L. Vanderplasschen A. Collete D. Debacq C. Lai W.S. Jauniaux J.C. Bernstein L.R. Semmes O.J. Burny A. Blackshear P.J. Kettmann R. Willems L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 1846-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Zhu et al. (28Zhu W. Brauchle M.A. Di Padova F. Gram H. New L. Ono K. Downey J.S. Han J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L499-L508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also observed that TTP can inhibit TNFα and IL-8 promoter activity. Considering that TTP is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, these results strongly indicate that TTP is a candidate to couple transcription in the nucleus and mRNA decay in the cytoplasm. In yeast, the RNA-binding protein Rpb4/7 couples the two processes of transcription in the nucleus and mRNA decay in the cytoplasm (21Goler-Baron V. Selitrennik M. Barkai O. Haimovich G. Lotan R. Choder M. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In summary, we report that TTP, an RNA-destabilizing protein, also functions as a transcriptional corepressor of NF-κB. These results suggest that TTP may critically control the inflammatory response by multiple mechanisms and is a potential therapeutic target for human inflammatory diseases. The transcription factor NF-κB mediates the major inflammatory signal pathways and regulates the most inflammatory gene expression (1O'Neill L.A. Nat. Rev.

By in vivo co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown, TTP was found to physically interact with the p65 subunit of NF-κB and to associate with HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC7. Consistently, TTP did not interfere with NF-κB signaling activation. Instead, TTP diminished p65 acetylation. Furthermore, knockdown of TTP enhanced LPS-induced NF-κB reporter activation, which is consistent with increased CBP recruitment and decreased HDAC1 recruitment on the NF-κB target promoter in TTP−/− cells. Combined with many other reports, these results suggest that TTP may critically regulate inflammatory gene expression through multiple mechanisms, including mRNA transcription and decay. However, the precise mechanisms by which TTP represses mRNA transcription are not completely understood. Our studies suggest that TTP exerts this effect at least partly through recruitment of HDACs to the target promoter and diminishment of p65 acetylation. However, other mechanisms may also exist.Consistent with previously reports, there is low level of TTP protein in resting RAW264.7 cells. LPS treatment caused a marked increase in TTP protein. However, the pattern of p65 co-immunoprecipitation with TTP did not follow the pattern of TTP accumulation (Fig. 4B). It has been reported that LPS regulates TTP at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. LPS-activated signaling pathways can dramatically induce TTP expression, which could also induce phosphorylation of TTP (25Fairhurst A.M. Connolly J.E. Hintz K.A. Goulding N.J. Rassias A.J. Yeager M.P. Rigby W. Wallace P.K. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2003; 5: R214-R225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was observed previously that p38-mediated phosphorylation of TTP can shuttle TTP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and inhibit TTP binding to mRNA (26Johnson B.A. Stehn J.R. Yaffe M.B.

Our results suggest that LPS stimulates the binding of TTP to p65 at an early time point (4 h) by induction of TTP expression and prevents TTP interaction with p65 at a late time point (8 h) by phosphorylation. This may also explain why TNFα treatment reduced TTP interaction with p65 in the overexpressing cell line (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, Zhu et al. (28Zhu W. Brauchle M.A. Di Padova F. Gram H. New L. Ono K. Downey J.S. Han J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L499-L508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also observed that p38-mediated TTP phosphorylation can release the suppressive effect of TTP on TNFα transcription.Our results suggest that TTP may also negatively regulate AP-1- and STAT-mediated signaling pathways, as overexpression of TTP also repressed AP-1 and STAT reporter activity (data not shown). However, there is no direct association of TTP with c-Fos/c-Jun or STAT1, suggesting that TTP may repress AP-1- and STAT-mediated signaling pathways through different mechanisms.One may ask whether the inhibitory effect of TTP on NF-κB signaling is dependent on its RNA-destabilizing activity. We observed that the first zinc finger mutant of TTP also significantly suppressed NF-κB activation with less potency compared with the wild-type TTP protein. Because any zinc finger mutation of TTP protein completely loses its RNA-binding activity (29Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9606-9613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the effect of TTP on NF-κB signaling may be independent of its RNA-destabilizing activity but that its two zinc fingers may be required for transcription repression.As reported previously, expression of TTP not only causes apoptotic cell death but also sensitizes cells to induction of apoptosis by TNFα (15Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Johnson B.A. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4237-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these events are not clear. It was well established that maturing activated monocytes face a choice between NF-κB-dependent survival and differentiation and death by TNFα-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that overexpression of TTP may promote TNFα-induced apoptosis through repression of NF-κB signaling.At least 55 CCCH zinc finger genes exist in the human genome (30Liang J. Song W. Tromp G. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although most of the CCCH proteins have been less characterized, most of the characterized CCCH proteins are RNA-binding proteins and regulate RNA metabolism, including mRNA maturation, export, modification, and turnover (30Liang J. Song W. Tromp G. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, there are also some CCCH proteins that regulate mRNA transcription. For instance, PIE-1 is a Caenorhabditis elegans protein that contains two central CCCH zinc fingers. PIE-1 can function as a transcription repressor by targeting to the basic transcriptional machinery (31Batchelder C. Dunn M.A. Choy B. Suh Y. Cassie C. Shim E.Y. Shin T.H. Mello C. Seydoux G. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified the novel CCCH protein MCPIP1, which also represses TNFα transcription but does not affect its mRNA stability (19Liang J. Wang J. Azfer A. Song W. Tromp G. Kolattukudy P.E.

Actually, TTP was also reported to interfere with the transcriptional activity of Tax by directly interacting with Tax protein (32Twizere J.C. Kruys V. Lefèbvre L. Vanderplasschen A. Collete D.

Considering that TTP is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, these results strongly indicate that TTP is a candidate to couple transcription in the nucleus and mRNA decay in the cytoplasm. In yeast, the RNA-binding protein Rpb4/7 couples the two processes of transcription in the nucleus and mRNA decay in the cytoplasm (21Goler-Baron V. Selitrennik M. Barkai O. Haimovich G. Lotan R.

These results suggest that TTP may critically control the inflammatory response by multiple mechanisms and is a potential therapeutic target for human inflammatory diseases. TTP is a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein that was characterized as a destabilizing factor of inflammatory mRNAs (6Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis Res.

https://openalex.org/W2125226304,"Nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) catalyze the conversion of l-arginine to nitric oxide and citrulline. There are three NOS isozymes, each with a different physiological role: neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS, and inducible NOS (iNOS). NOSs consist of an N-terminal oxygenase domain and a C-terminal reductase domain, linked by a calmodulin (CaM)-binding region. CaM is required for NO production, but unlike other NOS isozymes, iNOS binds CaM independently of the exogenous Ca(2+) concentration. We have co-expressed CaM and the FMN domain of human iNOS, which includes the CaM-binding region. The Ca(2+)-bound protein complex (CaCaMxFMN) forms an air-stable semiquinone when reduced with NADPH and reduces cytochrome c when reconstituted with the iNOS FAD/NADPH domain. We have solved the crystal structure of the CaCaMxFMN complex in four different conformations, each with a different relative orientation, between the FMN domain and the bound CaM. The CaM-binding region together with bound CaM forms a hinge, pivots on the conserved Arg(536), and regulates electron transfer from FAD to FMN and from FMN to heme by adjusting the relative orientation and distance among the three cofactors. In addition, the relative orientations of the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM are also different among the four conformations, suggesting that the flexibility between the two halves of CaM also contributes to the fine tuning of the orientation/distance between the redox centers. The data demonstrate a possible mode for precise control of electron transfer by altering the distance and orientation of redox centers in a protein displaying domain movement."
https://openalex.org/W2008571017,"While the sense of bodily ownership has now been widely investigated through the rubber hand illusion (RHI), very little is known about the sense of disownership. It has been hypothesized that the RHI also affects the ownership feelings towards the participant's own hand, as if the rubber hand replaced the participant's actual hand. Somatosensory changes observed in the participants' hand while experiencing the RHI have been taken as evidence for disownership of their real hand. Here we propose a theoretical framework to disambiguate whether such somatosensory changes are to be ascribed to the disownership of the real hand or rather to the anomalous visuo-proprioceptive conflict experienced by the participant during the RHI.In experiment 1, reaction times (RTs) to tactile stimuli delivered to the participants' hand slowed down following the establishment of the RHI. In experiment 2, the misalignment of visual and proprioceptive inputs was obtained via prismatic displacement, a situation in which ownership of the seen hand was doubtless. This condition slowed down the participants' tactile RTs. Thus, similar effects on touch perception emerged following RHI and prismatic displacement. Both manipulations also induced a proprioceptive drift, toward the fake hand in the first experiment and toward the visual position of the participants' hand in the second experiment.These findings reveal that somatosensory alterations in the experimental hand resulting from the RHI result from cross-modal mismatch between the seen and felt position of the hand. As such, they are not necessarily a signature of disownership."

To explore the cell cycle regulation of FoxM1, we examined the phosphorylation profile of FoxM1. Here, we show that the phosphorylated status and the activity of FoxM1 increase as cells progress from S to G2/M phases. Moreover, dephosphorylation of FoxM1 coincides with exit from mitosis. Using mass spectrometry, we have identified a new conserved phosphorylation site (Ser-251) within the forkhead domain of FoxM1. Disruption of Ser-251 inhibits phosphorylation of FoxM1 and dramatically decreases its transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that the Ser-251 residue is required for CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of FoxM1 as well as its interaction with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP).

Foxm1−/−-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts display not only polyploidy genotype but also premature senescence, suggesting that Foxm1 is required for the maintenance of chromosomal integrity.

Thus, exploring how the function of FoxM1b is regulated in the cell might have significant impact on the design of anti-cancer therapeutics. Expression of the FoxM1b protein is barely detectable in quiescent cells. During re-entry into the cell cycle, FoxM1b is expressed at late G1/early S phase and sustained throughout G2 phase and mitosis (10Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 13Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the transcriptional activity of FoxM1b is dependent upon the activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which activates FoxM1b through cyclin-CDKs (29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of FoxM1b contains a cyclin-binding motif (LXL motif), and both CDK1 and CDK2 were shown to associate with FoxM1b. Mutation of the cyclin-binding motif eliminates the binding of both CDK1 and CDK2 (29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Further analysis reveals that the Leu-641 residue within an LXL motif is required for the recruitment of the cyclin-CDK complex, and the Thr-596 residue is a critical CDK1 phosphorylation site within the activation domain of FoxM1b. CDK-dependent phosphorylation stimulates the FoxM1b transcriptional activity, which correlates with binding to the CREB-binding protein (CBP), the transcriptional coactivator. Mutation of Thr-596 abolishes binding to CBP and inhibits FoxM1b transcriptional activity (29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We and others have characterized an autorepression domain in the N-terminal region between residues 1 and 232 of FoxM1b (16Wierstra I. Alves J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Park H.J. Wang Z. Costa R.H. Tyner A. Lau L.F. Raychaudhuri P.

Biol. 2008; 28: 3076-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal repression domain renders FoxM1b constitutively active and independent of cyclin-CDK. The N-terminal repression domain inhibits FoxM1b transcriptional activity presumably by binding to the C-terminal activation domain. It is postulated that cyclin-CDK-mediated phosphorylation activates FoxM1b by disrupting the interaction of the N-terminal repression domain with the C-terminal activation domain (16Wierstra I. Alves J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Park H.J. Wang Z. Costa R.H. Tyner A. Lau L.F. Raychaudhuri P.

Biol. 2008; 28: 3076-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These observations indicated a critical role of cyclin-CDK phosphorylation in the cell cycle-regulated activation of FoxM1b. However, the mechanism of temporal activation of a subset genes by FoxM1b at the G1/S and G2/M phases remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the phosphorylation pattern of the endogenous FoxM1 protein during progression through the cell cycle. We show that the endogenous FoxM1 protein maintains a hypophosphorylation state at the G1/S boundary, exhibits increased phosphorylation status from S phase to G2/M transition, and reaches its maximal phosphorylation status at mitosis. FoxM1 is dephosphorylated upon the completion of mitosis. The transcriptional activity of FoxM1b increases through the cell cycle and coincides with the phosphorylation status of FoxM1. Consistent with a recent study (32Fu Z. Malureanu L. Huang J. Wang W. Li H. van Deursen J.M. Tindal D.J. Chen J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we observed that PLK1 interacts with FoxM1 in M phase, phosphorylates FoxM1b on Ser-724 at the C terminus, and stimulates its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we identified a novel, conserved phosphorylation site at Ser-251 within the forkhead box DNA binding domain of hyperphosphorylated FoxM1b using tandem mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography-MS/MS). Mutation of Ser-251 to alanine interferes with neither the subcellular localization nor the DNA binding ability of FoxM1b. However, the S251A mutant exhibits deficiency in undergoing phosphorylation by CDK1, remains predominantly hypophosphorylated and shows significantly diminished transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of the S251A mutant protein fails to be activated by CDK1, but remains responsive to PLK1 stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of FoxM1b is temporally regulated through phosphorylation modifications by multiple protein kinases during progression of the cell cycle. Moreover, we show that phosphorylation of Ser-251 in the forkhead box domain of FoxM1b is a critical event for activation of its transcriptional activity at the G2/M phases by CDK1. Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc.) and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free tissue culture medium following the manufacturer's protocol. Four hours after transfection, cells were fed with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell cycle synchronization was performed by double thymidine block. U2OS cells were arrested at G1/S transition for 17 h with 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma) with a 7-h release interval. Arrested cells were released into fresh medium to follow cell cycle progression. To analyze cell cycle progression, flow cytometry analyses were carried out using a Beckman Coulter EPICS Elite ESP apparatus, and data were analyzed by FCSPress software (Ray Hicks, FCSPress, Cambridge, UK). To isolate mitotic cells, we used the mitotic shake-off method. Briefly, U2OS cells were arrested by 300 ng/ml of nocodazole (Sigma) treatment for 16 h. The partially detached nocodazole-arrested cells were shaken-off and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before being plated to allow re-entry into the cell cycle. The pCMV T7-FoxM1b expression vector, 6×FoxM1 TATA luciferase reporter plasmid, and −749 bp Aurora B promoter-luciferase construct are described previously (19Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the FoxM1b point mutations were verified by sequencing (University of Illinois, Chicago, DNA Sequencing Facility). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation: mouse monoclonal T7 tag (Novagen, Madison, WI); mouse monoclonal Plk1 (F8), mouse monoclonal CBP (C1), normal mouse IgG, and normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse monoclonal Plk1 (pT210), mouse monoclonal cyclin B1 (GNS-11) (BD Biosciences); mouse monoclonal MPM2, rabbit anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser-10) (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY); rabbit phospho-Rb (Ser-795) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); mouse anti-α-tubulin (T6074), mouse anti-β-actin (A5441) (Sigma); and rabbit polyclonal anti-FoxM1 antibody was generated as described previously (19Wang I.C.

All procedures including lyses, clarification, and immunoprecipitation were performed at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts were prepared using the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described (29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For lysis, cells were incubated for 20 min in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants were collected. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with 500 μg of total protein extract from each sample. Cell lysates were first pre-cleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The supernatants were then incubated with 2 μg of antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted from the beads in SDS sample buffer. Coimmunoprecipitated proteins were then detected by Western blot analysis. For the dephosphorylation assay using λ-phosphatase, FoxM1 immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors and resuspended in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij 35). Parallel samples were incubated with or without 100 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 30 °C for 30 min. U2OS cells were plated in a 24-well plate at a density of 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected using 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 with 0.1 μg of either pCMV FoxM1b expression construct or pCMV empty vector, 0.2 μg of either 6×FoxM1 TATA luciferase reporter or the −749 bp Aurora B promoter luciferase reporter, and 1 ng of pCMV-Renilla luciferase, which serve as an internal control. Twenty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested and extracts were prepared for dual luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously. The luciferase levels were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (19Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10875-10894Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate, and repeated twice. A vector expressing T7-FoxM1b was coexpressed with either wild type or kinase-dead PLK1 plasmid in U2OS cells in five 15-cm dishes. T7-FoxM1b was immunoprecipitated by T7 tag antibody-conjugated beads (Novagen). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved in 7% SDS-PAGE. The hyper- and hypophosphorylated forms of the FoxM1b protein were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The gel bands were excised, washed, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma), and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) followed by digestion with modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). The extracted tryptic peptides were analyzed by data-dependent reversed-phase microcapillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). MS/MS spectra were searched against the concatenated target and decoy (reversed) Swiss-Prot protein data base using Sequest (Proteomics Browser, ThermoFisher Scientific) with differential modifications for Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation (+79.97) and the sample processing artifacts for Met oxidation (+15.99) and Cys alkylation (+57.02). Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptide sequences were identified if they initially passed the following Sequest scoring thresholds: 1+ ions, Xcorr ≥ 2.0, Sf ≥ 0.4, p ≥ 5; 2+ ions, Xcorr ≥ 2.0, Sf ≥ 0.4, p ≥ 5; 3+ ions, Xcorr ≥ 2.60, Sf ≥ 0.4, p ≥ 5 against the target protein data base. Passing MS/MS spectra that represented the phosphorylated forms in the FoxM1b sequence were manually inspected to be sure that all b- and y-fragment ions aligned with the assigned sequence and modification sites. Determination of the exact sites of phosphorylation was aided using GraphMod software (Proteomics Browser). For the in vitro kinase assays, 500 μg of protein lysates from U2OS cells transfected with T7-FoxM1b wild type or S251A mutant plasmids were coimmunoprecipitated overnight with T7 tag antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. To start the kinase reaction, 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of recombinant cyclin B1-CDK1 proteins was added to the beads, and samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and then dried prior to autoradiography. T7-FoxM1b wild type and S251A mutant constructs were subcloned from pCMV T7-FoxM1b and pCMV T7-FoxM1bS251A vectors into a pLPCX-puro vector, respectively. Retrovirus stocks were prepared by transfecting 24 μg of the vectors into the Amphotropic 293 cells in a 15-cm plate using the calcium phosphate method. Viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection, filtered, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C until use (pLPCX-puro vector and Amphotropic 293 cells were kindly provided by Chia-Chen Chen, University of Illinois, Chicago). U2OS cells were transduced by concentrated viral supernatant in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10 μg/ml Polybrene. Forty-eight hours after transduction, cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin. A modified McKay assay was performed with the double-stranded FoxM1 binding site oligonucleotide (from 6×FoxM1 TATA-luciferase reporter gene) (29Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, U2OS cells, transfected with a vector expressing either T7-FoxM1b wild type or S251A mutant protein, were lysed in 1 ml of McKay binding buffer (10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors). Cell debris was removed from the supernatant by spinning down at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Three hundred micrograms of cell extract was pre-cleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) (Amersham Biosciences) for 40 min and then incubated with 500,000 cpm of 32P-labeled FoxM1 binding site oligonucleotide, 35 μl of T7 tag antibody-conjugated beads (Novagen), and 1 μg/μl of poly(dI/dC) overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the McKay washing buffer (2% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors), and resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Five micrograms of proteinase K were then added and samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The 32P-labeled FoxM1 binding site oligonucleotides were purified using the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen), eluted with 20 μl of ddH2O and resolved on 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gel. For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of cold probe was preincubated with extract for 10 min prior to the binding reaction. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. U2OS, U2OS-WT, and U2OS-251A cell lines were used to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay as described (39Hunter"
https://openalex.org/W1979660397,"Vinculin links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton by binding F-actin. Little is known with respect to how this interaction occurs or affects actin dynamics. Here we assess the consequence of the vinculin tail (VT) on actin dynamics by examining its binding to monomeric and filamentous yeast actins. VT causes pyrene-labeled G-actin to polymerize in low ionic strength buffer (G-buffer), conditions that normally do not promote actin polymerization. Analysis by electron microscopy shows that, under these conditions, the filaments form small bundles at low VT concentrations, which gradually increase in size until saturation occurs at a ratio of 2 VT:1 actin. Addition of VT to pyrene-labeled mutant yeast G-actin (S265C) produced a fluorescence excimer band, which requires a relatively normal filament geometry. In higher ionic strength polymerization-promoting F-buffer, substoichiometric amounts of VT accelerate the polymerization of pyrene-labeled WT actin. However, the amplitude of the pyrene fluorescence caused by actin polymerization is quenched as the VT concentration increases without an effect on net actin polymerization as determined by centrifugation assays. Finally, addition of VT to preformed pyrene-labeled S265C F-actin causes a concentration-dependent decrease in the maximum amplitude of the pyrene fluorescence band demonstrating the ability of VT to remodel the conformation of the actin filament. These observations support the idea that vinculin can link adhesion plaques to the cytoskeleton by initiating the formation of bundled actin filaments or by remodeling existing filaments.

Cell migration is critical for embryonic development, adult homeostasis, inflammatory responses, and wound healing. To migrate, a cell must coordinate a number of different inputs into appropriate cellular responses. The cell must polarize in the direction of migration and extend lamellipodial and/or filopodial protrusions. Nascent adhesions that assemble within the branched actin network of the lamellipodium must link to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. This process allows for the maturation of adhesions to structures that anchor the protrusion. These adhesions also provide the traction forces necessary to pull the cell body forward and break older adhesions at the cell rear. Perturbation of any of these events affects a cell's migratory ability. For example, nascent adhesions that do not form linkages to the actin cytoskeleton cannot effectively anchor the protrusion to the substratum. The result is an extension that folds back upon itself, forming a membrane ruffle that cannot provide the traction forces necessary for migration. How adhesions establish links to the underlying actin cytoskeleton has been an area of intense investigation. Integrin-containing structures are active areas of actin polymerization suggesting that adhesion plaques can initiate actin filament formation (reviewed in Refs. 1DeMali K.A. Burridge K. J.

Focal complexes are small integrin clusters that are found exclusively at the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia. Formation of these structures is closely coupled with actin assembly in protruding regions of cells.

FAK has also been implicated in linking focal complexes to the actin cytoskeleton by virtue of its ability to recruit and activate the Arp2/3 complex (8Serrels B. Serrels A. Brunton V.G. Holt M. McLean G.W. Gray C.H. Jones G.E. Frame M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, efficient focal complex assembly requires the actin-binding protein, cortactin, which could affect adhesion assembly by interacting with the Arp2/3 complex (9Bryce N.S. Clark E.S. Leysath J.L. Currie J.D. Webb D.J. Weaver A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1276-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Hence, many of the known mechanisms for initiating filament formation involve recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex, which initiates the formation of branched actin filaments (55Mullins R.D. Stafford W.F. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is surprising then that the earliest detectable forms of actin-associated adhesions are interconnected by short actin bundles, not branched filaments (10Zimerman B. Volberg T. Geiger B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 58: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that our current understanding for how nascent adhesions initiate filament formation is incomplete. The earliest detectable actin-associated adhesions are “dots or doublets of dots” and are highly enriched in integrins, paxillin, and vinculin (10Zimerman B. Volberg T. Geiger B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 58: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of these molecules has the capability to initiate actin filament formation from such a plaque. Vinculin has long been implicated in linking adhesion plaques to the actin cytoskeleton by virtue of the ability of its tail to bind (11Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and bundle F-actin (12Jockusch B.M. Isenberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Upon binding actin, vinculin undergoes a conformational change that promotes dimerization suggesting that vinculin self-association may be important for its bundling activities (15Johnson R.P.

Less is known with respect to the effect of vinculin on actin filament formation and structure. This lack of knowledge stems from the fact that many of the early studies showed vinculin to have no effect on actin dynamics (26Rosenfeld G.C. Hou D.C. Dingus J. Meza I. Bryan J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Otto J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Wilkins J.A. Lin S. Cell. 1982; 28: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, these experiments were performed using chicken gizzard vinculin, which exists almost exclusively in a conformation where the actin binding sites are inaccessible, or from preparations that contain contaminants that produce false negatives (29Wilkins J.A. Lin S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). More recently, recombinant VT proteins were shown to cross-link and bundle actin (23Goldmann W.H. Guttenberg Z. Tang J.X. Kroy K. Isenberg G. Ezzell R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of vinculin with G-actin and the effect of vinculin on actin filament dynamics have not been explored. In this study, we have assessed the interaction of vinculin with pyrene-labeled wild-type and mutant yeast actins. We show that the VT can promote the formation of an actin nucleus from which filaments arise and alter the assembly and structure of actin filaments. These findings provide novel insights into how adhesion plaques may be linked to the actin cytoskeleton. The actins were purified from the lysates of frozen yeast cells by a combination of DNase I affinity chromatography, DE52 anion-exchange chromatography, and polymerization/depolymerization cycling as described previously (30Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type actin was obtained from yeast cakes purchased at a local market, whereas S265C actin was obtained from cells we had previously generated carrying the mutant actin (31Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (Sigma) with actins was performed as described in Feng et al. (31Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To conjugate actin at Cys-374 with Oregon Green 488 maleimide or N′-(3-maleimidypropionyl)biocytin, the maleimide derivatives were resuspended in DMSO and incubated with yeast F-actin at a molar ratio of 3:1 and 5:1, respectively, for 3 h at room temperature. The F-actin was separated from the reactants by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in G-buffer. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder as previously described (32Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified unmodified and modified actins were stored as the Ca2+-bound form in calcium G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT) at 4 °C and used within 4 days of purification. Escherichia coli carrying the plasmid pGEX-4T1, which encodes amino acids 881–1066 of chick vinculin, was obtained from David Critchley (University of Leicester). For expression of this vinculin fragment, known as the vinculin tail (VT), the cells were grown to early log phase and induced for 1 h. at 37 °C with 1 mm IPTG. Bacteria were then suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) plus the same set of protease inhibitors used for actin purification (30Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysozyme (Sigma) and DNase I (Worthington) at final concentrations of 0.2 μg/ml and 0.02 μg/ml, respectively, were added to the cell suspension, which was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with agitation. Following sonication of the cells, the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 4 °C in a Ti60 rotor at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatant solution was filtered through four layers of gauze and passed over a GST-Sepharose column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with HTND buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT) followed by washes with LTND substituting 25 mm NaCl for 500 mm NaCl. The GST-VT was eluted from the column with LTND containing 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma), and the GST was cleaved from the GST-VT with 40 units of human thrombin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. The VT peptide, 881–1066, was separated from the GST and thrombin by passing the solution over a DE52 DEAE column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25 mm NaCl and collecting the flow-through fractions. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the A280 (ϵ = 18,470 m−1cm−1). Either pyrene-labeled or unlabeled yeast calcium G-actin in Ca-G-buffer was converted to the magnesium form 2 min prior to use by dilution of the concentrated stock actin at least 10-fold into Mg2+-G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT). For assessing the actin-VT interaction in Mg2+ G-buffer, the actin was diluted with G-buffer to a concentration of 1 μm, and the baseline fluorescence was determined. VT was added, and the resulting change in fluorescence was followed until a steady state was obtained. For all assays, the excitation wavelength was 365 nm. For WT actin, single wavelength kinetic assays were carried out with an emission wavelength of 386 nm. For studies involving S265C actin, emission spectra were recorded between 375 and 550 nm. For VT-actin co-polymerization assays, VT was added to 1 μm G-actin, labeled or unlabeled in Mg2+ G-buffer. For pyrene assays, the increase in fluorescence was allowed to reach steady state after which 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl were added to induce actin polymerization. The subsequent change in fluorescence was recorded as a function of time. All fluorescence assays were performed in a final volume of 120 μl in a microcuvette housed in a thermostatted sample compartment of either a Fluorolog-3 or FluoroMax-3 spectrometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex). To quantitate the amount of actin filaments or bundles formed and the amount of actin-bound VT, the appropriate concentration of VT was combined with 1 μm Mg2+ G-actin in Mg2+ buffer as above. The sample, either before or after addition of MgCl2 and KCl to induce polymerization, was subjected to centrifugation in a TLA.1 rotor at 25 °C using a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. To assess filament formation, centrifugation was for 15 min at 80,000 rpm. For assessment of bundle formation, centrifugation was at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant fractions were carefully removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of distilled water. The entire pellet and one-fourth of the supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12% acrylamide gels. The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and the density of the bands was quantitated using an Epson Perfection 2450 photo scanner and ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) ensuring that the intensities of the bands were within the linear response range of the instrument. Band densities for actin and VT were normalized based on their relative molecular weights, and the resulting data were utilized to calculate VT/actin ratios in the pellet fractions. To visualize actin filaments and filament bundles, a 3-μl sample from an actin-VT solution was deposited on a carbon-coated Formvar grid (400 mesh) and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The sample was then observed using a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope housed in the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Facility. Two types of experiments were performed to examine the actin-VT interaction. In one, the increase in pyrene fluorescence following VT addition was followed as a function of time. In the second, VT-induced actin bundling was followed as a function of the amount of material pelleted in a co-sedimentation assay as described above. For the G-actin co-sedimentation study, we utilized two different types of data from the same experiment. One was the percentage of total actin pelleted (Fig. 3A), and the other the molar ratio of VT/actin in the pelleted material (Fig. 3B). We then generated Fig. 3C, a graph of VT-bound versus VT total using the Equation 1, where T = total. [VT]actin-bound=[VT]precipitated[actin]precipitated×[actin]precipitated[actin]T×[actin]T(Eq. 1) The data in Fig. 3C were then fitted to a quadric binding equation (Equation 2) in which the value of F was set at 1. [VT]bound=F×([actin]T+[VT]T+Kd)-([actin]T+[VT]T+Kd)-4×[actin]T×[VT]T2(Eq. 2) In this analysis, to obtain a good fit, we needed to assume that each actin monomer contains two independent VT binding sites. Thus, the total actin concentration shown is the concentration of sites rather than the actual actin concentration. Kd values were then obtained as previously described (33Wen K.K. McKane M. Houtman J.C. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9444-9453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the pyrene assays we used the same basic quadratic equation to analyze the increase in fluorescence over time. However, we multiplied the right side of Equation 2 by the total change in fluorescence for each VT concentration used (represented by F). For the quenching-based assay in Fig. 9, we used the same quadratic equation but, instead of net fluorescence change, we used the value of 1 − F. The flow cell was essentially prepared as described by Kuhn and Pollard (34Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Cells were coated with avidin (NeutrAvidin, Invitrogen) by allowing 15 μl of 50 nm avidin dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) to enter the cell via capillary action. The loaded cell was incubated in a humid chamber for at least 30 min at room temperature, and the excess avidin was removed by washing the cell with Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin and then TIRF buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 15 μm glucose, 0.5% methylcellulose, 20 μg/ml catalase, 100 μg of glucose oxidase). Calcium-actin mixtures containing 52% unlabeled actin, 33% Oregon Green 488 maleimide-actin, and 15% N′-(3-maleimidypropionyl)biocytin-actin were converted to Mg-actin as described above. For monitoring actin polymerization, the Mg-actin mixture was diluted to a final concentration of 2 μm in TIRF buffer. In a separate tube, VT was diluted to 5.0 μm in a modified TIRF buffer containing 0.2 mm MgCl2. The two samples were combined resulting in a mixture containing 1.0 μm actin and 2.5 μm VT. A 10-μl aliquot was immediately loaded into the cell by capillary action, and the cell was mounted on a Leica AM TIRF MC imaging system. Images were acquired every 10 s and analyzed using the ImageJ software package. Migration of many vertebrate cells requires both actin polymerization and adhesion to the substratum. The earliest detectable actin-associated adhesions are vinculin-rich and interconnected by short actin bundles (10Zimerman B. Volberg T. Geiger B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 58: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that vinculin, itself, may trigger bundle formation. We thus wished to assess the effect of vinculin on actin monomer and filament dynamics using the vinculin tail, VT, as a probe because it contains the actin-binding sites for the whole protein. We first determined if VT would bind to the actin monomer. For this work, we converted G-actin to the expected Mg2+ form, the predominant species found in the cell and labeled the active -SH of Cys-374 with pyrene-maleimide. If the two proteins interact, and this interaction alters the environment of the pyrene, its fluorescence properties will change providing an assay for the interaction. We thus combined VT with Mg-G-actin in a low ionic strength solution that will prevent polymerization of pure actin (Mg2+ G-buffer). Fig. 1A shows that this combination resulted in a biphasic time-dependent change in fluorescence consisting of a rapid first phase increase and a slower subsequent phase until a new steady state was reached after ∼20 min. Fig. 1B shows that this VT-induced change was saturable with respect to the amount of VT added to a constant amount of actin. The biphasic fluorescence increase observed in Fig. 1A suggested that, following an initial actin-VT interaction, some subsequent assembly step, possibly polymerization, might be occurring despite the fact that the proteins were combined in G-buffer. The polymerization-dependent increase in fluorescence of a pyrene at Cys-374 is, in fact, a commonly used assay for actin polymerization. To assess this possibility, aliquots of the VT-actin solutions at saturating VT concentrations were removed after the fluorescence increase had reached a steady state and visualized by electron microscopy after negative staining. Fig. 2 (B and C) shows the appearance of actin filament bundles that require VT to form (Fig. 2A). No evidence of bundle or filament formation was observed when we used actin with calcium rather than magnesium-bound to the high affinity divalent cation binding site (data not shown). We next wished to determine the dependence of actin filament formation and bundling in G-buffer on VT concentration. Increasing amounts of VT were added to a fixed amount of actin, and the mixtures were then centrifuged at speeds sufficient to pellet actin bundles but not individual filaments. Aliquots of the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the Coomassie Blue-stained bands were quantitated by densitometry. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows an increasing appearance of VT and actin in the pellet fraction as a function of added VT. Fig. 3A shows that the amount of pelleted actin reaches a plateau at a VT concentration somewhat lower than what is required to achieve the maximal change in pyrene fluorescence. This difference is not the result of the pyrene label on actin, as 100 and 5% pyrene-labeled actin behaved similarly in a co-sedimentation assay (data not shown). Rather, the difference reflects two different processes that are being measured. In the fluorescence assay, the maximum fluorescence change is obtained at the maximum exposure of the probed actin to VT (saturation). On the other hand, bundling sufficient to pellet all the actin can be achieved with a number of filament cross-links less than that required for saturable binding of VT. To determine how much of the polymerized actin induced by VT was bundled, we repeated the co-sedimentation assay at higher speeds that will quantitatively pellet unbundled actin filaments. The resulting curve (data not shown) is virtually identical to that obtained at lower speeds indicating that bundling occurs early in the polymerization process. Together, these data indicate that small amounts of VT cannot cause a propagated cooperative effect resulting in large amounts of actin polymerization. For a number of actin-bundling proteins, large amounts of bundling can be achieved by the formation of a small number of filament-filament cross-links (35Esue O. Harris E.S. Higgs H.N. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol.

To determine if such were the case with our VT-G-actin interaction, we determined the molar ratio of VT/actin in the pellet at each VT concentration. Fig. 3B shows that, at the lowest VT concentration, the ratio was almost equimolar and that it increased to a ratio of 2:1 at saturation. We used the information obtained in Fig. 3 (A and B) to generate a graph of VT-bound versus VT total (Fig. 3C). This analysis reveals that maximal binding of VT to 1.0 μm actin occurs at a VT concentration of ∼5–7.5 μm. Although we observed VT-dependent actin filament formation in G-buffer, the ionic strength difference between it and F-buffer (G-buffer plus 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl) may have resulted in an aberrant filament structure. To examine this possibility, we utilized a mutant yeast actin S265C that we had previously characterized (31Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This residue is at the tip of a hydrophobic loop between actin subdomains 3 and 4. Pyrene labeling of this actin results in the incorporation of 2 mol of probe per mol of actin, one at Cys-374 and one at Cys-265. Excitation of F-actin made with this doubly labeled protein results in the appearance of a new pyrene excimer band centered at 485 nm. This band results from the interaction of a pyrene at residue 265 of one monomer with that at Cys-374 of another monomer in the apposing strand of the filament and is observed only in the context of F-actin. Fig. 4A shows that introduction of VT into a solution of pyrene-labeled S265C Mg-G-actin in G-buffer results in the formation of the pyrene excimer band. Fig. 4B shows that the amplitude of this band depends on the VT/actin ratio and reaches a plateau at 5–7.5 μm. This concentration is near that required to reach a plateau of the fluorescence in the pyrene-labeled WT actin studies in Fig. 1B (10 μm). This result thus indicates that the filaments formed in G-buffer, described above, have very close to if not the same structure as those formed by pure actin alone in F-buffer and shows that the formation of this excimer depends on substantial binding of VT along the filament surface. We determined what effect VT would have on Mg-actin polymerization in F-buffer, which much more closely approximates the ionic strength conditions present in the cell. We thus examined the effect of preincubation of increasing VT concentrations on the polymerization kinetics of a f"
https://openalex.org/W2106227592,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are globally implicated in the growth and differentiation of mammalian cells; however, relatively little is known about their specific roles in hematopoiesis. In this study, we investigated the expression of HDACs in human hematopoietic cells and their functions during hematopoiesis. The expression of HDACs was very low in hematopoietic progenitor cells, which was accompanied by histone hyperacetylation. HDACs were detectable in more differentiated progenitors and erythroid precursors but down-regulated in mature myeloid cells especially granulocytes. In contrast, acute myeloid leukemias showed HDAC overexpression and histone hypoacetylation. Transcription of the HDAC1 gene was repressed by CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins during myeloid differentiation, and activated by GATA-1 during erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC1 enhanced myeloid differentiation in immature hematopoietic cell lines and perturbed erythroid differentiation in progenitor cells. Myeloid but not erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation was blocked in mice transplanted with HDAC1-overexpressing hematopoietic progenitor cells. These findings suggest that HDAC is not merely an auxiliary factor of genetic elements but plays a direct role in the cell fate decision of hematopoietic progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2097696814,"The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) exerts an well established immunosuppressive function in cancer. IDO is expressed within the tumor itself as well as in antigen-presenting cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, where it promotes the establishment of peripheral immune tolerance to tumor antigens. In the present study, we tested the notion whether IDO itself may be subject to immune responses.The presence of naturally occurring IDO-specific CD8 T cells in cancer patients was determined by MHC/peptide stainings as well as ELISPOT. Antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from the peripheral blood of cancer patients were cloned and expanded. The functional capacity of the established CTL clones was examined by chrome release assays. The study unveiled spontaneous cytotoxic T-cell reactivity against IDO in peripheral blood as well as in the tumor microenvironment of different cancer patients. We demonstrate that these IDO reactive T cells are indeed peptide specific, cytotoxic effector cells. Hence, IDO reactive T cells are able to recognize and kill tumor cells including directly isolated AML blasts as well as IDO-expressing dendritic cells, i.e. one of the major immune suppressive cell populations.IDO may serve as an important and widely applicable target for anti-cancer immunotherapeutic strategies. Furthermore, as emerging evidence suggests that IDO constitutes a significant counter-regulatory mechanism induced by pro-inflammatory signals, IDO-based immunotherapy holds the promise to boost anti-cancer immunotherapy in general."
https://openalex.org/W1973777019,"Hyaluronan (HA), the only non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is involved in morphogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, angiogenesis, and cancer. In mammals, HA is synthesized by three homologous HA synthases, HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, that polymerize the HA chain using UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as precursors. Since the amount of HA is critical in several pathophysiological conditions, we developed a non-radioactive assay for measuring the activity of HA synthases (HASs) in eukaryotic cells and addressed the question of HAS activity during intracellular protein trafficking. We prepared three cellular fractions: plasma membrane, cytosol (containing membrane proteins mainly from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi), and nuclei. After incubation with UDP-sugar precursors, newly synthesized HA was quantified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fluorophore-labeled saccharides and high performance liquid chromatography. This new method measured HAS activity not only in the plasma membrane fraction but also in the cytosolic membranes. This new technique was used to evaluate the effects of 4-methylumbeliferone, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, interleukin 1β, platelet-derived growth factor BB, and tunicamycin on HAS activities. We found that HAS activity can be modulated by post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation and N-glycosylation. Interestingly, we detected a significant increase in HAS activity in the cytosolic membrane fraction after tunicamycin treatment. Since this compound is known to induce HA cable structures, this result links HAS activity alteration with the capability of the cell to promote HA cable formation. Hyaluronan (HA), the only non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is involved in morphogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, angiogenesis, and cancer. In mammals, HA is synthesized by three homologous HA synthases, HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, that polymerize the HA chain using UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as precursors. Since the amount of HA is critical in several pathophysiological conditions, we developed a non-radioactive assay for measuring the activity of HA synthases (HASs) in eukaryotic cells and addressed the question of HAS activity during intracellular protein trafficking. We prepared three cellular fractions: plasma membrane, cytosol (containing membrane proteins mainly from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi), and nuclei. After incubation with UDP-sugar precursors, newly synthesized HA was quantified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fluorophore-labeled saccharides and high performance liquid chromatography.

HA is a major component of extracellular matrices and in pericellular spaces, particularly in tissues with rapid cell proliferation and cell migration (1Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Through interactions with cell surface receptors, notably CD44 and RHAMM (receptor for HA-mediated motility), HA has important roles in regulating cell behavior, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation (2Lee J.Y. Spicer A.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Recently, novel interactions involving HA and Toll-like receptors 4 and 2 have been described that have important roles in inflammation (3Jiang D. Liang J. Fan J. Yu S. Chen S. Luo Y. Prestwich G.D.

Res. 2003; 36: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In mammals, HA is normally synthesized at the plasma membrane and extruded directly into the extracellular space by three isoforms of HA synthases (HASs), HAS1, -2, and -3. The three HAS isoforms differ in tissue distribution, regulation, and enzymatic properties (12Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar); nevertheless, they are similar in amino acid sequences and molecular structures. HA biosynthesis is under the control of a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors (13Campo G.M. Avenoso A. Campo S. Angela D. Ferlazzo A.M. Calatroni A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2006; 292: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The changes in HA synthesis can be related to HAS mRNA expression (14Recklies A.D. White C. Melching L. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), to availability of the UDP-sugar precursors (15Vigetti D. Ori M. Viola M. Genasetti A. Karousou E. Rizzi M. Pallotti F.

Moreover, HA chain synthesis can be controlled by additional mechanisms, such as cell type, intracellular environment, or HAS accessory proteins (20de La Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30747-30755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cultures of smooth muscle cells isolated from human colon increase synthesis of HA after treatment with a viral mimetic molecule (poly(I-C)) (21de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Drazba J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Strong S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The HA is organized into novel cable-like structures, and their synthesis may be initiated in the perinuclear and/or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (22Hascall V.C. Majors A.K.

Furthermore, HA interstitial deposition is correlated with inflammatory processes (23Majors A.K. Austin R.C. de la Motte C.A. Pyeritz R.E. Hascall V.C. Kessler S.P. Sen G. Strong S.A. J. Biol.

Antin J.H. Hergrueter C.A. Underhill C.B. Sackstein R. Blood. 2004; 103: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cytokines and growth factors, such as IL-1β and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), as well as 4-methylumbeliferone (4-MU) and the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also modulate HA synthesis (26Jacobson A.

Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate how these different effectors affect HAS activity, it is important to purify and solubilize the HAS enzymes as previously underlined in studies on eukaryotic cell lines (30Ng K.F. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11776-11783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, Itano and Kimata (31Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) used a mammalian transient expression system to characterize the three different HAS isoforms in either cells or cellular membrane extracts. On the other hand, Spicer (32Spicer A.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 373-382PubMed Google Scholar) described three relatively simple procedures for the detection of HA synthase activity in cultured mammalian cell lines. In all of these studies, the enzyme activity was measured by incubating cellular membrane extracts with radiolabeled UDP-sugar precursors, and the final analysis of the products was done by liquid scintillation counting. Various other strategies and methods can be used to determine the HA biosynthetic capacity of cells, although they are always based on the use of radiolabeled UDP-sugar precursors (33Brinck J. Heldin P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol.

In our previous studies, we described methods of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fluorophore-labeled saccharides (PAGEFS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the analysis of disaccharides derived from HA and chondroitin sulfate (33Brinck J.

Chromatogr. 2005; 19: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In order to improve the sensitivity of this method, a derivatization with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) was done, followed by fluorescence detection (39Mitropoulou T.N. Lamari F. Syrokou A. Hjerpe A. Karamanos N.K. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 2458-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we modified this method to address the question of localization of HAS activity during intracellular trafficking, since HA has been detected inside cells in previous studies (40Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 41Furukawa K. Terayama H. Biochim. Biophys.

This new non-radioactive method was used to quantify HAS activity on cell membranes fractionated by sucrose gradient methods. To test the robustness of our approach, we analyzed the effect of 4-MU, PMA, IL-1β, PDGF-BB, and tunicamycin on cell cultures. In particular, we found that tunicamycin induced an increase of HA synthesis in both plasma and internal cell membranes in EVC cells, whereas it increased HA synthesis only in the internal cell membranes in the OVCAR-3 cells. The results suggest that post-translational modulation of HAS activity is responsible for the increased HA synthesis inside the cells. Moreover, since tunicamycin induced HA cable structures in the OVCAR-3 cells, we correlated the altered intracellular HAS activity with the capability to promote HA cable formation. The ECV 304 cell line (43Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) was obtained from “Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna” (Brescia, Italy), the OVCAR-3 cell line from human ovarian adenocarcinoma was kindly donated by Prof. Roberto Taramelli (University of Insubria), and the U937 cell line derived from a human histiocytic lymphoma was a gift of Carol A. de la Motte (Cleveland Clinic). ECV cells were grown in EGM2 complete culture medium (Cambrex, Baltimore, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), OVCAR-3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FBS, and U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 5% FBS. Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells in 25-cm2 culture flasks and were grown for 96 h in their culture medium in an atmosphere of humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In some experiments, ECV and OVCAR-3 cells were treated with 2 mm 4-MU (Sigma) or with 2 nm PMA (Sigma) for 18 h of incubation; with IL-1β (Peprotech) or PDGF-BB (Calbiochem), both at 10 ng/μl, for 18 h; with 200 nm PMA (a non-toxic concentration) for 5 or 10 min of incubation; or with IL-1β or PDGF-BB, both at 10 ng/μl, for 5 or 10 min. Further, ECV and OVCAR-3 cells were incubated for 18 and 24 h with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin from Streptomyces sp. (Sigma), with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), or with 20 μg/ml suramin (Sigma). The above mentioned concentrations were chosen from preliminary experiments in which several doses were tested. Membrane fractionations were done by ultracentrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient by modifying previous protocols (44Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Briefly, cells were washed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.4) (32Spicer A.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 373-382PubMed Google Scholar) and, subsequently, were incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) for 10 min. After incubation, cells were scraped into the lysis buffer and disrupted by three strokes of 6 s each at 80% microns amplitude using a high intensity ultrasonic liquid processor (Sonics & Materials). The suspensions were left on ice during treatment. Nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The obtained supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, placed at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose concentration gradient (40–5%) in the same buffer, and centrifuged (150,000 × g) for 24 h at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation, 20 fractions were collected, starting from the top of the tube. Each fraction was tested for protein content by the Bradford method and characterized by Western blot analysis before use. Western blot analyses were done to check the purity of each fraction after membrane purification steps. Twenty μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with polyclonal anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), polyclonal anti-glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal anti-GM130 (Sigma), and polyclonal anti-calnexin (Sigma), as described by Vigetti et al. (47Vigetti D. Moretto P. Viola M. Genasetti A. Rizzi M. Karousou E. Pallotti F. De Luca G. Passi A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1118-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The HAS activity assay was essentially developed following the method described by Spicer (32Spicer A.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 373-382PubMed Google Scholar) without adding any radiolabeled substrate. Twenty μg of proteins from selected membrane fractions were mixed with 10 μl of 10× HA synthase buffer (50 mm DTT, 150 mm MgCl2, 250 mm HEPES, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.1). One μl of 100 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 1 μl of 5 mm UDP-GlcUA were added and brought to 100 μl with lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture. The mixtures composed of membranes and UDP-sugar precursors were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a thermomixer. After incubation, the samples were digested by hyaluronidase SD (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h at a concentration of 100 milliunits/ml. A 100-milliunit/ml solution of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h according to our previous procedure of analysis of HA and CS (36Karousou E.G. Militsopoulou M. Porta G. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2919-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SDS (Bio-Rad) was added to each sample at a final concentration of 1%, and they were heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then frozen at −80 °C and lyophilized. In some experiments, 2 mm 4-MU or 200 nm PMA, 10 ng/μl IL-1β, or 10 ng/μl PDGF-BB at final concentrations were added into the mixture as controls. The disaccharides obtained with hyaluronidase SD and chondroitinase ABC digestions were derivatized with AMAC (Molecular Probes) and quantified by using PAGEFS, as previously described by Karousou et al. (36Karousou E.G. Militsopoulou M. Porta G. De Luca G. Hascall V.C. Passi A. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2919-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After the run, gels were scanned in UV light using a CCD camera and Gel Doc 2000 software (Bio-Rad). Analysis of the Δdi-nonSHA band was done by comparison of its migration and intensity with standard Δ-disaccharides in the same gel. Subsequently, Δdi-nonSHA quantification in each sample was standardized to total protein mass. AMAC-derivatized disaccharides were also quantified by using HPLC (34Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27513-27522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The quantification of leukocyte adhesion was done as described (48Vigetti D. Rizzi M. Viola M. Karousou E. Genasetti A. Clerici M. Bartolini B. Hascall V.C. De Luca G. Passi A. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, ECV and OVCAR-3 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 6-well plates and then treated with the test compounds for 18 h. U937 cells were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 μm CellTrackerTM Green 5-chloromethylflourescein diacetate (Invitrogen). The labeled cells were washed extensively with PBS and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium without FBS. The monocytes were added to the ECV or OVCAR-3 cells (106/well) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Nonadherent monocytes were removed by washing the wells gently at 4 °C with PBS. To verify that cell adhesion was dependent on HA, we treated some wells with hyaluronidase SD (2 units/μl) or with exogenous added high molecular weight HA (4 × 106 Da; Healon). The quantification of adhered monocytes was done by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus) counting six independent fields. ECV304 and OVCAR-3 cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were preincubated with PBS containing 2% FBS and then incubated in the same solution containing biotinylated HA-binding protein (Seikagaku) (5 μg/ml) and a CD44 monoclonal antibody (clone A3D8; 10 μg/ml; Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were washed with PBS and then incubated with a solution containing fluorescein-tagged streptavidin (1:500) and CY2.2-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (H+L) (1:1000) in PBS containing 2% FBS. After washing in PBS, the coverslips were mounted using mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The images were obtained using a confocal microscope (SP5; Leica). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 30 min at 37 °C to remove cell-associated HA, fixed with cold methanol (in order to permeabilize the cells), and probed as described above. To inhibit endocytosis during the hyaluronidase treatment, lower incubation temperatures were used (i.e. 15 and 25 °C), always obtaining similar results. Total RNA from both ECV304 and OVCAR-3 cells was extracted using Tri-reagent solution (Ambion). To remove DNA contamination, DNase (Ambion) treatment was done in all samples. One μg of total RNA was retrotranscribed using the High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for 2 h at 37 °C. Quantitative RT-PCR was done on an Abi Prism 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan gene expression assays were done for HAS1 (Hs00155410), HAS2 (Hs00193435), HAS3 (Hs00193436), and β-actin (Hs99999903) by amplification following the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). Comparison of the amount of each gene transcript among different samples was made using β-actin as the reference and the ΔΔCt method, as previously described (15Vigetti D. Ori M. Viola M.

Statistical analysis of the data was done using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post hoc tests (Bonferroni) using Origin 7.5 software (Microcal Software, Studio City, CA). Contrary to other GAGs, HA synthesis normally takes place on the plasma membrane, where active HAS enzymes are located. HAS proteins are synthesized in the ER, and, through the Golgi apparatus, they reach the plasma membrane. Previous studies have indicated that HAS enzymes associated with ER/Golgi membranes are not active (51Müllegger J. Rustom A. Kreil G. Gerdes H.H. Lepperdinger G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas other studies highlight the presence of HA inside the cells (40Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem.

To investigate the possibility that HAS enzymes associated with ER/Golgi membranes can synthesize HA, we fractionated ECV 304 cells (43Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), which are known to synthesize and secrete HA into the culture medium, in order to isolate fractions enriched in plasma membranes, ER/Golgi membranes, and nuclear membranes. ECV 304 cells are described as a spontaneously transformed line derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, although a genetic characterization revealed that this cell line is not appropriate to study endothelial cell biology (53Brown J. Reading S.J. Jones S. Fitchett C.J. Howl J. Martin A. Longland C.L. Michelangeli F. Dubrova Y.E. Brown C.A. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Among 20 subcellular fractions obtained from discontinuous sucrose gradient separation (supplemental Fig. S1), we isolated three fractions representative of plasma membrane (PM), cytosolic membranes (CM), and nuclear membranes (NM). To check the purity of these representative fractions, we did Western blot analyses using antibodies against CD44 (a plasma membrane-specific marker), glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (a cytosolic membrane marker), GM130 (a Golgi membrane marker), and calnexin (an ER membrane marker). Fig. 1A shows that a 90 kDa band corresponding to CD44 was present only in the PM fraction, indicating that no plasma membrane protein contaminations were present in the other two fractions. The 37 kDa band corresponding to the glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein was only detected in the CM fraction. On the other hand, GM130 and calnexin were present in both the PM and CM fractions but were absent in the NM fraction. This suggests that the PM fraction contains some Golgi and ER membrane components. Previous studies used radioactive precursors to measure HAS activity in subcellular fractions (30Ng K.F.

https://openalex.org/W2020214225,"Cohesion between sister chromatids is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. In budding yeast, the acetyltransferase Eco1/Ctf7 establishes cohesion during DNA replication in S phase and in response to DNA double strand breaks in G2/M phase. In humans two Eco1 orthologs exist: ESCO1 and ESCO2. Both proteins are required for proper sister chromatid cohesion, but their exact function is unclear at present. Since ESCO2 has been identified as the gene defective in the rare autosomal recessive cohesinopathy Roberts syndrome (RBS), cells from RBS patients can be used to elucidate the role of ESCO2. We investigated for the first time RBS cells in comparison to isogenic controls that stably express V5- or GFP-tagged ESCO2. We show that the sister chromatid cohesion defect in the transfected cell lines is rescued and suggest that ESCO2 is regulated by proteasomal degradation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In comparison to the corrected cells RBS cells were hypersensitive to the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C, camptothecin and etoposide, while no particular sensitivity to UV, ionizing radiation, hydroxyurea or aphidicolin was found. The cohesion defect of RBS cells and their hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents were not corrected by a patient-derived ESCO2 acetyltransferase mutant (W539G), indicating that the acetyltransferase activity of ESCO2 is essential for its function. In contrast to a previous study on cells from patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, another cohesinopathy, RBS cells failed to exhibit excessive chromosome aberrations after irradiation in G2 phase of the cell cycle. Our results point at an S phase-specific role for ESCO2 in the maintenance of genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2005727737,"Studies of the organic anion transporters (Oats) have focused mainly on their interactions with organic anionic substrates. However, as suggested when Oat1 was originally identified as NKT (Lopez-Nieto, C. E., You, G., Bush, K. T., Barros, E. J., Beier, D. R., and Nigam, S. K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6471–6478), since the Oats share close homology with organic cation transporters (Octs), it is possible that Oats interact with cations as well. We now show that mouse Oat1 (mOat1) and mOat3 and, to a lesser degree, mOat6 bind a number of “prototypical” Oct substrates, including 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. In addition to oocyte expression assays, we have tested binding of organic cations to Oat1 and Oat3 in ex vivo assays by analyzing interactions in kidney organ cultures deficient in Oat1 and Oat3. We also demonstrate that mOat3 transports organic cations such as 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and cimetidine. A pharmacophore based on the binding affinities of the tested organic cations for Oat3 was generated. Using this pharmacophore, we screened a chemical library and were able to identify novel cationic compounds that bound to Oat1 and Oat3. These compounds bound Oat3 with an affinity higher than the highest affinity compounds in the original set of prototypical Oct substrates. Thus, whereas Oat1, Oat3, and Oat6 appear to function largely in organic anion transport, they also bind and transport some organic cations. These findings could be of clinical significance, since drugs and metabolites that under normal physiological conditions do not bind to the Oats may undergo changes in charge and become Oat substrates during pathologic conditions wherein significant variations in body fluid pH occur.

IntroductionThe proximal tubule is the main site of reabsorption and elimination of a wide range of charged organic molecules, encompassing both xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites. The transport of these compounds across the basolateral or apical surfaces of the proximal tubular cell is mediated in large part by organic anion and cation transporters (Oats 2The abbreviations used are: Oatorganic anion transportermOatmouse OatOctorganic cation transporterPAHp-aminohippurate1-MPP1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium5CF5-carboxyfluorescein6CF6-carboxyfluorescein. and Octs) (2Ahn S.Y. Nigam S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The prototypical Oat, Oat1, initially identified as novel kidney transporter NKT (1Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G.

Recently, a closely related transporter, Oat6, was identified in mouse olfactory mucosa and was shown to be involved in the transport of odorant organic anions (5Kaler G. Truong D.M. Sweeney D.E.

Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 150: 36-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The Oats and Octs are closely related, both being members of the SLC22 family of solute transporters, and share close structural and sequence homology. Both Oats and Octs possess 12 transmembrane domains and a long hydrophilic extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2. Based on this, when Oat1 was originally identified as NKT (1Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G. Bush K.T. Barros E.J. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the transporter might bind organic cations as well as anions. In studies over the past decade, the broad substrate specificity of Oats and Octs and the structural homologies of newer family members (11Wu W. Baker M.E. Eraly S.A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 38: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have continued to raise the possibility that overlapping substrate specificity may be present and that the Oats can also interact with cations. However, despite a few early renal physiological reports on interaction of some cations with the probenecid-sensitive PAH transport system (12Dantzler W.H. Brokl O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F188-F200PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jensen R.E. Berndt W.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 244: 543-549PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sokol P.P. Huiatt K.R. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J.

Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), molecular studies until now have focused on the binding and transport of organic anions (mainly pharmaceutical drugs) by the Oats.We initially examined the kinetics of binding of organic cations to Oats by assessing inhibition of transport in Xenopus oocyte expression systems. We noted that a number of cationic compounds manifested significant binding affinity for Oat1 and -3 and, to a lesser degree, for Oat6 in the oocyte binding assays. To determine whether this was also true at the level of whole tissues, we examined the interaction of cationic compounds with transport of fluorescent organic anion substrates in cultures of kidney organ derived from Oat knock-out mice (16Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A. Nagle M. Eraly S.A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Truong D.M. Kaler G.

Organ culture represents a living organ system where the Oat is in interaction with the cellular membrane and other transporters. Results from the organ culture inhibition assay were consistent with those from the oocyte assays. We also used radiolabeled organic cations to directly measure transport by Oat1, -3, and -6 and found that cimetidine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (1-MPP) were transported by Oat3. Using the binding affinity data generated from these assays, we were able to generate a pharmacophore common to both Oat1 and -3. The pharmacophore consists of a positive ionizable feature, a hydrophobic region and two hydrogen bond acceptors. This pharmacophore was then used to screen a chemical library of cationic compounds, and novel cationic compounds that interacted with Oat1 and 3 were verified in vitro. Thus, our findings demonstrate novel binding interactions between organic cations and Oats using in vitro and ex vivo assays, which were further validated by pharmacophore modeling. Because pathological conditions can result in altered body fluid pH (and thus in altered ionization of charged drugs, toxins, and metabolites) and because of the importance of Oats in regulating the distribution of organic ions between blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, these findings could well be particularly important in disease states, such as metabolic alkalosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and lactic acidosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRadiolabeled substrates [3H]verapamil (specific activity 80 Ci/mmol), [3H]nicotine (specific activity 85 Ci/mmol), [3H]cimetidine (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol), [3H]quinidine (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol), [3H]procainamide (specific activity 55 mCi/mmol), and [3H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (specific activity 85 Ci/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The radiolabeled tracers [3H]p-aminohippurate (PAH) (specific activity 4.22 Ci/mmol) and [3H]estrone 3-sulfate (57.3 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cations and fluorescent dyes (5-carboxyfluorescein (5CF), 6-carboxyfluorescein (6CF), and fluorescein) were obtained from Sigma, and matches to the pharmacophore were ordered from Maybridge (Cornwall, UK).Oocyte Isolation/MicroinjectionXenopus oocyte assays were performed as previously described (5Kaler G.

Briefly, using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), capped RNA was synthesized from linearized plasmid DNA for mOat1 (Image clone ID 4163278), mOat3 (Image clone ID 4239544), and mOat6 (Image clone ID 6309674). Oocytes were defolliculated and maintained in Barth's buffer growth medium. Stage IV-V oocytes were selected and injected with cRNA solution (1.0 μg/μl, 23 nl/oocyte) using the Nanoliter 2000 nanoinjector (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Transport assays were performed 2 days after injection.Binding and Transport AssaysOocytes were divided into experimental groups of 16–20 and placed in a 24-well plate with 1 ml of Barth's buffer containing a fluorescent anion tracer with a final concentration of 30 μm 6-carboxyfluorescein for mOat1-injected oocytes, 50 μm 5CF (mOat3), or 30 μm fluorescein (mOat6), as well as various concentrations of unlabeled organic cations. After 1 h of incubation at 25 °C, the oocytes were washed five times at 4 °C with Barth's buffer, and each experimental group was divided into four groups of 4–5 oocytes. The oocytes were lysed, the lysate was centrifuged, and the fluorescence of the supernatant was measured by a fluorometer (PolarStar plate reader, BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC). To correct for transport due to diffusion or to endogenously expressed transporters in the oocytes, the uptake of fluorescent tracer was measured in uninjected oocytes, and this value was subtracted from the uptake into Oat-injected oocytes in all experimental samples.Transport assays using radiolabeled cations were performed in a similar manner. Two days after injection with cRNA, oocytes were incubated in 1 ml of Barth's buffer containing ∼1 μCi of the cation being assayed. For experiments measuring affinity of the cations for mOat3, the oocytes were incubated in 1 ml of Barth's buffer, together with 1 μCi of the cation being tested and different concentrations of unlabeled cation. After 1 h of incubation at 25 °C, the oocytes were washed five times with ice-cold Barth's buffer and subsequently lysed. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (Rackbeta, Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA).Calculations and StatisticsKi of an inhibitor cation was determined by measuring tracer uptake in the presence of 3–4 inhibitor concentrations in 10-fold increments. Each data point is the average of four measurements. Inhibition data were curve-fitted using nonlinear regression in Prism software 5.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA) to calculate the Ki ± S.E. as before (16Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A. Nagle M. Eraly S.A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Km of cations was determined by measuring uptake in the presence of 3–4 cation concentrations, followed by curve-fitting using nonlinear regression in Prism software, version 5.0. Vmax, the maximum transporter mediated uptake rate, was calculated as Vmax = CL × (S + Km), where S was the substrate concentration of the radiolabeled tracer in the medium, and clearance (CL; the amount of radiolabeled substrate cleared from the incubation medium) was calculated as Vtransport/S. S.E. for Vmax was measured as S.E.Vmax = (S.E.CL2 × (S + K)2 + S.E.K2 × CL2)½.Kidney Organ CultureOat1 and Oat3 knock-out kidney organ cultures were preformed as described previously (18Eraly S.A. Vallon V. Vaughn D.A. Gangoiti J.A. Richter K. Nagle M. Monte J.C. Rieg T. Truong D.M. Long J.M. Barshop B.A. Kaler G. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

Briefly, embryonic day 13.5 murine kidneys were grown on polycarbonate transwell filters with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 5 days. All animal protocols conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines for acceptable animal use.Kidney Organ Culture Uptake Assay and Confocal MicroscopyAfter 5 days of culture, the cultured kidneys were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated (on the filter) for 1 h at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) with 1 μm 6CF and with or without tracer uptake inhibitors (2 mm PAH, estrone 3-sulfate, or organic cations) (17Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After the incubation, organ cultures were washed three times in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline, cut from the transwell filter, and mounted on a glass slide with Fluormount (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Samples were kept on ice until imaged. Confocal images were taken with the Nikon D-eclipse C1 confocal microscope (A.G. Heinze, Lake Forest, CA). Images were taken using the same settings for intensity comparisons.Quantitative Image AnalysisImage analysis was performed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) using pixel intensity measurements. Images were manually outlined twice to measure intensity, and the average value obtained was taken as the total intensity of a kidney. Four representative background areas were traced in interstitial spaces. Average background measurements were then subtracted from the total intensity. Significance values were determined using the t test, and all values represent triplicate kidney samples.Computational ModelingThe consensus pharmacophore model was constructed on the basis of the cationic compounds that had high binding affinity for Oat3 (cimetidine, procainamide, metoclopramide, and verapamil), using the program Catalyst (Accelrys, 2007). The following steps were conducted according to the HipHop Catalyst strategy: (a) generation of conformational models for each of the compounds, (b) estimation of chemical features within each of the compounds, and (c) eventual creation of the closest superimposition of geometrical position of common features in three-dimensional space for the best fitting conformation of the compounds (20Barnum D. Greene J. Smellie A. Sprague P. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1996; 36: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 21Clement O.O. Mehl A.T. Pharmacophore Perception, Development, and Use in Drug Design.in: Guner O.F. International University Line, La Jolla, CA2000: 69-83Google Scholar). Conformations of the compounds were generated by the program within the limits of the energy differences from the initial conformation. It is known that in many cases, the conformation of a bound compound is not a global minimum conformation. We used the limit of 10 kcal/mol. The program superimposes up to 10 features (including hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrophobic, positive and negative ionizable features, etc.) for a set of compounds. These features are then included in the common feature hypotheses (pharmacophores). These hypotheses are tested by submitting a set of the structures of the compounds that have different activities to the program. Their fit to the hypothesis (pharmacophore) should correspond to their activities (i.e. compounds with better fits to the pharmacophore have higher activities, and those with worse fits have lower activities). Using such criteria, we selected the best hypothesis (pharmacophore), which was then used to screen a chemical data base from Maybridge. Compounds with a good fit were tested for binding to mOat1 and mOat3.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed the interaction of a set of prototypical Oct substrates with mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6 at multiple levels, including transporter-expressing Xenopus oocytes, kidney culture, and computational modeling, followed by in vitro testing of predictions. Somewhat unexpectedly, Oat1 and -3 shared affinity for most of these cations, which are classically viewed as Oct substrates. Oat3 generally appeared to demonstrate greater affinity and broader specificity for the tested cations. Oat6 did not appear to have the same degree or range of affinity for these compounds as did the other two transporters, although its relatively high affinity for nicotine is notable. These results support the view that although Oat1 and -3 share close structural homology and often overlapping substrate specificities, there are distinct differences in their binding sites (16Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A. Nagle M. Eraly S.A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Oat6, although a close phylogenetic relation of Oat1, has been observed to have charge and hydrophobicity preferences distinct from those of Oat1 (16Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The inhibition of Oat-mediated transport by the organic cations in our study using microinjected oocytes and cultured knock-out tissue is consistent with older physiological studies (prior to the molecular cloning of the Oats), showing inhibition of PAH transport by several cations in the renal proximal tubule (12Dantzler W.H. Brokl O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F188-F200PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G.

Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These cations were found to inhibit both the organic cation (N1-methylnicotinamide) transport system and the organic anion (PAH) transport system. It was postulated that hydrophobicity and the presence of electronegative groups, such as Cl−, Br−, or NO2−, determined inhibition of PAH transport by these substrates. We, however, found no correlation between hydrophobicity or increasing electron-attracting properties of the cations and their inhibitory potencies (data not shown).The kidney organ culture represents a model wherein the interaction of substrates with Oats in a live organ system can be observed. It has been shown that certain fluorescent tracers, such as 6CF, are transported by Oat1 and Oat3 (17Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This property was used in Oat1 and Oat3 knock-out tissue to determine the interaction of the cations with Oat1 and Oat3 individually in a whole organ system. Since the fluorescence was quantifiable, we were able to determine the inhibition profiles of the cations tested, and these results were similar to those obtained from the Xenopus oocyte assays, with the exception of 1-MPP. The organ culture is a more complex system than the oocyte system, and thus it is possible that other factors may affect binding in the organ culture. (Table 1 and Figs. 1, 5, and 6).The pharmacophore generated for Oat3 provides additional insight into the physicochemical characteristics that determine interaction with the binding site of the transporter. The features of the pharmacophore included two hydrogen bond acceptors, which is consistent with previous quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of the binding determinants of mOat3, which was based on inhibition profiles of antivirals (17Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

We used the Oat3 pharmacophore to screen a collection of cations, and, through in vitro testing of matches to the pharmacophore, were able to identify novel cations that bound Oat3 and Oat1. The affinities for Oat3 of these compounds were 10 times greater than those of the original set of prototypical Oct substrates, supporting the validity of the pharmacophore model. In the clinical setting, multidrug regimens are common, and competitive excretion of several drugs through Oat-mediated mechanisms can lead to accumulation of some of these drugs in the body potentially leading to toxicity. In such cases, a pharmacophore could be used to identify those drugs that are excreted through the Oats and therefore at risk for accumulation in the body and causing toxicity. Our results also suggest that competition between organic anionic and cationic drugs and metabolites could be clinically important, especially for Oat3-mediated transport. Furthermore, since changes in body fluid pH are common in pathological states (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, and respiratory and metabolic alkalosis) and because Oats mediate the distribution of drugs, metabolites, and toxins between blood, CSF, and urine, it seems plausible that, as their charge changes, drugs and metabolites that do not bind Oats under normal physiological conditions could become Oat substrates.When NKT, later termed Oat1, was first identified, it was suggested that it might interact with organic anions or cations (1Lopez-Nieto C.E.

Our data indicate that, despite their current nomenclature, Oat1 and Oat3 interact with organic cations to a surprising degree. However, among the cations that bound to the Oats, only cimetidine and, to a lesser degree, 1-MPP were actually transported. This supports previous observations that substrate binding to the Oats and translocation across the membrane are two distinct processes (16Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A. Nagle M. Eraly S.A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), with the former being dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the substrate and the latter on the molecular features of the substrate, which lead to transporter conformational changes. Finally, it seems worth considering in more detail whether other SLC22 transporters, including recently identified family members (11Wu W. Baker M.E. Eraly S.A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 38: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), might have the ability to bind and/or transport cations as well as anions. IntroductionThe proximal tubule is the main site of reabsorption and elimination of a wide range of charged organic molecules, encompassing both xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites. The transport of these compounds across the basolateral or apical surfaces of the proximal tubular cell is mediated in large part by organic anion and cation transporters (Oats 2The abbreviations used are: Oatorganic anion transportermOatmouse OatOctorganic cation transporterPAHp-aminohippurate1-MPP1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium5CF5-carboxyfluorescein6CF6-carboxyfluorescein. and Octs) (2Ahn S.Y. Nigam S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The prototypical Oat, Oat1, initially identified as novel kidney transporter NKT (1Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G.

Recently, a closely related transporter, Oat6, was identified in mouse olfactory mucosa and was shown to be involved in the transport of odorant organic anions (5Kaler G. Truong D.M. Sweeney D.E.

Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 150: 36-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The Oats and Octs are closely related, both being members of the SLC22 family of solute transporters, and share close structural and sequence homology. Both Oats and Octs possess 12 transmembrane domains and a long hydrophilic extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2. Based on this, when Oat1 was originally identified as NKT (1Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G. Bush K.T. Barros E.J. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the transporter might bind organic cations as well as anions. In studies over the past decade, the broad substrate specificity of Oats and Octs and the structural homologies of newer family members (11Wu W. Baker M.E. Eraly S.A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 38: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have continued to raise the possibility that overlapping substrate specificity may be present and that the Oats can also interact with cations. However, despite a few early renal physiological reports on interaction of some cations with the probenecid-sensitive PAH transport system (12Dantzler W.H. Brokl O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F188-F200PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jensen R.E. Berndt W.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 244: 543-549PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sokol P.P. Huiatt K.R. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J.

Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), molecular studies until now have focused on the binding and transport of organic anions (mainly pharmaceutical drugs) by the Oats.We initially examined the kinetics of binding of organic cations to Oats by assessing inhibition of transport in Xenopus oocyte expression systems. We noted that a number of cationic compounds manifested significant binding affinity for Oat1 and -3 and, to a lesser degree, for Oat6 in the oocyte binding assays. To determine whether this was also true at the level of whole tissues, we examined the interaction of cationic compounds with transport of fluorescent organic anion substrates in cultures of kidney organ derived from Oat knock-out mice (16Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A. Nagle M. Eraly S.A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Organ culture represents a living organ system where the Oat is in interaction with the cellular membrane and other transporters. Results from the organ culture inhibition assay were consistent with those from the oocyte assays. We also used radiolabeled organic cations to directly measure transport by Oat1, -3, and -6 and found that cimetidine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (1-MPP) were transported by Oat3. Using the binding affinity data generated from these assays, we were able to generate a pharmacophore common to both Oat1 and -3. The pharmacophore consists of a positive ionizable feature, a hydrophobic region and two hydrogen bond acceptors. This pharmacophore was then used to screen a chemical library of cationic compounds, and novel cationic compounds that interacted with Oat1 and 3 were verified in vitro. Thus, our findings demonstrate novel binding interactions between organic cations and Oats using in vitro and ex vivo assays, which were further validated by pharmacophore modeling. Because pathological conditions can result in altered body fluid pH (and thus in altered ionization of charged drugs, toxins, and metabolites) and because of the importance of Oats in regulating the distribution of organic ions between blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, these findings could well be particularly important in disease states, such as metabolic alkalosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and lactic acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W1970595107,"To understand the role of human 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-LOX1) in vascular wall remodeling, we have studied the effect of the major 15-LOX1 metabolite of arachidonic acid, 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE), on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration both in vitro and in vivo. Among 5(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE potentially stimulated more vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration. In addition, 15(S)-HETE-induced VSMC migration was dependent on Src-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). 15(S)-HETE also induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression via Src-STAT-3 signaling, and neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibodies completely negated 15(S)-HETE-induced VSMC migration. Cloning and characterization of a 2.6-kb MCP-1 promoter revealed the presence of four putative STAT-binding sites, and the site that is proximal to the transcription start site was found to be essential for 15(S)-HETE-induced Src-STAT-3-mediated MCP-1 expression. Rat carotid arteries that were subjected to balloon injury and transduced with Ad-15-LOX1 upon exposure to [(3)H]arachidonic acid ex vivo produced 15-HETE as a major eicosanoid and enhanced balloon injury-induced expression of MCP-1 in smooth muscle cells in Src and STAT-3-dependent manner in vivo. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of 15-LOX1 into rat carotid artery also led to recruitment and homing of macrophages to medial region in response to injury. In addition, transduction of Ad-15-LOX1 into arteries enhanced balloon injury-induced smooth muscle cell migration from media to intima and neointima formation. These results show for the first time that 15-LOX1-15(S)-HETE axis plays a major role in vascular wall remodeling after balloon angioplasty."
https://openalex.org/W2039258283,"Background Among the various hippocampal network patterns, sharp wave-ripples (SPW-R) are currently the mechanistically least understood. Although accurate information on synaptic interactions between the participating neurons is essential for comprehensive understanding of the network function during complex activities like SPW-R, such knowledge is currently notably scarce. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate an in vitro approach to SPW-R that offers a simple experimental tool allowing detailed analysis of mechanisms governing the sharp wave-state of the hippocampus. We combine interface storage of slices with modifications of a conventional submerged recording system and established in vitro SPW-R comparable to their in vivo counterpart. We show that slice storage in the interface chamber close to physiological temperature is the required condition to preserve network integrity that is necessary for the generation of SPW-R. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our method for studying synaptic and network properties of SPW-R, using electrophysiological and imaging methods that can only be applied in the submerged system. Conclusions/Significance The approach presented here demonstrates a reliable and experimentally simple strategy for studying hippocampal sharp wave-ripples. Given its utility and easy application we expect our model to foster the generation of new insight into the network physiology underlying SPW-R."
https://openalex.org/W2093743468,"Mahogunin ring finger-1 (MGRN1) is a RING domain-containing ubiquitin ligase mutated in mahoganoid, a mouse mutation causing coat color darkening, congenital heart defects, high embryonic lethality, and spongiform neurodegeneration. The melanocortin hormones regulate pigmentation, cortisol production, food intake, and body weight by signaling through five G protein-coupled receptors positively coupled to the cAMP pathway (MC1R-MC5R). Genetic analysis has shown that mouse Mgrn1 is an accessory protein for melanocortin signaling that may inhibit MC1R and MC4R by unknown mechanisms. These melanocortin receptors (MCRs) regulate pigmentation and body weight, respectively. We show that human melanoma cells express 4 MGRN1 isoforms differing in the C-terminal exon 17 and in usage of exon 12. This exon contains nuclear localization signals. MGRN1 isoforms decreased MC1R and MC4R signaling to cAMP, without effect on beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Inhibition was independent on receptor plasma membrane expression, ubiquitylation, internalization, or stability and occurred upstream of Galpha(s) binding to/activation of adenylyl cyclase. MGRN1 co-immunoprecipitated with MCRs, suggesting a physical interaction of the proteins. Significantly, overexpression of Galpha(s) abolished the inhibitory effect of MGRN1 and decreased co-immunoprecipitation with MCRs, suggesting competition between MGRN1 and Galpha(s) for binding to MCRs. Although all MGRN1s were located in the cytosol in the absence of MCRs, exon 12-containing isoforms accumulated in the nuclei upon co-expression with the receptors. Therefore, MGRN1 inhibits MCR signaling by a new mechanism involving displacement of Galpha(s), thus accounting for key features of the mahoganoid phenotype. Moreover, MGRN1 might provide a novel pathway for melanocortin signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus."

We examined a 6-Mb region on 11q23 by high-resolution deletion mapping, using both loss of heterozygosity analysis and customized microarray comparative genomic hybridization. LARG (leukemia-associated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor) (also called ARHGEF12), identified from the analysed region, is frequently underexpressed in breast and colorectal carcinomas with a reduced expression observed in all breast cancer cell lines (n=11), in 12 of 38 (32%) primary breast cancers, 5 of 10 (50%) colorectal cell lines and in 20 of 37 (54%) primary colorectal cancers. Underexpression of the LARG transcript was significantly associated with genomic loss (P=0.00334). Hypermethylation of the LARG promoter was not detected in either breast or colorectal cancer, and treatment of four breast and four colorectal cancer cell lines with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A did not result in a reactivation of LARG. Enforced expression of LARG in breast and colorectal cancer cells by stable transfection resulted in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, as well as in a markedly slower cell migration rate in colorectal cancer cells, providing functional evidence for LARG as a candidate tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1968771532,"Brain functional networks are graph representations of activity in the brain, where the vertices represent anatomical regions and the edges their functional connectivity. These networks present a robust small world topological structure, characterized by highly integrated modules connected sparsely by long range links. Recent studies showed that other topological properties such as the degree distribution and the presence (or absence) of a hierarchical structure are not robust, and show different intriguing behaviors. In order to understand the basic ingredients necessary for the emergence of these complex network structures we present an adaptive complex network model for human brain functional networks. The microscopic units of the model are dynamical nodes that represent active regions of the brain, whose interaction gives rise to complex network structures. The links between the nodes are chosen following an adaptive algorithm that establishes connections between dynamical elements with similar internal states. We show that the model is able to describe topological characteristics of human brain networks obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. In particular, when the dynamical rules of the model allow for integrated processing over the entire network scale-free non-hierarchical networks with well defined communities emerge. On the other hand, when the dynamical rules restrict the information to a local neighborhood, communities cluster together into larger ones, giving rise to a hierarchical structure, with a truncated power law degree distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2036012822,"Gpm6a was identified as a stress-responsive gene in the hippocampal formation. This gene is down-regulated in the hippocampus of both socially and physically stressed animals, and this effect can be reversed by antidepressant treatment. Previously we showed that the stress-regulated protein M6a is a key modulator for neurite outgrowth and filopodium/spine formation. In the present work, mutational analysis was used to characterize the action of M6a at the molecular level. We show that four cysteines 162, 174, 192, and 202 within EC2 are functionally crucial sites. The presence of cysteines 162 and 202 is essential for the efficient cell surface expression of the M6a protein. In contrast, cysteines 174 and 192, which form a disulfide bridge as shown by biochemical analysis, are not required for the efficient surface expression of M6a. Their mutation to alanine does not interfere with the localization of M6a to filopodial protrusions in primary hippocampal neurons. The neurons expressing C174A and/or C192A mutants display decreased filopodia number. In non-permeabilized cells, these mutant proteins are not recognized by a function-blocking monoclonal antibody directed to M6a. Moreover, neurons in contact with axons expressing C174A/C192A mutant display significantly lower density of presynaptic clusters over their dendrites.

In several animal models of chronic stress, expression levels for M6a in hippocampal tissue were found to be diminished by chronic stress exposure and this effect was counteracted by treatment with antidepressants (2.Alfonso J.

Recently, an association of the M6A gene with the subgroup of schizophrenia patients with high levels of depression has been reported (4.Boks M.P. Hoogendoorn M. Jungerius B.J. Bakker S.C.

These findings suggest that M6a plays a role in the stress-induced hippocampal alterations that are found in psychiatric disorders in general. M6a is prominently expressed in the central nervous system as early as embryonic day 10 and remains detectable in adulthood (5.Yan Y. Narayanan V. Lagenaur C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 370: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Originally, it was identified as an antigen reacting with the monoclonal M6 antibody and its role as a modulator of neurite outgrowth was postulated (6.Lagenaur C. Kunemund V. Fischer G. Fushiki S. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Lagenaur et al. (6.Lagenaur C. Kunemund V. Fischer G. Fushiki S. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IgG or Fab fragments of M6 antibody interfere with the extension of neurites by cultured cerebellar neurons. A recent study by Zhao et al. (7.Zhao J. Iida A. Ouchi Y. Satoh S. Watanabe S. Mol. Vis. 2008; 14: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar) shows that M6a expressed in the murine neural retina also regulates neurite extension. The neurite outgrowth of M6a-overexpressing retinal cells was strikingly enhanced, although M6a did not affect differentiation and proliferation. Even though the precise biological function of M6a still remains unclear, there is a growing body of evidence indicating the importance of M6a in the processes of neural development such as neurite extension and differentiation. For example, a study by Mukobata et al. (8.Mukobata S. Hibino T. Sugiyama A. Urano Y. Inatomi A. Kanai Y. Endo H. Tashiro F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that M6a expression enhances nerve growth factor-primed neurite extension in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. They show that it also induces an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of PC12 cells and that the anti-M6a antibody efficiently interferes with both nerve growth factor-triggered Ca2+ influx and neurite extension (8.Mukobata S. Hibino T. Sugiyama A. Urano Y. Inatomi A. Kanai Y. Endo H. Tashiro F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Next, inhibition of mouse M6a expression was found to lead to decreased differentiation of neurons derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (9.Michibata H. Okuno T. Konishi N. Wakimoto K. Kyono K. Aoki K. Kondo Y. Takata K. Kitamura Y. Taniguchi T. Stem Cells Dev. 2008; 17: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that M6a plays an important role in neurite/filopodium outgrowth and synapse formation (10.Alfonso J. Fernández M.E. Cooper B. Flugge G. Frasch A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17196-17201Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This study shows that M6a overexpression induces neurite formation and increases filopodia density in hippocampal neurons. M6a knockdown with small interference RNA methodology showed that M6a low expressing neurons display decreased filopodia number and a lower density of synaptophysin clusters. The reduced M6a expression by chronic stress might be directly related to the morphological alterations found in the hippocampus of chronically stressed animals. The mechanism that would explain how M6a regulates neurite/filopodium outgrowth and its involvement in chronic stress response remains unclear. In this study our goal was to identify the regions within M6a that are critical for the neurite/filopodium outgrowth. To define the putative biologically critical amino acid residues we took advantage of the striking structural similarities that M6a bears to the tetraspanin family of proteins. The functional specificity of tetraspanins is determined by the EC2 3The abbreviations used are: EC2large extracellular loopEC1small extracellular loopPLPproteolipid proteinWTwild typeGFPgreen fluorescent proteinN2amouse neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell linePBSphosphate-buffered salineMAP2microtubule-associated protein 2PKproteinase KmAbmonoclonal antibodyTMDtransmembrane domainMEMminimal essential mediumANOVAanalysis of varianceMTSEAN-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate. region. The EC2 is subdivided into a constant region and a variable region. The variable subdomain, which contains nearly all of the known tetraspanin protein-protein interaction sites, is inserted within the conserved subdomain and their relative topology is governed by the occurrence of key disulfides. The central role of the two disulfide bridges in stabilizing the EC2 structure was firmly established. In addition, most EC2s of tetraspanins are glycosylated in one or more potential N-glycosylation sites (11.Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Similarly to tetraspanins, the extracellular region of M6a contains cysteines residues that may be functionally crucial sites. In this report, we show that cysteines 174 and 192 within the EC2 are important for the role of the M6a protein in filopodia formation and synaptogenesis. All mutations were introduced into GFP-M6a, a mammalian expression plasmid coding for wild type (WT) M6a fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) that has been described previously (10.Alfonso J. Fernández M.E. Cooper B. Flugge G. Frasch A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17196-17201Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The expressed fusion protein is functional and localizes correctly to the plasma membrane of transfected cell lines or neuronal primary cultures. To create the cysteine mutants, cysteine residues at positions 44, 46, 162, 174, 192, and 202 were mutated to alanine. The substitution of conserved cysteine residues with alanine rather than serine has been proposed to minimize the effects of the substituting amino acid on proper protein folding and stability (15.Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To mutate two N-glycosylation sites, asparagines at positions 164 and 208 were substituted by glutamines. Multiple mutations in EC2, where two or more cysteines (Cys162, Cys174, Cys192, and Cys202) or two asparagines (Asn164 and Asn208) were mutated, were created by conducting serial rounds of site-directed mutagenesis. The desired mutations were generated by standard PCR mutagenesis techniques using BD Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (BD Biosciences Clontech). Two overlapping oligonucleotide primers, one of which contains the target mutation (purchased from Sigma) were used to amplify the template DNA and were as follows: C44A forward, 5′-T GGC TGT GGC CAT GAA GCC CTT TCT GGA ACA-3′, reverse, 5′-AAG GGC TTC ATG GCC ACA GCC AGC GAA CAG GGC AA-3′; C46A forward, 5′-T GGC CAT GAA GCC CTT TCT GGA ACA GTC AA-3′, reverse, 5′-AGA AAG GGC TTC ATG GCC AGC GCC ACA GAA CA-3′; double C44A/C46A forward, 5′-T GGC CAT GAA GCC CTT TCT GGA ACA GT-3′, reverse, 5′-A AAG GGC TTC ATG GCC AGC GCC AGC GAA CAG GGC AA-3′; C162A forward, 5′-TC AAT GTG TGG ACC ATC GCC CGG AAC ACC A-3′, reverse, 5′-GAT GGT CCA CAC ATT GAA ATA CAT GTA CAC GGG C-3′; C174A forward, 5′-TA GTG GAG GGA GCA AAT CTC GCC TTG GAT CTG-3′, reverse, 5′-GAG ATT TGC TCC CTC CAC TAG AGT GGT GTT-3′; C192A forward, 5′-CA ATT GGA GAG GAA AAG AAA ATT GCT ACT GCC TCT G-3′, reverse, 5′-AAT TTT CTT TTC CTC TCC AAT TGT CAC AAT CCC-3′; C202A forward, 5′-CT GAG AAC TTC CTG AGG ATG GCT GAA TCT ACT-3′, reverse, 5′-CAT CCT CAG GAA GTT CTC AGA GGC AGT ACA-3′; N164Q forward, 5′-C AAT GTG TGG ACC ATC TGC CGG CAA ACC ACT C-3′, reverse, 5′-CCG GCA GAT GGT CCA CAC ATT GAA ATA CAT GTA CAC G-3′; N208Q forward, 5′-G AGG ATG TGT GAA TCT ACT GAG CTG CAG ATG ACC TTC CAC-3′, reverse, 5′-CAG CTC AGT AGA TTC ACA CAT CCT CAG GAA GTT CTC AGA GGC-3′. Following temperature cycling, the DpnI endonuclease was used to digest the parental DNA template and to select for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. The identity of all mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing on ABI 377 or ABI 3130 sequencers (Applied Biosystems). Dissociated neuronal cultures were prepared from hippocampi of embryonic day 19 Wistar rats, as described (16.Brocco M. Pollevick G.D. Frasch A.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 744-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue was treated with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' solution for 15 min at 37 °C. A single-cell solution was prepared in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 2 mm glutamine, 10 μm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MEM1X) with 10% (v/v) horse serum. Cells were seeded on plates or coverslips coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma) and 20 μg/μl laminin (Invitrogen) at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2. After 2 h, medium was changed to MEM/N2 (MEM1X with 1 g/liter ovalbumin and B27 serum-free supplements from Invitrogen). Mouse neuroblastoma N2a and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Neurons or N2a cells growing in 24-well plates were transiently transfected with 2 μg of DNA mixed with 1 and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions (medium was changed 4–6 h later). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. If not indicated otherwise in the text, fixation was followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. Cultures were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1–2 h followed by incubation with the primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight and with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies were: monoclonal anti-M6a rat IgG (1/250) (Medical and Biological Laboratories), monoclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) mouse IgG (1/200) (Sigma), and anti-synaptophysin 1 rabbit antiserum (1/500) (Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (1/1000), goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 350 (1/200) (Molecular Probes), or rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1/1000) (Jackson). F-actin was stained with rhodamine phalloidin (1/1000) (Molecular Probes), together with secondary antibody incubation in the case of double labeling experiments. Coverslips were mounted in FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem). Fluorescent images were acquired by using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination (Nikon) with a ×100 oil-immersion lens. COS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were grown to 90% confluence and transfected with plasmids encoding WT GFP-M6a fusion protein or double C174A/C192A mutant protein (24 μg of DNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours following the transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with PBS alone or with proteinase K (PK) at a final concentration 1 mg/ml (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, dishes were placed on ice and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to halt digestion. Cells were scraped and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Samples were then rapidly centrifuged, and the supernatants were aspirated. Cell pellets were lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% deoxycholate sodium salt, 0.1% SDS, pH 8) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 15 min on ice. Proteins were then precipitated by trichloroacetic acid/acetone precipitation at −20°C overnight. After the precipitation, samples were centrifuged at 11,500 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were discarded. The protein pellets were dissolved in the appropriate volume of rehydration buffer (10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 9 m urea) and the concentration of solubilized proteins measured using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). 5× SDS sample buffer was added to each sample. The protein samples were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15 μg/lane) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. After 2 h of blocking in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk, the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal serum (1/750) (Invitrogen). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1/10,000) (Dako, Denmark) according to standard Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting protocol using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Cell surface protein were biotinylated with N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin; Toronto Research Chemicals). MTSEA-biotin is a membrane-impermeable, thiol-reactive agent that reacts only with cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups of free cysteines. Thus only cysteines not in a disulfide bond and in an accessible area of the protein tertiary structure will form a mixed disulfide with this alkylthiosulfonate and can be detected on immunoblots of avidin-biotin pulldown assays. No biotinylation would indicate that all cysteines in the extracellular region are unavailable, either from being disulfide-bonded and/or from residing in an area of the molecule that is inaccessible to MTSEA-biotin. A Cys → Ala point mutation of a residue that normally forms a disulfide bond would result in the bond being broken and the liberation of a partner cysteine residue would be detected as an increase in the biotinylation. In case of a double Cys → Ala mutation, when the correct pair of cysteines in a disulfide bond had been mutated the MTSEA-biotinylation would be decreased. In contrast, a double mutation corresponding to incorrect partners may result in an increase in biotinylation because of formation of a further free cysteine residue. COS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were grown to 90% confluence and transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged WT M6a, PLP, and the indicated M6a mutants (20 μg of DNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with MTSEA-biotin (at a final concentration 0.5 mm) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound MTSEA-biotin in the reaction was quenched by 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were washed twice in 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, scraped, and transferred to Eppendorf tubes with 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were disrupted by sonicating on ice using five 1-s bursts and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C, 400 μl of the clarified supernatant was added to 400 μl of NeutrAvidin-agarose slurry (Pierce) pre-equilibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C to allow binding of neutravidin to biotinylated proteins. Then, the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, pH 7.2) with a 2-min centrifugation (1,000 × g) at 4 °C between washes. After the final wash, biotinylated proteins were eluted by 2 × 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer with 100 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min before SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses. The remaining 100 μl of clarified cell lysate was used to assess the total amount of the overexpressed GFP-tagged protein in cellular lysate (input control for quantification purposes). Proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid/acetone precipitation as described above, dissolved in 20 μl of rehydration buffer, and the concentration of solubilized proteins was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay). 5× SDS sample buffer was added to each sample. The protein samples were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, and processed for anti-GFP antibody (rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal serum (1/750); Invitrogen) staining as described previously. Immunoblots were quantified by densitometric analyses using ImageJ software. For the neuroblastona cell line N2a, the percentage of cells showing filopodial protrusions (visualized by the F-actin marker phalloidin) was calculated for both transfected as well as non-transfected cells from the same coverslip. Transfection with WT M6a and GFP alone was used as a control. On average, 60–120 cells from three to nine groups for each transfection condition from multiple experiments were analyzed. The ratio of transfected to non-transfected filopodia-bearing cells from the same coverslip was determined. Filopodium density (number of protrusions per 20-μm neurite length measured within 50 μm from the soma as shown in the Fig. 7A) was quantified in 33–55 neurites of different neurons from 2 to 12 groups for each overexpression culture from multiple experiments. Group means were then analyzed for overall statistical significance by using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test for post hoc effects versus WT M6a and GFP as controls or by a Student's t test. To quantify the spots of synaptohysin 1 immunoreactivity, regions where transfected axons (identified by green labeling and their lack of MAP2 immunostaining) contacted non-transfected MAP2 positive dendrites were selected. The number of immunopositive synaptophysin 1 puncta was counted in a 40-μm neurite length along similar distances out from the soma in 22 neurites of a minimum 11 different neurons per group for overexpression cultures and repeated on three separate culture preparations. Group means were then analyzed for overall statistical significance by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Calculations were performed with the software GraphPad Prism. To define the part of the M6a molecule or amino acid residues that might be critical for the induction of filopodial protrusion formation, we constructed a series of M6a mutants expected to interfere with the function of the protein. The selection of proposed mutation sites was based on structural similarity of M6a to tetraspanins and numerous mutational analysis data available on the function of this family of proteins. Fig. 1 shows the predicted computational model of M6a displaying M6a structural features. It contains four transmembrane domains, a small extracellular loop (EC1), a very short intracellular loop, and a large extracellular loop (EC2), flanked by relatively short N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. There are four cysteines residues in EC2 domain (Cys162, Cys174, Cys192, and Cys202) that may be functionally important and two cysteines residues in the EC1 domain (Cys44 and Cys46). The EC2 domain also contains two potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn164 and Asn208). In the cytoplasmic part of the protein, two potential sites for protein kinase C and one for the casein kinase II phosphorylation are present as well as additional juxtamembrane cysteine residues. In analogy to tetraspanins, function of M6a may be determined by its EC2 region and its four cysteines residues may play the central role. To test this hypothesis, single C162A, C174A, C192A, and C202A point mutations, as well as double C162A/C174A, C174A/C192A, triple C162A/C174A/C192A, and quadruple C162A/C174A/C192A/C202A point mutations were introduced into GFP-M6a. The constructs were transfected into the neuroblastoma cell line N2a, and subcellular distribution of WT and mutant M6a proteins was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig. 2A shows non-permeabilized N2a cells transfected with the WT M6a and mutants. Single C162A and 202A mutants and all variants that include these mutations were detected intracellulary and none of them displays cell surface expression that can be clearly seen in control WT M6a-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, maximized views). Taken together, these results show that Cys → Ala mutations of Cys162 and Cys202 in the EC2 region disrupt the cell membrane localization of the M6a protein. We suppose that they could interfere with proper protein folding and/or cell surface trafficking. On the other hand, when N2a cells were transfected with single C174A or C192A or their combination C174A/C192A M6a mutants, we observed intense staining of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the C174A/C192A mutant was exposed on the outside of the cell, we probed its accessibility to digestion with the extracellular PK, a broad spectrum protease widely used to demonstrate the surface exposure of the membrane proteins. If WT M6a or the C174A/C192A mutant were expressed on the plasma membrane, their extracellular part would be accessible to PK digestion. Intracelullar parts of the proteins would be inaccessible, and thus protected from PK digestion. On Western blot we would be able to detect the fragments undigested by PK. Using anti-GFP antibody we expected to detect a cleaved fragment (∼32 kDa) corresponding to the GFP-tagged N-terminal part including the first transmembrane domain after PK treatment. In case the proteins are not cell surface exposed, and thus inaccessible to protease digestion, only full-length GFP fusion proteins would be detected by anti-GFP antibody after PK treatment. Intact COS-7 cells transfected with the double C174A/C192A mutant or WT M6a as a control were treated with PK. Cleaved products were analyzed on immunoblots using anti-GFP antibody. In both cases, PK treatment of cells expressing either WT M6a or the double C174A/C192A mutant yielded protein fragments of ∼32 kDa (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the size of the N-terminal GFP-tagged fragment localized inside the cell. This indicates that the mutant protein is accessible to PK digestion, and thus present on the plasma membrane. To investigate whether cysteine residues within the extracellular region of M6a form disulfide bonds, MTSEA-biotin labeling of cell surface proteins was performed. We used this assay to assess the availability of accessible free cysteines in the extracellular region of WT M6a and M6a cysteine mutants. Intact COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-tagged WT M6a, and the indicated M6a cysteine mutants, were treated with MTSEA-biotin. GFP-tagged PLP was used as a control because it belongs to the same family of proteins as M6a and the state of all cysteines residues of PLP and its membrane topology are well known (17.Weimbs T. Stoffel W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12289-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cell surface-biotinylated proteins were pulled down by neutravidin and analyzed on immunoblots using anti-GFP antibody. For quantification purposes we show data as the ratio of biotinylated proteins pulled down by neutravidin to the total in cellular lysates, as measured by densitometric analysis of immunoblots. Fig. 3, A and B, demonstrates that WT M6a as well as PLP are biotinylated, indicating that some cysteines in the extracellular region of WT molecules are free and thus accessible to MTSEA-biotin. A further increase in the biotinylation was detected for C174A and C192A mutants. This indicates that these residues are normally involved in disulfide bond formation in WT M6a. Double C174A/C192A mutant showed a decrease in biotinylation, and thus, less free cysteines available for MTSEA-biotinylation (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests that Cys174 and Cys192 correspond to the disulfide pair in WT M6a. Biotinylation of C44A and C46A mutants did not differ from that of WT M6a. The double C44A/C46A mutant showed a decrease in biotinylation compared with WT M6a, although the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 3C). It was not possible to test for the cell surface MTSEA-biotinylation of Cys162 and Cys202 because their mutation to alanine interfered with cell surface expression of the mutant proteins. The model for M6a topography predicts that EC2 is positioned on the outside of the cell. A previous study reported that monoclonal anti-M6a antibody directed against the extracellular part of the protein interferes with the extension of neurites by cultured cerebellar neurons (6.Lagenaur C. Kunemund V. Fischer G. Fushiki S. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutagenesis studies of tetraspanins demonstrated that EC2 of tetraspanins is a crucial site for specific functional protein-protein interactions (18.Higginbottom A. Quinn E.R. Kuo C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2065060909,"The prion consists essentially of PrPSc, a misfolded and aggregated conformer of the cellular protein PrPC. Whereas PrPC deficient mice are clinically healthy, expression of PrPC variants lacking its central domain (PrPΔCD), or of the PrP-related protein Dpl, induces lethal neurodegenerative syndromes which are repressed by full-length PrP. Here we tested the structural basis of these syndromes by grafting the amino terminus of PrPC (residues 1–134), or its central domain (residues 90–134), onto Dpl. Further, we constructed a soluble variant of the neurotoxic PrPΔCD mutant that lacks its glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) membrane anchor. Each of these modifications abrogated the pathogenicity of Dpl and PrPΔCD in transgenic mice. The PrP-Dpl chimeric molecules, but not anchorless PrPΔCD, ameliorated the disease of mice expressing truncated PrP variants. We conclude that the amino proximal domain of PrP exerts a neurotrophic effect even when grafted onto a distantly related protein, and that GPI-linked membrane anchoring is necessary for both beneficial and deleterious effects of PrP and its variants."
https://openalex.org/W2043270086,"The human holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) catalyzes transfer of biotin to biotin-dependent carboxylases, and the enzyme is therefore of fundamental importance for many physiological processes, including fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid catabolism. In addition, the enzyme functions in regulating transcription initiation at several genes that code for proteins involved in biotin metabolism. Two major forms of HCS exist in humans, which differ at the amino terminus by 57 amino acids. In this work, the two proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to biochemical characterization. Equilibrium sedimentation indicates that the two proteins are monomers both in their apo-forms and when bound to the enzymatic intermediate biotinyl 5'-AMP. Steady state kinetic analyses as a function of biotin, ATP, or a minimal biotin-accepting substrate concentration indicate similar behaviors for both isoforms. However, pre-steady state analysis of biotin transfer reveals that the full-length HCS associates with the minimal biotin acceptor substrate with a rate twice as fast as that of the truncated isoform. These results are consistent with a role for the HCS amino terminus in biotin acceptor substrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2056852438,"Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized by endothelial 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) to several vasodilatory eicosanoids such as 11,12,15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12,15-THETA) and its proposed unstable precursor 15-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-H-11,12-EETA). In the present study, the acid-stable 13-hydroxy-trans-14,15-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (13-H-14,15-EETA) was identified and its vascular activities characterized. Rabbit aorta, mesenteric arteries, and the combination of 15-LO and cytochrome P450 2J2 converted AA to two distinct HEETA metabolites. The HEETA metabolites were resistant to acidic hydrolysis but were hydrolyzed by recombinant sEH to a more polar metabolite identified by mass spectrometry as 13,14,15-THETA. Mass spectrometric analyses and HPLC comigration identified the HEETAs as threo- and erythro-diastereomers of 13-H-trans-14,15-EETA. Erythro- and threo-diastereomers of 13-H-trans-14,15-EETA relaxed endothelium-denuded rabbit small mesenteric arteries with maximum relaxations of 22.6 +/- 6.0% and 8.6 +/- 4.3%, respectively. Apamin (10(-7) m) inhibited the relaxations to the erythro-isomer (maximum relaxation = 1.2 +/- 5.6%) and increasing [K(+)](o) from 4.6 to 30 mm blocked relaxations to both isomers. In cell-attached patches of mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), erythro-13-H-trans-14,15-EETA (1-3 x 10(-6) m) increased mean open time of small conductance K(+) channels (13-14 pS) from 0.0007 +/- 0.0007 to 0.0053 +/- 0.0042. This activation was inhibited by apamin. The erythro, but not the threo, isomer blocked angiotensin II-stimulated aortic SMC migration. These studies demonstrate that 13-H-14,15-EETAs induces vascular relaxation via K(+) channel activation to cause SMC hyperpolarization. Thus, 13-H-14,15-EETA represents a new endothelial factor."
https://openalex.org/W1971156133,"Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e.g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process.Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, México, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits.SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W1987594102,"ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase controls starch synthesis in plants and is an interesting case to study the evolution and differentiation of roles in heteromeric enzymes. It includes two homologous subunits, small (S) and large (L), that originated from a common photosynthetic eukaryotic ancestor. In present day organisms, these subunits became complementary after loss of certain roles in a process described as subfunctionalization. For instance, the potato tuber enzyme has a noncatalytic L subunit that complements an S subunit with suboptimal allosteric properties. To understand the evolution of catalysis and regulation in this family, we artificially synthesized both subunit genes from the unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. This is among the most ancient species in the green lineage that diverged from the ancestor of all green plants and algae. After heterologous gene expression, we purified and characterized the proteins. The O. tauri enzyme was not redox-regulated, suggesting that redox regulation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases appeared later in evolution. The S subunit had a typical low apparent affinity for the activator 3-phosphoglycerate, but it was atypically defective in the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for the substrate Glc-1-P. The L subunit needed the S subunit for soluble expression. In the presence of a mutated S subunit (to avoid interference), the L subunit had a high apparent affinity for 3-phosphoglycerate and substrates suggesting a leading role in catalysis. Therefore, the subfunctionalization of the O. tauri enzyme was different from previously described cases.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first biochemical description of a system with alternative subfunctionalization paths. Starch synthesis in photosynthetic eukaryotes such as higher plants and unicellular algae is controlled by a heterotetrameric ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-Glc PPase, 4The abbreviations used are: ADP-Glc PPaseADP-glucose pyrophosphorylaseOtaSO. tauri S subunitOtaLO. tauri L subunit3-PGA3-phosphoglycerateBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolHEPPS3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propanesulfonic acid.

In photosynthetic eukaryotes the enzyme includes two distinct S and L homologous subunits (S2L2 or α2β2), but in photosynthetic bacteria the enzyme is a homotetramer (α4). There has been debate regarding the role of the different subunits of ADP-Glc PPase. The S subunit homotetramer from potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber (StuS), Arabidopsis thaliana (APS1), and barley (Hordeum vulgare) endosperm have a catalytic function with defective regulatory properties (1.Ballicora M.A. Fu Y.

The L subunit from potato tuber (StuL) is catalytically deficient and plays more of a regulatory role by modifying the apparent affinity of the S subunit toward allosteric regulators (1.Ballicora M.A. Fu Y. Nesbitt N.M. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4.Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Devillers C.H. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10189-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Arabidopsis APL1 and APL2 isoforms have both catalytic and regulatory functions, whereas the APL3 and APL4 isoforms behave like StuL (2.Crevillén P. Ballicora M.A. Mérida A.

Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The maize (Zea mays) endosperm L subunit has been postulated to have a role in catalysis due to effects on apparent affinity of substrates (6.Cross J.M. Clancy M. Shaw J.R. Greene T.W. Schmidt R.R. Okita T.W. Hannah L.C. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but this may be explained by allosteric effects. Even when the L subunit is not catalytic, it binds substrate and activator molecules. This may contribute to the synergistic effect seen when the L subunit influences the properties of the S subunit and vice versa (7.Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6741-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8.Hwang S.K. Hamada S. Okita T.W. Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 464-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9.Hwang S.K.

ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase O. tauri S subunit O. tauri L subunit 3-phosphoglycerate 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propanesulfonic acid. Different subunit roles have involved gene duplication, divergence, and functional evolution from a common ancestor. In plants and green algae, the presence of two types of subunits expanded the sequence space to explore new roles. Recently, it was shown that L subunit isoforms from Arabidopsis had different properties based on the tissue expression (2.Crevillén P. Ballicora M.A. Mérida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10.Crevillén P. Ventriglia T. Pinto F. Orea A. Mérida A. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8143-8149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of two types of subunits may have constrained each subunit to adopt complementary roles. For instance, S and L subunits need to interact to form tetramers in vivo (11.Wang S.M. Lue W.L. Yu T.S. Long J.H. Wang C.N. Eimert K. Chen J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because fewer S isoforms (e.g. only one in Arabidopsis) are available to combine with many L isoforms in different tissues, there is extra pressure for S subunits to remain catalytic in cases where the L subunits are not. The evolutionary path for these ADP-Glc PPase subunits to acquire or lose different roles is not clear despite recent success in determining the ancient catalytic role of StuL. This L subunit from potato tuber is defective in catalysis, but 10–20% of its catalytic activity was resurrected by mutating only two key residues (4.Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Devillers C.H. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10189-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that it evolved from a catalytic ancestor common to all flowering plants. However, it is uncertain how catalytic roles of the subunits diverged in early photosynthetic eukaryotes. The lineage of the unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri is in a unique position to understand the functional evolution of the ADP-Glc PPase subunits. This organism belongs to the Prasinophyceae class (12.Courties C. Perasso R. Chretiennot-Dinet M.-J. Gouy M. Guillou L. Troussellier M. J. Phycol. 1998; 34: 844-849Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), potentially the most ancient species in the green lineage that diverged from the ancestor of all green plants and algae (13.Hicks G.R.

Plant Res. 2008; 121: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). O. tauri has a single starch granule and the full set of genes present in higher plants for polysaccharide metabolism (16.Derelle E. Ferraz C. Rombauts S. Rouzé P. Worden A.Z. Robbens S. Partensky F. Degroeve S. Echeynié S. Cooke R. Saeys Y. Wuyts J. Jabbari K. Bowler C. Panaud O. Piégu B. Ball S.G. Ral J.P. Bouget F.Y. Piganeau G. De Baets B. Picard A. Delseny M. Demaille J. Van de Peer Y. Moreau H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11647-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In addition, it is known that the Prasinophyceae use the ADP-Glc pathway to synthesize starch (17.Ral J.P. Derelle E. Ferraz C. Wattebled F. Farinas B. Corellou F. Buléon A. Slomianny M.C. Delvalle D. d'Hulst C. Rombauts S. Moreau H. Ball S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To study the evolution of structure and function of subunits in the ADP-Glc PPase family, we artificially synthesized O. tauri OtaS and OtaL subunits because of their unique evolutionary position. We gained insightful information about the properties of the common ancestor of all ADP-Glc PPases from photosynthetic eukaryotes and how regulation of starch synthesis evolved. We found that under certain conditions OtaL, more than OtaS, may play a leading role in catalysis. As a result, we propose that the retention of catalytic properties is not necessarily identical in all branches of the phylogenetic tree. Differences in roles of O. tauri subunits also indicate that alternative divergent functional paths may have occurred in the evolution of ADP-Glc PPases. α-d-[U-14C]Glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) was purchased from GE Healthcare. Glc-1-P, ATP, ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), NADP, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, phosphoglucomutase from rabbit muscle, and inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. Phusion DNA polymerase and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). StrataClone™ Blunt PCR cloning kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All other reagents were purchased at the highest quality available. Escherichia coli glycogen synthase for the ADP-Glc synthesis assay was expressed and purified as described (18.Yep A. Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for gene synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, San Diego). Automated DNA sequencing was performed by University of Chicago Cancer Research Center. The OtaS and OtaL subunit genes were artificially synthesized with optimized codon usage (19.Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), following a PCR-based method with some modifications (20.Xiong A.S. Yao Q.H. Peng R.H. Li X. Fan H.Q. Cheng Z.M. Li Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e98Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). The genes were divided into three pieces of ∼500 bp to facilitate synthesis (supplemental Fig. 2). Oligonucleotides of 50 bp with a 25-bp overlap corresponding to top and bottom strand sequences of each ∼500-bp piece were purchased (supplemental Table 1). These oligonucleotides (40 pmol each) were combined in a single 50-μl PCR with Phusion DNA polymerase, following the manufacturer's instructions. After an initial denaturation of 30 s at 98 °C, we performed 30 cycles of 98 °C for 5 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified after agarose gel electrophoresis and inserted into the pSC-B vector using the StrataClone™ Blunt PCR cloning kit. Colonies were screened and sent to be sequenced. When unwanted mutations were present, they were eliminated linking correct fragments by PCR, and the screening and sequencing process was repeated. Whole genes were constructed using subsequent Phusion PCRs where all ∼500-bp pieces for each gene were used as template DNA in a single reaction and subcloned into pSC-B. The final products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. OtaS and OtaL genes were then subcloned into the compatible pMAB5 and pMAB6 expression vectors (21.Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Gómez-Casati D.F. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), respectively, using NdeI and SacI restriction sites. The vector pMAB5 is a derivative of the pMON17335 and pACYC177 with a tac promoter and a phage T7 gene10 leader translation enhancer (22.Iglesias A.A. Barry G.F. Meyer C. Bloksberg L. Nakata P.A. Greene T. Laughlin M.J. Okita T.W. Kishore G.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1081-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, pMAB6 is a derivative of pMON17336 and pBR327 with a PrecA and a gene10 leader translation enhancer expression cassette (22.Iglesias A.A. Barry G.F. Meyer C. Bloksberg L. Nakata P.A. Greene T. Laughlin M.J. Okita T.W. Kishore G.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1081-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These vectors do not express proteins with affinity tags. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR overlap extension (23.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Argentine J. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar) using Phusion DNA polymerase. Plasmids encoding the wild-type S subunit (OtaS) or wild-type L subunit (OtaL) were used as templates unless stated otherwise. Mutations on OtaS were accomplished using the following oligonucleotides: D148A, 5′-TGA GCG GTG CGC ACC TGT AC-3′; K201R, 5′-TTT GCA GAA CGC CCG AAA GGC-3′. To obtain the double mutant OtaSD148A/K201R, the OtaSD148A construct was used as a template. The oligonucleotides used to obtain the homologous mutations in OtaL were as follows: D171A, 5′-TGG CGG GCG CGC ACC TGT AT-3′; K224R, 5′-TTT ACC GAA CGC CCA AAA GGT-3′. Flanking primers for OtaS were as follows: forward, 5′-CAT ATG GCG GGT ACT AAC ACT CCT G-3′; reverse, 5′-GAA TTC GAG CTC TTA GAT CAC AGT GCC-3′. Flanking primers for OtaL were as follows: forward, 5′-CAT ATG TCT GAA CGT CGT ATT GCT C-3′; reverse, 5′-GAG CTC TCA TTA AAT GAT CGT ACC ATC TGG GAT CGT GCA GTT G-3′. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The bicinchoninic acid reagent from Pierce was used to measure protein concentration during enzyme purification. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard, and all interfering substances were removed by precipitation (12% trichloroacetic acid and 0.025% sodium deoxycholate and dissolving in 5% SDS, 0.1 n NaOH). Protein concentration after purification was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 0.803 ml cm−1 mg−1 for OtaS and 0.774 ml cm−1 mg−1 for heterotetramers. These extinction coefficients were calculated as described (24.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). Samples were desalted with Bio-Rad 10 DG chromatography columns. Centricon-30 devices (Amicon Inc., Billerica, MA) were used to concentrate the enzymes. SDS-PAGE was performed using reducing conditions on a 10% BisTris polyacrylamide gel. The BenchMark protein ladder from Invitrogen was used, and the gel was stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent from Pierce. To follow the activity during the purification, the enzyme was assayed with a coupled enzyme spectrophotometric assay. The reaction mixture contained 80 mm HEPPS buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 3-PGA, 0.5 mm ADP-Glc, 0.6 mm NADP, 10 mm NaF, 0.01 mm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2 units/ml phosphoglucomutase, 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and enzyme in a total volume of 0.3 ml. The reaction was initiated with 0.1 mm NaPPi, and absorbance at 340 nm was followed for 20 min every 15 s at 37 °C using a BioTek EL808 microplate reader (Winooski, VT). Under these conditions, the path length was 0.75 cm, and an absorbance of 0.0155 was equivalent to 1 nmol of NADPH produced and Glc-1-P synthesized. The method of Yep et al. (18.Yep A. Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was used to measure synthesis of ADP-[14C]Glc from [14C]Glc-1-P and ATP. Unless stated otherwise, the standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPPS buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm [14C]Glc-1-P (100–1000 cpm/nmol) for heterotetramers, 4 mm for OtaS homotetramer, 2.5 mm ATP, 10 mm 3-PGA, 0.75 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin plus enzyme in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The amount of ADP-[14C]Glc formed during the reaction was measured as described. To obtain saturation curves of a given effector, its concentration was varied, although the other conditions remained constant. One unit of enzyme activity is equal to 1 μmol of product, ADP-[14C]glucose, formed per min. E. coli AC7OR1-504 cells that lack endogenous ADP-Glc PPase activity were transformed with plasmids for expression (22.Iglesias A.A. Barry G.F. Meyer C. Bloksberg L. Nakata P.A. Greene T. Laughlin M.J. Okita T.W. Kishore G.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1081-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The OtaS subunit in plasmid pMAB5 was capable of being expressed alone to form a homotetramer, whereas the OtaL subunit in plasmid pMAB6 expressed alone was insoluble. For co-expression of both subunits, cells were co-transformed with pMAB5 containing wild-type OtaS or derivatives and pMAB6 containing wild-type OtaL or derivatives. Transformed cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium in a 2.8-liter Fernbach flask at 25 °C, 250 rpm, until the A600 nm reached 1.1–1.3. If the OtaS homotetramer was being expressed, 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was used to induce protein expression. Otherwise, the heterotetramers were induced with 5 μg/ml nalidixic acid and 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Protein was expressed for 16 h at 20 °C and harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall RC5B Plus centrifuge. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose) per g of cells and sonicated on ice eight times for 30 s with 45-s intervals. Crude extracts were the supernatants obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins OtaS, OtaSD148A, OtaSD148A/OtaL, OtaS/OtaL, and OtaS/OtaLD171A were purified to homogeneity using the following method. Crude extracts were loaded onto a 10- or 30-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow weak anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (10 column volumes, 0–0.5 m, 1 ml/min flow rate). Fractions that had the greatest enzyme activity were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation. The protein was resuspended in buffer A, desalted, and loaded onto a 1.7- or 10-ml Source 15Q 4.6/100 PE strong anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (20 column volumes, 0–0.5 m, 1 ml/min flow rate). Fractions with the highest activity were again pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation. Protein was resuspended in buffer H (buffer A plus 1 m (NH4)2SO4) and loaded onto two Resource PHE 1-ml HIC hydrophobic columns in tandem (GE Healthcare). The columns were equilibrated with buffer H, and protein was eluted with a linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (50 column volumes, 1 to 0 m, 0.5 ml/min flow rate). Fractions containing the highest activity were pooled, desalted, and concentrated. Chromatograms for each step of the purification of the wild-type enzyme are shown in supplemental Figs. 3–5. Typically, these enzymes were purified close to 30-fold with specific activity doubling after each column. The yield from 1 liter of culture was ∼3 mg. Enzymes OtaSD148A/K201R/OtaL, OtaSD148A/OtaLK224R, OtaSD148A/OtaLR53K/K63T, and OtaSD148A/OtaLD171A were purified using the DEAE-Sepharose column and desalted before kinetic analysis. These were more than 80% pure based on densitometry after SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The molecular weight of the OtaS/OtaL protein was determined using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Protein standards included thyroglobulin (669 kDa) (GE Healthcare), apoferritin (443 kDa) (MP Biomedicals), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa) (United States Biochemical Corp.), glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (104 kDa) (Sigma), and bovine serum albumin (68 kDa) (Sigma). The column void volume was determined using a blue dextran loading solution (Promega). The purified E. coli ADP-Glc PPase homotetramer was also used as a standard with a molecular mass of 194 kDa. Gels were visualized on a Canon 4400F scanner, and the software UN-Scan IT™ version 5.1 was used for gel densitometry to determine the subunit stoichiometry for the OtaS/OtaL wild-type protein on a 10% BisTris SDS-PAGE. We performed kinetic assays using saturated concentrations or optimal conditions for all reaction mixture components, while varying the concentration of the effector being studied. After we plotted the data as specific activity (units/mg) (v) versus effector concentration in millimolars ([S]), we fit the parameters of a modified Hill equation, v = Vmax [S]n/(S0.5n + [S]n), using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm in Origin® 7.5 (25.Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, New York1988: 347-383Google Scholar). The concentration of substrate necessary to obtain 50% of the maximum activity (Vmax) is S0.5. We used the equation v = v0 + (Vmax − v0) [A]n/(A0.5n + [A]n) to fit the activation curves, in which the activity with no activator [A] present is v0. A0.5 is the concentration of activator necessary to obtain 50% of the maximal activation (Vmax − v0). We fit the inhibition curves with the equation v = v0 + (Vinh − v0) [I]n/(I0.5n + [I] n), in which the activity with no inhibitor present is v0, and the activity at saturated concentration of inhibitor [I] is Vinh. I0.5 is the concentration of inhibitor necessary to obtain 50% of the maximal inhibition (v0 − Vinh). To calculate catalytic efficiency (ce = Vmax/Km) with accuracy in cases in which complete saturation was not reached (OtaSD148A/OtaLK224R), we used a modified Michaelis-Menten equation. We fit the data with the equation v = ce Km [S]/(Km + [S]) because ce = Vmax/Km. This is more accurate because Vmax/Km is the slope of the curve at very low concentrations of substrate ([S] ≪ Km) and that parameter is well determined even with curves that have not reached saturation. Standard deviations were provided by the fitting software. Kinetic experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Homology models of the O. tauri large subunit (OtaL) and potato tuber large subunit (StuL) proteins were constructed using Modeler 8 version 2. The crystal structure of the potato tuber small subunit homotetramer (Protein Data Bank code 1YP4 chain B) was used as a template, and models were evaluated as described previously (4.Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Devillers C.H. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10189-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To visualize the models we used Swiss-PdbViewer (26.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar) and POV-ray. Sequences for phylogenetic analysis were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (supplemental Table 2), and ClustalW was used initially to align sequences (27.Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). The alignments were later manually refined. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method, TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 (28.Schmidt H.A. Strimmer K. Vingron M. von Haeseler A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). Conditions were as follows: analysis with tree reconstruction; quartet puzzling with 1000 puzzling steps; approximate quartet likelihood; parameter estimates exact (slow); model of substitution with VT (29.Müller T. Vingron M. J. Comput. Biol. 2000; 7: 761-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) estimated from data set; model of rate heterogeneity with γ distributed rates estimated from a data set; and eight γ rate categories. The outgroup sequence was from the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. Duplication of an ancestral photosynthetic eukaryote gene gave rise to the ADP-Glc PPase S and L subunits present today in plants and green algae (30.Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the phylogenetic tree of these genes the L subunits are further divided into five different branches (Fig. 1), including group I to IV and unicellular algae (4.Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Devillers C.H. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10189-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previously, L subunits from group III (StuL, APL3, and APL4) were shown to have a regulatory function with a defective catalytic role (2.Crevillén P. Ballicora M.A. Mérida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J.

Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the other hand, isoforms APL1 and APL2 (groups I and II) were catalytic with a critical role in regulation (2.Crevillén P. Ballicora M.A. Mérida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5.Ventriglia T. Kuhn M.L. Ruiz M.T. Ribeiro-Pedro M. Valverde F. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Romero J.M.

The unicellular algae branches of the tree for S and L subunits have not been characterized (Fig. 1), and OtaS and OtaL belong to these two branches. To examine the structure of OtaL, we built a homology model (Fig. 2) and compared the position of the active site residues found in ADP-Glc PPases from other organisms. We found that the model contains all residues in the active site that were previously found to be critical. Residues with a Glc-1-P binding role in the E. coli enzyme (Glu-194, Lys-195, Ser-212, Tyr-216, Asp-239, Phe-240, Trp-274, and Asp-276) (33.Bejar C.M. Jin X. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2097889946,"ACA8 is a type 2B Ca(2+)-ATPase having a regulatory N terminus whose auto-inhibitory action can be suppressed by binding of calmodulin (CaM) or of acidic phospholipids. ACA8 N terminus is able to interact with a region of the small cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane domains 2 and 3. To determine the role of this interaction in auto-inhibition we analyzed single point mutants produced by mutagenesis of ACA8 Glu(252) to Asn(345) sequence. Mutation to Ala of any of six tested acidic residues (Glu(252), Asp(273), Asp(291), Asp(303), Glu(302), or Asp(332)) renders an enzyme that is less dependent on CaM for activity. These results highlight the relevance in ACA8 auto-inhibition of a negative charge of the surface area of the small cytoplasmic loop. The most deregulated of these mutants is D291A ACA8, which is less activated by controlled proteolysis or by acidic phospholipids; the D291A mutant has an apparent affinity for CaM higher than wild-type ACA8. Moreover, its phenotype is stronger than that of D291N ACA8, suggesting a more direct involvement of this residue in the mechanism of auto-inhibition. Among the other produced mutants (I284A, N286A, P289A, P322A, V344A, and N345A), only P322A ACA8 is less dependent on CaM for activity than the wild type. The results reported in this study provide the first evidence that the small cytoplasmic loop of a type 2B Ca(2+)-ATPase plays a role in the attainment of the auto-inhibited state."

The transient nature of stress signaling is a consequence of negative feedback signals that lead to kinase dephosphorylation, degradation, and sequestration, which have not been fully elucidated for MKK family members. Here, we investigated the signals that negatively regulate MKK4/SEK1, an upstream activator of the MAPKs JNK and p38/HOG1. Following exposure of cells to sorbitol, MKK4 underwent ubiquitination and degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. MKK4 ubiquitination required JNK kinase activity. The JNK substrate Itch (a HECT domain-containing Nedd4-like ubiquitin protein ligase) bound to MKK4, ubiquitinated lysines 140 and 143, and promoted MKK4 degradation. Other E3 ligases within the MAPK modular complex did not ubiquitinate MKK4. These data suggest that MKK4 is negatively regulated through a feedback loop involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which has a fundamental role in the mechanism that controls MKK4 protein levels.

This is also reflected by the frequent loss of the INK4A locus in acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells designed to conditionally express p16(INK4A) arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and show increased sensitivity to glucocorticoid- and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 6-induced apoptosis. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism for increased death sensitivity, we interfered with specific steps of apoptosis signaling by expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. We found that alterations in cell death susceptibility resulted from changes in the composition of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, i.e. repression of MCL1, BCL2, and PMAIP1/Noxa and the induction of pro-apoptotic BBC3/Puma. Interference with Puma induction by short hairpin RNA technology or retroviral expression of MCL1 or BCL2 significantly reduced both glucocorticoid- and FAS-induced cell death in p16(INK4A)-reconstituted leukemia cells. These results suggest that Puma, in concert with MCL1 and BCL2 repression, critically mediates p16(INK4A)-induced death sensitization and that in human T-cell leukemia the deletion of p16(INK4A) confers apoptosis resistance by shifting the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins toward apoptosis protection."
https://openalex.org/W2031268430,"Background Visual perception is usually stable and accurate. However, when the two eyes are simultaneously presented with conflicting stimuli, perception falls into a sequence of spontaneous alternations, switching between one stimulus and the other every few seconds. Known as binocular rivalry, this visual illusion decouples subjective experience from physical stimulation and provides a unique opportunity to study the neural correlates of consciousness. The temporal properties of this alternating perception have been intensively investigated for decades, yet the relationship between two fundamental properties - the sequence of percepts and the duration of each percept - remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we examine the relationship between the percept sequence and the percept duration by quantifying their sensitivity to the strength imbalance between two monocular stimuli. We found that the percept sequence is far more susceptible to the stimulus imbalance than does the percept duration. The percept sequence always begins with the stronger stimulus, even when the stimulus imbalance is too weak to cause a significant bias in the percept duration. Therefore, introducing a small stimulus imbalance affects the percept sequence, whereas increasing the imbalance affects the percept duration, but not vice versa. To investigate why the percept sequence is so vulnerable to the stimulus imbalance, we further measured the interval between the stimulus onset and the first percept, during which subjects experienced the fusion of two monocular stimuli. We found that this interval is dramatically shortened with increased stimulus imbalance. Conclusions/Significance Our study shows that in binocular rivalry, the strength imblanace between monocular stimuli has a much greater impact on the percept sequence than on the percept duration, and increasing this imbalance can accelerate the process responsible for the percept sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1971511597,"Class II MHC molecules (MHC II) are cell surface receptors displaying short protein fragments for the surveillance by CD4+ T cells. Antigens therefore have to be loaded onto this receptor in order to induce productive immune responses. On the cell surface, most MHC II molecules are either occupied by ligands or their binding cleft has been blocked by the acquisition of a non-receptive state. Direct loading with antigens, as required during peptide vaccinations, is therefore hindered.Here we show, that the in vivo response of CD4+ T cells can be improved, when the antigens are administered together with 'MHC-loading enhancer' (MLE). MLE are small catalytic compounds able to open up the MHC binding site by triggering ligand-release and stabilizing the receptive state. Their enhancing effect on the immune response was demonstrated here with an antigen from the influenza virus and tumour associated antigens (TAA) derived from the NY-ESO-1 protein. The application of these antigens in combination with adamantane ethanol (AdEtOH), an MLE compound active on human HLA-DR molecules, significantly increased the frequency of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in mice transgenic for the human MHC II molecule. Notably, the effect was evident only with the MLE-susceptible HLA-DR molecule and not with murine MHC II molecules non-susceptible for the catalytic effect of the MLE.MLE can specifically increase the potency of a vaccine by facilitating the efficient transfer of the antigen onto the MHC molecule. They may therefore open a new way to improve vaccination efficacy and tumour-immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2158568173,"A reanalysis of existing data suggests that the established tenet of increasing efficiency of transport with body size in terrestrial locomotion requires re-evaluation. Here, the statistical model that described the data best indicated a dichotomy between the data for small (<1 kg) and large animals (>1 kg). Within and between these two size groups there was no detectable difference in the scaling exponents (slopes) relating metabolic (E(met)) and mechanical costs (E(mech, CM)) of locomotion to body mass (M(b)). Therefore, no scaling of efficiency (E(mech, CM)/E(met)) with M(b) was evident within each size group. Small animals, however, appeared to be generally less efficient than larger animals (7% and 26% respectively). Consequently, it is possible that the relationship between efficiency and M(b) is not continuous, but, rather, involves a step-change. This step-change in the efficiency of locomotion mirrors previous findings suggesting a postural cause for an apparent size dichotomy in the relationship between E(met) and M(b). Currently data for E(mech, CM) is lacking, but the relationship between efficiency in terrestrial locomotion and M(b) is likely to be determined by posture and kinematics rather than body size alone. Hence, scaling of efficiency is likely to be more complex than a simple linear relationship across body sizes. A homogenous study of the mechanical cost of terrestrial locomotion across a broad range of species, body sizes, and importantly locomotor postures is a priority for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2007571712,"The way in which the information contained in genotypes is translated into complex phenotypic traits (i.e. embryonic expression patterns) depends on its decoding by a multilayered hierarchy of biomolecular systems (regulatory networks). Each layer of this hierarchy displays its own regulatory schemes (i.e. operational rules such as +/− feedback) and associated control parameters, resulting in characteristic variational constraints. This process can be conceptualized as a mapping issue, and in the context of highly-dimensional genotype-phenotype mappings (GPMs) epistatic events have been shown to be ubiquitous, manifested in non-linear correspondences between changes in the genotype and their phenotypic effects. In this study I concentrate on epistatic phenomena pervading levels of biological organization above the genetic material, more specifically the realm of molecular networks. At this level, systems approaches to studying GPMs are specially suitable to shed light on the mechanistic basis of epistatic phenomena. To this aim, I constructed and analyzed ensembles of highly-modular (fully interconnected) networks with distinctive topologies, each displaying dynamic behaviors that were categorized as either arbitrary or functional according to early patterning processes in the Drosophila embryo. Spatio-temporal expression trajectories in virtual syncytial embryos were simulated via reaction-diffusion models. My in silico mutational experiments show that: 1) the average fitness decay tendency to successively accumulated mutations in ensembles of functional networks indicates the prevalence of positive epistasis, whereas in ensembles of arbitrary networks negative epistasis is the dominant tendency; and 2) the evaluation of epistatic coefficients of diverse interaction orders indicates that, both positive and negative epistasis are more prevalent in functional networks than in arbitrary ones. Overall, I conclude that the phenotypic and fitness effects of multiple perturbations are strongly conditioned by both the regulatory architecture (i.e. pattern of coupled feedback structures) and the dynamic nature of the spatio-temporal expression trajectories displayed by the simulated networks."
https://openalex.org/W2049108246,"Genetic structure due to ancestry has been well documented among many divergent human populations. However, the ability to associate ancestry with genetic substructure without using supervised clustering has not been explored in more presumably homogeneous and admixed US populations. The goal of this study was to determine if genetic structure could be detected in a United States population from a single state where the individuals have mixed European ancestry. Using Bayesian clustering with a set of 960 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) we found evidence of population stratification in 864 individuals from New Hampshire that can be used to differentiate the population into six distinct genetic subgroups. We then correlated self-reported ancestry of the individuals with the Bayesian clustering results. Finnish and Russian/Polish/Lithuanian ancestries were most notably found to be associated with genetic substructure. The ancestral results were further explained and substantiated using New Hampshire census data from 1870 to 1930 when the largest waves of European immigrants came to the area. We also discerned distinct patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the genetic groups in the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR). To our knowledge, this is the first time such an investigation has uncovered a strong link between genetic structure and ancestry in what would otherwise be considered a homogenous US population."

Both integrases utilize a novel four-stranded beta-sheet DNA-binding motif, in contrast to the known proteins that bind their DNA targets by means of three-stranded beta-sheets. Moreover, the beta-sheets in Int(HPI) and Int(HAI7) are longer than those in other integrases, and the structured helical N terminus is positioned perpendicularly to the large C-terminal helix. These differences strongly support the proposal that the integrases of the genomic islands make up a distinct evolutionary branch of the site-specific recombinases that utilize a unique DNA-binding mechanism."

Conceived as handy one-page reference guides—cheat sheets—for important topics in cell and molecular biology, SnapShots have encapsulated diverse subjects ranging from silencing by small RNAs to the plant immune response. Building on this success, we are now loosening the tether between SnapShot and the printed page. The result: Enhanced SnapShot. Enhanced SnapShots include features only possible online—animations, embedded captions, and dynamic visuals—all accessible by the click of a mouse. The goal of an Enhanced SnapShot is to provide everything currently available with the print SnapShot plus additional layers of information that are accessible through an easy to navigate webpage. To demonstrate the capabilities of this new format, we have updated and enhanced two of our most popular SnapShots: The TGFβ Pathway Interactome by Ian Taylor and Jeffrey Wrana, and Nuclear Transport by Elizabeth Tran, Timothy Bolger, and Susan Wente. The updated TGFβ interactome lets you dig deeper into the complex TGFβ signaling network, with tailored views and in-depth information for different facets of the pathway. The Enhanced Snapshot on nuclear transport features animations of cargo movement into and out of the nucleus and has helpful links between its table and figure. Just follow the links below to access the two webpages. The Enhanced Snapshots are available in two formats with identical content and functionality: a web page and an interactive pdf file that you can download and view offline. You will need Acrobat Reader 8.0 or later to view the interactive features of the pdf file. In upcoming issues, be on the lookout for the blue Enhanced SnapShot logo letting you know that there is more to discover. Starting with the next issue, we will be publishing a two-part SnapShot by Daniel Wilson and colleagues on Antibiotic Inhibition of Protein Synthesis. The first installment, in our September 18th issue, will present a table of antibiotics and their mechanisms of action. The second enhanced installment, in our October 2nd issue, integrates this information and more within a clickable figure that depicts the steps of protein synthesis. Given that embedding information is central to the concept of Enhanced SnapShots, each one will hold surprises, and we hope that their interactive nature will make them fun and educational to explore. In the larger context of science communication, it is our expectation that Enhanced SnapShots, the first citable Cell format designed principally for the web, will pilot new ways of seamlessly integrating text, figures, and animations in an online environment."
