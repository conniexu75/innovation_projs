https://openalex.org/W2163401084,"Although culture-independent techniques have shown that the lungs are not sterile, little is known about the lung microbiome in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We used pyrosequencing of 16S amplicons to analyze the lung microbiome in two ways: first, using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to sample the distal bronchi and air-spaces; and second, by examining multiple discrete tissue sites in the lungs of six subjects removed at the time of transplantation. We performed BAL on three never-smokers (NS) with normal spirometry, seven smokers with normal spirometry (""healthy smokers"", HS), and four subjects with COPD (CS). Bacterial 16 s sequences were found in all subjects, without significant quantitative differences between groups. Both taxonomy-based and taxonomy-independent approaches disclosed heterogeneity in the bacterial communities between HS subjects that was similar to that seen in healthy NS and two mild COPD patients. The moderate and severe COPD patients had very limited community diversity, which was also noted in 28% of the healthy subjects. Both approaches revealed extensive membership overlap between the bacterial communities of the three study groups. No genera were common within a group but unique across groups. Our data suggests the existence of a core pulmonary bacterial microbiome that includes Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Veillonella, and Porphyromonas. Most strikingly, there were significant micro-anatomic differences in bacterial communities within the same lung of subjects with advanced COPD. These studies are further demonstration of the pulmonary microbiome and highlight global and micro-anatomic changes in these bacterial communities in severe COPD patients."
https://openalex.org/W1997985233,"Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are thought to be among the most abundant microorganisms on Earth and may significantly impact the global nitrogen and carbon cycles. We sequenced the genome of AOA in an enrichment culture from low-salinity sediments in San Francisco Bay using single-cell and metagenomic genome sequence data. Five single cells were isolated inside an integrated microfluidic device using laser tweezers, the cells' genomic DNA was amplified by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in 50 nL volumes and then sequenced by high-throughput DNA pyrosequencing. This microscopy-based approach to single-cell genomics minimizes contamination and allows correlation of high-resolution cell images with genomic sequences. Statistical properties of coverage across the five single cells, in combination with the contrasting properties of the metagenomic dataset allowed the assembly of a high-quality draft genome. The genome of this AOA, which we designate Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum limnia SFB1, is ∼1.77 Mb with >2100 genes and a G+C content of 32%. Across the entire genome, the average nucleotide identity to Nitrosopumilus maritimus, the only AOA in pure culture, is ∼70%, suggesting this AOA represents a new genus of Crenarchaeota. Phylogenetically, the 16S rRNA and ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) genes of this AOA are most closely related to sequences reported from a wide variety of freshwater ecosystems. Like N. maritimus, the low-salinity AOA genome appears to have an ammonia oxidation pathway distinct from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In contrast to other described AOA, these low-salinity AOA appear to be motile, based on the presence of numerous motility- and chemotaxis-associated genes in the genome. This genome data will be used to inform targeted physiological and metabolic studies of this novel group of AOA, which may ultimately advance our understanding of AOA metabolism and their impacts on the global carbon and nitrogen cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1982191152,"Introduction Few studies have performed expression profiling of both miRNA and mRNA from the same primary breast carcinomas. In this study we present and analyze data derived from expression profiling of 799 miRNAs in 101 primary human breast tumors, along with genome-wide mRNA profiles and extensive clinical information. Methods We investigate the relationship between these molecular components, in terms of their correlation with each other and with clinical characteristics. We use a systems biology approach to examine the correlative relationship between miRNA and mRNAs using statistical enrichment methods. Results We identify statistical significant differential expression of miRNAs between molecular intrinsic subtypes, and between samples with different levels of proliferation. Specifically, we point to miRNAs significantly associated with TP53 and ER status. We also show that several cellular processes, such as proliferation, cell adhesion and immune response, are strongly associated with certain miRNAs. We validate the role of miRNAs in regulating proliferation using high-throughput lysate-microarrays on cell lines and point to potential drivers of this process. Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive dataset as well as methods and system-level results that jointly form a basis for further work on understanding the role of miRNA in primary breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1979011193,"IL-23 and Th17 cells are key players in tissue immunosurveillance and are implicated in human immune-mediated diseases. Genome-wide association studies have shown that the IL23R R381Q gene variant protects against psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. We investigated the immunological consequences of the protective IL23R R381Q gene variant in healthy donors. The IL23R R381Q gene variant had no major effect on Th17 cell differentiation as the frequency of circulating Th17 cells was similar in carriers of the IL23R protective (A) and common (G) allele. Accordingly, Th17 cells generated from A and G donors produced similar amounts of Th17 cytokines. However, IL-23-mediated Th17 cell effector function was impaired, as Th17 cells from A allele carriers had significantly reduced IL-23-induced IL-17A production and STAT3 phosphorylation compared to G allele carriers. Our functional analysis of a human disease-associated gene variant demonstrates that IL23R R381Q exerts its protective effects through selective attenuation of IL-23-induced Th17 cell effector function without interfering with Th17 differentiation, and highlights its importance in the protection against IL-23-induced tissue pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2070561881,"We investigated the physiological consequences of one of the most extreme exercises realized by humans in race conditions: a 166-km mountain ultra-marathon (MUM) with 9500 m of positive and negative elevation change. For this purpose, (i) the fatigue induced by the MUM and (ii) the recovery processes over two weeks were assessed. Evaluation of neuromuscular function (NMF) and blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation were performed before and immediately following (n = 22), and 2, 5, 9 and 16 days after the MUM (n = 11) in experienced ultra-marathon runners. Large maximal voluntary contraction decreases occurred after MUM (−35% [95% CI: −28 to −42%] and −39% [95% CI: −32 to −46%] for KE and PF, respectively), with alteration of maximal voluntary activation, mainly for KE (−19% [95% CI: −7 to −32%]). Significant modifications in markers of muscle damage and inflammation were observed after the MUM as suggested by the large changes in creatine kinase (from 144±94 to 13,633±12,626 UI L−1), myoglobin (from 32±22 to 1,432±1,209 µg L−1), and C-Reactive Protein (from <2.0 to 37.7±26.5 mg L−1). Moderate to large reductions in maximal compound muscle action potential amplitude, high-frequency doublet force, and low frequency fatigue (index of excitation-contraction coupling alteration) were also observed for both muscle groups. Sixteen days after MUM, NMF had returned to initial values, with most of the recovery process occurring within 9 days of the race. These findings suggest that the large alterations in NMF after an ultra-marathon race are multi-factorial, including failure of excitation-contraction coupling, which has never been described after prolonged running. It is also concluded that as early as two weeks after such an extreme running exercise, maximal force capacities have returned to baseline."
https://openalex.org/W2093143288,"One of the most degraded states of the Mediterranean rocky infralittoral ecosystem is a barren composed solely of bare rock and patches of crustose coralline algae. Barrens are typically created by the grazing action of large sea urchin populations. In 2008 we observed extensive areas almost devoid of erect algae, where sea urchins were rare, on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. To determine the origin of those urchin-less ‘barrens’, we conducted a fish exclusion experiment. We found that, in the absence of fish grazing, a well-developed algal assemblage grew within three months. Underwater fish censuses and observations suggest that two alien herbivorous fish from the Red Sea (Siganus luridus and S. rivulatus) are responsible for the creation and maintenance of these benthic communities with extremely low biomass. The shift from well-developed native algal assemblages to ‘barrens’ implies a dramatic decline in biogenic habitat complexity, biodiversity and biomass. A targeted Siganus fishery could help restore the macroalgal beds of the rocky infralittoral on the Turkish coast."
https://openalex.org/W2002465714,"No animal models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with good construct validity are currently available; using genetic models of pathologies characterized by ASD-like deficits, but with known causes, may be therefore a promising strategy. The Fmr1-KO mouse is an example of this approach, modeling Fragile X syndrome, a well-known genetic disorder presenting ASD symptoms. The Fmr1-KO is available on different genetic backgrounds (FVB versus C57BL/6), which may explain some of the conflicting results that have been obtained with these mutants up till now.Fmr1 KO and their wild-type littermates on both the FVB and C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds were examined on a battery of tests modeling the clinical symptoms of ASD, including the triad of core symptoms (alterations in social interaction and communication, presence of repetitive behaviors), as well as the secondary symptoms (disturbances in sensori-motor reactivity and in circadian patterns of activity, epileptic events).Fmr1-KO mice displayed autistic-like core symptoms of altered social interaction and occurrence of repetitive behaviors with additional hyperactivity. The genetic background modulated the effects of the Fmr1 deletion and it appears that the C57BL/6 background may be more suitable for further research on core autistic-like symptoms.The Fmr1-mouse line does not recapitulate all of the main core and secondary ASD symptoms, but still can be useful to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying specific ASD-like endophenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2030048275,"Two hundred and fifty bread wheat lines, mainly Chinese mini core accessions, were assayed for polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium (LD) based on 512 whole-genome microsatellite loci representing a mean marker density of 5.1 cM. A total of 6,724 alleles ranging from 1 to 49 per locus were identified in all collections. The mean PIC value was 0.650, ranging from 0 to 0.965. Population structure and principal coordinate analysis revealed that landraces and modern varieties were two relatively independent genetic sub-groups. Landraces had a higher allelic diversity than modern varieties with respect to both genomes and chromosomes in terms of total number of alleles and allelic richness. 3,833 (57.0%) and 2,788 (41.5%) rare alleles with frequencies of <5% were found in the landrace and modern variety gene pools, respectively, indicating greater numbers of rare variants, or likely new alleles, in landraces. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that A genome had the largest genetic differentiation and D genome the lowest. In contrast to genetic diversity, modern varieties displayed a wider average LD decay across the whole genome for locus pairs with r2>0.05 (P<0.001) than the landraces. Mean LD decay distance for the landraces at the whole genome level was <5 cM, while a higher LD decay distance of 5–10 cM in modern varieties. LD decay distances were also somewhat different for each of the 21 chromosomes, being higher for most of the chromosomes in modern varieties (<5∼25 cM) compared to landraces (<5∼15 cM), presumably indicating the influences of domestication and breeding. This study facilitates predicting the marker density required to effectively associate genotypes with traits in Chinese wheat genetic resources."
https://openalex.org/W2050107524,"Background Spermatogonia are highly tolerant to reactive oxygen species (ROS) attack while advanced-stage germ cells such as spermatozoa are much more susceptible, but the precise reason for this variation in ROS tolerance remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the Japanese eel testicular culture system that enables a complete spermatogenesis in vitro, we report that advanced-stage germ cells undergo intense apoptosis and exhibit strong signal for 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, an oxidative DNA damage marker, upon exposure to hypoxanthine-generated ROS while spermatogonia remain unaltered. Activity assay of antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Western blot analysis using an anti-Copper/Zinc (Cu/Zn) SOD antibody showed a high SOD activity and Cu/Zn SOD protein concentration during early spermatogenesis. Immunohistochemistry showed a strong expression for Cu/Zn SOD in spermatogonia but weak expression in advanced-stage germ cells. Zn deficiency reduced activity of the recombinant eel Cu/Zn SOD protein. Cu/Zn SOD siRNA decreased Cu/Zn SOD expression in spermatogonia and led to increased oxidative damage. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that the presence of high levels of Cu/Zn SOD and Zn render spermatogonia resistant to ROS, and consequently protected from oxidative stress. These findings provide the biochemical basis for the high tolerance of spermatogonia to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2075570572,"Peptidoglycan is an essential and specific component of the bacterial cell wall and therefore is an ideal recognition signature for the immune system. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are conserved from insects to mammals and able to bind PGN (non-catalytic PGRPs) and, in some cases, to efficiently degrade it (catalytic PGRPs). In Drosophila, several non-catalytic PGRPs function as selective peptidoglycan receptors upstream of the Toll and Imd pathways, the two major signalling cascades regulating the systemic production of antimicrobial peptides. Recognition PGRPs specifically activate the Toll pathway in response to Lys-type peptidoglycan found in most Gram-positive bacteria and the Imd pathway in response to DAP-type peptidoglycan encountered in Gram-positive bacilli-type bacteria and in Gram-negative bacteria. Catalytic PGRPs on the other hand can potentially reduce the level of immune activation by scavenging peptidoglycan. In accordance with this, PGRP-LB and PGRP-SC1A/B/2 have been shown to act as negative regulators of the Imd pathway. In this study, we report a biochemical and genetic analysis of PGRP-SB1, a catalytic PGRP. Our data show that PGRP-SB1 is abundantly secreted into the hemolymph following Imd pathway activation in the fat body, and exhibits an enzymatic activity towards DAP-type polymeric peptidoglycan. We have generated a PGRP-SB1/2 null mutant by homologous recombination, but its thorough phenotypic analysis did not reveal any immune function, suggesting a subtle role or redundancy of PGRP-SB1/2 with other molecules. Possible immune functions of PGRP-SB1 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2164805748,"Growth anomalies (GAs) are common, tumor-like diseases that can cause significant morbidity and decreased fecundity in the major Indo-Pacific reef-building coral genera, Acropora and Porites. GAs are unusually tractable for testing hypotheses about drivers of coral disease because of their pan-Pacific distributions, relatively high occurrence, and unambiguous ease of identification. We modeled multiple disease-environment associations that may underlie the prevalence of Acropora growth anomalies (AGA) (n = 304 surveys) and Porites growth anomalies (PGA) (n = 602 surveys) from across the Indo-Pacific. Nine predictor variables were modeled, including coral host abundance, human population size, and sea surface temperature and ultra-violet radiation anomalies. Prevalence of both AGAs and PGAs were strongly host density-dependent. PGAs additionally showed strong positive associations with human population size. Although this association has been widely posited, this is one of the first broad-scale studies unambiguously linking a coral disease with human population size. These results emphasize that individual coral diseases can show relatively distinct patterns of association with environmental predictors, even in similar diseases (growth anomalies) found on different host genera (Acropora vs. Porites). As human densities and environmental degradation increase globally, the prevalence of coral diseases like PGAs could increase accordingly, halted only perhaps by declines in host density below thresholds required for disease establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2109224231,"A pivotal step in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is activation of Bak and Bax, although the molecular mechanism remains controversial. To examine whether mitochondrial apoptosis can be induced by just a lack of antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins or requires direct activators of the BH3-only proteins including Bid and Bim, we studied the molecular requisites for platelet apoptosis induced by Bcl-xL deficiency. Severe thrombocytopenia induced by thrombocyte-specific Bcl-xL knock-out was fully rescued in a Bak and Bax double knock-out background but not with single knock-out of either one. In sharp contrast, deficiency of either Bid, Bim, or both did not alleviate thrombocytopenia in Bcl-xL knock-out mice. An in vitro study revealed that ABT-737, a Bad mimetic, induced platelet apoptosis in association with a conformational change of the amino terminus, translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria, and homo-oligomerization of Bax. ABT-737-induced Bax activation and apoptosis were also observed in Bid/Bim-deficient platelets. Human platelets, upon storage, underwent spontaneous apoptosis with a gradual decline of Bcl-xL expression despite a decrease in Bid and Bim expression. Apoptosis was attenuated in Bak/Bax-deficient or Bcl-xL-overexpressing platelets but not in Bid/Bim-deficient platelets upon storage. In conclusion, platelet lifespan is regulated by a fine balance between anti- and proapoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins. Despite residing in platelets, BH3-only activator proteins Bid and Bim are dispensable for Bax activation and mitochondrial apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2039015646,"Tight-junction (TJ) protein degradation is a decisive step in hypoxic blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in stroke. In this study we elucidated the impact of acute cerebral ischemia on TJ protein arrangement and the role of the apoptotic effector protease caspase-3 in this context.We used an in vitro model of the neurovascular unit and the guinea pig whole brain preparation to analyze with immunohistochemical methods the BBB properties and neurovascular integrity. In both methodological approaches we observed rapid TJ protein disruptions after 30 min of oxygen and glucose deprivation or middle cerebral artery occlusion, which were accompanied by strong caspase-3 activation in brain endothelial cells (BEC). Surprisingly only few DNA-fragmentations were detected with TUNEL stainings in BEC. Z-DEVD-fmk, an irreversible caspase-3 inhibitor, partly blocked TJ disruptions and was protective on trans-endothelial electrical resistance.Our data provide evidence that caspase-3 is rapidly activated during acute cerebral ischemia predominantly without triggering DNA-fragmentation in BEC. Further we detected fast TJ protein disruptions which could be partly blocked by caspase-3 inhibition with Z-DEVD-fmk. We suggest that the basis for clinically relevant BBB breakdown in form of TJ disruptions is initiated within minutes during ischemia and that caspase-3 contributes to this process."
https://openalex.org/W2095237751,"Maternal prenatal undernutrition predisposes offspring to higher adiposity in adulthood. Mechanisms involved in these programming effects, apart from those described in central nervous system development, have not been established. Here we aimed to evaluate whether moderate caloric restriction during early pregnancy in rats affects white adipose tissue (WAT) sympathetic innervation in the offspring, and its relationship with adiposity development. For this purpose, inguinal and retroperitoneal WAT (iWAT and rpWAT, respectively) were analyzed in male and female offspring of control and 20% caloric-restricted (from 1-12 d of pregnancy) (CR) dams. Body weight (BW), the weight, DNA-content, morphological features and the immunoreactive tyrosine hydroxylase and Neuropeptide Y area (TH+ and NPY+ respectively, performed by immunohistochemistry) of both fat depots, were studied at 25 d and 6 m of age, the latter after 2 m exposure to high fat diet. At 6 m of life, CR males but not females, exhibited greater BW, and greater weight and total DNA-content in iWAT, without changes in adipocytes size, suggesting the development of hyperplasia in this depot. However, in rpWAT, CR males but not females, showed larger adipocyte diameter, with no changes in DNA-content, suggesting the development of hypertrophy. These parameters were not different between control and CR animals at the age of 25 d. In iWAT, both at 25 d and 6 m, CR males but not females, showed lower TH(+) and NPY(+), suggesting lower sympathetic innervation in CR males compared to control males. In rpWAT, at 6 m but not at 25 d, CR males but not females, showed lower TH(+) and NPY(+). Thus, the effects of caloric restriction during gestation on later adiposity and on the differences in the adult phenotype between internal and subcutaneous fat depots in the male offspring may be associated in part with specific alterations in sympathetic innervation, which may impact on WAT architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2157229282,"Drugs inhibiting the influenza A virus (IAV) neuraminidase (NA) are the cornerstone of anti-IAV chemotherapy and prophylaxis in man. Drug-resistant mutations in NA arise frequently in human isolates, limiting the therapeutic application of NA inhibitors. Here, we show that antibody-driven antigenic variation in one domain of the H1 hemagglutinin Sa site leads to compensatory mutations in NA, resulting in NA antigenic variation and acquisition of drug resistance. These findings indicate that influenza A virus resistance to NA inhibitors can potentially arise from antibody driven HA escape, confounding analysis of influenza NA evolution in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2060432861,"Plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, are raised in patients with chronic vascular disease, causing increased cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction, but the role of ADMA in acute inflammatory states is less well defined.In a prospective longitudinal study in 67 patients with acute sepsis and 31 controls, digital microvascular reactivity was measured by peripheral arterial tonometry and blood was collected at baseline and 2-4 days later. Plasma ADMA and L-arginine concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Baseline plasma L-arginine: ADMA ratio was significantly lower in sepsis patients (median [IQR] 63 [45-103]) than in hospital controls (143 [123-166], p<0.0001) and correlated with microvascular reactivity (r = 0.34, R(2) = 0.12, p = 0.02). Baseline plasma ADMA was independently associated with 28-day mortality (Odds ratio [95% CI] for death in those in the highest quartile (≥ 0.66 µmol/L) = 20.8 [2.2-195.0], p = 0.008), and was independently correlated with severity of organ failure. Increase in ADMA over time correlated with increase in organ failure and decrease in microvascular reactivity.Impaired endothelial and microvascular function due to decreased endothelial NO bioavailability is a potential mechanism linking increased plasma ADMA with organ failure and death in sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2064506377,"Psoriasis is a characteristic inflammatory and scaly skin condition with typical histopathological features including increased proliferation and hampered differentiation of keratinocytes. The activation of innate and adaptive inflammatory cellular immune responses is considered to be the main trigger factor of the epidermal changes in psoriatic skin. However, the molecular players that are involved in enhanced proliferation and impaired differentiation of psoriatic keratinocytes are only partly understood. One important factor that regulates differentiation on the cellular level is Ca2+. In normal epidermis, a Ca2+ gradient exists that is disturbed in psoriatic plaques, favoring impaired keratinocyte proliferation. Several TRPC channels such as TRPC1, TRPC4, or TRPC6 are key proteins in the regulation of high [Ca2+]ex induced differentiation. Here, we investigated if TRPC channel function is impaired in psoriasis using calcium imaging, RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsies. We demonstrated substantial defects in Ca2+ influx in psoriatic keratinocytes in response to high extracellular Ca2+ levels, associated with a downregulation of all TRPC channels investigated, including TRPC6 channels. As TRPC6 channel activation can partially overcome this Ca2+ entry defect, specific TRPC channel activators may be potential new drug candidates for the topical treatment of psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W1969939561,"Vertical depth migrations into shallower waters at night by the chambered cephalopod Nautilus were first hypothesized early in the early 20(th) Century. Subsequent studies have supported the hypothesis that Nautilus spend daytime hours at depth and only ascend to around 200 m at night. Here we challenge this idea of a universal Nautilus behavior. Ultrasonic telemetry techniques were employed to track eleven specimens of Nautilus pompilius for variable times ranging from one to 78 days at Osprey Reef, Coral Sea, Australia. To supplement these observations, six remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives were conducted at the same location to provide 29 hours of observations from 100 to 800 meter depths which sighted an additional 48 individuals, including five juveniles, all deeper than 489 m. The resulting data suggest virtually continuous, nightly movement between depths of 130 to 700 m, with daytime behavior split between either virtual stasis in the relatively shallow 160-225 m depths or active foraging in depths between 489 to 700 m. The findings also extend the known habitable depth range of Nautilus to 700 m, demonstrate juvenile distribution within the same habitat as adults and document daytime feeding behavior. These data support a hypothesis that, contrary to previously observed diurnal patterns of shallower at night than day, more complex vertical movement patterns may exist in at least this, and perhaps all other Nautilus populations. These are most likely dictated by optimal feeding substrate, avoidance of daytime visual predators, requirements for resting periods at 200 m to regain neutral buoyancy, upper temperature limits of around 25°C and implosion depths of 800 m. The slope, terrain and biological community of the various geographically separated Nautilus populations may provide different permutations and combinations of the above factors resulting in preferred vertical movement strategies most suited for each population."
https://openalex.org/W1975633768,"Background Coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) have evolved strategies to disable the innate immune system for productive replication and spread of infection. We have previously shown that papain-like protease domain 2 (PLP2), a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of MHV-A59, encodes a deubiquitinase (DUB) and inactivates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) thereby the type I interferon (IFN) response. Principal Findings Here we provide further evidence that PLP2 may also target TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), the upstream kinase of IRF3 in the IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression experiments showed that PLP2 deubiquitinated TBK1 and reduced its kinase activity, hence inhibited IFN-β reporter activity. Albeit promiscuous in deubiquitinating cellular proteins, PLP2 inactivated TBK1 and IFN-β response in TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) deficient cells, suggesting that targeting TBK1 would be sufficient for PLP2 to inhibit IRF3 activation. This notion was further supported by in vitro kinase assays, in which prior treatment of TBK1 with PLP2 inhibited its kinase activity to phosphorylate IRF3. Intriguing enough, results of PLP2 overexpression system and MHV-A59 infection system proved that PLP2 formed an inactive complex with TBK1 and IRF3 in the cytoplasm and the presence of PLP2 stabilized the hypo-phosphorylated IRF3-TBK1 complex in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions These results suggest that PLP2 not only inactivates TBK1, but also prevents IRF3 nuclear translocation hence inhibits IFN transcription activation. Identification of the conserved DUB activity of PLP2 in suppression of IFN signaling would provide a useful clue to the development of therapeutics against coronaviruses infection."
https://openalex.org/W1987607197,"Telomere dynamics are intensively studied in human ageing research and epidemiology, with many correlations reported between telomere length and age-related diseases, cancer and death. While telomere length is influenced by environmental factors there is also good evidence for a strong heritable component. In human, the mode of telomere length inheritance appears to be paternal and telomere length differs between sexes, with females having longer telomeres than males. Genetic factors, e.g. sex chromosomal inactivation, and non-genetic factors, e.g. antioxidant properties of oestrogen, have been suggested as possible explanations for these sex-specific telomere inheritance and telomere length differences. To test the influence of sex chromosomes on telomere length, we investigated inheritance and sex-specificity of telomere length in a bird species, the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), in which females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males are the homogametic (ZZ) sex. We found that, contrary to findings in humans, telomere length was maternally inherited and also longer in males. These results argue against an effect of sex hormones on telomere length and suggest that factors associated with heterogamy may play a role in telomere inheritance and sex-specific differences in telomere length."
https://openalex.org/W1998657923,"The HIV-1 epidemic in West Africa has been dominated by subtype A and the recombinant form CRF02_AG. Little is known about the origins and the evolutionary history of HIV-1 in this region. We employed Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods in combination with temporal and spatial information to reconstruct the HIV-1 subtype distribution, demographic history and migration patterns over time in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. We found that CRF02_AG and subsubtype A3 were the dominant forms of HIV-1 in Guinea-Bissau and that they were introduced into the country on at least six different occasions between 1976 and 1981. These estimates also corresponded well with the first reported HIV-1 cases in Guinea-Bissau. Migration analyses suggested that (1) the HIV-1 epidemic started in the capital Bissau and then dispersed into more rural areas, and (2) the epidemic in Guinea-Bissau was connected to both Cameroon and Mali. This is the first study that describes the HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a West African country by combining the results of subtype distribution with analyses of epidemic origin and epidemiological linkage between locations. The multiple introductions of HIV-1 into Guinea-Bissau, during a short time-period of five years, coincided with and were likely influenced by the major immigration wave into the country that followed the end of the independence war (1963-1974)."
https://openalex.org/W2094891646,"Clinical trials revealed beneficial effects of the broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor aprotinin on the prevention of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The underlying mechanisms remained largely unclear. Using in vivo microscopy on the cremaster muscle of male C57BL/6 mice, aprotinin as well as inhibitors of the serine protease plasmin including tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid were found to significantly diminish I/R-elicited intravascular firm adherence and (subsequent) transmigration of neutrophils. Remodeling of collagen IV within the postischemic perivenular basement membrane was almost completely abrogated in animals treated with plasmin inhibitors or aprotinin. In separate experiments, incubation with plasmin did not directly activate neutrophils. Extravascular, but not intravascular administration of plasmin caused a dose-dependent increase in numbers of firmly adherent and transmigrated neutrophils. Blockade of mast cell activation as well as inhibition of leukotriene synthesis or antagonism of the platelet-activating-factor receptor significantly reduced plasmin-dependent neutrophil responses. In conclusion, our data suggest that extravasated plasmin(ogen) mediates neutrophil recruitment in vivo via activation of perivascular mast cells and secondary generation of lipid mediators. Aprotinin as well as the plasmin inhibitors tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid interfere with this inflammatory cascade and effectively prevent postischemic neutrophil responses as well as remodeling events within the vessel wall."
https://openalex.org/W2007650487,"Explaining or predicting the behaviour of our conspecifics requires the ability to infer the intentions that motivate it. Such inferences are assumed to rely on two types of information: (1) the sensory information conveyed by movement kinematics and (2) the observer's prior expectations – acquired from past experience or derived from prior knowledge. However, the respective contribution of these two sources of information is still controversial. This controversy stems in part from the fact that “intention” is an umbrella term that may embrace various sub-types each being assigned different scopes and targets. We hypothesized that variations in the scope and target of intentions may account for variations in the contribution of visual kinematics and prior knowledge to the intention inference process. To test this hypothesis, we conducted four behavioural experiments in which participants were instructed to identify different types of intention: basic intentions (i.e. simple goal of a motor act), superordinate intentions (i.e. general goal of a sequence of motor acts), or social intentions (i.e. intentions accomplished in a context of reciprocal interaction). For each of the above-mentioned intentions, we varied (1) the amount of visual information available from the action scene and (2) participant's prior expectations concerning the intention that was more likely to be accomplished. First, we showed that intentional judgments depend on a consistent interaction between visual information and participant's prior expectations. Moreover, we demonstrated that this interaction varied according to the type of intention to be inferred, with participant's priors rather than perceptual evidence exerting a greater effect on the inference of social and superordinate intentions. The results are discussed by appealing to the specific properties of each type of intention considered and further interpreted in the light of a hierarchical model of action representation."

The crystal structure shows three substrate oxidation site candidates involving His-170, Asp-146, and Tyr-181. Steady-state kinetics for oxidation of veratryl alcohol (the typical LiP substrate) by variants at the above three residues reveals a crucial role of Tyr-181 in LiP activity. Moreover, assays with ferrocytochrome c show that its ability to oxidize large molecules (a requisite property for oxidation of the lignin polymer) originates in Tyr-181. This residue is also involved in the oxidation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, a reaction initiated by the one-electron abstraction with formation of substrate cation radical, as described for the well known Phanerochaete chrysosporium LiP. Detailed spectroscopic and kinetic investigations, including low temperature EPR, show that the porphyrin radical in the two-electron activated T. cervina LiP is unstable and rapidly receives one electron from Tyr-181, forming a catalytic protein radical, which is identified as an H-bonded neutral tyrosyl radical. The crystal structure reveals a partially exposed location of Tyr-181, compatible with its catalytic role, and several neighbor residues probably contributing to catalysis: (i) by enabling substrate recognition by aromatic interactions; (ii) by acting as proton acceptor/donor from Tyr-181 or H-bonding the radical form; and (iii) by providing the acidic environment that would facilitate oxidation. This is the first structure-function study of the only ligninolytic peroxidase described to date that has a catalytic tyrosine.

This is the first structure-function study of the only ligninolytic peroxidase described to date that has a catalytic tyrosine. Lignin is one of the most abundant and recalcitrant natural polymers, in which various nonphenolic phenylpropanoid units form a complex three-dimensional network (1Brunow G. Lundquist K. Heitner C. Dimmel D. Schmidt J. Lignin and Lignans: Advances in Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton2010: 267-299Google Scholar). Therefore, lignin degradation is a key step for carbon recycling in forest ecosystems and a central issue in lignocellulose-based industries (e.g. in paper pulp manufacture and production of bioethanol and other renewable chemicals) (2Martínez A.T. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Del Río J.C. Gutiérrez A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In nature, extracellular heme peroxidases from fungi of the basidiomycetes group are responsible for the one-electron oxidation of lignin units that initiates the biodegradation process, being of interest as industrial biocatalysts (3Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar, 4Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez A.T. Microb. Biotechnol. 2009; 2: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Ligninolytic peroxidases are included into class II of the plant, fungal, and bacterial peroxidase superfamily (5Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez A.T. Torres E. Ayala M. Biocatalysts Based on Heme Peroxidases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2010: 37-59Google Scholar). They comprise lignin peroxidases (LiP; 4The abbreviations used are: LiPlignin peroxidaseLiP*recombinant LiPMnPmanganese peroxidaseVPversatile peroxidaseABTS2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonate)Cc3+ferricytochrome cCc2+ferrocytochrome c1,4-DMB1,4-dimethoxybenzeneMPD2-methyl-2,4-pentanediolVAveratryl alcoholmTmilliteslas. EC 1.11.1.14); manganese peroxidases (MnP; EC 1.11.1.13), which were first described in Phanerochaete chrysosporium; and versatile peroxidases (VP; EC 1.11.1.16), described later in Pleurotus and Bjerkandera species (6Hammel K.E. Cullen D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7Martínez A.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 425-444Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). LiP exhibits the high redox potential and ability to oxidize large molecules required for direct oxidation of the lignin polymer and other nonphenolic aromatic substrates. The latter includes veratryl (3,4-dimethoxybenzyl) alcohol (VA), the LiP physiological substrate with a mediating role in lignin biodegradation (8Khindaria A. Yamazaki I. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6418-6424Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MnP specifically oxidizes Mn2+ to Mn3+, which acts as a diffusible mediator for oxidation of phenolic substrates (9Gold M.H. Youngs H.L. Gelpke M.D. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2000; 37: 559-586PubMed Google Scholar) and as a starter of lipid peroxidation reactions generating strong oxidizers (10Kapich A.N. Korneichik T.V. Hatakka A. Hammel K.E. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2010; 46: 136-140Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, VP is a hybrid enzyme with the catalytic properties of LiP, MnP, and phenol-oxidizing fungal peroxidases, such as Coprinopsis cinerea peroxidase (11Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Morales M. García E.

The overall catalytic cycle of ligninolytic peroxidases is similar to that of classical peroxidases, such as horseradish peroxidase (12Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley & Sons, New York1999: 281-308Google Scholar). Resting enzyme (with ferric heme) is two-electron-oxidized by H2O2 and converted into Compound I (with oxo-ferryl, Fe4+=O, heme containing a porphyrin π-cation radical). The activated enzyme sequentially performs one-electron oxidations of two substrate molecules, coming back to the resting state via Compound II (the one-electron-oxidized intermediate with Fe4+=O heme). Mn2+ oxidation by MnP and VP is produced by direct electron transfer to the peroxide-activated heme (13Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17574-17580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Morales M. Pérez-Boada M. Choinowski T. Martínez M.J. Piontek K. Martínez A.T.

Biol. 1998; 2: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, oxidation of high redox potential substrates (including lignin models) by LiP and VP occurs at a catalytic tryptophan exposed on the protein surface (e.g. Trp-171 of P. chrysosporium LiP and Trp-164 of Pleurotus eryngii VP) via long-range electron transfer to heme (16Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Pérez-Boada M. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Pogni R. Basosi R. Choinowski T.

Spin-trapping and more recently electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have demonstrated that the peroxide-activated forms (Compounds I and II) of the above peroxidases contain a radical at the catalytic tryptophan (19Blodig W. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Piontek K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Pogni R. Baratto M.C. Teutloff C. Giansanti S. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J.

Ivancich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16084-16089Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, different LiP and VP cDNA sequences (up to more than 30 sequences available) have shown that the catalytic tryptophan is conserved in all of them (5Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez A.T. Torres E. Ayala M. Biocatalysts Based on Heme Peroxidases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2010: 37-59Google Scholar, 6Hammel K.E. Cullen D. Curr. Opin.

Therefore, this residue is considered to be essential for the LiP-type activities exhibited by both LiP and VP enzymes. A new type of LiP was recently found in the white rot basidiomycete Trametes cervina (22Miki Y. Tanaka H. Nakamura M. Wariishi H. J. Fac. Agr. Kyushu Univ. 2006; 51: 99-104Google Scholar). This LiP exhibits oxidative activities toward high redox potential substrates such as VA and 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (1,4-DMB) (1.3–1.4 V), and large molecules such as ferrocytochrome c (Cc2+), as reported previously for P. chrysosporium LiP (23Kersten P.J. Kalyanaraman B. Hammel K.E. Reinhammar B. Kirk T.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 24Wariishi H. Sheng D. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5545-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, its first molecular characterization showed that T. cervina LiP lacks the conserved catalytic tryptophan and contains one tyrosine residue (Tyr-181) at a position where tyrosine residues were never found in other LiP and VP sequences (25Miki Y. Ichinose H. Wariishi H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2010; 304: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Homology molecular modeling showed that this tyrosine is located near the heme and accessible to the solvent (25Miki Y. Ichinose H. Wariishi H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2010; 304: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that it could represent an alternative substrate oxidation site, in agreement with previous chemical modification results (26Miki Y. Ichinose H. Wariishi H. Biotechnol. Lett. 2011; (March 4, 10.1007/s10529-011-0571-2)PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies on T. cervina LiP catalysis, including Tyr-181 role, are of high interest, but they could not be produced so far because of the low enzyme levels obtained from T. cervina cultures. Recently, Escherichia coli production of recombinant T. cervina LiP (LiP*), followed by in vitro activation, was optimized (27Miki Y. Morales M. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Wariishi H. Martínez A.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), enabling site-directed mutagenesis and other studies. In the present work, the crystal structure of native (wild-type) LiP* was determined at high resolution, and several site-directed variants at three substrate oxidation site candidates exposed to the solvent were investigated by spectroscopic and kinetic techniques. Low temperature EPR of the peroxide-activated T. cervina LiP* successfully detected a protein radical at Tyr-181. These results provide the first structure-function information on the only ligninolytic peroxidase described to date that has a catalytic tyrosine. The previously constructed pET-mlip expression vector (27Miki Y. Morales M. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Wariishi H. Martínez A.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which contains the cDNA of mature T. cervina LiP (GenBankTM entry AB191466) in pET23 (Merck), was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: 5′-CCTCGTTCCCGGCCCGACTGACT-3′ for D146G; 5′-CTCCCACTGAGGTCGTTTCGCTGCTCGCTTCCCACAG-3′ for H170S; and 5′-CACAGTATTGCTGCTCAAAACGAAGTGGACACGGACGTC-3′ for Y181N (only direct primers are shown, with the mutated codons in bold and the mutated bases underlined). The PCR reactions (20 μl) contained 10 ng of pET-mlip, 50 ng of each (forward and reverse) primer, 50 μm of each dNTP, and 1 unit of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in 1× PCR reaction buffer. The reactions were as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min in 16 cycles, with a final 10-min extension at 68 °C. The expression vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Merck). Recombinant proteins were produced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, recovered from inclusion bodies, in vitro-refolded, and purified in a single anion-exchange chromatography step, as described previously (27Miki Y. Morales M. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Wariishi H. Martínez A.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The concentrations of native LiP* and its mutated variants were calculated spectrophotometrically (ϵ407 147 mm−1 · cm−1). Absorbance changes during oxidation of VA and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1600 spectrophotometer. VA oxidation rates were estimated from maximal veratraldehyde (ϵ310 9.3 mm−1 · cm−1) formation during 5 s in 20 mm sodium succinate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 50 nm enzyme and 0.1 mm H2O2. ABTS oxidation rates were estimated from maximal ABTS cation radical (ϵ420 36 mm−1 · cm−1) formation during 5 s in 20 mm succinate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 5 nm enzyme and 0.1 mm H2O2. The apparent affinity constant (Michaelis-Menten constant, Km) and maximal enzyme turnover (kcat) for oxidation of VA and ABTS were obtained by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the experimental values (reaction rates v and substrate concentrations [S]) to the Michaelis-Menten equation. v=(kcat/Km)[S]/(1+[S]/Km)(Eq. 1) Spectral changes during oxidation of 1,4-DMB and Cc2+ were recorded with an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer, showing 1,4-benzoquinone and ferricytochrome c (Cc3+) formation, respectively (27Miki Y. Morales M. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Martínez M.J. Wariishi H. Martínez A.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 1,4-Benzoquinone concentration was followed at 245 nm in 20 mm sodium succinate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 0.2 mm 1,4-DMB, 100 nm enzyme, and 0.1 mm H2O2. Cc2+ concentration was followed at 550 nm in 20 mm sodium succinate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 15 μm Cc2+ (prepared by reducing Cc3+ with sodium dithionite and excess dithionite removal with Sephadex G-25 prior to use), 0.1 μm enzyme, and 0.1 mm H2O2. All reactions were carried out at 25 °C and initiated by the addition of H2O2. Spectroscopic and kinetic studies of Compound I formation and decay were performed with an SFM 300 stopped-flow device (Bio-Logic) equipped with a MOS-DA rapid-scanning diode array detector (J&M). Five equivalents of H2O2 were used to ensure pseudo first-order kinetics. Typically, one syringe contained 2 μm enzyme in 10 mm sodium succinate buffer (pH 4.5), the other contained 10 μm H2O2 in 50 mm sodium succinate buffer (pH 3.5), and equal volumes were mixed. Apparent second-order rate constants of Compound I formation (k1app) were determined from the slope of the plots of H2O2 concentration versus kobs1, calculated from traces at 399 nm (Compound I and II isosbestic point). First-order rate constants of Compound I decay (kobs-1) were calculated from the absorbance changes at 416 nm (Compound II and resting state isosbestic point). Solutions of native T. cervina LiP* and its Y181N variant (0.2 mm) were prepared in 20 mm sodium succinate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 n NaCl. Eight or nineteen equivalents of H2O2 were added to the EPR tubes containing the native LiP* and Y181N solutions, respectively, that were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. CW-X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR measurements were carried out with a Bruker E500 Elexsys series using the Bruker ER 4122 SHQE cavity and an Oxford helium continuous flow cryostat (ESR900). Spin quantitation was performed by double integration of the experimental EPR radical signal compared with the iron signal. EPR simulations were performed using the X-Sophe package (Bruker). Crystals of native T. cervina LiP* were obtained with the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The protein solution (10 mg/ml, in 20 mm sodium succinate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2) was mixed (1:1) with a solution containing 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 0.1 m imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Crystals appeared after 7 days at 22 °C and were frozen in the crystallization medium containing 15% polyethylene glycol 400. A complete data set was collected at the beamline ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Data were processed using XDS (28Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar) and merged and scaled with SCALA, from the CCP4 package (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (30Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) using the P. eryngii VP structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3FM4) as a search probe. Consecutive cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding were done using REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Native T. cervina LiP* was successfully crystallized, the crystals containing one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined against data to 1.85 Å. The LiP* refined structure consists of 337 residues (from residue 1 to 337, of a total of 338) and contains one heme molecule and two Ca2+ ions (as well as one molecule of MPD and two more ions from the crystallization medium, all of them located at the protein surface) (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal amino acid (Gly-338) and the aromatic ring of Phe-89 were not solved because they are highly disordered in the crystal. The overall structure is mostly helical (Fig. 1A), including 11 α-helices and one short antiparallel β-sheet. Four disulfide bridges (Cys-3/Cys-15, Cys-14/Cys-283, Cys-34/Cys-120, and Cys-247/Cys-314) were also identified. The overall folding of T. cervina LiP* is largely superimposable with those of other ligninolytic peroxidases such as P. chrysosporium LiP and MnP and P. eryngii VP (Fig. 1B). The heme cofactor is entirely buried in the protein but accessible to the solvent via two channels (Fig. 1C). Its iron ion is coordinated at the lower side of the heme by Nϵ2 of one of two axial histidines (proximal histidine) with a bond length of 2.11 Å (Fig. 1D). The sixth coordination site of the iron (at the upper side of the heme) is occupied by a water molecule (Wat-61) with a bond length of 2.55 Å, which is hydrogen-bonded (2.65 Å) to Nϵ2 of the second axial histidine (distal histidine). In addition to the proximal (His-175) and distal (His-47) histidines, other residues conserved in the T. cervina LiP* heme pocket are Arg-43 and Phe-46 at the upper (distal) side and Asp-236, hydrogen-bonded (2.84 Å) to Nδ1 of the proximal histidine, at the lower (proximal) side (Fig. 1D). The distal and proximal side Ca2+ ions in the T. cervina LiP* structure are, respectively, hepta-coordinated with Asp-48, Gly-66, Asp-68, Ser-70, and two water molecules (Fig. 1E) and octa-coordinated with Ser-176, Asp-193, Thr-195, Val-198, and Asp-200 (Fig. 1F). According to the substrate oxidation sites and electron transfer pathways described in other ligninolytic peroxidases, including P. chrysosporium LiP and MnP and P. eryngii VP (13Sundaramoorthy M.

Site-II would be at the δ-carbon of the heme (i.e. that between rings I and IV) involving Asp-146, homologous to Glu-146 contributing to a second substrate oxidation site in P. chrysosporium LiP (16Doyle W.A.

Finally, site-III would be located at Tyr-181 and involves electron transfer from this exposed residue to the porphyrin macrocycle via the internal heme propionate (bond to carbon-6 of heme ring III), its final part being similar to the propionate electron transfer pathway for Mn2+ oxidation by MnP and VP (13Sundaramoorthy M.

To evaluate these possible substrate oxidation sites, site-directed mutagenesis of T. cervina LiP* was performed. Mutations were introduced to block the three sites as detailed below. His-170 was replaced by serine because MnP, lacking site-I, includes Ser-168 at this position (Fig. 2D). Asp-146 was substituted by glycine because it has been demonstrated that the E146G mutation in P. chrysosporium LiP affects VA oxidation activity at site-II (Fig. 2B) (16Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Finally, Tyr-181 was replaced by asparagine because LiP without site-III has Asn-182 at this position (Fig. 2B). The same E. coli expression and in vitro refolding conditions previously optimized for native LiP* were used for the three mutated variants (D146G, H170S, and Y181N). These were obtained as inactive proteins, which accumulated in inclusion bodies with high purities. Their in vitro refolding yields, up to 5% activation of the total recombinant protein, were similar to that obtained for the native LiP*. The purified variants appeared electrophoretically homogeneous, and their electronic absorption spectra were almost identical to the native LiP* spectrum, indicating no significant changes of the heme environment. The changes in T. cervina LiP catalytic properties caused by the three point mutations are described below. Oxidation of VA and ABTS by native LiP* and its mutated variants was investigated. The kinetic constants obtained are shown in Table 2. The Y181N mutation completely removes VA oxidation activity and also decreases (7-fold) the catalytic efficiency for ABTS oxidation. The H170S variant shows the same kinetic constants for VA oxidation of native LiP*, although it slightly decreases (32%) the catalytic efficiency on ABTS. Finally, the D146G variant shows slightly lower VA oxidation efficiency (30% decrease) than native LiP*, whereas its kinetic parameters for ABTS oxidation are almost identical to those of native LiP*.TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters for oxidation of VA and ABTS by native T. cervina LiP* and its site-directed variants D146G, H170S, and Y181NVA oxidationABTS oxidationKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1s−1 · mm−1μms−1s−1 · mm−1LiP*6.0 ± 0.523.5 ± 0.63.92 ± 0.10868 ± 790210 ± 7242 ± 8D146G5.6 ± 0.715.3 ± 0.82.73 ± 0.14814 ± 170231 ± 2284 ± 2H170S6.0 ± 0.722.1 ± 1.03.68 ± 0.161125 ± 100184 ± 7164 ± 6Y181NNDaND, not determined due to lack of activity.

Among subjects with AD FLG defects are also consistently associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) but it is less clear to what extent these associations are also present independently from skin disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of 2282del4 and R501X in predisposing to these allergic phenotypes in a Polish population.2282del4 and R501X were typed among 3,802 participants of the Epidemiology of Allergic Diseases in Poland (ECAP) survey, a cross-sectional population-based study using ECRHS II and ISAAC questionnaires, and ambulatory examination.The FLG null variants were associated with AD (OR = 2.01, CI: 1.20-3.36, P = 0.007), allergic rhinitis (in particular persistent form, OR = 1.69, CI:1.12-2.54, P = 0.011), and asthma (in particular atopic asthma, OR = 2.22, CI:1.24-3.96, P = 0.006). Association with atopic asthma (but not persistent allergic rhinitis) was also present in the absence of AD, (OR = 2.02, CI: 1.07-3.81, P = 0.027) as well as in the absence of AD and history of broadly defined inflammatory skin disease (OR = 2.30, CI: 1.07-4.93, P = 0.03). Association to atopic asthma would have not been found if diagnosis was made by questionnaire only (OR = 1.15, CI: 0.58-2.32, P = 0.8). We did not observe an association between FLG variants and allergic sensitizations (P = 0.8) or total IgE. (P = 0.6).In a Polish population FLG 2282del4 and R501X carriage increases risk for development of AD and atopic asthma (also in the absence of AD or history thereof). This suggests that interventions aimed at restoring epidermal barrier may have a general role in asthma prophylaxis/treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2050053600,"The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences and associations of high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin and proinflammatory adipokines, individually or in combinations, with adiposity and insulin resistance (IR) measures in prepubertal childhood.We studied 305 prepubertal children (boys/girls: 144/161; Tanner stage 1; age: 5-13 yr), included in a cohort of 44,231 adolescents who participated in an extensive Italian school-based survey. According to Cole's criteria, 105 individuals were lean (L; boys/girls: 59/46), 60 overweight (OW; boys/girls: 32/28) and 140 obese (OB; boys/girls: 70/70). Measurements comprised total and HMW adiponectin, leptin, as well as a panel of proinflammatory adipokines/chemokines associated with diabetes risk.Leptin-, and the leptin-to-HMW adiponectin ratio (L/HMW)-, increased progressively (p<0.0001) from L to OW to OB boys and girls. When compared with L peers, OW and OB girls exhibited lower (p<0.001) HMW adiponectin levels, while in boys the HMW multimers did not differ significantly across the BMI-stratified groups. OB girls displayed higher (p<0.05) IL-8, IL-18, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels (sICAM-1) than L girls, whereas increased macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) concentrations in OB vs OW boys were seen. HMW adiponectin (negatively), leptin or inflammatory markers (positively) correlated with adiposity and IR measures. In multivariate models, leptin represented a strong and independent determinant of HOMA-IR (R(2) 0.378; p<0.01). Adjustment for age, BMI(z-score), lipids and inflammatory mediators abolished the association between leptin and HOMA-IR in boys, while in girls leptin remained still a significant predictor of IR (R(2) 0.513; p<0.01). Finally, in both sexes, the joint effect of the L/HMW did not improve the prediction of basal IR as compared with leptin levels alone, which were mainly explained by the BMI(z-score.)In prepubertal children, leptin emerges as a sex-independent discrimination marker of adiposity degree and as a useful, sex-associated predictor of the systemic insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2131785177,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) self-associate as dimers or higher-order oligomers in living cells. The stability of associated GPCRs has not been extensively studied, but it is generally thought that these receptors move between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments as intact dimers or oligomers. Here we show that β(2)-adrenergic receptors (β(2)ARs) that self-associate at the plasma membrane can dissociate during agonist-induced internalization. We use bioluminescence-resonance energy transfer (BRET) to monitor movement of β(2)ARs between subcellular compartments. BRET between β(2)ARs and plasma membrane markers decreases in response to agonist activation, while at the same time BRET between β(2)ARs and endosome markers increases. Energy transfer between β(2)ARs is decreased in a similar manner if either the donor- or acceptor-labeled receptor is mutated to impair agonist binding and internalization. These changes take place over the course of 30 minutes, persist after agonist is removed, and are sensitive to several inhibitors of arrestin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The magnitude of the decrease in BRET between donor- and acceptor-labeled β(2)ARs suggests that at least half of the receptors that contribute to the BRET signal are physically segregated by internalization. These results are consistent with the possibility that β(2)ARs associate transiently with each other in the plasma membrane, or that β(2)AR dimers or oligomers are actively disrupted during internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2139845893,"Objective To explore the prevalence and features of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDS) in Botswana, a sub-Saharan country at the center of the HIV epidemic. Design and Methods A cross sectional study of 60 HIV-positive individuals, all receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and 80 demographically matched HIV-seronegative control subjects. We administered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and structured psychiatric interview. The lowest 10th percentile of results achieved by control subjects was used to define the lower limit of normal performance on cognitive measures. Subjects who scored abnormal on three or more measures were classified as cognitively impaired. To determine the clinical significance of any cognitive impairment, we assessed medication adherence, employment, and independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Results HIV+ subjects were impaired for all cognitive-motor ability areas compared with matched, uninfected control subjects. Thirty seven percent of HIV+ patients met criteria for cognitive impairment. Conclusion These findings indicate that neurocognitive impairment is likely to be an important feature of HIV infection in resource-limited countries; underscoring the need to develop effective treatments for subjects with, or at risk of developing, cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2042017476,"NMDA receptors are traditionally viewed as being located postsynaptically, at both synaptic and extrasynaptic locations. However, both anatomical and physiological studies have indicated the presence of NMDA receptors located presynaptically. Physiological studies of presynaptic NMDA receptors on neocortical GABAergic terminals and their possible role in synaptic plasticity are lacking.We report here that presynaptic NMDA receptors are present on GABAergic terminals in developing (postnatal day (PND) 12-15) but not older (PND21-25) rat frontal cortex. Using MK-801 in the recording pipette to block postsynaptic NMDA receptors, evoked and miniature IPSCs were recorded in layer II/III pyramidal cells in the presence of AMPA/KA receptor antagonists. Bath application of NMDA or NMDA receptor antagonists produced increases and decreases in mIPSC frequency, respectively. Physiologically patterned stimulation (10 bursts of 10 stimuli at 25 Hz delivered at 1.25 Hz) induced potentiation at inhibitory synapses in PND12-15 animals. This consisted of an initial rapid, large increase in IPSC amplitude followed by a significant but smaller persistent increase. Similar changes were not observed in PND21-25 animals. When 20 mM BAPTA was included in the recording pipette, potentiation was still observed in the PND12-15 group indicating that postsynaptic increases in calcium were not required. Potentiation was not observed when patterned stimulation was given in the presence of D-APV or the NR2B subunit antagonist Ro25-6981.The present results indicate that presynaptic NMDA receptors modulate GABA release onto neocortical pyramidal cells. Presynaptic NR2B subunit containing NMDA receptors are also involved in potentiation at developing GABAergic synapses in rat frontal cortex. Modulation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses by presynaptic NMDA receptors may be important for proper functioning of local cortical networks during development."
https://openalex.org/W2013039026,"Thiazole antibiotic, thiostrepton was recently identified as proteasome inhibitor. We investigated the therapeutic potential of the combination of thiostrepton and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) on various human tumor cell lines. Combination of sub-lethal concentrations of thiostrepton and bortezomib induced potent apoptosis and inhibition of long-term colony formation in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines. The synergistic relationship between thiostrepton and bortezomib combination was also quantitatively demonstrated by calculating their combination index values that were much lower than 1 in all studied cell lines. The synergy between these drugs was based on their proteasome inhibitory activities, because thiostrepton modification, thiostrepton methyl ester, which did not have intact quinaldic acid ring and did not inhibit proteasome activity failed to demonstrate any synergy in combination with bortezomib."
https://openalex.org/W2087504465,"The proper level of estrogen-estrogen receptor (ER) signaling is important for the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis in the breast. In a previous study we demonstrated that ATBF1, which has been suggested as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, inhibited estrogen-mediated cell proliferation by selectively competing with AIB1 for binding to the ER. However, the expression of ATBF1 mRNA was shown to positively correlate with ER in breast cancer specimens. We, therefore, examined whether estrogen regulates ATBF1. We demonstrated that estrogen up-regulated the transcription of ATBF1, which was mediated by the direct binding of the ER onto the ATBF1 promoter, and that a half-estrogen-responsive element in the ATBF1 promoter was essential for ER direct binding. Furthermore, we found that estrogen at lower levels increased, but at higher levels decreased the expression of ATBF1 protein, which involved the degradation of ATBF1 protein by the estrogen-responsive proteasome system. ATBF1 protein levels fluctuate with estrogen levels. Although lower levels of estrogen increased ATBF1 protein expression, ATBF1 still inhibited cell proliferation caused by lower levels of estrogen. These findings not only reveal an autoregulatory feedback loop between ATBF1 and estrogen-ER signaling but also suggest that ATBF1 plays a role in both the maintenance of breast epithelial homeostasis and breast tumorigenesis caused by elevated estrogen levels."
https://openalex.org/W2055886634,"LMNA encodes both lamin A and C: major components of the nuclear lamina. Mutations in LMNA underlie a range of tissue-specific degenerative diseases, including those that affect skeletal muscle, such as autosomal-Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (A-EDMD) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1B. Here, we examine the morphology and transcriptional activity of myonuclei, the structure of the myotendinous junction and the muscle contraction dynamics in the lmna-null mouse model of A-EDMD. We found that there were fewer myonuclei in lmna-null mice, of which ∼50% had morphological abnormalities. Assaying transcriptional activity by examining acetylated histone H3 and PABPN1 levels indicated that there was a lack of coordinated transcription between myonuclei lacking lamin A/C. Myonuclei with abnormal morphology and transcriptional activity were distributed along the length of the myofibre, but accumulated at the myotendinous junction. Indeed, in addition to the presence of abnormal myonuclei, the structure of the myotendinous junction was perturbed, with disorganised sarcomeres and reduced interdigitation with the tendon, together with lipid and collagen deposition. Functionally, muscle contraction became severely affected within weeks of birth, with specific force generation dropping as low as ∼65% and ∼27% of control values in the extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles respectively. These observations illustrate the importance of lamin A/C for correct myonuclear function, which likely acts synergistically with myotendinous junction disorganisation in the development of A-EDMD, and the consequential reduction in force generation and muscle wasting."
https://openalex.org/W1991004739,"The c-Myb transcription factor is a critical regulator of proliferation and stem cell differentiation, and mutated alleles of c-Myb are oncogenic, but little is known about changes in c-Myb activity during the cell cycle. To map the association of c-Myb with specific target genes during the cell cycle, we developed a novel Fix-Sort-ChIP approach, in which asynchronously growing cells were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with Hoechst 33342 and separated into different cell cycle fractions by flow sorting, then processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We found that c-Myb actively repositions, binding to some genes only in specific cell cycle phases. In addition, the specificity of c-Myb is dramatically different in small subpopulations of cells, for example cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, than in the bulk population. The repositioning of c-Myb during the cell cycle is not due to changes in its expression and also occurs with ectopically expressed, epitope-tagged versions of c-Myb. The repositioning occurs in established cell lines, in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and in primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells. The combination of fixation, sorting and ChIP analysis sheds new light on the dynamic nature of gene regulation during the cell cycle and provides a new type of tool for the analysis of gene regulation in small subsets of cells, such as cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2070970615,"Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM, CD166) is expressed in various tissues, cancers, and cancer-initiating cells. Alterations in expression of ALCAM have been reported in several human tumors, and cell adhesion functions have been proposed to explain its association with cancer. Here we documented high levels of ALCAM expression in human thyroid tumors and cell lines. Through proteomic characterization of ALCAM expression in the human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line TPC-1, we identified the presence of a full-length membrane-associated isoform in cell lysate and of soluble ALCAM isoforms in conditioned medium. This finding is consistent with proteolytically shed ALCAM ectodomains. Nonspecific agents, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or ionomycin, provoked increased ectodomain shedding. Epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation also enhanced ALCAM secretion through an ADAM17/TACE-dependent pathway. ADAM17/TACE was expressed in the TPC-1 cell line, and ADAM17/TACE silencing by specific small interfering RNAs reduced ALCAM shedding. In addition, the CGS27023A inhibitor of ADAM17/TACE function reduced ALCAM release in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited cell migration in a wound-healing assay. We also provide evidence for the existence of novel O-glycosylated forms and of a novel 60-kDa soluble form of ALCAM, which is particularly abundant following cell stimulation by PMA. ALCAM expression in papillary and medullary thyroid cancer specimens and in the surrounding non-tumoral component was studied by western blot and immunohistochemistry, with results demonstrating that tumor cells overexpress ALCAM. These findings strongly suggest the possibility that ALCAM may have an important role in thyroid tumor biology."
https://openalex.org/W1987120078,"Background The loss of diurnal rhythm in blood pressure (BP) is an important predictor of end-organ damage in hypertensive and diabetic patients. Recent evidence has suggested that two major physiological circadian rhythms, the metabolic and cardiovascular rhythms, are subject to regulation by overlapping molecular pathways, indicating that dysregulation of metabolic cycles could desynchronize the normal diurnal rhythm of BP with the daily light/dark cycle. However, little is known about the impact of changes in metabolic cycles on BP diurnal rhythm. Methodology/Principal Findings To test the hypothesis that feeding-fasting cycles could affect the diurnal pattern of BP, we used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) which develop essential hypertension with disrupted diurnal BP rhythms and examined whether abnormal BP rhythms in SHR were caused by alteration in the daily feeding rhythm. We found that SHR exhibit attenuated feeding rhythm which accompanies disrupted rhythms in metabolic gene expression not only in metabolic tissues but also in cardiovascular tissues. More importantly, the correction of abnormal feeding rhythms in SHR restored the daily BP rhythm and was accompanied by changes in the timing of expression of key circadian and metabolic genes in cardiovascular tissues. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that the metabolic cycle is an important determinant of the cardiovascular diurnal rhythm and that disrupted BP rhythms in hypertensive patients can be normalized by manipulating feeding cycles."

The current model of class II and Ii structure states that three αβ heterodimers bind to an Ii trimer.[corrected] We have now analyzed the composition and size of the complexes of class II and Ii using epitope tagged class II subunits and density gradient experiments. We show here that class II-Ii oligomers consist of one class II heterodimer associated with one Ii trimer, such that the DR, DQ and DP isotypes are contained within separate complexes with Ii.We propose a structural model of the class II-Ii oligomer and speculate that the pentameric class II-Ii complex is bent towards the cell membrane, inhibiting the binding of additional class II heterodimers to Ii."
https://openalex.org/W2018631108,"Background Spiroplasma citri is a wall-less bacterium that colonizes phloem vessels of a large number of host plants. Leafhopper vectors transmit S. citri in a propagative and circulative manner, involving colonization and multiplication of bacteria in various insect organs. Previously we reported that phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), the well-known glycolytic enzyme, bound to leafhopper actin and was unexpectedly implicated in the internalization process of S. citri into Circulifer haematoceps cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In an attempt to identify the actin-interacting regions of PGK, several overlapping PGK truncations were generated. Binding assays, using the truncations as probes on insect protein blots, revealed that the actin-binding region of PGK was located on the truncated peptide designated PGK-FL5 containing amino acids 49–154. To investigate the role of PGK-FL5-actin interaction, competitive spiroplasma attachment and internalization assays, in which His6-tagged PGK-FL5 was added to Ciha-1 cells prior to infection with S. citri, were performed. No effect on the efficiency of attachment of S. citri to leafhopper cells was observed while internalization was drastically reduced. The in vivo effect of PGK-FL5 was confirmed by competitive experimental transmission assays as injection of PGK-FL5 into S. citri infected leafhoppers significantly affected spiroplasmal transmission. Conclusion These results suggest that S. citri transmission by its insect vector is correlated to PGK ability to bind actin."
https://openalex.org/W2041273034,"Alternative splicing, which produces multiple mRNAs from a single gene, occurs in most human genes and contributes to protein diversity. Many alternative isoforms are expressed in a spatio-temporal manner, and function in diverse processes, including in the neural system.The purpose of the present study was to comprehensively investigate neural-splicing using P19 cells. GeneChip Exon Array analysis was performed using total RNAs purified from cells during neuronal cell differentiation. To efficiently and readily extract the alternative exon candidates, 9 filtering conditions were prepared, yielding 262 candidate exons (236 genes). Semiquantitative RT-PCR results in 30 randomly selected candidates suggested that 87% of the candidates were differentially alternatively spliced in neuronal cells compared to undifferentiated cells. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that many of the candidate genes were associated with neural events. Together with 66 genes whose functions in neural cells or organs were reported previously, 47 candidate genes were found to be linked to 189 events in the gene-level profile of neural differentiation. By text-mining for the alternative isoform, distinct functions of the isoforms of 9 candidate genes indicated by the result of Exon Array were confirmed.Alternative exons were successfully extracted. Results from the informatics analyses suggested that neural events were primarily governed by genes whose expression was increased and whose transcripts were differentially alternatively spliced in the neuronal cells. In addition to known functions in neural cells or organs, the uninvestigated alternative splicing events of 11 genes among 47 candidate genes suggested that cell cycle events are also potentially important. These genes may help researchers to differentiate the roles of alternative splicing in cell differentiation and cell proliferation."

Trx80 induces differentiation of human monocytes into a novel cell type, named Trx80-activated-monocytes (TAMs). Principal Findings In this investigation we present evidence for a role of TAMs in the control of intracellular bacterial infections. As model pathogens we have chosen Listeria monocytogenes and Brucella abortus which replicate in the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum respectively. Our data indicate that TAMs efficiently inhibit intracellular growth of both L. monocytogenes and B. abortus. Further analysis shows that Trx80 activation prevents the escape of GFP-tagged L. monocytogenes into the cytosol, and induces accumulation of the bacteria within the lysosomes. Inhibition of the lysosomal activity by chloroquine treatment resulted in higher replication of bacteria in TAMs compared to that observed in control cells 24 h post-infection, indicating that TAMs kill bacteria by preventing their escape from the endosomal compartments, which progress into a highly degradative phagolysosome. Significance Our results show that Trx80 potentiates the bactericidal activities of professional phagocytes, and contributes to the first line of defense against intracellular bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2061950974,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKK or MEK) 1 and 2 are usually treated as redundant kinases. However, in assessing their relative contribution towards ERK-mediated biologic response investigators have relied on tests of necessity, not sufficiency. In response we developed a novel experimental model using lethal toxin (LeTx), an anthrax toxin-derived pan-MKK protease, and genetically engineered protease resistant MKK mutants (MKKcr) to test the sufficiency of MEK signaling in melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells. Surprisingly, ERK activity persisted in LeTx-treated cells expressing MEK2cr but not MEK1cr. Microarray analysis revealed non-overlapping downstream transcriptional targets of MEK1 and MEK2, and indicated a substantial rescue effect of MEK2cr on proliferation pathways. Furthermore, LeTx efficiently inhibited the cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of SK-MEL-28 cells expressing MKK1cr but not MEK2cr. These results indicate in SK-MEL-28 cells MEK1 and MEK2 signaling pathways are not redundant and interchangeable for cell proliferation. We conclude that in the absence of other MKK, MEK2 is sufficient for SK-MEL-28 cell proliferation. MEK1 conditionally compensates for loss of MEK2 only in the presence of other MKK."

Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium best known for its role in meningitis and septicemia. This human-specific pathogen is considered as a major cause of morbidity and mortality during childhood in industrialized countries and is responsible for epidemics in Africa and in Asia (1.Caroline, Genco, Lee, Wetzler, (ed) (2010) Neisseria: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis, Caister Academic Press, Norwich, UK.Google Scholar). Like most bacterial pathogens, N. meningitidis synthesizes a number of toxic products believed to target and kill their host cells. Among these toxins, proteins that exert ADP-ribosylation activity represent a large family of potentially toxic enzymes able to modify or disrupt essential functions of eukaryotic cells (2Moss J.

ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADPRTs) 3The abbreviations used are: ADPRTADP-ribosyltransferaseNOENuclear Overhauser EffectsCSPChemical Shift PerturbationNADaseNAD-glycohydrolase. catalyze the transfer of a single ADP-ribosyl group from β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) onto specific amino acid residues of host cell proteins with the simultaneous release of nicotinamide (3Althaus F.R. Richter C. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 37: 1-237PubMed Google Scholar). Many bacterial pathogens use ADP-ribosylating enzymes to block protein synthesis or to alter signal transduction by inactivating key target proteins such as GTP-binding proteins (4Locht C. Keith J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosyltransferase Nuclear Overhauser Effects Chemical Shift Perturbation NAD-glycohydrolase. The putative ADP-ribosylating NarE protein from N. meningitidis was recently identified on the basis of a profile-based computational approach (5Masignani V. Balducci E. Di Marcello F. Savino S. Serruto D. Veggi D. Bambini S. Scarselli M. Aricò B. Comanducci M. Adu-Bobie J. Giuliani M.M. Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NarE shares structural features with toxins from Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli, and, like cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxins, retains the capacity to ADP-ribosylate arginine and to hydrolyze NAD in ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. Another feature of NarE is its ability to bind iron through an iron-sulfur center (Fe-S) (6Del Vecchio M. Pogni R. Baratto M.C. Nobbs A. Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Balducci E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33040-33047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic assays showed that correct assembly of the iron-binding site is essential for transferase but not for hydrolase activity (6Del Vecchio M. Pogni R. Baratto M.C. Nobbs A. Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Balducci E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33040-33047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting for the first time an implication of a Fe-S cluster in catalysis within the ADP-ribosyltransferase family. By using solution state NMR spectroscopy we solved the atomic structure of the apo-form of NarE, which is structurally homologous to other ADPRTs. We could further characterize the NAD binding site using 15N-HSQC titration experiments. The resulting Chemical Shift Perturbation (CSP) data were used to model the first NAD-bound complex of an ADPRT using the docking software HADDOCK (7deVries S.J. van Dijk M. Bonvin A.M. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). This data is in agreement with results from site directed mutagenesis identifying two functionally crucial residues within the substrate binding site. Moreover we could identify the iron coordination site of NarE consisting of two cysteines and two histidines using CSP experiments as well as paramagnetic effects of the bound iron. We could further identify a main epitope of NarE using four different monoclonal antibodies and two complementary methods based on antibody immobilization, proteolytic digestion, and mass spectrometry. Because of the eminent implication of ADPRTs in pathogenicity the presented results will stimulate drug design for a wide variety of pathogens. The NarE gene was PCR amplified from the chromosomal DNA of N. meningitidis MC58 strain and cloned into a pET21b+ plasmid (Novagen) under the control of the T7 promoter. The resulting expression vector encodes a 17 kDa fusion protein that contains the wild-type NarE sequence (145 residues) followed by an 8-residue C-terminal histidine tag (LEHHHHHH) used for purification purposes. The pET21b+ plasmid was transformed into an E. coli BL21 (DE3) expression strain. Recombinant protein was prepared from cells grown to an A600 of 0.5–0.6 at 37 °C in a bacterial culture supplemented by 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was then induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and the culture was further grown for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g for 30 min), resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, and lysed with a French press cell (SLM, Aminco). The soluble fraction enriched with the NarE protein was separated from the inclusion bodies by centrifugation at 39,200 × g for 45 min, and loaded on a nickel affinity chromatography column (GE Healthcare). The protein was purified using IMAC standard protocols and an imidazole concentration of 125 mm was required to elute recombinant NarE. A second step of purification was performed using anion exchange QHP chromatography (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the target protein were collected at a NaCl concentration of 300 mm and finally concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 3-kDa cutoff membrane (Millipore). Expression of uniformly labeled 15N and 15N/13C proteins was carried out by growing BL21 strains in ISOGRO-15N and ISOGRO-15N,13C rich media (Sigma), respectively. NMR spectra were acquired at 300 K on Bruker Avance-II 600 and 900 spectrometer equipped with cryoprobes and on an Avance-II 750 spectrometer. All experiments were performed with solutions of 0.6 mm NarE protein in 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, complete protease inhibitor EDTA free (Roche), 0.01% NaN3 in either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O. Trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3-2H4]propionate (TSP) was added as an internal 1H chemical shift reference. 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to TSP, using the absolute frequency ratios (8Wishart D.S.

All spectra were processed using Topspin 2.1 (Bruker Biospin GmbH). Backbone resonance assignment was carried out based on the triple-resonance experiment sets CBCA(CO)NH/CBCANH and HN(CA)CO/HNCO (9Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

Side chain resonances were identified using HBHA(CO)NH (11Montelione G. Lyons B. Emerson S. Tashiro M. J. Am. Chem.

The extent of the resonance assignment was described recently (13Carlier L. Koehler C. Veggi D. Pizza M. Soriani M. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2011; 5: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Interproton distance information for structure calculations was derived from 15N-NOESY-HSQC spectra as well as 13C-NOESY-HMQC (14Clore G. Gronenborn A. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1992; 23: 43-92Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (246) Google Scholar) spectra recorded in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O, respectively. All NOESY spectra were acquired using a mixing time of 90 ms. Sparky (15.Goddard, T., Kneller, D., Sparky 3, University of California, San Francisco.Google Scholar) was used for resonance assignment of the protein. Dihedral angle restraints were predicted using the chemical shift-based dihedral angle prediction software TALOS+ (16Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Automated assignment of NOESY spectra was performed with CYANA 2.1 (17Guentert P. Downing A.K. Automated NMR Protein Structure Calculation with Cyana, Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, 2004: 353-378Google Scholar). The resulting assigned distance restraints were imported back to Sparky and manually refined by iterative assignment corrections and structure calculations using CNS1.2 (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

For these calculations the assigned distance restraints were categorized into three classes: (I, < 4 Å; II, < 5 Å; III, < 6 Å) according to the signal volume. The 20 lowest energy structures were subjected to a refinement in water using CNS1.2 (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Proteins-Structure Function Genetics. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The quality of the final ensemble was analyzed with PSVS 1.3 (20Bhattacharya A. Tejero R. Montelione G.T. Proteins. 2007; 66: 778-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Relaxation rate measurements were performed as a series of 1H-15N-HSQC-type spectra (21Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Relaxation rates of the amide nitrogens were extracted from eleven spectra with delays of 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 2000 ms for R1 and 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, and 200 ms for R2 by fitting the signal intensities to an exponential decay as implemented in the Sparky software. The 15N heteronuclear NOE was measured interleaved with a reference spectrum without NOE transfer. Information to internal dynamics were extracted from the ratio of the signal intensities between both spectra.

Residues showing chemical shift perturbations were assumed to be less affected by the ligand binding than residues showing a signal attenuation. In this regard perturbations of chemical shifts were assumed to be minor and assignments for well dispersed signals were transferred from the reference spectrum. The extracted changes of 15N and 1H chemical shifts were used to calculate the combined chemical shift perturbation in Equation 1 (22Mulder F.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Δδcomb=[(ΔδHN)2+(ΔδN/6.5)2]1/2(Eq. 1) Models of the NAD-NarE complex were calculated using HADDOCK2.1 (23Dominguez C. Boelens R.

Protoc. 2010; 5: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Residues affected by the binding of NAD as revealed by CSP experiments and further conserved within the ADPRT group were considered as directly participating in ligand binding (active residues). All remaining affected residues were categorized as indirectly involved in the ligand binding (passive residues). Active and passive residues were only discriminated during the rigid body docking (it0). During semiflexible docking (it1) and water refinement all affected residues on NarE were categorized as passive while NAD was kept active. To account for the flexibility of the loop region of NarE residues 10–66 were defined as fully flexible. One additional ambiguous restraint was defined from the Nitrogen atom of the nicotinamide cleavage site to any protein side-chain glutamate oxygen. To generate the NarE-R7K mutant as histidine fusion protein in E. coli, the gene coding sequence, devoid of the STOP codon, was amplified by PCR from N. meningitidis strain MC58, using mutated oligonucleotides containing an NdeI or XhoI site in the forward or reverse primers, respectively, which were used to clone the mutant gene into the pET21b+ vector (Table 2). To generate NarE E111D and E120D mutants, internal primers containing codon changes were designed according to the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis instruction manual. 100 ng of the pET-NarE-His plasmid were used as template in a methylation reaction, then 12.5 ng of methylated plasmid were employed as substrate in a mutagenesis reaction, using the primer pairs listed in the Table 2. All the mutants were expressed and purified as soluble forms at 37 °C.TABLE 2Primer sequences for the site-directed mutagenesisPrimerSequenceCodon changeR7K forwardCGCGGATCCCATATGGGAAATTTCTTATATAaAGGCATTAGAGA - AaAR7K reverseCCCGCTCGAGGTTAATTTCTATCAACTCTTTAGCAE120D forwardCCAGAAAACCCAAATGAGAAGGAcGTAACAATCAGAGCGAA - GAcE120D reverseAGCTCTGATTGTTACgTCCTTCTCATTTGGGTTTTCTGGE111D forwardGAATATGAGGTTGAcCATCCAGAAAACCCAAATGAGAAGGGAA - GAcE111D reverseCTTCTCATTTGGGTTTTCTGGATGgTCAACCTCATATTC Open table in a new tab The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of NarE was assayed in vitro by monitoring the enzymatic transfer of ADP-ribose to agmatine as described previously (25Moss J. Stanley S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 4809-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NarE was added to a 0.3 ml assay mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20 mm agmatine as ADP-ribose acceptor and 0.1 mm [adenine-U-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi). After incubation at 30 °C, duplicate samples (100 μl) were applied to 1-ml columns of Dowex AG 1-X2 followed by eluting the product [adenine- 14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine with 5 ml of H2O. An analog assay based on nicotinamide release was employed to measure the NAD-glycohydrolase (NADase) activity of NarE (26Moss J. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73 (Dec): 4424-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This assay was carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm [carbonyl-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi) replacing [adenine-U-14C]NAD in a total volume of 0.3 ml in the presence of the appropriate concentrations of chloride salts. Samples (100 μl) after incubation at 30 °C were applied to a 1-ml column of Dowex AG 1-X2 and 14C-nicotinamide eluted with 5 ml of H2O for liquid scintillation counting. NADase activity was expressed as nanomol/h of [14C]nicotinamide released. The epitope mapping protocols are based on the approach described by Peter and Tomer (27Peter J.F. Tomer K.B. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4012-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which we adapted in two different protocols used here (28Soriani M. Petit P. Grifantini R. Petracca R. Gancitano G.

Peptide mixtures were obtained by digestion of NarE with trypsin and LysC (independently) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer in a ratio 10:1 at 37 °C for 3 h. To capture the epitope-containing peptide, a 25-μl suspension of Dyanbeads Pan Mouse IgG (uniform, superparamagnetic polystyrene beads of 4.5-μm diameter coated with monoclonal human anti-mouse IgG antibodies) was used. The beads were washed twice with PBS using a magnet and resuspended in the initial volume. 1 μg of the probe (murine) mAb was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, after which the beads were washed twice with PBS to remove mAb excess. 0.5 μl of Protease Inhibitor Mix (GE Healthcare) was added prior to the addition of the peptide mixture to avoid potential degradation of the antibodies. The sample was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle tilting and rotation. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, and the bound peptide was then eluted with 50 μl of 0.2% TFA. The elute fraction was concentrated and washed with C18 ZipTips (Millipore) and eluted in 3 μl of 50% ACN and 0.1% TFA. For MALDI-MS analysis, 1 μl of sample was mixed with the same volume of a solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-transcinnamic acid matrix (0.3 mg/ml in H2O:ACN:TFA at 6:3:1), spotted onto the MALDI target plate and allowed to air-dry at room temperature. MALDI-mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode on an UltrafleXtreme MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics). Ion acceleration was set to 25 kV. All mass spectra were externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture. For MS/MS analysis, the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science. London, UK) was used with the following parameters: one missed cleavage permission, 20 ppm measurement for MS, and 0.3 Da for MS/MS tolerance. Positive identification was accepted with p values lower than 0.05. In the searches, methionine residues modified to methionine sulfoxide were allowed. 2) Partial digestion of immunocaptured antigens. To allow the capture of conformational epitopes, the order of the steps in the previous protocol was inverted. The intact protein (20 μg) was added to the beads, allowing binding to the immobilized mAbs. The protease was then added to the sample in a ratio 50:1, with incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. After proteolysis, the beads were washed ten times with 1 ml of PBS, and the bound peptide was then eluted as previously described. To avoid the analysis of proteolyzed antibody fragments within the elute fraction, NarE was substituted by PBS in negative controls. As previously described, the family of ADPRTs shares a similarly folded active site region consisting of three antiparallel β-strands with an α-helix adjacent to the central strand (5Masignani V. Balducci E. Di Marcello F. Savino S. Serruto D. Veggi D. Bambini S. Scarselli M. Aricò B. Comanducci M. Adu-Bobie J. Giuliani M.M. Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using solution state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we determined the structure of apo-NarE and characterized its dynamics. Table 1 summarizes the structural statistics of the ensemble of NarE conformers. From R1 and R2 relaxation rates as well as heteronuclear Nuclear Overhauser Effects (NOE) we identified a loop region corresponding to residues 20–60, which is characterized by fast motions in the range of μs-ms within the otherwise rigid protein (Fig. 1, A and B). A lack of NMR signals detected for this loop region also suggests exchange effects as a result of motions in a range of ms-s. The rigid part forms a β-α-α-β-α-β-β-β-β fold with two groups of each three antiparallel β-strands interrupted by three α-helices (Fig. 2, A and B). This domain is commonly found within the ADPRT group as indicated by a DALI (29Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) search for structurally similar proteins within the Protein Data Bank. Fig. 3A shows some of the highest-ranking hits superposed onto NarE. Surprisingly, besides classical ADPRTs like the heat-labile enterotoxin from E. coli (PDB-ID: 1LTA (30Merritt E.A. Sixma T.K.

As shown in Fig. 4A, the addition of NAD results in the disappearance of several NMR signals, which could be explained by induced fit motions or cleavage of NAD during the measurement. These slow exchange processes lead to a constantly changing system resulting in increasing linewidth of the NMR signals. In Fig. 4B the affected residues are mapped onto the NarE structure, highlighting the expected NAD binding site as found in other ADPRTs (5Masignani V. Balducci E. Di Marcello F. Savino S. Serruto D. Veggi D. Bambini S. Scarselli M. Aricò B. Comanducci M. Adu-Bobie J. Giuliani M.M. Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine which residues are directly involved in the NAD binding, an analysis of conserved regions between different ADPRTs was carried out. Fig. 3B presents a structure-based alignment of the sequences of the 5 proteins shown in Fig. 3A. Residues showing a perturbation of NMR signals after addition of NAD and that are conserved within the group of ADPRTs are marked with a star (Fig. 4B). These residues, namely Arg-7, Asp-14, Ser-70, Thr-71, Thr-72, Tyr-91, Ile-92, Tyr-93, Tyr-108, and Glu-120, are considered to actively interact with NAD, whereas all other affected residues are thought to be only indirectly involved in NAD binding. To fortify these results we performed a site-directed mutagenesis on two potentially crucial residues, namely Arg-7 and Glu-120. As a control we further analyzed a mutation of Glu-111, which is predicted to have a minor influence in catalysis. To maintain the fold of the protein, residues were substituted by chemically similar amino acids, which leads to the mutations R7K, E111D, and E120D. The activity of the three purified NarE mutants was tested by an in vitro ADP-ribosylation assay as described previously (25Moss J. Stanley S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 4809-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whereas the activity of the R7K and E120D mutants is almost completely abolished, the substitution of Glu-111 did not affect it (Fig. 4C), which is in perfect agreement with the described NMR data. In addition, to test whether NarE mutations not only influence the bi"
https://openalex.org/W1967155526,"Telomere shortening is a cell-intrinsic mechanism that limits cell proliferation by induction of DNA damage responses resulting either in apoptosis or cellular senescence. Shortening of telomeres has been shown to occur during human aging and in chronic diseases that accelerate cell turnover, such as chronic hepatitis. Telomere shortening can limit organ homeostasis and regeneration in response to injury. Whether the same holds true for pancreas regeneration in response to injury is not known.In the present study, pancreatic regeneration after acute cerulein-induced pancreatitis was studied in late generation telomerase knockout mice with short telomeres compared to telomerase wild-type mice with long telomeres.Late generation telomerase knockout mice exhibited impaired exocrine pancreatic regeneration after acute pancreatitis as seen by persistence of metaplastic acinar cells and markedly reduced proliferation. The expression levels of p53 and p21 were not significantly increased in regenerating pancreas of late generation telomerase knockout mice compared to wild-type mice.Our results indicate that pancreatic regeneration is limited in the context of telomere dysfunction without evidence for p53 checkpoint activation."
https://openalex.org/W2004651709,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 encoded Rev is essential for export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, of unspliced and singly spliced transcripts coding for structural and nonstructural viral proteins. This process is spatially and temporally coordinated resulting from the interactions between cellular and viral proteins. Here we examined the effects of the sub-cellular localization and dynamics of Rev on the efficiency of nucleocytoplasmic transport of HIV-1 Gag transcripts and virus particle production. Using confocal microscopy and fluorescence recovery after bleaching (FRAP), we report that NF90ctv, a cellular protein involved in Rev function, alters both the sub-cellular localization and dynamics of Rev in vivo, which drastically affects the accumulation of the viral protein p24. The CRM1-dependent nuclear export of Gag mRNA linked to the Rev Response Element (RRE) is dependent on specific domains of the NF90ctv protein. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the appropriate intracellular localization and dynamics of Rev could regulate Gag assembly and HIV-1 replication."
https://openalex.org/W2091233714,"Understanding the basis of the binding of a T cell receptor (TR) to the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex is essential due to the vital role it plays in adaptive immune response. We describe the use of computed binding (free) energy (BE), TR paratope, pMHC epitope, molecular surface electrostatic potential (MSEP) and calculated TR docking angle (θ) to analyse 61 TR/pMHC crystallographic structures to comprehend TR/pMHC interaction. In doing so, we have successfully demonstrated a novel/rational approach for θ calculation, obtained a linear correlation between BE and θ without any ""codon"" or amino acid preference, provided an explanation for TR ability to scan many pMHC ligands yet specifically bind one, proposed a mechanism for pMHC recognition by TR leading to T cell activation and illustrated the importance of the peptide in determining TR specificity, challenging the ""germline bias"" theory."
https://openalex.org/W1970375657,"The ability to respond to anti-growth signals is critical to maintain tissue homeostasis and loss of this negative growth control safeguard is considered a hallmark of cancer. Negative growth regulation generally occurs during the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, yet the redundancy and complexity among components of this regulatory network has made it difficult to discern how negative growth cues protect cells from aberrant proliferation.The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) acts as the final barrier to prevent cells from entering into the cell cycle. By introducing subtle changes in the endogenous mouse Rb1 gene (Rb1(ΔL)), we have previously shown that interactions at the LXCXE binding cleft are necessary for the proper response to anti-growth signals such as DNA damage and TGF-β, with minimal effects on overall development. This disrupts the balance of pro- and anti-growth signals in mammary epithelium of Rb1(ΔL/ΔL) mice. Here we show that Rb1(ΔL/ΔL) mice are more prone to mammary tumors in the Wap-p53(R172H) transgenic background indicating that negative growth regulation is important for tumor suppression in these mice. In contrast, the same defect in anti-growth control has no impact on Neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis.Our work demonstrates that negative growth control by pRB acts as a crucial barrier against oncogenic transformation. Strikingly, our data also reveals that this tumor suppressive effect is context-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2072481026,"Thioredoxins (TRXs) are ubiquitous proteins involved in redox processes. About forty genes encode TRX or TRX-related proteins in plants, grouped in different families according to their subcellular localization. For instance, the h-type TRXs are located in cytoplasm or mitochondria, whereas f-type TRXs have a plastidial origin, although both types of proteins have an eukaryotic origin as opposed to other TRXs. Herein, we study the conformational and the biophysical features of TRXh1, TRXh2 and TRXf from Pisum sativum. The modelled structures of the three proteins show the well-known TRX fold. While sharing similar pH-denaturations features, the chemical and thermal stabilities are different, being PsTRXh1 (Pisum sativum thioredoxin h1) the most stable isoform; moreover, the three proteins follow a three-state denaturation model, during the chemical-denaturations. These differences in the thermal- and chemical-denaturations result from changes, in a broad sense, of the several ASAs (accessible surface areas) of the proteins. Thus, although a strong relationship can be found between the primary amino acid sequence and the structure among TRXs, that between the residue sequence and the conformational stability and biophysical properties is not. We discuss how these differences in the biophysical properties of TRXs determine their unique functions in pea, and we show how residues involved in the biophysical features described (pH-titrations, dimerizations and chemical-denaturations) belong to regions involved in interaction with other proteins. Our results suggest that the sequence demands of protein-protein function are relatively rigid, with different protein-binding pockets (some in common) for each of the three proteins, but the demands of structure and conformational stability per se (as long as there is a maintained core), are less so."
https://openalex.org/W2037412756,"The encounter of a Ca2+ ion with a protein and its subsequent binding to specific binding sites is an intricate process that cannot be fully elucidated from experimental observations. We have applied Molecular Dynamics to study this process with atomistic details, using Calbindin D9k (CaB) as a model protein. The simulations show that in most of the time the Ca2+ ion spends within the Debye radius of CaB, it is being detained at the 1st and 2nd solvation shells. While being detained near the protein, the diffusion coefficient of the ion is significantly reduced. However, due to the relatively long period of detainment, the ion can scan an appreciable surface of the protein. The enhanced propagation of the ion on the surface has a functional role: significantly increasing the ability of the ion to scan the protein's surface before being dispersed to the bulk. The contribution of this mechanism to Ca2+ binding becomes significant at low ion concentrations, where the intervals between successive encounters with the protein are getting longer. The efficiency of the surface diffusion is affected by the distribution of charges on the protein's surface. Comparison of the Ca2+ binding dynamics in CaB and its E60D mutant reveals that in the wild type (WT) protein the carboxylate of E60 function as a preferred landing-site for the Ca2+ arriving from the bulk, followed by delivering it to the final binding site. Replacement of the glutamate by aspartate significantly reduced the ability to transfer Ca2+ ions from D60 to the final binding site, explaining the observed decrement in the affinity of the mutated protein to Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1964377055,"Sprouty and Spred proteins have been widely implicated in the negative regulation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In considering the functional role of these proteins, we explored their effects on ERK activation induced by cyclopentenone prostanoids, which bind to and activate Ras proteins. We therefore found that ectopic overexpression in HeLa cells of human Sprouty2, or human Spred1 or 2, inhibits ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activation triggered by the cyclopentenone prostanoids PGA(1) and 15d-PGJ(2). Furthermore, we found that in HT cells that do not express Sprouty2 due to hypermethylation of its gene-promoter, PGA(1)-provoked ERK activation was more intense and sustained compared to other hematopoietic cell lines with unaltered Sprouty2 expression. Cyclopentenone prostanoids did not induce Sprouty2 tyrosine phosphorylation, in agreement with its incapability to activate tyrosine-kinase receptors. However, Sprouty2 Y55F, which acts as a defective mutant upon tyrosine-kinase receptor stimulation, did not inhibit cyclopentenone prostanoids-elicited ERK pathway activation. In addition, Sprouty2 did not affect the Ras-GTP levels promoted by cyclopentenone prostanoids. These results unveil both common and differential features in the activation of Ras-dependent pathways by cyclopentenone prostanoids and growth factors. Moreover, they provide the first evidence that Sprouty and Spred proteins are negative regulators of the ERK/Elk-1 pathway activation induced not only by growth-factors, but also by reactive lipidic mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1974502604,"Background Young adult Mexican Americans (MA) exhibit lower insulin sensitivity (Si) than nonHispanic whites (NHW), even when controlling for fitness and adiposity. It is unclear if MA are as responsive to the same lifestyle intervention as NHW. Objective We developed a model to examine cardiometabolic plasticity (i.e., changes in Si and plasma lipids) in MA compared to NHW adults in response to a diet-exercise intervention. Design Sedentary subjects (20 NHW: 11F, 9M, 23.0 y, 25.5 kg/m2; 17 MA: 13F, 4M, 22.7 y, 25.4 kg/m2) consumed their habitual diets and remained sedentary for 7 days, after which fasting blood samples were obtained, and a 3-h intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed with the insulin area under the curve (IAUC) used to estimate Si. Subjects then completed a 7-day diet/exercise intervention (diet: low saturated fat, low added sugar, high fiber; exercise: cycling, six total sessions lasting 40–45 min/session at 65% VO2 max). Pre-intervention tests were repeated. Results Pre intervention IAUC was 28% higher (p<0.05) in MA (IAUC pre = 2298 µU*180 min/mL) than in NHW (IAUC = 1795 µU*180 min/mL). Following the intervention, there was a significant reduction in IAUC in MA (29%) and NHW (32%), however, the IAUC remained higher (p<0.05) for MA (post = 1635 µU*180 min/mL) than for NHW (post = 1211 µU*180 min/mL). Pre test plasma lipids were not different in MA compared to NHW. Plasma cholesterol and TG concentrations significantly improved in both groups, but concentrations of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and small dense LDL particles significantly improved only in the NHW. Conclusion With a short-term diet-exercise intervention, the magnitude of improvements in Si and serum cholesterol and TG in Hispanics are similar to those in NHW. However, because at the outset MA were less insulin sensitive compared to NHW, within the short timeframe studied the ethnic gap in insulin sensitivity remained."
https://openalex.org/W2031394951,MacroH2A1 is a histone H2A variant which contains a large non-histone C-terminal region of largely unknown function. Within this region is a macro domain which can bind ADP-ribose and related molecules. Most studies of macroH2A1 focus on the involvement of this variant in transcriptional repression. Studies in mouse embryos and in embryonic stem cells suggested that during early development macroH2A can be found at the centrosome. Centrosomal localization of macroH2A was later reported in somatic cells. Here we provide data showing that macroH2A1 does not localize to the centrosome and that the centrosomal signal observed with antibodies directed against the macroH2A1 non-histone region may be the result of antibody cross-reactivity.
