Later migrations, if any, are unlikely to have significantly changed the original genetic and cultural make-up While early Aborigines may have hunted extinct megafauna, the data do not support a rapid ""Pleistocene overkill"" hypothesis. Finally, aspects of Australian Aboriginal economy, especially plant utilization, and technology-the small tool tradition, ground stone hatchets and boomerangs-are of considerable antiquity and probably originated locally."
https://openalex.org/W2004520069,"The neutrino hypothesis, put forward by Pauli to account for the apparent loss of energy and momentum in beta decay, was verified by a series of measurements at a nuclear reactor nearly 25 years ago. An account is given of the first observations of the interaction of neutrinos in a target remote from the fission process that produced them. These experiments completed the observations of the particles involved in beta decay and paved the way for use of the free neutrino to probe the nature of the weak interaction."
