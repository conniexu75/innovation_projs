https://openalex.org/W1973774127,"Abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins (A68) are the building blocks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) paired helical filaments. The biological consequences of the conversion of normal adult tau to A68 remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that native A68 does not bind to microtubules (MTs), yet dephosphorylated A68 regains the ability to bind to MTs. Ser396 is phosphorylated in A68, but not in normal adult tau, whereas fetal tau is phosphorylated transiently at this site. Phosphorylation of tau at Ser396 by protein kinases in CHO cells and rat brain produces an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of A68. Using CHO cells transfected with an Ala396 mutant, we show that the phosphorylation of tau at Ser396 reduces its affinity for MTs and its ability to stabilize MTs against nocodazole-induced depolymerization. Our results demonstrate that the abnormal phosphorylation of tau in AD involves Ser396, and we suggest that this may be mediated by the inappropriate activation of fetal kinases or the reduced activity of tau protein phosphatases. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser396 may destabilize MTs in AD, resulting in the degeneration of affected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000518052,"In D. melanogaster a pulse of the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers the larval-to-adult metamorphosis, a complex process in which this hormone induces imaginal tissues to generate adult structures and larval tissues to degenerate. We show that the EcR gene encodes three ecdysone receptor isoforms (EcR-A, EcR-B1, and EcR-B2) that have common DNA- and hormone-binding domains but different N-terminal regions. We have used isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies to show that at the onset of metamorphosis different ecdysone target tissues express different isoform combinations in a manner consistent with the proposition that the different metamorphic responses of these tissues require different combinations of the EcR isoforms. We have also determined temporal developmental profiles of the EcR isoforms and their mRNAs in whole animals, showing that different isoforms predominate at different developmental stages that are marked by a pulse of ecdysone."
https://openalex.org/W1993222258,"Lamina-associated polypeptides (LAPs) 1A, 1B, 1C, and 2 are integral membrane proteins of the nuclear envelope associated with the nuclear lamina. Using in vitro assays, we show that LAPs 1A and 1B specifically bind to both lamins A and C and lamin B1, while LAP 2 associates only with lamin B1. LAP 2 also binds to mitotic chromosomes. The LAPs are phosphorylated during mitosis, and phosphorylation of LAP 2 by mitotic cytosol inhibits its binding to both lamin B1 and chromosomes. During late anaphase, LAP 2 associates with chromosomes prior to assembly of most lamins. Together, these data suggest that LAP 2 may have a key role in initial events of nuclear envelope reassembly, and that both LAP 2 and LAP 1 may be involved in attaching lamins to the nuclear envelope."

https://openalex.org/W2042322079,"The ability of P. syringae to elicit the hypersensitive response in nonhost plants or pathogenesis in hosts is controlled by hrp genes. The P. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrpZ gene encodes harpinPss, a 34.7 kd extracellular protein that elicits hypersensitive necrosis in tobacco and other plants. HarpinPss is heat stable, glycine rich, dissimilar in amino acid sequence to any known protein, produced only in apoplastic fluid-mimicking minimal media, and secreted in a HrpH-dependent manner. The carboxy-terminal 148 amino acid portion of harpinPss contains two directly repeated sequences of GGGLGTP and QTGT and is sufficient and necessary for elicitor activity. The necrosis elicited by harpinPss is an active response of the plant, which can be inhibited by alpha-amanitin, cycloheximide, lanthanum chloride, or sodium vanadate."

https://openalex.org/W2078578982,"We report genetic and biochemical evidence that the RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) interacts with a large multisubunit complex that contains TATA-binding protein (TBP) and is an integral part of the transcription initiation complex. The isolation and characterization of extragenic suppressors of S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II CTD truncation mutations led us to identify SRB2, SRB4, SRB5, and SRB6 as genes involved in CTD function in vivo. SRB2 was previously isolated and shown to encode a 23 kd TBP-binding protein. The four SRB proteins and a portion of cellular TBP are components of a high molecular weight multisubunit complex that is tightly bound to RNA polymerase II. This SRB-TBP complex binds specifically to recombinant CTD protein. In vitro transcription and template commitment assays confirm that SRB2 and SRB5 are components of a functional preinitiation complex and are required for efficient transcription initiation."

https://openalex.org/W1559821198,"Heme oxygenase-1 mRNA levels increase following exposure of many mammalian cell lines to oxidative stress such as ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation. Here we demonstrate a 4-fold increase in microsomal heme oxygenase activity and a 40% decrease in microsomal heme content 14 h after treatment of human skin fibroblasts (FEK4) with 250 kJ m-2 of UVA radiation. Paralleling this was a 2-fold increase in ferritin levels that was sustained for at least 46 h after UVA irradiation. Treatment of fibroblasts with the iron chelating agent desferrioxamine, after the UVA-dependent induction of heme oxygenase, prevented the increase in ferritin levels. Treatment of fibroblasts with Sn-protoporphyrin IX (an inhibitor of heme oxygenase) also prevented the effect of UVA radiation on ferritin levels. Thus we conclude that the effect of UVA radiation on ferritin levels is via the heme oxygenase-dependent release of iron from endogenous heme sources. We propose that the increase in ferritin that follows UVA irradiation would decrease intracellular free iron such that iron-catalyzed free radical reactions would be restricted during periods of subsequent oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W1550235641,"A small number of proteins becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. Previous work has identified two of these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as the focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. Here we identify a third focal adhesion protein, tensin, that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. The tyrosine phosphorylation of tensin does not occur when cells adhere to plastic or polylysine and is blocked when microfilament assembly and cell spreading are inhibited with cytochalasin D. In addition, we show that other focal adhesion proteins such as talin and vinculin do not become tyrosine-phosphorylated under the same conditions of cell spreading on extracellular matrix proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2110596072,"The fragile X syndrome is commonly associated with mutant alleles of the FMR1 gene that are hypermethylated and have large expansions of CGG repeats. We present data here on the replication timing of FMR1 that confirm predictions of delayed replication of alleles from affected males. The normal FMR1 allele replicates late in S phase, while alleles from affected males replicate later, the major peak of replication occurring in the flow cytometry fraction usually referred to as G2/M. The delayed timing of replication is not the direct result of a single replication fork stalling at the expanded CGG repeat, because delayed replication was observed for regions on both sides of the repeat. The domain of altered replication timing includes sites at least 150 kb 5' and 34 kb 3' of the repeat, indicating that genes in addition to FMR1 may be affected."

https://openalex.org/W2023132914,"A Purkinje cell-specific transgene, L7-IacZ, is expressed in a series of parasagitally oriented stripes in the mouse cerebellum. This banding pattern can be perturbed by promoter mutation, showing that a combination of positive and negative control elements contributes to the temporal and spatial map of L7 gene expression. In addition to the parasagittal stripes, certain mutations reveal Purkinje cells organized into compartments oriented in the transverse plane of the cerebellum. Transcription factors of the POU or homeobox families appear to be involved in controlling L7 expression in the transverse orientation. Strikingly, some of the domains of gene expression revealed by the mutations appear to correspond to functional compartments of Purkinje cells, thereby suggesting an underlying genetic principle used to orchestrate functional organization in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1996645650,"PRP16 encodes an RNA-dependent ATPase required for the second step of mRNA splicing in S. cerevisiae. We have isolated seven alleles of PRP16 that, like the original allele prp16-1, allow splicing of introns with a mutant branch site (UACUAAC to UACUACC), by forming lariat intermediates at the mutant C nucleotide. Every suppressor mutation maps to the region of PRP16 common to RNA-dependent ATPases. We purified three of the mutant proteins and found that all exhibit reduced ATPase activity, as does Prp16-1. An in vivo analysis of the steady-state levels of the splicing intermediates and products provides evidence for a pathway, under the genetic control of PRP16, to discard incorrectly branched substrates. We propose that decreasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis by Prp16 allows aberrantly formed lariat intermediates more time to proceed through the productive rather than the discard branch of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2072823072,"The primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether a rhodopsin-like gene, which has been postulated to represent the green cone pigment in several species, is in fact expressed in cone photoreceptors instead of rods. The expression patterns of rod opsin and blue and red cone opsins were also examined in both goldfish and zebrafish retinas using colorimetric in situ hybridization. The results demonstrate that the rhodopsin-like gene is expressed in green cones, as predicted. A subset of small cones that do not hybridize with these cRNA probes are tentatively identified as ultraviolet receptors. The results also demonstrate that opsin message in cones is restricted to the perinuclear region, whereas in rods, it is both perinuclear and adjacent to the ellipsoid."
https://openalex.org/W1589489693,"Most metabolic pathways are regulated by feedback inhibition/activation or by covalent modification of a regulatory enzyme. In erythrocytes, however, we demonstrate that glycolysis can be modulated over 30-fold by controlling the availability of glycolytic enzyme binding sites at the extreme N terminus of the anion transporter, band 3. Direct obstruction of these inhibitory sites by anti-peptide Fab's against residues 1-15 of band 3 promotes an approximately 3-fold increase in the rate of lactate production. In contrast, enrichment of the erythrocyte cytoplasm with the band 3 peptide against which the above antibodies were raised results in a more than 10-fold decrease in the rate of lactate accumulation. Control peptides and their derived antipeptide antibodies corresponding to other sequences of band 3 or glycophorin were found to have no effect on lactate production. Analysis of changes in glycolytic intermediates during Fab treatments suggests that hexokinase may be one enzyme that is modulated by association with band 3. We conclude that the extreme N terminus of band 3 can bind and inhibit glycolytic enzymes in vivo and that it probably participates in control of red cell glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1561116581,"Smooth muscle's stress equals that of skeletal muscle with less myosin. Thus, under isometric conditions, smooth muscle myosin may spend a greater fraction of its cycle time attached to actin in a high force state (i.e. higher duty cycle). If so, then smooth muscle myosin may also have a higher duty cycle under unloaded conditions. To test this, we used an in vitro motility assay in which fluorescently labeled actin filaments move freely over a sparsely coated (5-100 micrograms/ml) myosin surface. Actin filament velocity (V) was a function of the number of cross-bridges capable of interacting with an actin filament (N) and the duty cycle (f), V = (a x Vmax) x (1-(1-f)N) (Uyeda et al., 1990; Harada et al., 1990). N was estimated from the myosin density on the motility surface and the actin filament length. Data for V versus N were fit to the above equation to predict f. The duty cycle of smooth muscle myosin (4.0 +/- 0.7%) was not significantly different from that of skeletal muscle myosin (3.8 +/- 0.5%) in agreement with values estimated by Uyeda et al. (1990) for skeletal muscle myosin under unloaded conditions. The duty cycles of smooth and skeletal muscle myosin may still differ under isometric conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1980298497,"We have used an in vitro assay to identify sources of retinoic acid (RA) and transgenic mice to identify target domains in the developing forebrain. RA participates in a sequence of events that leads to the establishment of the olfactory pathway. First, the lateral cranial mesoderm activates an RA-inducible transgene in neuroepithelial cells in the olfactory placode and the ventrolateral forebrain. Then, neurons and neurites begin to differentiate in these two regions. Finally, olfactory axons grow specifically into the ventrolateral forebrain and subsequently are limited to the olfactory bulb rudiment. The coordination of these events, perhaps by common signals, implies that retinoid induction and retinoida-ctivated region-specific transcriptional regulation may help to define a forebrain subdivision and the peripheral neurons that provide its primary innervation."
https://openalex.org/W1531962736,"Exocytotic release of vesicular catecholamine from individual bovine adrenal medullary cells was detected with carbon fiber microelectrodes. Release was elicited from cells permeabilized with 20 microM digitonin in extracellular solutions of pH 5.5, 7.4, or 8.2, and with 100 microM nicotine at pH 7.4. Release detected amperometrically with a 6-microns radius electrode and 1-micron cell-electrode spacing was qualitatively similar for each pH and stimulus. However, amperometric detection with smaller electrodes (radius = 1 micron), cyclic voltammetry, or increased cell-electrode spacing with the larger electrode all resulted in a severe reduction in size and frequency of spikes detected at pH 5.5. Thus, the existence of a steep catecholamine concentration gradient at the cell surface is necessary to cause dissociation of the vesicular matrix at low extracellular pH. At an extracellular pH of 7.4, the distribution of amperometric spike widths measured with a 1-micron cell-electrode spacing was found to be inconsistent with that predicted for diffusional dispersion during transport from the cell surface to the electrode. Both of these results agree with the hypotheses that the chromaffin vesicle matrix normally exists in an aggregated state that can be dissociated by a chemical driving force. Some of the spikes exhibit a pre-spike feature. These were present more often following permeabilization in acidic pH as opposed to more alkaline solutions, and were most prevalent following exposure to nicotine at pH 7.4. The variability in the occurrence of the pre-spike feature suggests it originates from free catecholamine within the vesicle, since the molar fraction bound by the vesicular matrix is regulated by the pH-dependent conformation and Ca(2+)-dependent binding affinity of chromogranin A, a major protein in the vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1509786858,"A contiguous 3-kilobase pair region of DNA was isolated from Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) that can direct hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule biosynthesis in acapsular mutants as well as heterologous bacteria. The DNA was identified by transposon 916 insertional mutagenesis and subcloned into a plasmid shuttle vector. Mutant acapsular GAS or Enterococcus faecalis containing this plasmid, but not vector alone, displayed a mucoid phenotype on agar plates, possessed a capsule as seen by light microscopy, and produced HA in quantities comparable with wild-type GAS. The polysaccharide was shown to be authentic HA based on its recognition by a specific proteoglycan and its degradation by Streptomyces hyaluronate lyase. Escherichia coli with the complementing plasmid also produced HA but at only 10% of the level made by the above cells. E. coli minicell analysis showed that two proteins, 42 and 45 kDa, are expressed by the functional DNA insert. Deletion analysis of the insert in the minicells revealed that the 42-kDa protein is essential for HA production. This is the first demonstration of reconstitution of HA capsule biosynthesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501247761,"Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase has been purified from Escherichia coli and characterized as a homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of 66,000. The combination of UV visible absorption, EPR, magnetic circular dichroism, and resonance Raman spectroscopies indicates that the native enzyme contains a [4Fe-4S]2+,+ cluster, in contrast to spinach dihydroxy-acid dehydratase which contains a [2Fe-2S]2+,+ cluster (Flint, D. H., and Emptage, M. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3558-3564). In frozen solution, the reduced [4Fe-4S]+ cluster has a S = 3/2 ground state with minor contributions from forms with S = 1/2 and possibly S = 5/2 ground states. Resonance Raman studies of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase indicate non-cysteinyl coordination of a specific iron, which suggests that it is likely to be directly involved in catalysis as is the case with aconitase (Emptage, M. H., Kent, T. A., Kennedy, M. C., Beinert, H., and Munck, E. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 4674-4678). Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase from E. coli is inactivated by O2 in vitro and in vivo as a result of oxidative degradation of the [4Fe-4S]cluster. Compared to aconitase, the oxidized cluster of E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase appears to be less stable as either a cubic or linear [3Fe-4S] cluster or a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Oxidative degradation appears to lead to a complete breakdown of the Fe-S cluster, and the resulting protein cannot be reactivated with Fe2+ and thiol reducing agents."
https://openalex.org/W1632264659,"While the physiologic role of platelet microparticles may include a stable, physical dispersion of concentrated surface procoagulant activity the mechanism(s) of platelet vesiculation remains unknown. We demonstrate using flow cytometric methods a central role for the beta 3 integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex and its ligand tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) binding site in platelet vesiculation. Time- and calcium-dependent vesiculation of platelets in response to ADP, collagen, thrombin, phorbol myristate acetate, and the thrombin peptide SFLLRN were dramatically inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, by monoclonal antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa (A2A9, 7E3, PAC1) and RGDS. Complete inhibition with A2A9 and RGDS occurred at 7.5 micrograms/ml and 75 microM, respectively, while control antibodies and a mock peptide had no effect. Platelet vesiculation requires intact GPIIb-IIIa and is fully supported by the intracellular pool of GPIIb-IIIa alone since de-complexing of this heterodimer by calcium chelation completely abolished microparticle formation in response to collagen (no alpha-granule release) but not to thrombin or SFLLRN. A central role for GPIIb-IIIa is supported by the near total inability of Glanzmann's thrombasthenic (type I) platelets to vesiculate in response to thrombin, ADP, collagen, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This extends the biologic roles of GPIIb-IIIa to include platelet vesiculation and suggests that one or all of its binding ligands play a role."
https://openalex.org/W2089150766,"The distribution and levels of c-fos expression in response to changes in the light/dark cycle were examined in rat retina by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Under a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark cycle (LD 12:12), c-fos mRNA levels in the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer increased transiently for 30 min immediately following the onset of the light period, whereas in the outer nuclear layer, c-fos mRNA expression was observed throughout the dark period. During a period of extended darkness following the dark period of LD 12:12, c-fos mRNA levels in the outer nuclear layer remained cyclic--low during the day and higher during the night--suggesting an endogenously generated rhythm. Furthermore, since a 30 min pulse of light during the dark period decreased c-fos expression in the outer nuclear layer, whereas a similar pulse of darkness during the light period resulted in an increase, environmental light/dark cues are also suggested to influence c-fos gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1983978018,"The effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) on sympathetic axon growth were investigated by generating transgenic mice in which the beta subunit of NGF was expressed in sympathetic neurons using the human dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) promoter. In DBH-NGF mice, the sympathetic trunk and nerves growing to peripheral tissues were enlarged and contained an increased number of sympathetic fibers. Although sympathetic axons reached peripheral tissues, terminal sympathetic innervation within tissues was decreased in DBH-NGF mice. This effect could be reversed in the pancreas by overexpression of NGF in pancreatic islets. The observations are consistent with a model in which NGF gradients are not required to guide sympathetic axons to their targets, but are required for the establishment of the normal density and pattern of sympathetic innervation within target tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2102522743,"We have previously isolated glycopeptides derived from yeast invertase that acted as highly potent elicitors in suspension-cultured tomato cells, inducing ethylene biosynthesis and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, and we have found that the high mannose oligosaccharides released from the pure glycopeptide elicitors by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H acted as suppressors of elicitor activity (Basse, C. W., Bock, K., and Boller, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10258-10265). One of the elicitor-active glycopeptides (gp 8c) was labeled with t-butoxycarbonyl-L-[35S]methionine and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography resulting in a specific radioactivity of the derivative of about 900 Ci/mmol. This radiolabeled glycopeptide showed specific, saturable, and reversible binding to whole tomato cells under conditions in which cells are responsive to elicitors as well as to microsomal membranes derived from these cells. Ligand saturation experiments, performed with microsomal membranes, gave a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.3 nM as determined by Scatchard analysis. Various glycopeptide elicitors and preparations from yeast invertase were compared with respect to their abilities to compete for binding of 35S-labeled gp 8c to tomato membranes and to induce ethylene biosynthesis in tomato cells. These studies revealed a high degree of correlation between elicitor activities in vivo and displacement activities in vitro. In both tests, a high activity depended on the presence of glycan side chains consisting of more than 8 mannosyl residues. The high mannose oligosaccharides that acted as suppressors of elicitor activity in vivo competed for binding of the labeled elicitor also. The suppressor-active glycan Man11GlcNAc and the elicitor-active gp 8c exhibited very similar displacement activities, and the inhibitory constant (Ki) of the glycan Man11GlcNAc was very similar to the Kd value calculated for 35S-labeled gp 8c, indicating that the glycopeptide elicitors and the glycan suppressors derived from these elicitors competed with similar affinities for the same binding site. The suppressor-inactive glycan Man8GlcNAc had a 200-fold lower capacity to compete for binding of 35S-labeled gp 8c to tomato membranes compared with the suppressor-active glycan Man11GlcNAc. Our results demonstrate the existence of a specific elicitor binding site in tomato cell membranes and suggest that glycopeptides and glycans act as agonists and antagonists for induction of the stress response, respectively, by competing for this binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1998961405,"We have investigated the impact of stochastic transmission on the input-output relations of neurons in hippocampal slices. A synaptic input that fires a cell has a significant trial-to-trial variability in amplitude, reflecting the probabilistic release of transmitter. By measuring miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, we estimate that synchronous release of a few vesicles can fire a CA1 cell. The firing threshold and variability can be physiologically modulated. Different cell types have distinct firing thresholds and variabil ities. Long-term potentiation (LTP) decreases trial-to-trial variability. If after LTP, the stimulus is reduced to produce a threshold response, the variability returns to that observed before LTP. Thus, for a threshold input, the trial-to-trial variability is maintained with LTP. This may be important for the proper functioning of a plastic nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1991840178,"CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) identify virally infected cells by recognizing processed viral antigen in association with class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on infected cells. Processing begins in the cytosol with the generation of peptides, possibly by a protease complex with MHC-encoded subunits, known as the proteasome. Transport of the resulting cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for association with class I molecules is essential and probably involves a heterodimer of the MHC-encoded proteins, Tap-1 and Tap-2. The site of processing of viral envelope proteins is uncertain. These proteins are not present in the cytosol because of cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. We show here that the HIV-1 envelope (env) protein is processed in infected cells by a novel Tap-1/Tap-2-independent pathway that seems to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2066104607,"Opsin expression is extremely suppressed by carotenoid deprivation in Drosophila. Carotenoid replacement in deprived flies promotes the recovery of visual pigment with an increase in opsin, as well as the chromophore 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal. Here, we show that opsin mRNA and opsin peptide in an intermediate step of posttranslational processing were present in carotenoiddeprived flies. By supplementing chromophore to photoreceptor cells, intermediate opsin was made mature. During this process, opsin peptide underwent multiple modifications involving glycosylation. Based on these results, we present a novel mechanism of protein regulatory expression; that is, chromophore posttranslationally controls the expression of apoprotein by promoting its maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1585424001,"A fully active form of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase from Nitrosomonas has been purified with high recovery and shown by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and N-terminal analysis to contain only a 63-kDa subunit and to lack the 11-kDa protein previously thought to be a second subunit. Based on the previously published values of molecular weight in solution, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase probably has an alpha 2 or alpha 3 oligomeric structure. The enzyme was digested separately with trypsin and chymotrypsin and peptides which contained covalently bound heme were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and their amino acid sequences determined. A total of seven heme-containing peptides of unique amino acid sequence were obtained. Six of these heme-containing peptides clearly contained a single c-heme with optical properties indistinguishable from the tryptic heme-containing peptide from horse heart cytochrome c. No noncovalently bound heme was observed. One of the seven heme-containing peptides (T7) was unusual in that it released 2 amino acid residues after each cycle of the Edman degradation due to a nondisulfide cross-link and exhibited a Soret band that was broadened in both the ferric form at neutral pH and the pyridine ferrohemochrome. Subdigestion of peptide T7 with nonspecific proteases (Pronase, bromelain, or pepsin) resulted in the isolation of two smaller heme-containing peptides of unique sequences. One of these was spectrally identical to the other c-heme containing peptides, whereas the second was still apparently cross-linked, again releasing 2 amino acid residues after each Edman cycle. This second peptide possessed a heme-like chromophore with absorption bands (Soret, alpha and beta) red-shifted about 6 nm relative to the spectrum of c-heme-containing peptides. Thus, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase contains a total of eight covalently bound hemes per subunit, seven of which are c-hemes. The eighth, which is attached to a cross-linked peptide, is probably the unusual P460 heme which is unique to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and thought to be at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1582713327,"The biogenesis of glycogen involves a specific initiation event mediated by the initiator protein, glycogenin, which undergoes self-glucosylation to generate an oligosaccharide primer from which the glycogen molecule grows. Rabbit muscle glycogenin was expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and purified close to homogeneity in a procedure that involved binding to a UDP-agarose affinity column. The resulting protein had subunit molecular weight of 38,000 as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Analysis of peptide fragments by mass spectroscopy indicated that the recombinant glycogenin was already glucosylated at Tyr-194 and contained from 1 to 8 glucose residues attached. The enzyme was active as a glucosyl transferase and could incorporate a further approximately 5 mol of glucose/mol. The apparent Km for the glucosyl donor UDP-glucose was 4.5 microM, and the pH optimum was pH 8. Of a number of nucleotides and related compounds surveyed, UDP and UTP were the most effective inhibitors. There was also a correlation between inhibition and the presence of a pyrophosphate group. Of several oligosaccharides of glucose, only maltose caused significant inhibition. The glucosylation reaction was first order with respect to glycogenin suggesting that it was intramolecular. The efficacy of the purified glycogenin as a substrate for the elongation reaction catalyzed by glycogen synthase was significantly enhanced if glycogenin was first allowed to undergo self-glucosylation. The length of the priming oligosaccharide is thus important for glycogen synthase action. A mutant of glycogenin, in which Tyr-194 was changed to Phe, behaved identically to the wild-type through purification and in particular bound to the UDP-agarose affinity matrix. Despite these indications of the protein's overall structural integrity, it was unable to self-glucosylate. This result indicates that Tyr-194 is necessary for glycogenin function and is consistent with Tyr-194 being the sole site of glucosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1635573697,"Turkey ovomucoid third domain with Leu18 in its reactive site is a potent inhibitor of many serine proteinases: subtilisins, chymotrypsins, and elastases. Previous studies showed that an L18K mutation made it a moderately strong inhibitor of trypsin, while an L18E mutation made it a strong inhibitor of Glu-specific Streptomyces griseus proteinase (GluSGP). For human furin substrates the consensus optimal sequence is RXKR decreases. Therefore the A15R, T17K, and L18R mutations were made in turkey ovomucoid third domain. The mutant inhibits human furin with a Ka of 1.1 x 10(7) M-1. As human furin catalyzes an obligatory step in human immunodeficiency virus proliferation, this inhibitor, along with the others already available, deserves further study."
https://openalex.org/W1529237785,"Abstract The hemes of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) have been analyzed optically by potentiometric titrations using a low volume optically transparent thin layer electrochemical cell. The electrochemical behavior of the HAO monomeric unit has been interpreted by modeling the spectroelectrochemical data at several wavelengths to eight one-electron Nernst sites: seven c-type hemes and one P460 heme. Of the seven c-hemes, six show alpha-bands with absorption maxima at or near 553 nm. One c-heme has an alpha-band absorption maximum at 559 nm. The six c-553 hemes have midpoint potentials at pH 7.0 of +288, -10, -162, -192, -265 and -412 mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The c-559 heme has a midpoint potential (Em') at pH 7.0 of +11 mV versus NHE. The midpoint potential of the P460 heme is at -260 mV versus NHE at pH 7.0. In contrast, the midpoint potential for the P460 heme in another protein, cytochrome P460, from the same organism is -402 mV versus NHE at pH 7.0. Midpoint potentials of the c-hemes show little, if any, pH dependence over the range of pH 6-8. In contrast, Em' for the P460 heme changes with a slope of -60 mV/pH unit over the same range. Electrochemical isolation of the P460 heme at pH 8.0 led to the discovery of a broad spectroscopic feature centered near 740 nm that was assigned to the oxidized P460 heme. Changes in the spectroelectrochemical behavior of HAO after inactivation by H2O2 was almost exclusively restricted to the P460 heme of HAO. Both the 464-nm absorption band of the reduced P460 heme and the 740-nm band of the oxidized heme were no longer present. For the c-hemes, the only effect seems to be a slight shift in Em' for a single c-553 heme from -162 to -135 mV."
https://openalex.org/W1511624316,"Recent studies indicate that insulin and insulin-like growth factors regulate development of the nervous system. The signal transduction pathways that mediate the neurotrophic responses to these peptides are largely unknown. The aims of this study were to examine the regulation of c-fos mRNA expression by insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in postmitotic neurons derived from fetal chick forebrain and to investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in c-fos induction by these growth factors. Cultured neurons were treated with growth factors or other known activators of c-fos gene expression, and then total cellular RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern analysis using a full-length mouse c-fos cDNA probe. Fetal calf serum, insulin, IGF-I, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol (TPA), and cycloheximide induced a 2.2-kilobase c-fos transcript in neurons. Increased levels of c-fos mRNA were apparent as early as 15 min after the addition of insulin. Levels peaked after 60 min and then remained high up to 180 min. The onset of c-fos induction by IGF-I was similar to insulin; however, the response was more transient. Analyses of dose-response curves indicate that insulin and IGF-I stimulate c-fos expression by interacting with their own receptor type. The decay rate of c-fos mRNA was unaltered by insulin or IGF-I. Pretreatment of neurons with actinomycin D (2 microM) for 5 min prior to the addition of insulin completely blocked the induction of c-fos mRNA. TPA increased c-fos mRNA levels with similar kinetics to that of insulin and IGF-I; however, the attenuation phase more closely paralleled that of insulin. Two inhibitors of PKC, sphingosine and staurosporine, completely blocked the induction of c-fos mRNA by insulin, IGF-I, and TPA. These data indicate that insulin and IGF-I stimulate transcription of the c-fos gene in neurons by a PKC-mediated pathway. Increased AP-1 activity may mediate some of the neurotrophic responses to insulin and IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W1504811083,"Translation initiation factor eIF-5A (formerly called eIF-4D) is a small, highly conserved protein in eukaryotic cells that undergoes a unique modification at one of its lysine residues to form hypusine. eIF-5A stimulates in vitro the synthesis of methionyl-puromycin, a model reaction for formation of the first peptide bond. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF-5A is encoded by two highly homologous genes, TIF51A and TIF51B, and each gene gives rise to two hypusinated isoelectric variants, eIF-5Aa (more acidic) and eIF-5Ab (more basic). In order to study the structural and functional differences between the two isoforms, both isoelectric forms were purified from a yeast strain overexpressing TIF51A and were shown to stimulate identically the synthesis of methionyl-puromycin in a heterologous mammalian assay system. Pulse-chase labeling of yeast cells with [35S]methionine showed that the basic form, eIF-5Ab, is a precursor form of the acidic form, eIF-5Aa. Immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled cell lysates with rabbit antibodies specific for yeast eIF-5A, phosphoprotein phosphatase treatment of eIF-5Aa, and phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that eIF-5Aa is generated by phosphorylation of eIF-5Ab on serine. Therefore eIF-5A undergoes two post-translational modifications, hypusination and phosphorylation, where the activity of the factor is dependent on the first but is not influenced in vitro by the second."
https://openalex.org/W1588919755,"Low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins encoded by the Rab gene family are posttranslationally modified by a specific geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase II), which catalyzes the thioether linkage of geranylgeranyl isoprenoids to cysteines within one of the following carboxyl-terminal sequence motifs: GGCC, CXC, CCSN. Short peptides containing these sequences are poor substrates for isoprenylation in vitro, suggesting that structural domains remote from the carboxyl terminus are required for interactions between Rab proteins and GGTase II. To begin to define these domains, deletions and point mutations were created within the Rab1B gene, and the ability of the mutant translation products to undergo isoprenylation was evaluated in reticulocyte lysates. Deletion of amino acids 2-9 diminished but did not eliminate isoprenylation of Rab1B, suggesting that the extreme amino-terminal region is not absolutely required for interaction with GGTase II. Longer deletions in the amino-terminal region, which probably disrupt the overall conformation of Rab1B, completely prevented isoprenylation. Site-directed mutations predicted to lie in the amino-terminal variable region (Y5N), the beta 3 strand (Q60E), and Loop 7 (A110D) of the Rab1B structure did not reduce isoprenylation. However, two mutations (I41N, D44N) in the effector domain, which appears to mediate interactions with proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis or GDP dissociation, essentially abolished the ability of Rab1B to undergo isoprenylation. These findings imply that the effector domain plays a key role in the isoprenylation of Rab proteins, either by serving as a prenyltransferase binding site or by facilitating interactions with accessory proteins that allow Rab1B to assume a specific guanine nucleotide-dependent conformation that is recognized by GGTase II."
https://openalex.org/W1482621800,"Spectrin, a heterodimer composed of alpha and beta subunits, interacts with itself head-to-head to form tetramers in the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton. The NH2-terminal region of alpha-spectrin, encompassing the alpha I 80-kDa domain, was expressed in Escherichia coli. In addition to the correctly initiated polypeptide, four smaller polypeptides were produced by initiation at internal codons. Only the full-length polypeptide was able to bind to spectrin dimers, beta monomers, and to a recombinant polypeptide containing the COOH terminus of beta-spectrin. The head-to-head interaction with beta-spectrin was also retained by a recombinant polypeptide containing the NH2-terminal 158 amino acids of the alpha subunit. Deletion of the first 27 or 49 NH2-terminal amino acids abolished binding of this polypeptide to the beta monomer. The phasing used to design these recombinant polypeptides was based on a conformational model recently refined by Speicher et al. (Speicher, D. W., DeSilva, T. M., Speicher, K. D., Ursitti, J. A., Hembach, P., and Weglarz, L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4227-4235), where the structural unit begins and terminates around residue 30 of the repeat unit. The binding properties, mobility on gel filtration, and circular dichroism data of the recombinant polypeptides indicated that most polypeptides were able to assume their native conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1483314214,"Microsomal cytochromes P-450 are known to be integrated into smooth endoplasmic reticulum through their hydrophobic sequences located at the N termini. The length requirement of the membrane insertion signal was determined by the generation of six plasmids encoding mutant P450c21 that lacked various portions of the N-terminal hydrophobic domains. When they were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of endoplasmic reticulum membranes, mutant protein lacking more than a third of the first hydrophobic domain gradually lost the ability to insert into the membrane and stayed mostly in the soluble fraction when the first N-terminal hydrophobic domain was removed. The steady-state amount of the truncated proteins was progressively reduced in parallel to the extent of their N-terminal deletions, due to their fast degradation. This process was accompanied by a decrease in the enzymatic activity. Therefore, the first hydrophobic domain of P450c21 not only serves as a membrane targeting and anchoring domain, but it is also important for the in vivo protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1577715258,"Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation of glycogen synthesis. Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogenin, transiently expressed in COS cells, was found exclusively in the low speed supernatant fraction, with M(r) 37-38,000. The protein was capable of self-glucosylation and was, if suitably primed, an effective substrate for glycogen synthase. Rabbit muscle glycogen synthase was similarly expressed, to a level 7-10-fold over the endogenous activity. Most of the expressed protein was found in the low speed pellet fraction. However, when co-expressed with glycogenin, a significant increase in the proportion of glycogen synthase in the soluble fraction was observed. Therefore, glycogenin interacts with glycogen synthase in the cell and redistributes the synthase to the soluble fraction. Co-expression of an inactive form of glycogenin did not affect glycogen synthase localization. The expressed glycogenin could be detected as two distinguishable species, differing slightly in electrophoretic mobility, depending on the glucose concentration of the cell culture medium. At 25 mM glucose, a form of M(r) 38,000 was observed; however, upon transfer to 5 mM glucose, it converted to a species of slightly lower M(r). The M(r) of the 38,000-dalton species could be also be reduced by treatment of the cell extract with alpha-amylase. It was additionally found that the 38,000-dalton glycogenin was a much more effective glycogen synthase substrate than the lower M(r) species. These results, therefore, raise the possibility of a novel mechanism for the control of glycogen metabolism in which glucose levels would regulate the glucosylation state of glycogenin, which in turn would determine glycogenin's efficacy as a substrate for elongation by glycogen synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1597810998,"The replication-dependent histone genes encode mRNAs that are expressed during S phase. When DNA synthesis ceases, histone mRNAs are rapidly degraded via the activation of a specific mRNA destabilization process. It has been proposed that this process is autoregulated by histone proteins and is triggered by an increase in the abundance of cytoplasmic histones that accompanies the cessation of DNA synthesis. Consistent with this proposal, all four core histones, in conjunction with cytosol, specifically trigger a 3-4-fold destabilization of polysome-associated histone mRNA in cell-free extracts. Here, we show that each individual purified core histone or purified linker histone H1 can autoregulate (destabilize) histone mRNA in vitro. Three basic polypeptides, protamines, poly-L-lysine, and poly-L-arginine, accelerate an early step in the decay pathway but do not fully autoregulate the mRNA. These data suggest that histones function by overcoming a holdup point at an early step in histone mRNA degradation and that unique properties of histones, aside from their basic domains, are necessary to trigger autoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1525196319,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) dissociates the multimeric protein, carmin, into its monomers (2 S) at low concentration. Dissociation begins at and above 1.6 mM SDS concentration and reaches 50% at 5 mM SDS concentration. Denaturation occurs above 5 mM SDS concentration. The dissociation step involves binding of 540 +/- 50 mol of SDS/mol of protein with an association constant, K alpha of 6.90 +/- 0.35 x 10(2) M-1. The interaction reflects a delta G(0) = -4.0 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1. In the denaturation step, the K alpha has the same value, and the gamma value is nearly 2-fold higher. Dissociation of carmin thus begins only above a binding of 0.60 g of SDS/g of protein. Analysis of the binding data at 37 degrees C indicates a maximum of 1030 +/- 90 mol of SDS bound/mol of protein, which is equivalent to 1.14 +/- 0.10 g of SDS/g of protein. Upon denaturation, the alpha-helix content of the protein increases from 4 to 15%. Kinetically, the denaturation process consists of a two-step process (a fast and a slow step). The first order rate constants for these steps are 89.6 +/- 8.1 and 15.8 +/- 1.5 min-1, respectively, at 6.3 mM SDS concentration. The processes of dissociation and denaturation occur sequentially. Dissociation of the protein is reversible, whereas the process of denaturation is only partially reversible as reflected by sedimentation velocity and conformational analysis. These data are taken as a model for general understanding of the dissociation and/or denaturation processes, which could be either sequential or simultaneous in multimeric proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1503791834,"Upon excitation by 280 nm, the intensity decay of the 2 tyrosine residues (residues 10 and 109) of rabbit skeletal muscle troponin C is resolved into three components. The anisotropy decay in the absence of divalent cation is biphasic with a short correlation time of 0.67 ns and a long correlation time of 9.23 ns. The limiting anisotropy is 0.225, considerably lower than the value expected for immobilized tyrosine. Upon excitation by 290 nm, the anisotropy decay is also biphasic, and the limiting anisotropy increases to 0.274. The recovery of anisotropy by excitation at a wave-length near the red edge of the tyrosine absorption spectrum is evidence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two tyrosines. For energy transfer to occur, the average separation between the 2 tyrosines is unlikely much larger than the Forster distance Ro, congruent to 10 A, and this close proximity of the residues would require a highly distorted dumbbell shape of troponin C in solution. These results are consistent with a flexible central helix, which either has a segmental flexibility with large amplitude or results in a spectrum of conformations including those in which the two globular domains are in a very close proximity."
https://openalex.org/W1527459932,"After incorporation of the purified Na(+)-translocating F0F1-ATPase from Propionigenium modestum into preformed phospholipid vesicles the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate could be observed under conditions where a valinomycin-mediated K+ diffusion potential (delta psi) and/or a Na+ concentration gradient (delta pNa) were imposed. This reaction was not inhibited by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-tri-fluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Furthermore, the delta pNa-driven ATP synthesis was stimulated by FCCP. In contrast, the addition of the Na+/H+ antiporter monensin or of the F0F1 inhibitors N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and venturicidin abolished the synthesis of ATP completely. Finally, delta pNa alone was able to elicit ATP synthesis, when a Na+ concentration gradient of sufficient magnitude was applied. In this case ATP synthesis occurred above a threshold level of approximately 120 mV and, furthermore, delta psi and delta pNa appear to be equivalent as driving forces for this process. Therefore, the data provide firm evidence for the concept that deltamu Na+ is the primary driving force for the synthesis of ATP in P. modestum."
