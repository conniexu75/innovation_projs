https://openalex.org/W2061616850,"Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a globally important crop, accounting for 20 per cent of the calories consumed by humans. Major efforts are underway worldwide to increase wheat production by extending genetic diversity and analysing key traits, and genomic resources can accelerate progress. But so far the very large size and polyploid complexity of the bread wheat genome have been substantial barriers to genome analysis. Here we report the sequencing of its large, 17-gigabase-pair, hexaploid genome using 454 pyrosequencing, and comparison of this with the sequences of diploid ancestral and progenitor genomes. We identified between 94,000 and 96,000 genes, and assigned two-thirds to the three component genomes (A, B and D) of hexaploid wheat. High-resolution synteny maps identified many small disruptions to conserved gene order. We show that the hexaploid genome is highly dynamic, with significant loss of gene family members on polyploidization and domestication, and an abundance of gene fragments. Several classes of genes involved in energy harvesting, metabolism and growth are among expanded gene families that could be associated with crop productivity. Our analyses, coupled with the identification of extensive genetic variation, provide a resource for accelerating gene discovery and improving this major crop. Sequencing of the hexaploid bread wheat genome shows that it is highly dynamic, with significant loss of gene family members on polyploidization and domestication, and an abundance of gene fragments. Two groups in this issue report the compilation and analysis of the genome sequences of major cereal crops — bread wheat and barley — providing important resources for future crop improvement. Bread wheat accounts for one-fifth of the calories consumed by humankind. It has a very large and complex hexaploid genome of 17 Gigabases. Michael Bevan and colleagues have analysed the genome using 454 pyrosequencing and compared it with diploid ancestral and progenitor genomes. The authors discovered significant loss of gene family members upon polyploidization and domestication, and expansion of gene classes that may be associated with crop productivity. Barley is one of the earliest domesticated plant crops. Although diploid, it has a very large genome of 5.1 Gigabases. Nils Stein and colleagues describe a physical map anchored to a high-resolution genetic map, on top of which they have overlaid a deep whole-genome shotgun assembly, cDNA and RNA-seq data to provide the first in-depth genome-wide survey of the barley genome."
https://openalex.org/W2017723918,"All massive galaxies likely have supermassive black holes at their centers, and the masses of the black holes are known to correlate with properties of the host galaxy bulge component. Several explanations have been proposed for the existence of these locally-established empirical relationships; they include the non-causal, statistical process of galaxy-galaxy merging, direct feedback between the black hole and its host galaxy, or galaxy-galaxy merging and the subsequent violent relaxation and dissipation. The empirical scaling relations are thus important for distinguishing between various theoretical models of galaxy evolution, and they further form the basis for all black hole mass measurements at large distances. In particular, observations have shown that the mass of the black hole is typically 0.1% of the stellar bulge mass of the galaxy. The small galaxy NGC4486B currently has the largest published fraction of its mass in a black hole at 11%. Here we report observations of the stellar kinematics of NGC 1277, which is a compact, disky galaxy with a mass of 1.2 x 10^11 Msun. From the data, we determine that the mass of the central black hole is 1.7 x 10^10 Msun, or 59% its bulge mass. Five other compact galaxies have properties similar to NGC 1277 and therefore may also contain over-sized black holes. It is not yet known if these galaxies represent a tail of a distribution, or if disk-dominated galaxies fail to follow the normal black hole mass scaling relations."
https://openalex.org/W2084284467,"The genome of the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis encodes three potential diadenylate cyclases that may synthesize the signaling nucleotide cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP). These enzymes are expressed under different conditions in different cell compartments, and they localize to distinct positions in the cell. Here we demonstrate the diadenylate cyclase activity of the so far uncharacterized enzymes CdaA (previously known as YbbP) and CdaS (YojJ). Our work confirms that c-di-AMP is essential for the growth of B. subtilis and shows that an excess of the molecule is also harmful for the bacteria. Several lines of evidence suggest that the diadenylate cyclase CdaA is part of the conserved essential cda-glm module involved in cell wall metabolism. In contrast, the CdaS enzyme seems to provide c-di-AMP for spores. Accumulation of large amounts of c-di-AMP impairs the growth of B. subtilis and results in the formation of aberrant curly cells. This phenotype can be partially suppressed by elevated concentrations of magnesium. These observations suggest that c-di-AMP interferes with the peptidoglycan synthesis machinery. The activity of the diadenylate cyclases is controlled by distinct molecular mechanisms. CdaA is stimulated by a regulatory interaction with the CdaR (YbbR) protein. In contrast, the activity of CdaS seems to be intrinsically restricted, and a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to drastically increase the activity of the enzyme. Taken together, our results support the idea of an important role for c-di-AMP in B. subtilis and suggest that the levels of the nucleotide have to be tightly controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2102471792,"Lymphedema is a dreaded complication of cancer treatment. However, despite the fact that >5 million Americans are affected by this disorder, the development of effective treatments is limited by the fact that the pathology of lymphedema remains unknown. The purpose of these studies was to determine the role of inflammatory responses in lymphedema pathology. Using mouse models of lymphedema, as well as clinical lymphedema specimens, we show that lymphatic stasis results in a CD4 T-cell inflammation and T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation. Using mice deficient in T cells or CD4 cells, we show that this inflammatory response is necessary for the pathological changes of lymphedema, including fibrosis, adipose deposition, and lymphatic dysfunction. Further, we show that inhibition of Th2 differentiation using interleukin-4 (IL-4) or IL-13 blockade prevents initiation and progression of lymphedema by decreasing tissue fibrosis and significantly improving lymphatic function, independent of lymphangiogenic growth factors. We show that CD4 inflammation is a critical regulator of tissue fibrosis and lymphatic dysfunction in lymphedema and that inhibition of Th2 differentiation markedly improves lymphatic function independent of lymphangiogenic cytokine expression. Notably, preventing and/or reversing the development of pathological tissue changes that occur in lymphedema may be a viable treatment strategy for this disorder."

https://openalex.org/W1984962612,"In this work, we investigate the conduction properties of strongly interacting fermions flowing through a quasi two-dimensional, multimode channel, which connects two atomic reservoirs. The atomic current in the channel is controlled using a repulsive potential created by an off-resonant laser beam. In analogy with an electronic field-effect transistor, this gate potential controls the chemical potential in the channel while keeping the temperature imposed by the reservoirs unchanged. With the gate potential as a control parameter, we measure the current through the channel over a large dynamic range and determine the density distribution in the channel region. This allows us to observe the onset of superfluid flow of strongly interacting fermions. These measurements are compared to the case of a weakly interacting Fermi gas."
https://openalex.org/W2102995273,"Germline transgenesis is an important procedure for functional investigation of biological pathways, as well as for animal biotechnology. We have established a simple, nonviral protocol in three important biomedical model organisms frequently used in physiological studies. The protocol is based on the hyperactive Sleeping Beauty transposon system, SB100X, which reproducibly promoted generation of transgenic founders at frequencies of 50–64, 14–72, and 15% in mice, rats, and rabbits, respectively. The SB100X-mediated transgene integrations are less prone to genetic mosaicism and gene silencing as compared to either the classical pronuclear injection or to lentivirus-mediated transgenesis. The method was successfully applied to a variety of transgenes and animal models, and can be used to generate founders with single-copy integrations. The transposon vector also allows the generation of transgenic lines with tissue-specific expression patterns specified by promoter elements of choice, exemplified by a rat reporter strain useful for tracking serotonergic neurons. As a proof of principle, we rescued an inborn genetic defect in the fawn-hooded hypertensive rat by SB100X transgenesis. A side-by-side comparison of the SB100X- and piggyBac-based protocols revealed that the two systems are complementary, offering new opportunities in genome manipulation.—Katter, K., Geurts, A.

https://openalex.org/W2051429168,"The biosynthesis of nonribosomally formed peptides (NRPs), which include important antibiotics such as vancomycin, requires the activation of amino acids through adenylate formation. The biosynthetic gene clusters of NRPs frequently contain genes for small, so-called MbtH-like proteins. Recently, it was discovered that these MbtH-like proteins are required for some of the adenylation reactions in NRP biosynthesis, but the mechanism of their interaction with the adenylating enzymes has remained unknown. In this study, we determined the structure of SlgN1, a 3-methylaspartate-adenylating enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the hybrid polyketide/NRP antibiotic streptolydigin.

Significance: MbtH-like proteins activate adenylating enzymes but make no direct contact with their substrates. SlgN1 is a 3-methylaspartate-adenylating enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic streptolydigin (Fig. 1). SlgN1 contains an MbtH-like domain at its N terminus. The so-called MbtH-like proteins comprise about 70 amino acids and are frequently found in the biosynthetic gene clusters of nonribosomally formed peptides (e.g. of the antibiotic vancomycin), siderophores, glycopeptidolipids, and aminocoumarin antibiotics (1Baltz R.H.

To date, GenBankTM contains more than 600 genes for MbtH-like proteins, all of which belong to the kingdom of eubacteria. The function of MbtH-like proteins has long been enigmatic. Inactivation experiments demonstrated that MbtH-like proteins are essential for the biosynthesis of certain secondary metabolites and that different MbtH-like proteins can functionally replace each other (3Wolpert M.

Only recently, several biochemical studies showed that MbtH-like proteins interact with adenylating enzymes and are required for the activation of amino acids, especially in nonribosomal peptide formation (6Imker H.J.

MbtH-like proteins form stable 1:1 complexes with these adenylating enzymes (11Boll B. Taubitz T. Heide L.

Chem. 2011; 286: 36281-36290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism in which MbtH-like proteins contribute to the adenylation reaction is still unknown. Nonribosomal peptides are formed by large modular enzymes containing several adenylation domains (A-domains), each of which catalyzes the activation of a specific amino acid. Surprisingly, within a single nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), 3The abbreviations used are: NRPSnonribosomal peptide synthetasePCPpeptidyl carrier proteinAMPcPPadenosine 5′-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphater.m.s.d.root mean square deviationPDBProtein Data Bank. some of the A-domains are dependent on MbtH-like proteins for their activity, whereas others are not (7Felnagle E.A. Barkei J.J. Park H. Podevels A.M. McMahon M.D. Drott D.W. Thomas M.G. MbtH-like proteins as integral components of bacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetases.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 8815-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The biochemical reason for this difference is not clear. Some gene clusters that code for the active biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides do not contain any mbtH-like gene at all (1Baltz R.H. Function of MbtH homologs in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis and applications in secondary metabolite discovery.J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 38: 1747-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two tyrosine-adenylating enzymes of aminocoumarin antibiotic biosynthesis, NovH and CloH, show 83% sequence identity and even 100% identity in the amino acids, which are expected to interact with the substrates. Yet, NovH and CloH differ markedly in their requirement for MbtH-like proteins (11Boll B. Taubitz T. Heide L.

The adenylating enzymes that interact with MbtH-like proteins belong to the ANL superfamily (12Gulick A.M. Conformational dynamics in the Acyl-CoA synthetases, adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which includes the Acyl-CoA synthetases, the NRPS adenylation domains, and the Luciferase enzymes. Enzymes of the ANL superfamily catalyze first the adenylation of a carboxylate to form an acyl-AMP intermediate, followed by a second half-reaction, which is most commonly the formation of a thioester. Structural investigations showed that ANL superfamily enzymes alternate between two conformations during catalysis of the two half-reactions. After the initial adenylation step, the C-terminal part (hereafter called Asub domain) rotates by ∼140° to adopt a second conformation for thioester formation (13Reger A.S. Wu R. Dunaway-Mariano D. Gulick A.M. Structural characterization of a 140 degrees domain movement in the two-step reaction catalyzed by 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8016-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, crystallization of these conformationally flexible enzymes has been challenging, but several structures are available (12Gulick A.M. Conformational dynamics in the Acyl-CoA synthetases, adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Notably, the crystallization of a bacterial fatty acid-adenylating enzyme succeeded only after the C-terminal Asub domain (comprising 120 amino acids) was removed from the N-terminal part, which is hereafter called the Acore domain (comprising 400 amino acids) (14Goyal A. Yousuf M. Rajakumara E. Arora P. Gokhale R.S. Sankaranarayanan R.

Sankaranarayanan R. Gokhale R.S. Mechanistic and functional insights into fatty acid activation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, the activated amino acid is transferred to the phosphopantetheinyl cofactor of a peptidyl carrier domain (PCP domain). The PCP domain is usually linked to the C terminus of the Asub domain but can also form a separate protein (12Gulick A.M. Conformational dynamics in the Acyl-CoA synthetases, adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). PCP domains are dynamic and can adopt multiple conformations (12Gulick A.M. Conformational dynamics in the Acyl-CoA synthetases, adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and also the phosphopantetheinyl cofactor is highly flexible. Structures of two isolated MbtH-like proteins revealed the overall fold of this domain (16Drake E.J. Cao J. Qu J. Shah M.B. Straubinger R.M. Gulick A.M. The 1.8 Å crystal structure of PA2412, an MbtH-like protein from the pyoverdine cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

Solution structure of Rv2377c-founding member of the MbtH-like protein family.Tuberculosis. 2010; 90: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, because structural information of an MbtH-like protein bound to an adenylating enzyme has been lacking, it has not been clear how the two proteins interact and what role this interaction may play in substrate binding and catalysis. To advance such an understanding, we undertook a structure-function analysis of such a complex. In most cases, MbtH-like proteins are separate proteins, but in a few cases, they are fused to the adenylation domain in a single polypeptide chain (1Baltz R.H. Function of MbtH homologs in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis and applications in secondary metabolite discovery.J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 38: 1747-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To facilitate the crystallization of a complex, we searched in the database for fusion proteins that contain both an MbtH-like protein and an adenylating enzyme. SlgN1, which is encoded in the streptolydigin biosynthetic gene cluster, contains an MbtH-like and an adenylation domain. In the biosynthesis of the hybrid polyketide/nonribosomal peptide streptolydigin, SlgN1 is predicted to catalyze the adenylation of 3-methylaspartate; subsequently, the 3-methylaspartyl residue is transferred to the PCP domain of SlgN2 (Fig. 1) (18Horna D.H.

Tailoring modification of 3-methyl-aspartate.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 2647-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of SlgN1 shows all motifs expected for a functional adenylation domain. Sequence analysis of SlgN2 indicates the presence of a functional PCP domain, but the adenylation domain appears to be nonfunctional, as noticed previously by Olano et al. (19Olano C. Gómez C.

Biol. 2009; 16: 1031-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subsequent to its transfer to the PCP domain of SlgN2, 3-methylaspartate is probably converted to 3-methylasparagine by the aminotransferase SlgZ (18Horna D.H. Gómez C. Olano C. Palomino-Schätzlein M. Pineda-Lucena A. Carbajo R.J. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. Biosynthesis of the RNA polymerase inhibitor streptolydigin in Streptomyces lyticus. Tailoring modification of 3-methyl-aspartate.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 2647-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3-Methylaspartate itself is derived from glutamate in a glutamate mutase reaction (20Gómez C. Horna D.H. Olano C.

This reaction usually produces l-threo-3-methylaspartate, i.e. (2S,3S)-2-amino-3-methylsuccinic acid (21Marsh E.N. Insights into the mechanisms of adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B12)-dependent enzymes from rapid chemical quench experiments.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and this stereochemistry is found in the 3-methylaspartate moiety of streptolydigin (for the x-ray structure see PDB code 2A6H). Gene inactivation experiments showed that SlgN1 and SlgN2 are required for streptolydigin formation (22Gómez C. Olano C. Palomino-Schätzlein M. Pineda-Lucena A. Carbajo R.J. Braña A.F. Méndez C.

Antibiot. 2012; 65: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but so far the functions of SlgN1 and SlgN2 have been deduced from sequence analysis and from the chemical structure of streptolydigin and have not been confirmed biochemically yet. In this study, we expressed and purified SlgN1, confirmed its 3-methylaspartate adenylating activity, crystallized the protein, and determined its structure. This allowed us, for the first time, to visualize and functionally characterize the interface between an MbtH-like domain and an adenylating enzyme. Tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate (3.38 TBq mmol−1) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. dl-threo-3-Methylaspartate was purchased from Sigma.

The gene was excised from the vector with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into vector pET28a using the same restriction sites. The correct DNA sequence of the entire gene was confirmed by sequencing. The vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) with an ybdZ deletion. Site-directed mutagenesis of SlgN1 was carried out by PCR amplification of the template pET28a-SlgN1 and pET22b-SlgN1, respectively, using asymmetric primers as follows: SlgN1_G82STOP-fwd (5′-CGC CCT ACA TAA CCT GCC GTT GAA CGT GCT CCT GCT G-3′) and SlgN1_G82STOP_rev (5′-C AAC GGC AGG TTA TGT AGG GCG CAG ATC GGT CCA GTG A-3′); SlgN1_R484STOP_fwd (5′-G TAT GTC GGT CGT TAA GAC GAT CAG GTG AAA ATT CGT GGG TTC CG-3′) and SlgN1_R484STOP_rev (5′-T CAC CTG ATC GTC TTA ACG ACC GAC ATA CTC CAG AAC TCC ATC AG-3′); SlgN1_A428Y_fwd (5′-GGC TCT GAC TTA TGA ACG TTT TGT TGC CGA TCC GTT TGC TG-3′) and SlgN1_A428Y_rev (5′-CA AAA CGT TCA TAA GTC AGA GCC GGA CGA GAA ACA TAA CCG TG-3′); SlgN1_A433E_fwd (5′-CGT TTT GTT GAA GAT CCG TTT GCT GGC CCG GGA GG-3′) and SlgN1_A433E_rev(5′-C AAA CGG ATC TTC AAC AAA ACG TTC AGC AGT CAG AGC CGG-3′); SlgN1_S23Y_fwd (5′-G GAC GCC ATT ATC TGT GGC CTG CTG GTA TTG CCG-3′) and SlgN1_S23Y_rev (5′-C AGG CCA CAG ATA ATG GCG TCC CAG GGC ATC TG-3′); the mutated bases are underlined. The PCR mixture (50 μl) contained polymerase buffer (10 μl, 5× ExactRun buffer, Genaxxon Bioscience), dNTPs (1 μl, 25 mm, each), ExactRun DNA polymerase (0.5 μl, Genaxxon Bioscience, 2 units/μl), template plasmid (5 ng), primers (1 μl, 10 μm, each), and DMSO (1 μl). The PCR was performed using a typical thermal cycling procedure (1 cycle, 98 °C for 2 min; 18 cycles, 98 °C for 30 s, 71 °C for 1:00 min, and 72 °C for 3.5 min; and 1 cycle, 72 °C for 10 min). The template DNA was digested with DpnI, precipitated, and transformed in E. coli XL10-Gold cells. Mutagenesis was verified by sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described below. 10 ml of an overnight culture in Luria-Bertani medium (50 μg ml−1 kanamycin) of E. coli BL21(DE3)ΔybdZ cells harboring the respective expression plasmid were used to inoculate 1 liter of terrific broth (50 μg ml−1 kanamycin). The cells were grown at 37 °C and cooled to 20 °C, 30 min before an A600 of 0.6 was reached. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to start protein production, and cells were allowed to grow for an additional 6 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 7,000 × g), resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per 10 g of cells, and placed on ice. Benzonase (500 units, Novagen) was added, and cells were lysed by sonication. Subsequent centrifugation (27,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) yielded supernatant that was passed through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore) and loaded with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min on a 5-ml nickel column (HisTrapTM 5-ml FF Global, GE Healthcare), which was equilibrated with HisA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). Unbound sample was washed out by washing with HisA buffer (50 ml). A step gradient with HisB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 500 mm imidazole) was applied to remove impurities, and purified protein was eluted with 26% of HisB buffer (in case of all constructs of SlgN1). In case of the MbtH-like domain of SlgN1, HisA and HisB buffer contained 10% (v/v) glycerol. Fractions containing purified protein were pooled and concentrated. For structural determination, the His6 tag was cleaved by exchanging the buffer for thrombin buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) and incubation with thrombin (1 unit/mg protein, GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 24 h in a total volume of 2 ml. Uncleaved protein, as well as the cleaved His6 tag, was removed by passing the solution through a 5-ml nickel column (HisTrap 5-ml FF Global, GE Healthcare) coupled to a 1-ml benzamidine column (HiTrap Benzamidine FF, GE Healthcare). The flow-through was pooled and concentrated. Afterward, the protein was applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 (GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl. The elution volume of all proteins corresponded to a monomeric state, except for the MbtH-like domain of SlgN1, which was a dimer. Effects upon freezing were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (J-720 CD spectrometer, Jasco), dynamic light scattering spectroscopy (DLS-Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments), and analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30, GE Healthcare). Proteins found to be stable were concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at −80 °C, and used only once upon thawing. ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays (100 μl) contained 95 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 2 mm ATP, 1.5 mmdl-threo-3-methylaspartate, 2 μm of the respective adenylating enzyme, 2.1 μm of the respective MbtH-like protein (unless other amounts are indicated), and 1 mm [32P]pyrophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were initiated by the addition of the adenylating enzyme, allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C, and then quenched with 500 μl of a suspension of activated charcoal (1.6% (w/v)) in quenching buffer (4.5% (w/v)) tetrasodium pyrophosphate and 3.5% perchloric acid in water). The charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with quenching buffer, resuspended in 0.5 ml of water, and added to 9 ml of scintillation liquid. Radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. Data reported are means of two independent reactions. Initial crystals were obtained from a cleaved SlgN1, which lacks the Asub domain (SlgN1ΔAsubc). The cleavage occurred between residues 463 and 473, within the inter-domain linker connecting the Acore and Asub domains. The structure of those crystals was solved first and served to design a construct via site-directed mutagenesis (pET28a-SlgN1ΔAsub), which ends with Arg-464 (SlgN1ΔAsub) to reproduce the crystals. Crystallization experiments were performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. 300 nl of protein solution (5–6 mg/ml) was mixed 1:1 with crystallization buffer on a 96-well plate above the reservoir (100 μl). The crystallization buffer that yielded initial crystals was optimized for optimal crystal growth (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 m Li2SO4, 1.3 m potassium/sodium tartrate) at 20 °C. The crystallization buffer proved to be cryo-protective. Crystals of SlgN1ΔAsubc grew to a final size of 100 × 50 × 20 μm and diffracted up to 2.44 Å, and crystals of SlgN1ΔAsub grew to a final size of 350 × 200 × 150 μm and diffracted up to 1.9 Å. To incorporate ligands, the crystals of SlgN1ΔAsub were soaked with 20 mm AMPcPP (Jena Bioscience), 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm of various amino acids (Sigma). Native and derivatized crystals were harvested, mounted into cryo-loops, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data sets of the native (SlgN1ΔAsubc) and the soaked (SlgN1ΔAsub-AMPcPP) crystals were collected at beamline X06DA at the Swiss Light Source in Villigen, Switzerland. Data reduction was performed with XDS and XSCALE (23Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl.

GIP is secreted from enteroendocrine K-cells located in the duodenum and upper small intestine; GLP-1 is secreted from enteroendocrine L-cells located in the lower small intestine and colon. GIP binds to the GIP receptor (GIPR) on the surface of pancreatic β-cells, adipose tissue, and osteoblasts, and it stimulates insulin secretion (6Seino Y. Fukushima M. Yabe D.

However, the mechanisms involved in GIP hypersecretion from K-cells in obesity remain unclear due to difficulties in separating these cells from other intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. In this study, we investigated expression of various genes in K-cells by using GIP-GFP knock-in (GIP-GFP) mice in which K-cells can be visualized by EGFP fluorescence. We found that regulatory factor X6(Rfx6) is expressed exclusively in K-cells of the upper small intestine and is involved in GIP mRNA expression in the mouse small intestinal cell line STC-1. Furthermore, expression of Rfx6 as well as Pdx1 was found to be increased in K-cells of HFD-induced obese mice. Thus, GIP expression is stimulated by both Rfx6 and Pdx1, suggesting that these transcription factors play an important role in both GIP expression and GIP hypersecretion in HFD-induced obesity. We designed targeting vector constructs as short-EGFP-poly(A)-loxp-Neo-loxp-long cassettes using mouse B6N BAC clone (identification numbers RP23-31E4 and RP23-383D10). A diphtheria toxin A expression cassette for negative selection was attached to the 3′ end of the gip sequence in the targeting vector. Next, the targeting vector was injected in embryonic stem cells from C57BL/6 mice, and a Neo resistance strain was established. The ES cells positive for the knock-in gene were selected by Southern blot analysis. The established ES cells were then injected into the blastocyst to obtain chimeric mice. Finally, we generated hetero-mutant mice by mating the chimeric mice with wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The mice were housed in an air-controlled (temperature 25 °C) room with a dark-light cycle of 10 and 14 h, respectively. Animal care and procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kyoto University. GIP-GFP heterozygous mice (7 weeks of age) were fed control fat chow (CFD; 10% fat, 20% protein, and 70% carbohydrate by energy) or high fat chow (HFD; 60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrate by energy) (Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) for 8 weeks. Food intake, water intake, and body weight were measured. Mouse upper small intestine samples were fixed in Bouin's solution and transferred into 70% ethanol before processing through paraffin. Rehydrated paraffin sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary mouse anti-GFP antibody (sc-9996, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-GIP antibody (T-4053, 1:100, Peninsula Laboratories, Inc., San Carlos, CA). Intestine samples and STC-1 cells (kindly provided by Prof. Hanahan, University of California, San Francisco) were embedded by Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound 4583 (Sakura Fine Technical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (10 μm) on slides were air-dried and fixed in acetone for 5 min. Slides were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked for 15 min in 3% BSA. They were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (mouse anti-GIP antibody (1:100, kindly provided by Merck Millipore)) and goat anti-Rfx6 antibody (ABD28, 1:100, Merck). The sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody. Images were taken using a fluorescent microscopy with a BZ-8100 system (KEYENCE Corp., Osaka, Japan) and confocal microscopy with an LSM510META system (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd., Jena, Germany). Fifty representative mucous membranes from each slide were randomly selected, and their mean length and GFP-positive cells were quantified using fluorescent microscopy images. To count the GFP-positive cells, we distinguished the mucous membrane as villus, upper crypt, or lower crypt. Mouse upper small intestine was removed and washed by PBS. The intestine was cut into several round pieces and tied on one side with a thread. The pouch-like intestine was injected with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mg/ml collagenase, clamped, and incubated with CO2 at 37 °C for 10 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB: 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3). The digested intestinal epithelium was collected into the tube filled with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium and rinsed twice. The intestinal epithelium was cultured in a humidified incubator (95% air and 5% CO2) at 37 °C for 1 h. Afterward, it was centrifuged at 180 × g for 5 min, resuspended in PBS twice, and filtered with a cell strainer (352340, Falcon cell strainer, BD Biosciences). GFP-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium were analyzed using BD FACS AriaTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were collected into vials containing medium at a rate of 2000 cells/tube. Total RNA was extracted with PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Alameda, CA) from sorted cells of GIP-GFP mouse intestinal epithelium and treated with DNase (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Microarray analysis was performed using GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix Inc., Fremont, CA). After a 16-h fasting period, OGTTs (1 g/kg body weight) were performed. Blood samples were taken at the indicated times (0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose loading), and blood glucose levels, plasma insulin levels, and plasma total GIP concentrations were measured. Blood glucose levels were determined by the glucose oxidase method (Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). Plasma insulin levels were determined using enzyme immunoassay (Shibayagi, Gumma, Japan). Plasma total GIP levels were determined using an ELISA kit (Merck Millipore). For measurement of GIP content in the mouse upper small intestine, the mice were killed at 15 weeks of age after 8 weeks of CFD or HFD feeding. The intestine was rapidly removed and washed in PBS. After measuring the weight, samples were extracted with 5 ml/g acid ethanol, and GIP levels were measured (15Flatt P.R. Bailey C.J. Kwasowski P. Swanston-Flatt S.K. Marks V. Abnormalities of GIP in spontaneous syndromes of obesity and diabetes in mice.Diabetes. 1983; 32: 433-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared by reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR using ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems Inc.). PCR analyses were carried out using the oligonucleotide primers. SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems Inc.) was prepared for PCR run. Thermal cycling conditions were denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.

STC-1 cells, mouse small intestinal cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 and 95% air). siRNA transfection of StealthTM siRNAs were synthesized (Invitrogen). The sequences of siRNAs specific for Rfx6 and Pdx1 are shown as follows: Pdx1, caguacuacgcggccacacagcucu and agagcuguguggccgcguaguacug, and Rfx6, ggugaaugccaugguaucugauauu and aauaucagauaccauggcauucacc. Cultured STC-1 cells were trypsinized, suspended with DMEM without antibiotics, mixed with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing siRNA and Lipofectamine TM2000 (Invitrogen), plated on 12-well dishes, and then incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The amounts of STC-1 cells were 1 × 106 cells/well. Medium was replaced with 1 ml of DMEM containing antibiotics about 5–6 h after transfection. RT-PCR was performed 48 h after transfection. The cDNA fragment of mouse Rfx6 protein was obtained from mouse (C57BL/6) islets by RT-PCR. The cDNA fragment of Rfx6 was cloned into pCMV vector (Clontech). Expression plasmids of Rfx6 cDNA were transfected into STC-1 cells using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). Plasmid (8 μg/well) was diluted into Opti-MEM, and LipofectamineTM 2000 was added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After incubation, the mixture was added to STC-1 cells (1 × 106 cells/well). RT-PCR was performed 48 h after transfection. For incretin release assays, DMEM was collected from STC-1 cells cultured on 12-well dishes about 42–43 h after changing the medium (48 h after transfection). Media were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Total GIP and total GLP-1 levels were measured by ELISA methods (Merck Millipore and Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD), respectively) as incretin release from STC-1 cells. To determine incretin content, STC-1 cells cultured on 12-well dishes (48 h after transfection) were washed with PBS and homogenized in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl and extracted at RT for 10 min, after which the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. Incretin and protein levels were measured by ELISA (GIP and GLP-1) and Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), respectively. Yeast one-hybrid assays were performed using the Matchmaker Gold Yeast One-hybrid Library Screening System (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gip promoter fragments shown in Fig. 4A were inserted separately upstream of the aureobasidin A resistance gene on the pAbAi vector, and Rfx6 cDNA was inserted downstream of GAL4-activating domain (GAL4AD) on the pGADT7 activating domain vector. The interactions between gip promoter fragments and Rfx6-GAL4AD protein were assayed using the aureobasidin A resistance gene reporter system. First, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y1HGold (MATα, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, met-MEL1) was transformed by gip promoter fragment-inserted pAbAi plasmid (pAbAi-fragments a, b, c, and d), and spread on the synthetic medium with dextrose (SD) (without uracil) and incubated for 1 week at 30 °C. Obtained yeast was transformed by Rfx6 cDNA-inserted pGADT7 activating domain plasmid (pGADT7-Rfx6), spread on the SD (without tryptophan) medium, and then incubated for 1 week at 30 °C. Interaction between gip promoter fragment and Rfx6-GAL4AD protein could be detected, and the transformant was grown on SD (without tryptophan) medium containing 600 ng/ml aureobasidin A. 1 × 106 STC-1 cells were cotransfected with pGL4.19 luciferase reporter plasmid expressing five different lengths of the gip promoter gene (Fig. 4C) and pGL4.73 Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. 48 h after transfection, luciferase and Renilla activities were assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using a GioMax 20/20n luminometer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase expression and is presented as fold increase in relative light units over samples transfected with pGL4.19. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The results are given as means ± S.E. (S.E., n = number of mice). Statistical significance was determined using paired and unpaired Student's t test and analysis of variance. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. GIP-GFP mice were generated for the purpose of visualizing enteroendocrine K-cells (Fig. 1A). The mouse gip gene is composed of six exons. The targeting vector for GIP-GFP mice was designed so that EGFP cDNA was fused with exon 3 in the gip gene. Prepro-GIP consists of 144 amino acids (Fig. 1B), and PC1/3 and PC2 cleave prepro-GIP, generating GIP(1–42) and GIP(1–30), respectively. In GIP-GFP mice, the fusion protein retains the signal peptide, but it does not have the GIP(1–42) sequence nor the PC1/3 and PC2 cleavage sites. Accordingly, GIP-GFP mice express GIP signal peptide-GFP fusion protein (280 amino acids). GFP fluorescence was observed in the small intestine of GIP-GFP heterozygous mice (Fig. 1C) and GIP-GFP homozygous mice (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to assess localization of GFP-expressing cells and GIP-expressing cells using anti-GFP and anti-GIP antibodies, respectively, in the upper small intestine of wild-type and GIP-GFP heterozygous and homozygous mice (Fig. 1D). GFP-expressing cells are present in the intestine of GIP-GFP heterozygous and homozygous mice and GIP-expressing cells are present in the intestine of both wild-type and GIP-GFP heterozygous mice. However, in GIP-GFP homozygous mice, no GIP-expressing cells were found. The GFP-expressing cells were identical to the GIP-expressing cells in the GIP-GFP heterozygous mice. We then examined the fasting plasma GIP levels in the three types of mice (Fig. 1E). GIP levels were significantly lower in GFP-GFP heterozygous mice compared with those in wild-type mice. GIP levels of GIP-GFP homozygous mice were not detectable. These results indicate that GIP-GFP heterozygous mice have only one normal gip gene and that GIP-GFP homozygous mice have no normal gip genes. Next, GFP-positive cells were purified by a flow cytometry system. GFP-positive cells and GFP-negative cells from upper small intestinal epithelium of GIP-GFP heterozygous mice were separated and collected. GFP mRNA and GIP mRNA were highly expressed in GFP-positive cells (Fig. 1F). In microarray analysis, the expression levels of GIP mRNA were much higher in GFP-positive cells than those in GFP-negative cells (GFP-positive cells (n = 3) 12,951.55 ± 335.77 versus GFP-negative cells (n = 3) 1763.61 ±142.65; p ≤ 0.001). These results demonstrate that the GFP-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium of GIP-GFP mice are K-cells. Microarray analysis data revealed that mRNA of the transcription factor Rfx6 is highly expressed in GFP-positive cells (GFP-positive cells (n = 3) 2613.4 ± 341.9 versus GFP-negative cells (n = 3) 24.0 ± 6.7; p ≤ 0.05). As seven members of the Rfx family were identified previously, we evaluated the expression of these mRNAs in mouse islets, GFP-positive cells (K-cells), and mouse small intestinal cell line STC-1 (Fig. 2A). All of the rfx genes, except for rfx4, were expressed in islets as shown in a previous study (20Smith S.B. Qu H.Q. Taleb N. Kishimoto N.Y. Scheel D.W. Lu Y. Patch A.M. Grabs R. Wang J. Lynn F.C.

Polychronakos C. German M.S. Rfx6 direct islet formation and insulin production in mice and humans.Nature. 2010; 463: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Rfx3, Rfx6, and Rfx7 were expressed in GFP-positive cells, but no Rfx mRNAs were detected in the GFP-negative cells. In semi-quantitative RT-PCR data, the expression levels of Rfx6 were extremely higher in GFP-positive cells than those in GFP-negative cells, whereas the expression levels of Rfx3 and Rfx7 were similar (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that Rfx6-expressing cells correspond to GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that Rfx6 is expressed exclusively in K-cells. We then assessed the influence of Rfx6 on GIP expression and secretion by using STC-1 cells. Rfx6 mRNA expression was confirmed in STC-1 cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). The Rfx6-expressing cells were similarly located in the GIP-expressing cells by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2D). By treatment with Rfx6 siRNA, Rfx6 mRNA expression was inhibited by 70% (Fig. 2E). In the same condition, mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion of GIP were significantly decreased whereas those of GLP-1 were similar to control (Fig. 2, E–G), indicating that Rfx6 increases GIP mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion. However, Pdx1 is reported to be an important transcriptional factor for producing GIP in K-cells (17Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H.

To examine the effect of Pdx1 on incretin expression and secretion, mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion of GIP and GLP-1 were measured in Pdx1-knockdown STC-1 cells by using siRNA. Pdx1 mRNA expression was confirmed in STC-1 cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). The expression levels of Pdx1 mRNA were decreased by 50% in STC-1 cells treated with Pdx1 siRNA (Fig. 3C). GIP mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion were significantly decreased, whereas GLP-1 mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion were somewhat increased in STC-1 cells treated with Pdx1 siRNA (Fig. 3, C–E). The expression levels of Rfx6 mRNA were significantly decreased in the cells (Fig. 3C). We assessed the interaction of the Rfx6 and gip gene by one-hybrid assay. Four fragments of the gip promoter were constructed (Fig. 4A). Rfx"

Healthy pregnant women (n=26, wk 26-29 gestation) were randomized to 480 mg choline/d, an intake level approximating the adequate intake of 450 mg/d, or 930 mg/d for 12 wk. Maternal blood and placental samples were retrieved at delivery. Whole genome expression microarrays were used to identify placental genes and biological processes impacted by maternal choline intake. Maternal choline intake influenced a wide array of genes (n=166) and biological processes (n=197), including those related to vascular function. Of special interest was the 30% down-regulation (P=0.05) of the antiangiogenic factor and preeclampsia risk marker fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT1) in the placenta tissues obtained from the 930 vs. 480 mg/d choline intake group. Similar decreases (P=0.04) were detected in maternal blood sFLT1 protein concentrations. The down-regulation of sFLT1 by choline treatment was confirmed in a human trophoblast cell culture model and may be related to enhanced acetylcholine signaling. These findings indicate that supplementing the maternal diet with extra choline may improve placental angiogenesis and mitigate some of the pathological antecedents of preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W1995754779,"Observations of trace gases over the south pole of Titan indicate that the moon’s middle-atmospheric circulation extends to an altitude of at least 600 kilometres, which is higher than previously thought and requires active chemistry and dynamics in the upper atmosphere. When NASA's Cassini probe reached the Saturnian system in 2004, one of its goals was to observe the seasonal behaviour of Saturn's biggest moon, Titan, which has a nitrogen-rich atmosphere comparable to Earth's. As the seasons pass, those observations are bearing fruit. Here, Nicholas Teanby et al. report a build-up of trace gases over Titan's south pole approximately two years after the observation of a post-equinox circulation reversal in the middle atmosphere, from which they conclude that middle-atmosphere circulation must extend to at least 600 kilometres above the moon's surface, rather than the 450–500 kilometres previously suspected. These findings would require active upper-atmosphere chemistry, and an alternative explanation for the detached layer of haze at 450–500 kilometres that was formerly regarded as an atmospheric boundary. Saturn’s moon Titan has a nitrogen atmosphere comparable to Earth’s, with a surface pressure of 1.4 bar. Numerical models reproduce the tropospheric conditions very well but have trouble explaining the observed middle-atmosphere temperatures, composition and winds1,2. The top of the middle-atmosphere circulation has been thought to lie at an altitude of 450 to 500 kilometres, where there is a layer of haze that appears to be separated from the main haze deck3. This ‘detached’ haze was previously explained as being due to the co-location of peak haze production and the limit of dynamical transport by the circulation’s upper branch4. Here we report a build-up of trace gases over the south pole approximately two years after observing the 2009 post-equinox circulation reversal, from which we conclude that middle-atmosphere circulation must extend to an altitude of at least 600 kilometres. The primary drivers of this circulation are summer-hemisphere heating of haze by absorption of solar radiation and winter-hemisphere cooling due to infrared emission by haze and trace gases5; our results therefore imply that these effects are important well into the thermosphere (altitudes higher than 500 kilometres). This requires both active upper-atmosphere chemistry, consistent with the detection of high-complexity molecules and ions at altitudes greater than 950 kilometres6,7, and an alternative explanation for the detached haze, such as a transition in haze particle growth from monomers to fractal structures8."
https://openalex.org/W1971214150,"Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation is initiated by the binding of sialofucosylated carbohydrates expressed on leukocytes to endothelial E/P-selectin. Although the glycosyltransferases (glycoTs) constructing selectin-ligands have largely been identified using knock-out mice, important differences may exist between humans and mice. To address this, we developed a systematic lentivirus-based shRNA delivery workflow to create human leukocytic HL-60 cell lines that lack up to three glycoTs. Using this, the contributions of all three myeloid α1,3-fucosyltransferases (FUT4, FUT7, and FUT9) to selectin-ligand biosynthesis were evaluated. The cell adhesion properties of these modified cells to L-, E-, and P-selectin under hydrodynamic shear were compared with bone marrow-derived neutrophils from Fut4−/−Fut7−/− dual knock-out mice. Results demonstrate that predominantly FUT7, and to a lesser extent FUT4, forms the selectin-ligand at the N terminus of leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in humans and mice. Here, 85% reduction in leukocyte interaction was observed in human FUT4−7− dual knockdowns on P/L-selectin substrates. Unlike Fut4−/−Fut7−/− mouse neutrophils, however, human knockdowns lacking FUT4 and FUT7 only exhibited partial reduction in rolling interaction on E-selectin. In this case, the third α1,3-fucosyltransferase FUT9 played an important role because leukocyte adhesion was reduced by 50–60% in FUT9-HL-60, 70–80% in dual knockdown FUT7−9− cells, and ∼85% in FUT4−7−9− triple knockdowns.

Three members of the selectin family of adhesion molecules, E-(CD62E), P-(CD62P), and L-selectin (CD62L), regulate the capture of leukocytes from flowing blood to sites of inflammation under hydrodynamic/fluid shear conditions (1Zarbock A.

E-selectin ligands on human bone marrow CD34+ cells are distinct from mouse LSK (lin− Sca-1+ c-kit+) cells in that the CD44 variant HCELL (hematopoietic cell E- and L-selectin ligand) is the dominant ligand for the human cell type, whereas CLA (cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, epitope recognized by mAb HECA-452) plays this role in mice (10Merzaban J.S.

Thus, although P-selectin expression is up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and IL-1β in murine inflammation models, this is not the case in humans.

Whether the selectin-ligands differ in murine versus human systems because of species-specific functions of glycoTs remains undetermined. We addressed this possibility by advancing RNA interference (RNAi) and lentiviral delivery tools to study glycoTs in human leukocytes. In particular, we evaluated the roles of all three α1,3-FUTs expressed in myeloid cells, FUT4, FUT7, and FUT9 in synthesizing the ligands for human E-, P-, and L-selectin (3Taniguchi N. Honke K. Fukuda M. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo2002Crossref Google Scholar). In accordance with Taniguchi et al. (3Taniguchi N. Honke K. Fukuda M. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo2002Crossref Google Scholar), FUT4 and FUT7 are used to designate human enzymes and Fut4 and Fut7 are used for non-human species. The strategy involved generation of a panel of stable human promyelocytic HL-60 cell lines that contain short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against one, two, or three different glycoTs. HL-60 cells were chosen because primary human leukocytes cannot be maintained in culture for long term assays, and because the prototypic sialofucosylated O-linked selectin-ligand located at the N terminus of human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1/CD162) was originally characterized using these cells (13Aeed P.A.

A microfluidics based cell adhesion assay under physiological flow evaluated the effect of gene silencing. Results show that, like mice, FUT7 and to a lesser extent FUT4 synthesize the selectin-ligands that mediate human leukocyte tethering and rolling on substrates bearing P- and L-selectin. Unlike mice, however, FUT9 plays a major role during the synthesis of human E-selectin ligands with FUT7 and FUT4 having smaller contributions. Overall, the study introduces RNA interference methods for studies of leukocyte glycoTs. Unlike previous studies with Fut4−/−Fut7−/− dual knock-out mice that exhibit complete loss of E-, P-, and L-selectin binding function in a variety of physiological and pathological models (17Weninger W.

To our best knowledge, this is the first demonstration of glycoTs in different mammalian species having distinct contributions to leukocyte rolling. CHO-S cells (Invitrogen), CHO-S stably expressing P-selectin (CHO-P), and HEK293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS. HL-60 cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% FBS. L-cells bearing E-selectin (L-E cells), kindly provided by Dr. Scott I. Simon (University of California, Davis, CA), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 0.25 mg/ml xanthine, sodium hypoxanthine and thymidine supplement, and 5 μg/ml mycophenolic acid. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) purchased from Lonza (Walkersville, MD) were maintained in EBM2 media (Lonza). Cell adhesion studies with HUVEC were conducted within 1–3 passages. Standard molecular biology methods were used to create lentiviral transfer plasmids that carry DNA encoding for cell-surface proteins, fusion proteins, or shRNA. Typically, cell-surface and fusion proteins were expressed using pCS-CG (plasmid 12154, Addgene, Cambridge, MA) as the transfer construct. Here, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter drives gene expression. shRNAs were encoded using the pLKO.1 vector (Sigma). In this case, the human polymerase III U6 promoter drives shRNA expression, whereas a phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) promoter drives expression of either the selection marker (puromycin resistance gene) or reporter gene (DsRed or cerulean). Details are below. FUT-EGFP represents a family of fusion proteins where EGFP is fused to the C terminus of either full-length human FUT4, FUT7, or FUT9. DNA encoding for FUT-EGFP was constructed in the vector pCS-CG. To this end, first, 1.5 kb of pCS-CG (bp 2383–3882 on pCS-CG), which includes both the CMV promoter and EGFP regions, was cloned into the pUC19 cloning vector. Primers 1 and 2 (supplemental Table S1) were used to introduce an AgeI site (ACCGGT) directly prior to the EGFP in this vector, and the native start codon (ATG) of EGFP was simultaneously deleted. This pUC19 vector was digested using KpnI and AgeI to remove the 800-bp fragment encoding for the EGFP region of pCS-CG. This fragment was ligated into native pCS-CG vector using the same enzymes, to generate “pCS-CG-AgeI-EGFP.” cDNA encoding for the human fucosyltransferases FUT4, FUT7, and FUT9 were obtained in pCMVsport-6 from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Forward primers were designed to introduce either an AgeI (ACCGGT) site in the case of FUT7 and -9 or an AgeI-compatible end (BspEI, TCCGGA) in the case of FUT4, along with a Kozak sequence (CGCCACC) just prior to the start codon of the enzyme. The native stop codon was deleted, and an AgeI site was introduced using an appropriate reverse primer. Primers 3–8 (supplemental Table S1) were used for this step. PCR-amplified FUT cDNA segments thus obtained were ligated into pCS-CG-AgeI-EGFP. In summary, the above steps lead to the construction of pCS-CG that carried FUT4-EGFP, FUT7-EGFP, and FUT9-EGFP. Human PSGL-1 cDNA was amplified using primers 9 and 10 (supplemental Table S1) and template vector available from a previous study (19Jayakumar D. Marathe D.D. Neelamegham S. Detection of site-specific glycosylation in proteins using flow cytometry.Cytometry. 2009; 75: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Product digested using BamHI and KpnI was ligated into pLKO.1 TRC cloning (Addgene plasmid 10878) in place of the puromycin resistance gene. In pLKO.1, the puromycin resistance gene was located between unique BamHI and KpnI sites just downstream of the PGK promoter. shRNA was absent in the pLKO.1 TRC cloning vector. 3–5 shRNAs for each of the FUTs of interest (supplemental Table S2) were cloned into the pLKO.1 TRC cloning vector that has a puromycin selection cassette. These unique shRNA sequences were selected from the Broad Institute MISSION® shRNA library. Each shRNA sequence was introduced between unique AgeI and EcoRI sites downstream of the U6 promoter in pLKO.1. In some cases, the puromycin resistance gene in pLKO.1 was replaced by either DsRed (red fluorescence protein variant) or cerulean (cyan fluorescence protein variant). Here, DsRed was isolated from mRFP-ubiquitin (Addgene plasmid 11935) using primers 11 and 12 (supplemental Table S1), and cerulean was amplified from pCerulean-VSVG (Addgene plasmid 11913) using primers 13 and 14. BamHI and KpnI present in PCR products enabled ligation into pLKO.1. The vectors resulting from this step both drive expression of shRNA for gene knockdown and express the fluorescence reporter DsRed/cerulean. Following the cloning steps, lentiviral particles were generated using calcium phosphate precipitation method to co-transfect into HEK293T cells the following plasmids: 15 μg of packaging vector psPAX2, 10 μg of VSVG envelope vector pMD2.G, and 20 μg of transfer plasmid (described in the previous section). For viral preparation, 8–14 h post-transfection, 10 mm sodium butyrate was added to culture medium for 48 h. The medium with lentiviral particles was then collected, filtered through 0.45-μm syringe filters, and concentrated 100-fold by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The viral pellet was dissolved in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) and used either immediately or stored at −80 °C. Lentivirus prepared in the above step was used to stably transduce HEK293T, CHO-S, and HL-60 cells. Substrate-adherent cells (HEK293T and CHO-S) were plated in 24-well plates overnight to achieve 70% confluence the following day. HL-60 cells were at 60,000 cells/ml at the time of transduction. In all cases, the wells had cells, 500 μl of normal cell culture media, 8 μg/ml Polybrene, and a range of viral titers during the transduction step. In the case of adherent cells, 25 μl of the 100× viral concentrate above was typically used to consistently achieve ∼100% stable transduction (multiplicity of infection ∼10). Viral titer was 2-fold greater in the case of suspension cells (HL-60). Cells were scaled up in media lacking virus and Polybrene after 24–36 h. Stable gene expression was confirmed 5–14 days post-transduction using flow cytometry. Stable HEK293T cell lines that express various FUTs, in the presence or absence of PSGL-1, were generated. HEK293T cells were first transduced with lentivirus encoding for human PSGL-1. Stable PSGL-1 expression in ∼100% of the cells was confirmed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-PSGL-1 mAb KPL-1 (BD Biosciences). Both wild-type (WT) HEK293T and HEK293T cells with PSGL-1 (“HEK-PSGL-1” or “HP” cells) were then transduced with lentivirus encoding for either FUT4-EGFP, FUT7-EGFP, or FUT9-EGFP. >95% of the transduced cells stably expressed FUT-EGFP based on EGFP fluorescence. To characterize the subcellular localization of FUT-EGFPs in these cells, immunocytochemistry was performed as described below. 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips were incubated overnight with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine to absorb the molecules. Excess poly-l-lysine was then removed, and HEK293T cells expressing one of the FUT-EGFP proteins were seeded on the substrate. Cells grown to ∼50–70% confluence overnight were washed and fixed with 1.5 ml of cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and the membrane was permeabilized using 1 ml of 5% blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 1 h. Coverslips containing cells were then incubated with 0.67 μg/ml anti-human TGN-46 antibody (Ab against trans-Golgi network protein, Sigma) for 12–16 h, washed with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and then 2 μg/ml goat-anti-rabbit Alexa 594 IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was added for 1–2 h in the dark. Cells were then stained with 0.33 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min, mounted on a microscope slide, and dried overnight at 4 °C. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta NLO confocal microscope with plan-apochromat 63×/1.4 oil objective. Co-localization overlap coefficient was calculated using the ImageJ plug in JACoP, “Just Another Colocalization Plugin” (20Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Enzymology assays quantified FUT activity in HEK293T cell lysates by extending a previously published method (21Patil S.A. Chandrasekaran E.V. Matta K.L. Parikh A. Tzanakakis E.S. Neelamegham S. Scaling down the size and increasing the throughput of glycosyltransferase assays. Activity changes on stem cell differentiation.Anal. Biochem. 2012; 425: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, FUT activity was quantified in a 3-μl reaction volume that contained 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 7 mm ATP, 3 mm NaN3, 4.167 μm GDP-[14C]Fuc (0.0012 μCi), 1.25 mm synthetic acceptor, and 1 mg/ml cell lysate. Following reaction for 8 h, 5 μl of acetonitrile was added, and the sample was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min to precipitate proteins. The supernatant was collected, air-dried for 30 min to remove acetonitrile, and the remaining material resuspended in 2 μl of water. This was spotted on a reverse phase-TLC to separate radioactive product from unreacted GDP-[14C]Fuc using water containing 0.2% acetic acid as mobile phase. Reverse phase-TLC plates were scanned using phosphorimaging followed by analysis using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Percent of total radioactivity incorporated into various acceptors was quantified. CHO cells stably expressing one of the three FUT-EGFP fusion proteins (FUT4-EGFP, FUT7-EGFP, or FUT9-EGFP) were developed by transduction of CHO-S cells (Invitrogen) with lentivirus encoding for the fusion proteins. To determine shRNA silencing efficiency, lentivirus encoding for various FUT shRNAs (listed in supplemental Table S2) were added to these cells. Change in EGFP fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry 4–10 days after transduction. Silencing efficiency (%) = 100 × (1 −(EGFP fluorescence of FUT-EGFP cells treated with shRNA ÷ EGFP fluorescence in cells without shRNA)). Negative controls include lentivirus made using the pLKO.1 TRC cloning vector that contains a 1.9-kb stuffer in place of shRNA (Addgene plasmid 10878) and pLKO.1 TRC control vector containing 18 bp of nonhairpin sequence (Addgene plasmid 10879). Positive control was pLKO.1 EGFP shRNA vector (Addgene plasmid 12273). Although the pLKO.1 vector carrying shRNA did not have a fluorescence reporter during the initial RNAi screening studies, DsRed replaced the puromycin resistance gene in this vector in later studies that confirmed the specificity of gene silencing. Efficient shRNA directed against various FUTs, highlighted in bold in supplemental Table S2, were cloned into the pLKO.1 vector that had either drug selection (puromycin resistance) or reporter genes (DsRed or cerulean). In all cases, the human polymerase III U6 promoter drove shRNA expression, whereas a PGK promoter was upstream of the drug selection or reporter gene. Single knockdown HL-60 cells lacking FUT4, FUT7, or FUT9 were created by transduction of WT cells with virus encoding for corresponding shRNA, using DsRed as a reporter of stable gene expression. These cell lines are abbreviated “FUT4− HL-60,” “FUT7− HL-60,” and “FUT9− HL-60.” The pLKO.1 TRC cloning vector with DsRed cloned in place of the puromycin resistance gene was used as a negative control in the single knockdown experiments. These cells were termed “DsRed HL-60.” Dual knockdowns lacking either FUT4 and FUT7 or FUT7 and FUT9 were created by transducing FUT7− HL-60 with virus encoding for either FUT4 or FUT9 shRNA along with the puromycin resistance gene. These dual knockdown cell lines that were selected and maintained in growth media containing 0.5 μg/ml puromycin were termed FUT4−7− HL-60 and FUT7−9− HL-60. Triple knockdown HL-60s lacking all three FUTs were made by transducing FUT7−9− HL-60 cells with virus encoding for FUT4 shRNA. These cells, called FUT4−7−9− HL-60, carried an additional cerulean reporter. Virus generated using the pLKO.1 TRC cloning vector, where cerulean replaced the puromycin resistance gene, were also transduced into FUT7−9− HL-60 cells to serve as a negative control for the triple knockdown experiments. These last cells are called “FUT7−9− cerulean HL-60.” Stable gene expression was verified using quantitative real time PCR based on a previous study (primers are listed in supplemental Table S3) (14Marathe D.D. Chandrasekaran E.V. Lau J.T. Matta K.L. Neelamegham S.

HL-60 cells were resuspended in 30 mm HEPES buffer (30 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) containing 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% human serum albumin for all cytometry and cell adhesion studies described below. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used include anti-Lewis-X (LeX)/CD15 clone HI98, anti-CLA clone HECA-452, anti-sialyl Lewis X (sLeX)/CD15s clone CSLEX-1, anti-human PSGL-1/CD162 clone KPL-1, anti-human CD65s clone VIM-2, and isotype-matched controls. All reagents were from BD Biosciences, except mAb VIM-2 was from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Among these, the binding specificity of mAb HECA-452 is similar to that of CSLEX-1 because they both recognizes sLeX and related epitopes. Fluorescent mAbs (HECA-452, HI98, and KPL-1) or isotype-matched reagents were added to cells for 15 min at room temperature (RT) prior to cytometry analysis. Binding studies with unconjugated mAb (CSLEX-1) or biotinylated Aleuria aurantia (AAL) lectin (binds α1,3/4/6 fucose, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) involved 15 min of incubation of reagents with cells before addition of 1:200 diluted secondary Ab (goat anti-mouse IgM Alexa 488 for CSLEX-1 or fluorescein-conjugated anti-biotin for AAL) for another 15 min. Cytometry analysis was then performed. Although many of the flow cytometry studies utilized a BD FACSCalibur instrument, studies with cells expressing cerulean were analyzed using a BD LSR-II cytometer with appropriate lasers. Mouse neutrophils were isolated using the protocol described elsewhere (22Luo Y. Dorf M.E. Isolation of mouse neutrophils.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2001; (Chapter 3, Unit 3.20)Google Scholar). Briefly, age-matched WT C57BL/6 and Fut4−/−Fut7−/− mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Bone marrow cells collected from femur, tibia, and sternum in RPMI 1640 medium were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS.

https://openalex.org/W2061668975,"This study explored the novel use of iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles (<20 nm) as a vaccine delivery platform without additional adjuvants. A recombinant malaria vaccine antigen, the merozoite surface protein 1 (rMSP1), was conjugated to IO nanoparticles (rMSP1-IO). Immunizations in outbred mice with rMSP1-IO achieved 100% responsiveness with antibody titers comparable to those obtained with rMSP1 formulated with a clinically acceptable adjuvant, Montanide ISA51 (2.7×10–3 vs. 1.6×10–3; respectively). Only rMSP1-1O could induce significant levels (80%) of parasite inhibitory antibodies. The rMSP1-IO was highly stable at 4°C and was amenable to lyophilization, maintaining its antigenicity, immunogenicity, and ability to induce inhibitory antibodies. Further testing in nonhuman primates, Aotus monkeys, also elicited 100% immune responsiveness and high levels of parasite inhibitory antibodies (55–100% inhibition). No apparent local or systemic toxicity was associated with IO immunizations. Murine macrophages and dendritic cells efficiently (>90%) internalized IO nanoparticles, but only the latter were significantly activated, with elevated expression/secretion of CD86, cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL1-b, IFN-γ, and IL-12), and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL10). Thus, the IO nanoparticles is a novel, safe, and effective vaccine platform, with built-in adjuvancy, that is highly stable and field deployable for cost-effective vaccine delivery.—Pusic, K., Aguilar, Z., McLoughlin, J., Kobuch, S., Xu, H., Tsang, M., Wang, A., Hui, G.

https://openalex.org/W2077578501,"Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, where it is synthesized locally and plays a critical role in mitochondrial bioenergetic functions. The importance of CL in human health is underscored by the observation that perturbation of CL biosynthesis causes the severe genetic disorder Barth syndrome. To fully understand the cellular response to the loss of CL, we carried out genome-wide expression profiling of the yeast CL mutant crd1Δ. Our results show that the loss of CL in this mutant leads to increased expression of iron uptake genes accompanied by elevated levels of mitochondrial iron and increased sensitivity to iron and hydrogen peroxide. Previous studies have shown that increased mitochondrial iron levels result from perturbations in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. Consistent with an Fe-S defect, deletion of ISU1, one of two ISU genes that encode the mitochondrial Fe-S scaffolding protein essential for the synthesis of Fe-S clusters, led to synthetic growth defects with the crd1Δ mutant. We further show that crd1Δ cells have reduced activities of mitochondrial Fe-S enzymes (aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, and ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase), as well as cytosolic Fe-S enzymes (sulfite reductase and isopropylmalate isomerase). Increased expression of ATM1 or YAP1 did not rescue the Fe-S defects in crd1Δ. These findings show for the first time that CL is required for Fe-S biogenesis to maintain mitochondrial and cellular iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2042227355,"Circadian rhythms in metabolism, physiology, and behavior originate from cell-autonomous circadian clocks located in many organs and structures throughout the body and that share a common molecular mechanism based on the clock genes and their protein products. In the mammalian neural retina, despite evidence supporting the presence of several circadian clocks regulating many facets of retinal physiology and function, the exact cellular location and genetic signature of the retinal clock cells remain largely unknown. Here we examined the expression of the core circadian clock proteins CLOCK, BMAL1, NPAS2, PERIOD 1(PER1), PERIOD 2 (PER2), and CRYPTOCHROME2 (CRY2) in identified neurons of the mouse retina during daily and circadian cycles. We found concurrent clock protein expression in most retinal neurons, including cone photoreceptors, dopaminergic amacrine cells, and melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells. Remarkably, diurnal and circadian rhythms of expression of all clock proteins were observed in the cones whereas only CRY2 expression was found to be rhythmic in the dopaminergic amacrine cells. Only a low level of expression of the clock proteins was detected in the rods at any time of the daily or circadian cycle. Our observations provide evidence that cones and not rods are cell-autonomous circadian clocks and reveal an important disparity in the expression of the core clock components among neuronal cell types. We propose that the overall temporal architecture of the mammalian retina does not result from the synchronous activity of pervasive identical clocks but rather reflects the cellular and regional heterogeneity in clock function within retinal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2099516766,"Neutrophil apoptosis and subsequent nonphlogistic clearance by surrounding phagocytes are key to the successful resolution of neutrophilic inflammation, with dysregulated apoptosis reported in multiple human inflammatory diseases. Enhancing neutrophil apoptosis has proresolution and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical models of inflammation. Here we investigate the ability of the flavones apigenin, luteolin, and wogonin to induce neutrophil apoptosis in vitro and resolve neutrophilic inflammation in vivo. Human neutrophil apoptosis was assessed morphologically and by flow cytometry following incubation with apigenin, luteolin, and wogonin. All three flavones induced time- and concentration-dependent neutrophil apoptosis (apigenin, EC50=12.2 μM; luteolin, EC50=14.6 μM; and wogonin, EC50=28.9 μM). Induction of apoptosis was caspase dependent, as it was blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh and was associated with both caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation. Flavone-induced apoptosis was preceded by down-regulation of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1, with proteasomal inhibition preventing flavone-induced Mcl-1 down-regulation and apoptosis. The flavones abrogated the survival effects of mediators that prolong neutrophil life span, including lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, dexamethasone, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, by driving apoptosis. Furthermore, wogonin enhanced resolution of established neutrophilic inflammation in a zebrafish model of sterile tissue injury.

https://openalex.org/W2075486945,"The phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase (PI3K) family regulates diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and vesicular trafficking, through catalyzing 3'-phosphorylation of phosphoinositides. In contrast to class I PI3Ks, including p110α and p110β, functional roles of class II PI3Ks, comprising PI3K-C2α, PI3K-C2β, and PI3K-C2γ, are little understood. The lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) plays the important roles in regulating vascular functions, including vascular formation and barrier integrity, via the G-protein-coupled receptors S1P(1-3). We studied the roles of PI3K-C2α in S1P-induced endothelial cell (EC) migration and tube formation. S1P stimulated cell migration and activation of Akt, ERK, and Rac1, the latter of which acts as a signaling molecule essential for cell migration and tube formation, via S1P(1) in ECs. Knockdown of either PI3K-C2α or class I p110β markedly inhibited S1P-induced migration, lamellipodium formation, and tube formation, whereas that of p110α or Vps34 did not. Only p110β was necessary for S1P-iduced Akt activation, but both PI3K-C2α and p110β were required for Rac1 activation. FRET imaging showed that S1P induced Rac1 activation in both the plasma membrane and PtdIns 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P)-enriched endosomes. Knockdown of PI3K-C2α but not p110β markedly reduced PtdIns(3)P-enriched endosomes and suppressed endosomal Rac1 activation. Also, knockdown of PI3K-C2α but not p110β suppressed S1P-induced S1P(1) internalization into PtdIns(3)P-enriched endosomes. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis suppressed S1P-induced S1P(1) internalization, Rac1 activation, migration, and tube formation. These observations indicate that PI3K-C2α plays the crucial role in S1P(1) internalization into the intracellular vesicular compartment, Rac1 activation on endosomes, and thereby migration through regulating vesicular trafficking in ECs."
https://openalex.org/W2128459593,"Without chemotactic cues and structural support, cavitary brain lesions typically fail to recruit endogenous neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Toward resolving this, we engineered multifunctional biomaterials comprising injectable gelatin-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (Gtn-HPA) hydrogels and dextran sulfate/chitosan polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PCNs) that delivered stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). Over 7 d of interface with in vitro tissue simulant containing adult rat hippocampal NPCs (aNPCs) and their neuronal progeny, Gtn-HPA/SDF-1α-PCN hydrogels promoted chemotactic recruitment to enhance infiltration of aNPCs by 3- to 45-fold relative to hydrogels that lacked SDF-1α or vehicles to sustain SDF-1α release. When cross-linked with 0.85-0.95mM H2O2, Gtn-HPA/SDF-1α-PCN hydrogels provided optimally permissive structural support for migration of aNPCs. Specific matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors revealed that 42, 30, and 55% of cell migration into Gtn-HPA/SDF-1α-PCN hydrogels involved MMP-2, 3, and 9, respectively, demonstrating the hydrogels to be compatible toward homing endogenous NPCs, given their expression of similar MMPs. Interestingly, PCNs utilized FGF-2 found in situ to induce chemokinesis, potentiate SDF-1α chemotactic recruitment, and increase proliferation of recruited cells, which collectively orchestrated a higher number of migrated aNPCs. Overall, Gtn-HPA/SDF-1α-PCN hydrogels prove to be promising biomaterials for injection into cavitary brain lesions to recruit endogenous NPCs and enhance neural tissue repair/regeneration.—Lim, T.

https://openalex.org/W2005188958,"Objectives Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP2) is an intestinal growth factor that has been shown to stimulate intestinal growth and reduce disease severity in preclinical models of short bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Teduglutide, a recombinant human GLP2 variant (GLP2-2G), has increased half-life and stability as compared to the native GLP2 peptide, but still requires twice daily dosing in preclinical models and daily dosing in the clinic. The goal of this study was to produce and characterize the preclinical pharmacokinetic and therapeutic properties of GLP2-2G-XTEN, a novel, long-acting form of GLP2-2G. Methodology and Results A GLP2-2G-XTEN fusion protein with extended exposure profile was produced by genetic fusion of GLP2-2G peptide to XTEN, a long, unstructured, non-repetitive, hydrophilic sequence of amino acids. The serum half-life of GLP2-2G-XTEN in mice, rats and monkeys was 34, 38 and 120 hours, respectively. Intestinotrophic effects were demonstrated in normal rats, where GLP2-2G-XTEN administration resulted in a significant increase in both small intestine weight and length. Efficacy of the GLP2-2G-XTEN protein was compared to that of GLP2-2G peptide in a rat Crohn’s disease model, indomethacin-induced inflammation. Prophylactic administration of GLP2-2G-XTEN significantly increased the length, reduced the number of trans-ulcerations and adhesions, and reduced the TNFα content of the small intestine. GLP2-2G-XTEN demonstrated greater in vivo potency as compared to GLP2-2G peptide, and improvement in histopathology supported the GLP2-2G-XTEN treatment effects. Conclusions and Significance GLP2-2G-XTEN is intestinotrophic and demonstrates efficacy in a rat Crohn’s disease model requiring a lower molar dose and less frequent dosing relative to GLP2-2G peptide. Allometric scaling based on pharmacokinetics from mouse, rat and monkey projects a human half-life of 240 hours. These improvements in preclinical pharmacokinetics and dosing indicate that GLP2-2G-XTEN may offer a superior therapeutic benefit for treatment of gastrointestinal diseases including Crohn’s disease."

It has been demonstrated that the base sequence identity of a protospacer with the cognate spacer and the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) influence CRISPR-mediated interference efficiency. By using an original transformation assay with plasmids targeted by a resident spacer here we show that natural CRISPR-mediated immunity against invading DNA occurs in wild type Escherichia coli. Unexpectedly, the strongest activity is observed with protospacer adjoining nucleotides (interference motifs) that differ from the PAM both in sequence and location. Hence, our results document for the first time native CRISPR activity in E. coli and demonstrate that positions next to the PAM in invading DNA influence their recognition and degradation by these prokaryotic immune systems."

Here, we show that MC-deficient KitW/KitWv mice display increased neurodegeneration in the lesion area after brain trauma. Furthermore, MC-deficient mice display significantly more brain inflammation, namely an increased presence of macrophages/microglia, as well as dramatically increased T-cell infiltration at days 4 and 14 after injury, combined with increased astrogliosis at day 14 following injury. The number of proliferating Ki67+ macrophages/microglia and astrocytes around the lesion area is more than doubled in these MC-deficient mice. In parallel, MC-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice display increased presence of macrophages/microglia at day 4, and persistent astrogliosis at day 4 and 14 after brain trauma. Further analysis of mice deficient in one of the most relevant MC proteases, i.e., mouse mast cell protease 4 (mMCP-4), revealed that astrogliosis and T-cell infiltration are significantly increased in mMCP-4-knockout mice. Finally, treatment with an inhibitor of mMCP-4 significantly increased macrophage/microglia numbers and astrogliosis. These data suggest that MCs exert protective functions after trauma, at least in part via mMCP-4, by suppressing exacerbated inflammation via their proteases.—Hendrix, S., Kramer, P., Pehl, D., Warnke, K., Boato, F., Nelissen, S., Lemmens, E., Pejler, G., Metz, M., Siebenhaar, F., Maurer, M.

Prior studies have shown that FoxM1 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, including brain tumor, and plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. In this study we found that FoxM1 was up-regulated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) under heat shock stress condition in multiple cell lines. Knockdown of HSF1 with HSF1 siRNA or inhibition of HSF1 with a HSF1 inhibitor abrogated heat shock-induced expression of FoxM1. Genetic deletion of HSF1 in mouse embryo fibroblast cells also abolished heat shock stress-induced FoxM1 expression. Moreover, we showed that HSF1 directly bound to FoxM1 promoter and increased FoxM1 promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FoxM1 was required for the G(2)-M phase progression through regulating Cdc2, Cdc20, and Cdc25B under a mild heat shock stress but enhanced cell survival under lethal heat shock stress condition. Finally, in human glioblastoma specimens, FoxM1 overexpression correlated with elevated HSF1 expression. Our results indicate that FoxM1 is regulated by HSF1 and is critical for HSF1-mediated heat shock response. We demonstrated a novel mechanism of stress resistance controlled by HSF1 and a new HSF-FoxM1 connection that mediates cellular thermotolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1988887233,"The enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a multifunctional protein that can both degrade adenosine and bind extracellularly to adenosine receptors, acting as an allosteric modulator regulating the hormonal effects of adenosine. The molecular regions of ADA responsible for the latter are unknown. In this work, alanine scanning mutagenesis of various ADA amino acid stretches, selected through in silico docking experiments, allowed us to identify regions of the enzyme responsible for modulating both its catalytic activity and its ability to modulate agonist binding to A1 and A2A adenosine receptors (A1R and A2AR). The combination of computational and in vitro experiments show that the structural gate to the catalytic site; i.e., the α-1 helix containing residues L58-I72 and the loop containing residues A184-I188 of ADA, were important to maintain both the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and its action as an allosteric modulator of the adenosine receptors. These data are consistent with a predicted supramolecular assembly, in which ADA bridges A2AR and CD26 and are in line with the notion that the interaction of ADA with adenosine receptors has an important role in the immunosynapse.

https://openalex.org/W2014812571,"The D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) is widely expressed in the kidney and plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation. Although much is known about D1R desensitization, especially through G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4), comparatively little is known about other aspects of D1R trafficking and the proteins involved in the process. We now report the discovery of a dynamic interaction between sorting nexin 5 (SNX5), a component of the mammalian retromer, and D1R in human renal epithelial cells. We show that internalization of agonist-activated D1R is regulated by both SNX5 and GRK4, and that SNX5 is critical to the recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane. SNX5 depletion increases agonist-activated D1R phosphorylation (>50% at basal condition), prevents D1R internalization and cAMP response, and delays receptor recycling compared to mock siRNA-transfected controls. Moreover, renal restricted subcapsular infusion of Snx5-specific siRNA (vs. mock siRNA) decreases sodium excretion (Δ=-0.2±0.005 mEq/mg creatinine) and further elevates the systolic blood pressure (Δ=48±5 mm Hg) in spontaneously hypertensive rats, indicating that SNX5 depletion impairs renal D1R function. These studies demonstrate an essential role for SNX5 in regulating D1R function, which may have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications in the management of essential hypertension."

In cyanobacteria, plant plastids, and the apicoplast of the genus Plasmodium, a noncatalytic paralog of ClpP, termed ClpR, has been identified. ClpRs are found to form heterocomplexes with ClpP resulting in a ClpRP tetradecameric cylinder having less than 14 catalytic triads. The exact role of ClpR in such a complex remains enigmatic. Here we describe the x-ray crystal structure of ClpR protein heptamer from Plasmodium falciparum (PfClpR). This is the first structure of a ClpR protein. The structure shows that the PfClpR monomer adopts a fold similar to that of ClpP, but has a unique motif, which we named the R-motif, forming a β turn located near the inactive catalytic triad in a three-dimensional space. The PfClpR heptamer exhibits a more open and flat ring than a ClpP heptamer. PfClpR was localized in the P. falciparum apicoplast as is the case of PfClpP. However, biochemical and structural data suggest that, contrary to what has been observed in other organisms, PfClpP and PfClpR do not form a stable heterocomplex in the apicoplast of P. falciparum."

The erk5 gene was conditionally deleted under three different experimental conditions: prior to training for contextual fear, 6 days after training, or 5 weeks after training, We present evidence that remote memory was impaired under all three conditions. These data demonstrate that ongoing adult neurogenesis is required both for the initial establishment and the continued maintenance of remote contextual fear memory, even after the remote memory has transferred into extra-hippocampal regions of the brain 5 weeks after training."

Mutations in the PT complex cause the lysosomal storage diseases mucolipidosis II and III. A prerequisite for the enzymatic activity is the site-1 protease-mediated cleavage of the PT α/β-subunit precursor protein in the Golgi apparatus. Here, we have investigated structural requirements of the PT α/β-subunit precursor protein for its efficient export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Both wild-type and a cleavage-resistant type III membrane PT α/β-subunit precursor protein are exported whereas coexpressed separate α- and β-subunits failed to reach the cis-Golgi compartment. Mutational analyses revealed combinatorial, non-exchangeable dileucine and dibasic motifs located in a defined sequence context in the cytosolic N- and C-terminal domains that are required for efficient ER exit and subsequent proteolytic activation of the α/β-subunit precursor protein in the Golgi. In the presence of a dominant negative Sar1 mutant the ER exit of the PT α/β-subunit precursor protein is inhibited indicating its transport in coat protein complex II-coated vesicles. Expression studies of missense mutations identified in mucolipidosis III patients that alter amino acids in the N- and C-terminal domains demonstrated that the substitution of a lysine residue in close proximity to the dileucine sorting motif impaired ER-Golgi transport and subsequent activation of the PT α/β-subunit precursor protein. The data suggest that the oligomeric type III membrane protein PT complex requires a combinatorial sorting motif that forms a tertiary epitope to be recognized by distinct sites within the coat protein complex II machinery."

During growth on a two-carbon substrate, Escherichia coli diverts significant carbon flux to the glyoxylate bypass, an anapleurotic pathway that circumvents two decarboxylation steps in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (1.Kornberg H.L. The role and control of the glyoxylate cycle in Escherichia coli.Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The flux through the glyoxylate bypass is determined by the level of active isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), 2The abbreviations used are: IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase IDHKP isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase ACR absolute concentration robustness. a key tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme that is regulated by reversible phosphorylation by the bifunctional isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase (IDHKP). Phosphorylation by IDHKP inactivates IDH, limiting the synthesis of α-ketoglutarate and directing flux through the bypass. When E. coli is transferred to a substrate containing more than two carbons, IDHKP dephosphorylates IDH to reactivate the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the primary metabolic pathway. Maintaining precise control of IDH activity is thus essential for the ability of E. coli to switch between growth on two-carbon and other substrates. Phosphorylation of IDH by IDHKP has also served as a classic model system for studying the role of protein post-translational modification in complex cellular processes, and a number of fundamental biochemical discoveries were made from examination of the IDH regulatory system. IDH was the first substrate identified for a prokaryotic protein kinase, establishing that protein phosphorylation is not restricted to eukaryotes (2.Garnak M. Reeves H.C. Phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli.Science. 1979; 203: 1111-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). IDHKP was one of the earliest examples of a multifunctional enzyme to be discovered and characterized (3.LaPorte D.C. Koshland D.E. A protein with kinase and phosphatase activities involved in regulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle.Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the IDH regulatory system provided the original experimental basis for enzymatic zero-order ultrasensitivity (4.LaPorte D.C.

Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided experimental evidence that the IDH regulatory system exhibits robustness: the ability of a biochemical network to perform its correct function even as levels of the chemical species in the network fluctuate. During growth on acetate, IDH activity varied minimally even as the total amount of IDH present fluctuated 1.8-fold (natural variation between strains) and more than 20-fold (between natural levels and overproduction from a plasmid) (8.LaPorte D.C.

A distinctive feature of these systems is that (like the E. coli glyoxylate bypass) each contains a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes opposing post-translational modifications. These experimental results strongly suggest that bifunctional enzymes tend to confer robustness to biochemical processes. There have been longstanding efforts to understand this connection between bifunctionality and robustness theoretically, beginning with the suggestion by Russo and Silhavy (12.Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J.

Each of these studies relies on mathematical and numerical analysis of the underlying chemical reaction networks to derive expressions that predict robust behavior. The recent study by Shinar et al. (15.Shinar G. Rabinowitz J.D. Alon U. Robustness in glyoxylate bypass regulation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) of IDH robustness is representative of these systems-level analyses of bifunctional enzymes. They proposed a detailed chemical reaction network to describe how IDHKP interacts with IDH to regulate the glyoxylate bypass (Fig. 1A). At the center of their network is the ternary complex EIpI, where E denotes IDHKP and I and Ip denote active and inactive IDH, respectively. The putative formation of such a ternary complex is a direct consequence of having a bifunctional enzyme that can simultaneously bind two molecules of its substrate. Using mass-action kinetics, Shinar et al. (15.Shinar G. Rabinowitz J.D. Alon U. Robustness in glyoxylate bypass regulation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) derived a mathematical expression that shows that the ternary complex gives rise to approximately robust behavior in the IDH regulatory system. On the basis of this result, they concluded that their model provides an explanation for the experimental observation of robustness by LaPorte et al. (8.LaPorte D.C. Thorsness P.E. Koshland D.E. Compensatory phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase: a mechanism for adaptation to the intracellular environment.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction network of Shinar et al. (15.Shinar G. Rabinowitz J.D. Alon U. Robustness in glyoxylate bypass regulation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) makes two major assumptions about the biochemistry of the IDH regulatory system. Formation of the ternary complex EIpI requires that one molecule of IDHKP be able to simultaneously bind one phosphorylated and one unphosphorylated IDH, which implies that IDHKP must have separate active sites for its kinase and phosphatase activities. Additionally, although IDH is known to form an obligate homodimer in vivo (18.Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Structure of a bacterial enzyme regulated by phosphorylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), Shinar et al. (15.Shinar G. Rabinowitz J.D. Alon U. Robustness in glyoxylate bypass regulation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) opted to model it as a monomer. When Shinar et al. proposed their model, the crystal structure of IDHKP had not been determined, and the exact configuration of its active sites was an open question. However, detailed structural information about IDHKP has since been published (19.Zheng J. Jia Z. Structure of the bifunctional isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Nature. 2010; 465: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), revealing that the enzyme employs a single site for both its kinase and its phosphatase activities and switches between them using a conformational shift (Fig. 1B). It follows from these data that the ternary complex proposed by Shinar et al. (15.Shinar G. Rabinowitz J.D. Alon U. Robustness in glyoxylate bypass regulation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) cannot form and that their model needs to be amended. In this study, we show that these structural data and other biochemical information about IDH and IDHKP lead to a different model of the E. coli IDH regulatory system. Our model assumes that the IDHKP kinase and phosphatase reactions are catalyzed from the same active site and that dimerization of IDH is an important feature of the system. From mass-action analysis of our model, we derive a polynomial expression, an invariant, that relates the steady-state levels of the phospho-forms of the IDH dimer. The key invariant is obtained using algebraic techniques that do not require assigning numerical values to any of the parameters (i.e. the rate constants in the system). This approach allows us to develop a model that accurately reflects the biochemical complexity of the IDH regulatory system. We then study the behavior of the invariant numerically, given several experimentally justified assumptions about the system. Under these conditions, we find that the invariant predicts the robustness of active IDH to changes in total IDH levels, in agreement with existing experimental results. Here we outline the biochemical justification for the two major assumptions (shared active site on IDHKP and dimerization of IDH) of our model. Prior to the determination of the crystal structure of IDHKP, a number of mutagenesis studies suggested that the kinase and phosphatase activities might share a single active site. For instance, Stueland et al. (20.Stueland C.S. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. Mutation of the predicted ATP binding site inactivates both activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13775-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that mutation of a lysine residue in the ATP binding domain severely compromised both the kinase and the phosphatase activity of IDHKP. This result suggested that the two activities rely on the same ATP binding site, making it unlikely that the active sties could be located in structurally distinct regions. (This hypothesis was also supported by a photoaffinity labeling study (21.Varela I. Nimmo H.G. Photoaffinity labelling shows that Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase contains a single ATP-binding site.FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).) A kinetic study of two IDHKP mutants provided further evidence for the existence of a shared active site (22.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase: kinetic characteristics of the wild-type and two mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Vmax for the phosphatase reaction was shown to be inversely related to the kinase Vmax, suggesting that the activities are closely linked and possibly differentiated by a conformational shift (22.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase: kinetic characteristics of the wild-type and two mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Supporting these earlier experiments, the IDHKP structure of Zheng and Jia (19.Zheng J. Jia Z. Structure of the bifunctional isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Nature. 2010; 465: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) conclusively demonstrated that the active site is shared. IDHKP was found to have two domains, a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain where ATP binds and the kinase and phosphatase activities take place. AMP, a potent inhibitor of IDHKP kinase activity, binds between the domains and induces a conformational change to promote phosphatase activity. This structural information reveals that it is impossible for an IDHKP molecule to act simultaneously as a kinase and a phosphatase. Additionally, E. coli IDHKP is known to bind only to intact, dimeric IDH (23.McKee J.S. Hlodan R. Nimmo H.G. Studies of the phosphorylation of Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase. Recognition of the enzyme by isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase and effects of phosphorylation on its structure and properties.Biochimie. 1989; 71: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This absolute substrate specificity (which has recently been characterized on a structural level (24.Yates S.P. Edwards T.E. Bryan C.M. Stein A.J. Van Voorhis W.C. Myler P.J. Stewart L.J. Zheng J. Jia Z. Structural basis of the substrate specificity of bifunctional isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 8103-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) is so strong that replacing E. coli IDH with Bacillus subtilis IDH, which dimerizes and exhibits extensive sequence and structural homology with E. coli IDH, reduces the Km of IDHKP 60-fold for kinase activity and 3,450-fold for phosphatase activity (25.Singh S.K. Miller S.P. Dean A. Banaszak L.J. LaPorte D.C. Bacillus subtilis isocitrate dehydrogenase: a substrate analogue for Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7567-7573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to characterizing isolated IDHKP, Zheng and Jia (19.Zheng J. Jia Z. Structure of the bifunctional isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Nature. 2010; 465: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) also reported the structure of an IDH homodimer with an IDHKP bound to each half of the dimer. This structure revealed that the substrate recognition loop of IDHKP interacts extensively with both halves of the dimer, providing an explanation for why IDHKP fails to recognize monomeric IDH. These data strongly suggest that dimerization of IDH is essential to its function in the E. coli glyoxylate bypass. We now describe our model of the IDH regulatory system and the corresponding reaction network (see Fig. 2). The model makes several standard assumptions. We assume that all reactions follow a Michaelis-Menten scheme. Accordingly, we do not explicitly account for molecules of ATP or the ATPase activity of IDHKP. ATP is assumed to be maintained in excess at a constant concentration, and levels of ADP and Pi are also assumed to be constant. These assumptions are discussed in detail in Ref. 26.Xu Y. Gunawardena J. Realistic enzymology for post-translational modification: zero-order ultrasensitivity revisited.J. Theor. Biol. 2012; 311: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. We treat IDH as a homodimer that can take one of three forms, Ioo (neither monomer phosphorylated), Iop (one monomer phosphorylated), and Ipp (both monomers phosphorylated), and we assume that all IDH is dimerized (18.Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Structure of a bacterial enzyme regulated by phosphorylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Because no cooperative effects are known to occur between the two halves of the IDH homodimer (27.Dean A.M. Lee M.H. I. Koshland Jr., D.E. Phosphorylation inactivates Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase by preventing isocitrate binding.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20482-20486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we consider each phosphorylation to be an independent event and do not distinguish between the monophosphorylated forms (i.e. Iop = Ipo). Each IDH monomer can bind to one IDHKP (denoted as E), leading to the formation of three different ternary complexes: EIooE, EIopE, and EIppE. Thus, in our notation, the enzyme-substrate complex studied by Zheng and Jia (19.Zheng J. Jia Z. Structure of the bifunctional isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Nature. 2010; 465: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is EIooE. Each of these ternary complexes has one (dimeric) IDH attached to two molecules of IDHKP, the opposite of the ternary complex in the model of Shinar et al. (15.Shinar G. Rabinowitz J.D. Alon U. Robustness in glyoxylate bypass regulation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which consisted of one IDHKP bound to two units of IDH. Our model includes all possible binary and ternary complexes that can form between IDHKP and the various states of IDH. Additionally, IDHKP is allowed to act as either a kinase or a phosphatase when bound in a ternary complex. Because the two halves of the IDH dimer are independent, we assume that simultaneous double modifications (e.g. EIooE going to EIppE + E or EIppE going to EIooE + E) are unlikely. We exclude such reactions from the model. We also assume that the conformational change required for IDHKP to switch between kinase and phosphatase activity occurs on a much faster time scale than the catalytic steps (kcat = 9.8 × 10−2 s−1 for kinase activity and kcat = 6.5 × 10−2 s−1 for phosphatase activity, calculated from data in Ref. 22.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase: kinetic characteristics of the wild-type and two mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we do not include a reaction representing the shift between the IDHKP kinase and phosphatase activities. The two conformations are assumed to be in rapid equilibrium before the formation of each binary or ternary complex. Although the kinetics of the IDHKP shift have not been studied, similar conformational changes for other enzymes are known to occur many orders of magnitude faster than the IDHKP catalytic steps, supporting our assumption (28.Kern D. Zuiderweg E.R. P. The role of dynamics in allosteric regulation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 748-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Mass-action analysis of the reaction network in Fig. 2 yields a system of 10 ordinary differential equations (listed in Table 1). At steady state, these 10 differential equations give 10 polynomial equations, f1 = 0, …, f10 = 0, that involve the 10 species. For clarity, the species are written as x1, …, x10 (defined in Table 1) in Table 1 and in the supplemental material.TABLE 1Mass-action analysis of the IDH regulatory system Conclusions are based on mathematical analysis of the polynomial system and calculations involving the derived algebraic expressions. Symbolic algebraic and numerical calculations were performed using Mathematica 8.0 (Wolfram Research). A printout of a Mathematica notebook detailing the calculations is provided in the supplemental material. The actual notebook is available on request from the authors. Computation of reaction network deficiency was performed in MATLAB 7.12.0 (The MathWorks, Inc.) using a custom program developed by Guy Shinar and Eran Eden (Reaction Network Analyzer V1.0). Gröbner basis calculations were performed following the procedure described by Manrai and Gunawardena (29.Manrai A.K. Gunawardena J. The geometry of multisite phosphorylation.Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5533-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To derive Equation 2, a lexicographically ordered Gröbner basis was computed for the 10 polynomial equations in Table 1 with the variables ordered as x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x1, x3, x10, x2. Parameters for the numerical calculations were determined from kinetic data on IDHKP obtained by Miller et al. (22.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase: kinetic characteristics of the wild-type and two mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The parameters in the model (k1, …, k20) fall into six categories, on-rate, off-rate, and catalytic rate for IDHKP acting as a kinase, and the same for IDHKP acting as a phosphatase. We assumed that the on-rates are determined by the diffusion-limited interaction of IDH and IDHKP and set both at 1 × 108 m−1 s−1, a typical value for protein-protein diffusion-limited interactions (30.Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics.Portland Press Ltd. 2004; Google Scholar). We set the catalytic rate constants to the kcat values measured for IDHKP kinase and IDHKP phosphatase (22.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase: kinetic characteristics of the wild-type and two mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, we calculated the off-rates from the on-rates, catalytic rates, and Michaelis-Menten constants of Miller et al. (22.Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase: kinetic characteristics of the wild-type and two mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) according to the formula Km=koff+kcatkon(Eq. 1) As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we applied steady-state mass-action kinetics to the reaction network in Fig. 2 to obtain the system of polynomial equations in Table 1. From algebraic analysis of this polynomial system, we find that there is a polynomial expression, an invariant, involving only these three variables that holds in any positive steady state of the system (i.e. any steady state in which all 10 variables take strictly positive values). It has the form Ioo2+a2lop2+a3lpp2+a4loolop+a5looIpp+a6IopIpp=0(Eq. 2) where a2, …, a6 are algebraic combinations of the rate constants, normalized so that the coefficient of I2 is 1. The full expressions for the coefficients are given in the supplemental material. The above invariant provides important constraints on the levels of the three IDH phospho-forms at steady state and sheds light on the experimentally observed robustness of the IDH regulatory system, as discussed in the following section. Equation 2 is calculated by a method previously described in Ref. 29.Manrai A.K. Gunawardena J. The geometry of multisite phosphorylation.Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5533-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, as shown in the supplemental material.

https://openalex.org/W2059860905,"During rotavirus infection, replication and packaging of the viral genome occur in viral factories, termed viroplasms. The viral nonstructural protein NSP5 is a major building block of viroplasms; it recruits the viral polymerase VP1, the core protein VP2, and the ATPase NSP2 inside the viroplasm to form the viral replication complex. Here we report that NSP5 is a unique viral metalloprotein that coordinates a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster as demonstrated by the metal and labile sulfide contents, UV-visible light absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance. Point mutations in NSP5 allowed us to identify C171 and C174, arranged in a CX2C motif, as essential residues for cluster coordination. When coexpressed with NSP2, an NSP5 mutant devoid of the iron-sulfur cluster still forms viroplasm-like structures. The cluster is therefore neither involved in the interaction with NSP2 nor in the formation of viroplasm-like structures and thus presumably in viroplasm formation. Finally, we show using microscale thermophoresis that the iron-sulfur cluster modulates the affinity of NSP5 for single-stranded RNA. Because the cluster is near the binding sites of both the polymerase VP1 and the ATPase NSP2, we anticipate that this cluster is crucial for NSP5 functions, in either packaging or replication of the viral genome.—Martin, D., Charpilienne, A., Parent, A., Boussac, A., D'Autreaux, B., Poupon, J., Poncet, D.

https://openalex.org/W2123772311,"The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a homopentameric membrane protein that protects bacteria from hypoosmotic stress. Its mechanics are coupled to structural changes in the membrane, yet the molecular mechanism of the transition from closed to open states and the cooperation between subunits are poorly understood. To determine the early stages of channel activation, we have created a chemically addressable heteropentameric MscL, which allows us to selectively trigger only one subunit in the pentameric protein assembly. By employing a liposome leakage assay developed in house, we measured the size-exclusion limits of MscL (G22C homopentamer and WTG22C heteropentamer). Patch-clamp, single-channel conductance recordings were used to electrically characterize the various channel substates. We show that a decrease in the hydrophobicity of a pore residue in only one subunit breaks the energy barrier for gating and increases the pore diameter up to 10 Å. A further decrease on the hydrophobicity of the same pore residue in other subunits opens the channel further, up to a diameter of 25 Å. However, it is not sufficient for full opening of the channel. This suggests the presence of supplementary mechanisms other than only the hydrophobic gate for MscL opening and closing and/or insufficient expansion of the channel by hydrophobic gating in the absence of applied membrane tension."
https://openalex.org/W2039207927,"Repair of double-stranded DNA breaks in Escherichia coli is initiated by the RecBCD helicase that possesses two superfamily-1 motors, RecB (3' to 5' translocase) and RecD (5' to 3' translocase), that operate on the complementary DNA strands to unwind duplex DNA. However, it is not known whether the RecB and RecD motors act independently or are functionally coupled. Here we show by directly monitoring ATP-driven single-stranded DNA translocation of RecBCD that the 5' to 3' rate is always faster than the 3' to 5' rate on DNA without a crossover hotspot instigator site and that the translocation rates are coupled asymmetrically. That is, RecB regulates both 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' translocation, whereas RecD only regulates 5' to 3' translocation. We show that the recently identified RecBC secondary translocase activity functions within RecBCD and that this contributes to the coupling. This coupling has implications for how RecBCD activity is regulated after it recognizes a crossover hotspot instigator sequence during DNA unwinding."
https://openalex.org/W1986942704,"Globulins are an important group of seed storage proteins in dicotyledonous plants. They are synthesized during seed development, assembled into very compact protein complexes, and finally stored in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs). Here, we report a proteomic investigation on the native composition and structure of cruciferin, the 12 S globulin of Brassica napus. PSVs were directly purified from mature seeds by differential centrifugations. Upon analyses by blue native (BN) PAGE, two major types of cruciferin complexes of ∼ 300-390 kDa and of ∼470 kDa are resolved. Analyses by two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE revealed that both types of complexes are composed of several copies of the cruciferin α and β polypeptide chains, which are present in various isoforms. Protein analyses by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF)/SDS-PAGE not only revealed different α and β isoforms but also several further versions of the two polypeptide chains that most likely differ with respect to posttranslational modifications. Overall, more than 30 distinct forms of cruciferin were identified by mass spectrometry. To obtain insights into the structure of the cruciferin holocomplex, a native PSV fraction was analyzed by single particle electron microscopy. More than 20,000 images were collected, classified, and used for the calculation of detailed projection maps of the complex. In contrast to previous reports on globulin structure in other plant species, the cruciferin complex of Brassica napus has an octameric barrel-like structure, which represents a very compact building block optimized for maximal storage of amino acids within minimal space."

https://openalex.org/W2052419619,"Nab3 is an RNA-binding protein whose function is important for terminating transcription by RNA polymerase II. It co-assembles with Nrd1, and the resulting heterodimer of these heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-C (hnRNP)-like proteins interacts with the nascent transcript and RNA polymerase II. Previous genetic analysis showed that a short carboxyl-terminal region of Nab3 is functionally important for termination and is located far from the Nab3 RNA recognition domain in the primary sequence. The domain is structurally homologous to hnRNP-C from higher organisms. Here we provide biochemical evidence that this short region is sufficient to enable self-assembly of Nab3 into a tetrameric form in a manner similar to the cognate region of human hnRNP-C. Within this region, there is a stretch of low complexity protein sequence (16 glutamines) adjacent to a putative α-helix that potentiates the ability of the conserved region to self-assemble. The glutamine stretch and the final 18 amino acids of Nab3 are both important for termination in living yeast cells. The findings herein describe an additional avenue by which these hnRNP-like proteins can polymerize on target transcripts. This process is independent of, but acts in concert with, the interactions of the proteins with RNA and RNA polymerase and extends the relationship of Nab3 as a functional orthologue of a higher eukaryotic hnRNP."
https://openalex.org/W2034577771,"High-latitude northern ecosystems are experiencing rapid climate changes, and represent a large potential climate feedback because of their high soil carbon densities and shifting disturbance regimes. A significant carbon flow from these ecosystems is soil respiration (R(S), the flow of carbon dioxide, generated by plant roots and soil fauna, from the soil surface to atmosphere), and any change in the high-latitude carbon cycle might thus be reflected in R(S) observed in the field. This study used two variants of a machine-learning algorithm and least squares regression to examine how remotely-sensed canopy greenness (NDVI), climate, and other variables are coupled to annual R(S) based on 105 observations from 64 circumpolar sites in a global database. The addition of NDVI roughly doubled model performance, with the best-performing models explaining ∼62% of observed R(S) variability. We show that early-summer NDVI from previous years is generally the best single predictor of R(S), and is better than current-year temperature or moisture. This implies significant temporal lags between these variables, with multi-year carbon pools exerting large-scale effects. Areas of decreasing R(S) are spatially correlated with browning boreal forests and warmer temperatures, particularly in western North America. We suggest that total circumpolar R(S) may have slowed by ∼5% over the last decade, depressed by forest stress and mortality, which in turn decrease R(S). Arctic tundra may exhibit a significantly different response, but few data are available with which to test this. Combining large-scale remote observations and small-scale field measurements, as done here, has the potential to allow inferences about the temporal and spatial complexity of the large-scale response of northern ecosystems to changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W2044648422,"Fungal phospholipases are members of the fungal/bacterial group XIV secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s). TbSP1, the sPLA2 primarily addressed in this study, is up-regulated by nutrient deprivation and is preferentially expressed in the symbiotic stage of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Tuber borchii. A peculiar feature of this phospholipase and of its ortholog from the black truffle Tuber melanosporum is the presence of a 54-amino acid sequence of unknown functional significance, interposed between the signal peptide and the start of the conserved catalytic core of the enzyme. X-ray diffraction analysis of a recombinant TbSP1 form corresponding to the secreted protein previously identified in T. borchii mycelia revealed a structure comprising the five α-helices that form the phospholipase catalytic module but lacking the N-terminal 54 amino acids. This finding led to a series of functional studies that showed that TbSP1, as well as its T. melanosporum ortholog, is a self-processing pro-phospholipase A2, whose phospholipase activity increases up to 80-fold following autoproteolytic removal of the N-terminal peptide. Proteolytic cleavage occurs within a serine-rich, intrinsically flexible region of TbSP1, does not involve the phospholipase active site, and proceeds via an intermolecular mechanism. Autoproteolytic activation, which also takes place at the surface of nutrient-starved, sPLA2 overexpressing hyphae, may strengthen and further control the effects of phospholipase up-regulation in response to nutrient deprivation, also in the context of symbiosis establishment and mycorrhiza formation.Background: TbSP1 is a phospholipase A2 strongly up-regulated during the symbiotic phase of the truffle Tuber borchii.Results: An activated enzyme species composed of five α-helices is generated by self-proteolysis through an intermolecular reaction.Conclusion: TbSP1 autoproteolysis is a site-specific post-translational modification not involving the phospholipase active site.Significance: Autoproteolytic activation is described for the first time for a microbial PLA2, with possible implications for symbiosis establishment. Fungal phospholipases are members of the fungal/bacterial group XIV secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s). TbSP1, the sPLA2 primarily addressed in this study, is up-regulated by nutrient deprivation and is preferentially expressed in the symbiotic stage of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Tuber borchii. A peculiar feature of this phospholipase and of its ortholog from the black truffle Tuber melanosporum is the presence of a 54-amino acid sequence of unknown functional significance, interposed between the signal peptide and the start of the conserved catalytic core of the enzyme.

Based on their primary structures and enzymatic and subcellular localization properties, members of the PLA2 superfamily are classified into five main subfamilies: Ca2+-dependent secreted and cytosolic PLA2s, Ca2+-independent PLA2s, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases, and lysosomal PLA2s (1Murakami M.

Secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s), which comprise 14 different groups of enzymes from a variety of organisms and tissues, are the most diverse and populated PLA2 subfamily (1Murakami M. Taketomi Y. Miki Y.

Biochem. 2011; 150: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In accordance with their extracellular localization, most sPLA2s have an N-terminal secretion signal peptide that is cleaved upon internalization into the endoplasmic reticulum (or into the periplasmic space in the case of bacterial enzymes) (2Dennis E.A.

Animal sPLA2s belonging to groups IB and X also bear a propeptide sequence upstream to the N terminus of the mature protein (1Murakami M. Taketomi Y. Miki Y. Sato H. Hirabayashi T. Yamamoto K.

One of the best characterized of these zymogen-like phospholipases is a human group IB sPLA2, named pro-hG1B, which is secreted from pancreatic acinar cells in an inactive form and is activated by trypsin via proteolytic elimination of an inhibitory N-terminal heptapeptide (10Mayer J.M.

This propeptide, which is thought to play a role in the folding process, can also be cleaved off by thrombin, plasmin, and a trypsin-like type 1-proPLA2 activator (12Rae D. Beechey-Newman N.

A number of metazoan sPLA2 structures have been determined in recent years (2Dennis E.A. Cao J. Hsu Y.H. Magrioti V. Kokotos G. Phospholipase A2 enzymes.

Gelb M.H. Biochemistry and physiology of mammalian secreted phospholipases A2.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 495-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). An extensive structural similarity, particularly within the catalytic and the calcium-binding sites, between otherwise distinct metazoan sPLA2s (e.g. group I, group II, and group III phospholipases) has been revealed by these studies (2Dennis E.A. Cao J. Hsu Y.H. Magrioti V. Kokotos G. Phospholipase A2 enzymes. Physical structure, biological function, disease implication, chemical inhibition, and therapeutic intervention.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 6130-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In contrast, a strikingly distinct folding topology, with five instead of three α-helices and no antiparallel β-sheet, has been reported for a phospholipase A2 from the soil bacterium Streptomyces violaceoruber (15Matoba Y. Katsube Y. Sugiyama M. The crystal structure of prokaryotic phospholipase A2.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20059-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), belonging to group XIV sPLA2s. The founding member of this group of enzymes, designated as the “symbiotic fungus/bacteria” group (2Dennis E.A. Cao J. Hsu Y.H. Magrioti V. Kokotos G. Phospholipase A2 enzymes. Physical structure, biological function, disease implication, chemical inhibition, and therapeutic intervention.Chem.

A nutrient-regulated, dual localization phospholipase A2 in the symbiotic fungus Tuber borchii.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5079-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), where it is strongly up-regulated by nutrient deprivation and preferentially expressed during symbiosis establishment and mycorrhiza formation (16Soragni E.

The TbSP1 phospholipase shares a number of primary structure features with its bacterial homolog, including the CXRHDF active site consensus sequence and the presence of only two disulfide bonds. However, a notable difference is the presence of a 54-amino acid sequence in the TbSP1 polypeptide, interposed between the signal peptide and the start of the polypeptide region homologous to the Streptomyces enzyme (Fig. 1). Three additional fungal sPLA2s homologous to TbSP1 but lacking the above mentioned polypeptide insertion have been characterized in recent years (19Nakahama T. Nakanishi Y. Viscomi A.R. Takaya K. Kitamoto K. Ottonello S. Arioka M. Distinct enzymatic and cellular characteristics of two secretory phospholipases A2 in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.Fungal Genet.

Secretory phospholipases A2 induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In addition, a number of putative group XIV sPLA2s (listed in supplemental Fig. S1) have been identified in the genomes of various recently sequenced filamentous fungi (mainly ascomycetes), but none of them seems to share the N-terminal polypeptide extension present in TbSP1 and in the orthologous sPLA2 from the related ectomycorrhizal fungus Tuber melanosporum (21Martin F.

Perigord black truffle genome uncovers evolutionary origins and mechanisms of symbiosis.Nature. 2010; 464: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) (TmelPLA2; Fig. 1). Despite the mixed, prokaryotic/eukaryotic composition of group XIV phospholipases A2 and the preponderance of fungal enzymes within this group (see supplemental Fig. S1), no structural information is available, so far, on fungal sPLA2s. Similarly unknown is the potential functional significance of the N-terminal polypeptide extension found in TbSP1 and in the orthologous phospholipase TmelPLA2 (Fig. 1). To address these questions, recombinant TbSP1 lacking the signal peptide but containing the N-terminal polypeptide extension characteristic of the protein isolated from T. borchii mycelia was crystallized and subjected to x-ray diffraction analysis. Surprisingly, the N-terminal sequence extension was found to be missing from the crystal structure, which otherwise revealed an overall domain architecture of the catalytic module closely resembling that of the Streptomyces sPLA2. This finding, which pointed to a self-cleavage reaction taking place within the time required for crystallization, was confirmed and extended by targeted experiments carried out in solution. These showed that both recombinant TbSP1 (as well as the orthologous sPLA2 from T. melanosporum) and the protein isolated from T. borchii mycelia are indeed capable of region-specific autoproteolytic processing. This endoproteolytic reaction, which is temperature-dependent, but not Ca2+-dependent, and occurs intermolecularly, is independent from phospholipase activity and leads to the production of a shortened (14.5-kDa) and catalytically activated form of the enzyme. Autoproteolytic activation may thus strengthen and further control the effects of TbSP1 up-regulation in response to nutrient deprivation, perhaps also in the context of symbiosis establishment and mycorrhiza formation. Recombinant TbSP1 (rTbSP1) was purified from the soluble fraction and from inclusion bodies of BL21-Origami 2 (BL21-Ori; Novagen) and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (BL21-CP; Stratagene) Escherichia coli cells transformed with the pET28b-TbSP1 plasmid (16Soragni E. Bolchi A. Balestrini R. Gambaretto C. Percudani R. Bonfante P. Ottonello S. A nutrient-regulated, dual localization phospholipase A2 in the symbiotic fungus Tuber borchii.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5079-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Following induction by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich), cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and inclusion bodies, recovered in the pellet, were subjected to a second round of sonication in washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 2 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, pH 8.0), followed by an additional centrifugation step. The pellet was resuspended in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 8.0) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and the resulting solution was then dialyzed against urea-containing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 m urea, pH 8.0), followed by protein refolding, carried out by stepwise dialysis against a 6 to 0 m urea gradient. Protein recovery in the soluble fraction was maximal following induction for 6 h at 30 °C or for 4 h at 37 °C for BL21-Ori and BL21-CP cells, respectively. rTbSP1-containing extracts from either strain were loaded onto HisTrap FF Crude columns (1 ml; GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear 20–500 mm imidazole gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) using an ÄKTAprime protein purification system (Amersham Biosciences). rTbSP1 derived from the soluble fraction was further purified by chromatography on a HiTrap Q FF column (1 ml; GE Healthcare), which was eluted with a linear, 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The purity of individual column fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The final yield of purified rTbSP1 was about 8 mg and 0.5 mg of protein/liter for the BL21-Ori and the BL-CP strain, respectively. The same purification procedure, with a similar yield of purified protein, was applied to BL21-CP cells transformed with a pET28b construct (pET28-TmelPLA2) bearing a cDNA coding for the orthologous sPLA2 from T. melanosporum. The TmelPLA2 cDNA (534 bp) was isolated from a free-living mycelium cDNA library prepared from the homokaryotic strain Mel28 (21Martin F. Kohler A. Murat C. Balestrini R. Coutinho P.M. Jaillon O. Montanini B. Morin E. Noel B. Percudani R. Porcel B. Rubini A. Amicucci A. Amselem J. Anthouard V. Arcioni S. Artiguenave F. Aury J.M. Ballario P. Bolchi A. Brenna A. Brun A. Buée M. Cantarel B.

The expression vector pET26 (Novagen), containing an N-terminal pelB signal sequence, was used for secretory production of rTbSP1. The pET26-TbSP1 plasmid was constructed by incorporating an NcoI site into pro-TbSP1 via PCR amplification (see supplemental Table 1 for the sequences of the amplification primers), followed by insertion of the stop codon containing amplicon into NcoI-digested pET26. Transformants were pregrown at 37 °C in LB medium (A600 = 1.0) and induced for 15 h at 20 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 10 min, pro-TbSP1 was recovered (and concentrated) from the culture medium by ammonium sulfate fractionation (70% saturation at 4 °C with 2-h stirring on ice followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min). Following desalting by ultrafiltration, the protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q FF column as described above and then purified to homogeneity by reverse phase chromatography (see below). The yield of secreted, homogeneously purified pro-TbSP1 obtained with this expression system was about 1 mg/liter of culture medium. His-tagged rTbSP1, derived from the soluble fraction of BL21-Ori cells and supplemented with 20 mm CaCl2 prior to the final purification step (HiTrap Q FF), and the same protein from which the His tag had been removed by thrombin cleavage were utilized for crystallization trials, which were performed with the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. Crystals were obtained with both protein samples after 30 days of incubation at room temperature in the presence of different salt solutions; 2.0 m ammonium sulfate (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) or 0.5 m potassium thiocyanate (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6) for His-tagged TbSP1 (15 mg/ml, dissolved in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8) or 2.0 m ammonium sulfate (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, plus 2% polyethylene glycol 200) for the tag-free form of TbSP1 (13 mg/ml, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8) was equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, buffer with 2% PEG 200. All drops contained 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals were harvested into a cryoprotective solution containing 10% (v/v) 2R,3R-butane diol in reservoir buffer, mounted in a nylon loop, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. In order to overcome the crystallographic phase problem, crystals were harvested into cryoprotective buffer containing 250 mm NaI or alternatively pressurized with 15-bar xenon gas for 15 min before flash-cooling in liquid N2. This quick soaking approach yielded data sets of native protein derivatized with a substantial number of individual but weakly occupied iodide or xenon sites. Data from the derivatized crystals were collected on a rotating anode x-ray generator (MicroMax 007, Rigaku) with a mar345dtb image plate detector (Marresearch) at an x-ray wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The reflections were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL suite (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38518) Google Scholar). The positions of anomalous scatterers were located with SHELXD (23Sheldrick G.M. A short history of SHELX.Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab PLA2 activity was measured by quantifying free linoleic acid released from 2-linoleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Sigma-Aldrich) using a colorimetric assay (NEFA-HR(2), Wako). Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 40 μl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm phospholipid substrate dissolved in 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, plus 1 or 0.025 μm enzyme for the 22- and 14.5-kDa forms of TbSP1, respectively. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, 7-μl aliquots of each reaction mixture were treated with NEFA-HR(2) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by determination of absorbance at 546 nm and quantification of the released fatty acids using oleic acid as an external standard. Autoproteolytic activity was routinely assayed by incubating recombinant TbSP1, TbSP1-thioredoxin (Trx) fusion proteins, or the natural protein purified from T. borchii mycelia (see below) at a concentration of 20 μm for various lengths of time (from a few min up to several h, depending on the source of the protein and on reaction conditions) in 20 mm Tris-HCl at 37 °C. Proteolytically inactive pro-TbSP1 derived from inclusion bodies was used as substrate (30 μm) for some experiments, as specified unde"
https://openalex.org/W1986328076,"The statistical validation of database search results is a complex issue in bottom-up proteomics. The correct and incorrect peptide spectrum match (PSM) scores overlap significantly, making an accurate assessment of true peptide matches challenging. Since the complete separation between the true and false hits is practically never achieved, there is need for better methods and rescoring algorithms to improve upon the primary database search results. Here we describe the calibration and False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimation of database search scores through a dynamic FDR calculation method, FlexiFDR, which increases both the sensitivity and specificity of search results. Modelling a simple linear regression on the decoy hits for different charge states, the method maximized the number of true positives and reduced the number of false negatives in several standard datasets of varying complexity (18-mix, 49-mix, 200-mix) and few complex datasets (E. coli and Yeast) obtained from a wide variety of MS platforms. The net positive gain for correct spectral and peptide identifications was up to 14.81% and 6.2% respectively. The approach is applicable to different search methodologies--separate as well as concatenated database search, high mass accuracy, and semi-tryptic and modification searches. FlexiFDR was also applied to Mascot results and showed better performance than before. We have shown that appropriate threshold learnt from decoys, can be very effective in improving the database search results. FlexiFDR adapts itself to different instruments, data types and MS platforms. It learns from the decoy hits and sets a flexible threshold that automatically aligns itself to the underlying variables of data quality and size."
https://openalex.org/W2003883485,"While pharmacological inhibition of Akt kinase has been regarded as a promising anti-cancer strategy, most of the Akt inhibitors that have been developed are enzymatic inhibitors that target the kinase active site of Akt. Another key cellular regulatory event for Akt activation is the translocation of Akt kinase to the cell membrane from the cytoplasm, which is accomplished through the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt. However, compounds specifically interacting with the PH domain of Akt to inhibit Akt activation are currently limited. Here we identified a compound, lancemaside A (LAN-A), which specifically binds to the PH domain of Akt kinase. First, our mass spectra analysis of cellular Akt kinase isolated from cells treated with LAN-A revealed that LAN-A specifically binds to the PH domain of cellular Akt kinase. Second, we observed that LAN-A inhibits the translocation of Akt kinase to the membrane and thus Akt activation, as examined by the phosphorylation of various downstream targets of Akt such as GSK3β, mTOR and BAD. Third, in a co-cultured cell model containing human lung epithelial cancer cells (A549) and normal human primary lung fibroblasts, LAN-A specifically restricts the growth of the A549 cells. LAN-A also displayed anti-proliferative effects on various human cancer cell lines. Finally, in the A549-luciferase mouse transplant model, LAN-A effectively inhibited A549 cell growth with little evident cytotoxicity. Indeed, the therapeutic index of LAN-A in this mouse model was >250, supporting that LAN-A is a potential lead compound for PH domain targeting as a safe anti-cancer Akt inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2082556958,"The functions of calnuc, a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein with multiple structural domains and diverse interacting partners, are yet unknown. We demonstrate unknown facets of calnuc, which is a serine protease in which Ser-378 of GXSXG motif, Asp-328 of DTG motif, and His-339 form the ""catalytic triad,"" locating the enzyme active site in the C-terminal region. Analogous to the active site of Zn(2+) carboxypeptidases, calnuc has two high affinity (K(d) ∼ 20 nm), well conserved Zn(2+)-binding sites near its N terminus, although it is inactive as a peptidase. Zn(2+) binding allosterically and negatively regulates the serine protease activity of calnuc, inhibition being caused by an ""open to close"" change in its conformation not seen upon Ca(2+) binding. Most strikingly, interaction with G protein α subunit completely inhibits the enzymatic activity of calnuc. We thus illustrate that G proteins and Zn(2+) act as two ""keys"" that control enzymatic activity of calnuc, arresting it in ""locked"" state. Calnuc, therefore, exists dynamically in two different forms, (i) as a Ca(2+)-binding protein in Zn(2+)-bound form and (ii) as a protease in Zn(2+)-free form, commissioning it to perform multiple functions."
https://openalex.org/W2115423151,"Familial cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency is more common in some East Asian populations than elsewhere, suggesting the possibility of a selective advantage of this genetic defect against regional infectious diseases. Historically, infection with the Asian blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum has been endemic in these regions, including Japan. We previously reported that eggs of S. japonicum require cholesteryl ester uptake from normal high-density lipoprotein (HDL) but not from CETP-deficient HDL for their maturation to miracidia, a critical step of the hepatic pathogenesis of schistosomiasis. Herein we show that cholesteryl ester uptake is selective from HDL, and identified CD36-related protein (CD36RP) as a candidate to mediate the reaction. CD36RP was cloned from the adult and the egg developmental stages of S. japonicum, with 1880 bp encoding 506 amino acid residues exhibiting the CD36 domains and two transmembrane regions. Using antibodies against recombinant peptides representing the potential extracellular domains of CD36RP, Western blotting detected a protein with a molecular mass of 82 kDa in the particulate fraction of the adult parasite cells, which was reduced to 62 kDa after N-glycanase treatment. The extracellular domain peptide bound human HDL, as established by immunoblots following nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Antibodies against the extracellular domain suppressed HDL cholesteryl ester uptake and maturation of the eggs in vitro. CD36RP is a candidate receptor on eggs of S. japonicum that facilitates uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester necessary for egg embryonation and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2002324515,"Obesity promotes increased secretion of a number of inflammatory factors from adipose tissue. These factors include cytokines and very lately, extracellular matrix components (ECM). Biglycan, a small leucine rich proteoglycan ECM protein, is up-regulated in obesity and has recently been recognized as a pro-inflammatory molecule. However, it is unknown whether biglycan contributes to adipose tissue dysfunction. In the present study, we characterized biglycan expression in various adipose depots in wild-type mice fed a low fat diet (LFD) or obesity-inducing high fat diet (HFD). High fat feeding induced biglycan mRNA expression in multiple adipose depots. Adiponectin is an adipokine with anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing effects. Due to the importance of adiponectin, we examined the effect of biglycan on adiponectin expression. Comparison of adiponectin expression in biglycan knockout (bgn−/0) and wild-type (bgn+/0) reveals higher adiponectin mRNA and protein in epididymal white adipose tissue in bgn−/0 mice, as well higher serum concentration of adiponectin, and lower serum insulin concentration. On the contrary, knockdown of biglycan in 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to decreased expression and secretion of adiponectin. Furthermore, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with conditioned medium from biglycan treated macrophages resulted in an increase in adiponectin mRNA expression. These data suggest a link between biglycan and adiponectin expression. However, the difference in the pattern of regulation between in vivo and in vitro settings reveals the complexity of this relationship."

https://openalex.org/W2056811392,"The relationship between sequence polymorphisms and human disease has been studied mostly in terms of effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leading to single amino acid substitutions that change protein structure and function. However, less attention has been paid to more drastic sequence polymorphisms which cause premature termination of a protein’s sequence or large changes, insertions, or deletions in the sequence. We have analyzed a large set (n = 512) of insertions and deletions (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphisms causing premature termination of translation in disease-related genes. Prediction of protein-destabilization effects was performed by graphical presentation of the locations of polymorphisms in the protein structure, using the Genomes TO Protein (GTOP) database, and manual annotation with a set of specific criteria. Protein-destabilization was predicted for 44.4% of the nonsense SNPs, 32.4% of the frameshifting indels, and 9.1% of the non-frameshifting indels. A prediction of nonsense-mediated decay allowed to infer which truncated proteins would actually be translated as defective proteins. These cases included the proteins linked to diseases inherited dominantly, suggesting a relation between these diseases and toxic aggregation. Our approach would be useful in identifying potentially aggregation-inducing polymorphisms that may have pathological effects."
