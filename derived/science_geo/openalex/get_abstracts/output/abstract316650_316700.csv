Although models of how the ocean and the atmopshere interact are meant to forecast the greenhouse warming of the next century, they can`t even get today`s climate right. So the amount of heat and moisture flowing between a model`s atmosphere and ocean are adjusted until it approximates the present climate. In a study out of MIT, Nakamura, Stone, and Marotzke report that they deliverately introduced an error into a climate model, then seemingly adjusted the error away, only to find that it still hampered the model`s ability to predict future climates. The implication is that flux adjustments disguise, but may not correct a model`s underlying defects. This article discusses the broader aspects of the finding."

https://openalex.org/W1977252581,"The Hague, Netherlands, last month welcomed 2000 astronomers from around the world for the 22nd General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). From 15 to 27 August, they participated in symposia and discussions on topics ranging from the down-to-Earth issue of light and radio-frequency pollution to the creation of elements at the farthest reaches of time and space, in the big bang. Some of the most striking news, however, came in new findings from our galaxy and its immediate surroundings."

This is especially true not only because of the far-reaching significance of the discovery, but also because British scientists have been known to be at odds concerning the reconstruction of the skull in question. It will be recalled that Dr Smith Woodward regarded the Piltdown specimen as the type of a new genus of the family Hominidae, to which he gave the name Eoanthropus dawsoni, and which was defined primarily by the characters of the mandible. Of the mandible only the right ramus with first and second molar teeth in situ was at first discovered. The condyle and symphysis were both lacking, but the fragment was of sufficient size to enable Dr Smith Woodward to reconstruct the symphysis with a fair degree of accuracy. It was the reconstruction of the cranium about which differences of opinion arose between Dr Smith Woodward and Professor Elliot Smith on the one hand and Professor Arthur Keith on the other. Of the brain case nine fragments, parts of the frontal, parietal occipital, and temporal, were found. From these Dr Smith Woodward reconstructed a skull with a capacity of about o1076 cc. On the other hand a reconstruction by Professor Keith gave to the skull a brain capacity of 1500oo cc., in other words that of a welldeveloped modern European skull. After further study Dr Smith"
