https://openalex.org/W1514077182,"A soluble extract prepared from human cells (KB S-100) has been recently shown to direct accurate transcription initiation by purified RNA polymerase II at the major late promoter of adenovirus 2. We have fractionated this extract by chromatography on phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose, and DNA-cellulose, and have identified four components that are required for the active and selective initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II at this promoter. One of these components seems to act by suppressing random, but not selective, transcription by RNA polymerase II. All but one of these components have been shown to be chromatographically distinct from the factors involved in directing selective transcription by RNA polymerase III."
https://openalex.org/W1561042132,"Cell-free extracts (S-100) prepared from cultured mammalian KB cells have previously been shown to direct accurate and selective transcription of class III genes by RNA polymerase III. We have fractionated the KB S-100 and have found that multiple components are essential for the accurate transcription of these genes. After the S-100 has been separated into four different protein fractions by chromatography on phosphocellulose, two fractions are required, in addition to RNA polymerase III, for active and selective transcription of the virus-associated RNAI gene of adenovirus 2 and a tRNA gene; a third fraction is required, along with these components, for the reconstitution of 5 S RNA gene transcription. At least two of these components are distinct from the four factors required for accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Matsui, T., Segall, J., Weil, P. A., and Roeder, R. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11992-11996)."

https://openalex.org/W1566493820,"The eighth component of human complement (C8) has been purified in high yield from Cohn Fraction III and characterized with regard to its physicochemical properties and subunit structure. The purified product was found to be similar to functional C8 isolated from plasma or serum. Human C8 possesses a molecular weight of 151,000 and is composed of a 1:1:1 ratio of three nonidentical subunits: alpha (Mr = 64,000), beta (Mr = 64,000), and gamma (Mr = 22,000). These subunits occur as a covalently linked alpha-gamma dimer which is noncovalently associated with beta. After purification and characterization of alpha, beta, and gamma, each was found to possess different amino acid compositions and NH2-terminal sequences. Both alpha and beta subunits contain similar but exceptionally high percentages of hydrophobic aromatic amino acids. As measured by circular dichroism, the secondary structure of C8 contains 12% alpha-helix, 24% beta structure, and 64% unordered structure, values typical of globular proteins. Complete secondary structure, as well as hemolytic activity, can be recovered after exposure to 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride or 8 M urea. The alpha-gamma and beta subunits were dissociated and isolated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and after removal of detergent, neither was found to possess independent hemolytic activity. Significantly, activity equivalent to that of native C8 was generated when alpha-gamma and beta were recombined in an equimolar ratio. These results indicate that C8 is an atypical serum protein with regard to both its subunit structure and denaturation characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1523963034,"The asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of chick embryo fibroblast glycoproteins were previously shown to derive from a common lipid-linked precursor, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. The formation of this precursor oligosaccharide was examined in intact chick embryo fibroblasts, NIL-8 cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The labeling kinetics and compositions of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides were examined, and the results indicate that lipid-linked Man5GlcNAc2 is rapidly assembled (< 1.5 min) and then extended (< 2.5 min) to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 via the intermediate Man8GlcNAc2. Chain elongation from Man5GlcNAc2- to Man8GlcNAc2-lipid probably occurs by addition of single mannose residues. The pool of lipid-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 turns over with a half-time of 3.5 to 6 min; since there is little if any degradation (the mannose residues do not turn over), this reflects the rate at which completed chains are transferred to acceptor proteins. The same intermediates and similar kinetics were observed in all three cell types. Oligosaccharide-lipid assembly was also examined in cells in which protein synthesis was decreased (using actinomycin D to depress levels of mRNA) or abolished (using cycloheximide). The results indicate that the rate of oligosaccharide-lipid synthesis is proportional to the rate of protein synthesis. The regulated step is prior to the Man5GlcNAc2 stage, and we suggest that the most likely control mechanism is limitation of available oligosaccharide carrier lipid."
https://openalex.org/W1559876918,"The Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of a number of proteins in the cytosol of the rat or guinea pig cerebral cortex was profoundly stimulated by phosphatidylserine; calmodulin, on the other hand, had only a minimal effect. The Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of different proteins from the total particulate fraction of the same tissue, in comparison, was specifically stimulated by either phosphatidylserine or calmodulin. The present findings, in line with the phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent protein kinase recently recognized, suggest an involvement of phospholipid in regulating Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous substrate proteins. This new system presumably functions independent or in a complementary manner with the calmodulin-sensitive Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation system previously reported by others."
https://openalex.org/W1507649645,"Plasma lipoproteins containing either the B (apo-B) or E (apo-E) apoproteins, e.g. apo-B low density lipoproteins (LDL) isolated from normolipemic humans and apo-E-containing cholesterol-induced high density lipoproteins (apo-E HDLc) isolated from cholesterol-fed dogs, suppress phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced lymphocyte activation and inhibit early events such as mitogen-enhanced 45Ca2+ accumulation and late events such as enhanced DNA synthesis. On a molar basis, apo-E HDLc are 3.5 times more effective than apo-B LDL in inhibiting 45Ca2+ accumulation by 50% and 3.8 times more effective than apo-B LDL in suppressing DNA synthesis by 50%. Both lipoproteins bind to the lymphocyte surface, and in competitive binding assays apo-E HDLc and apo-B LDL bind to the same receptors. These receptors, termed immunoregulatory receptors, comprise a homogeneous class of binding sites which do not act cooperatively. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for apo-B LDL is 2.0 X 10(-7) M at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C; the Kd for apo-E HDLc is 9.3 X 10(-8) M at 4 degrees C and 7.3 X 10(-8) M at 37 degrees C. At saturation, 16,000 and 20,000 LDL particles are bound/cell at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively. The corresponding values for apo-E HDLc are 6,700 at 4 degrees C and 5,500 at 37 degrees C. The increased effectiveness of apo-E HDLc in supp]ressing the PHA-induced Ca2+ accumulation and DNA synthesis is due to the multiple receptor binding of apo-E HDLc. At 37 degrees C, each apo-E HDLc particle occupies multiple receptors at a ratio of 3.6:1 relative to apo-B LDL. The enhanced affinity of apo-E HDLc most likely results from the multiple interactions of this lipoprotein with the receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1518769145,"The phosphorylation sites of spectrin dimer were characterized before and after incubation of intact human red cells with [32P]orthophosphate. Phosphate measurements of unlabeled spectrin dimer show it contains 4.0 +/- 0.3 covalent protein phosphates, all located on band 2. Quantitation of the number of exchangeable phosphorylation sites in erythrocytes labeled with [32P]orthophosphate yields 3.9 +/- 0.3 phosphates/spectrin dimer, indicating that all four spectrin phosphorylation sites are metabolically active. Tryptic and chymotryptic peptide mapping reveals that the dimer contains three unique 32P-labeled tryptic peptides of approximately 4,600 (A1), 3,500 (A2), and 2,400 (B) daltons. Peptide A1 contains both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine while peptides A2 and B possess only phosphoserine. Peptides A1 and A2 remain associated after trypsinization of spectrin dimer and are only separable in detergents. All three 32P-labeled tryptic peptides are contained within a 20,000 dalton cyanogen bromide fragment which is within a 60,000 dalton staphylococcal protease phosphopeptide. All these fragments are found within a 90,000 dalton nitrothiocyanobenzoic acid phosphopeptide. The purified 20,000 dalton fragment contains no homoserine or homoserine lactone and is the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide of band 2. The isolated tryptic peptide B possesses no lysine or arginine and is presumably the COOH-terminal tryptic peptide of band 2 and the most distal phosphopeptide. Thus, the four phosphorylation sites of spectrin dimer are clustered at the extreme COOH-terminal end of band 2."

https://openalex.org/W1606524691,"We have attempted a biochemical characterization of the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) of cultured HeLa cells. The HeLa MAPs consist of a group of three polypeptides of 200,000 to 220,000 molecular weight (the 210K MAP) and a protein of 125,000 molecular weight (the 125K MAP). The solution properties of the HeLa MAPs were examined using molecular sieve chromatography and sucrose gradient sedimentation. With both analytical procedures, the 125K and 210K MAPs behaved independently of one another. The effects of each of the MAPs on microtubule polymerization were also studied. Both the 125K and 210K MAPs stimulated the polymerization of pure tubulin. The effect of high levels of MAPs on microtubule polymerization was also examined. Increasing the concentration of MAPs at a constant tubulin concentration increased both the rate and extent of microtubule polymerization. The 125K and 210K MAPs showed independent behavior with respect to binding to microtubules. The 210K MAP saturated its binding sites at a level of 14.0% (210K MAP:tubulin in polymer, w/w), while the 125K MAP showed no saturation even at a level of 18.3%. These results demonstrate that the 125K and 210K MAPs are distinct molecular species, differing in their solution properties and their binding to microtubules. The 210K MAP showed some similarities and some differences when compared to the porcine brain high molecular weight MAP. The HeLa MAPs, although showing some properties similar to brain MAPs, are nevertheless distinctive in several respects and may best be considered as separate though possibly related species."

https://openalex.org/W1586126707,"Using native glucagon and [12-homoarginine]glucagon (analogue A), prepared in high yield and purity by new procedures, we have synthesized the following glucagon analogues by semisynthetic methods: [1-deshistidine][12-homoarginine]glucagon (analogue B); N alpha-carbamoylglucagon (analogue C); N alpha, N epsilon-dicarbamoylglucagon (analogue D); [1-N alpha-carbamoylhistidine, 12-N epsilon-trinitrophenyllsyine]glucagon (analogue II); [1-deshistidine] [2-N alpha-trinitrophenylserine, 12-homoarginine]glucagon (analogue III); and [1-N alpha-trinitrophenylhistidine, 12-homoarginine]glucagon (analogue IV). The introduction of hydrophylic groups at the alpha- and epsilon-amino positions of glucagon results in a reduction in potency. The alpha-position is also involved in biological activity. Carbamylation of the alpha-position results in a partial agonist (analogues C and D). The introduction of hydrophobic groups and the neutralization of the positive charge at the alpha- and epsilon-amino positions result in glucagon antagonists (analogues II, III, and IV). [1-N alpha-Trinitrophenylhistidine, 12-homoarginine]glucagon (analogue IV) is the most potent inhibitor tested. Based on its competitive inhibitory action, this analogue appears to have about one-third the affinity of glucagon for the receptor site. These modifications at the epsilon-amino position cause an increase in the secondary structure of the peptide (as shown by circular dichroism studies) which may be related to their biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W1575215027,"Glycine decarboxylase, tentatively called P-protein and considered a constituent of the glycine cleavage system, was purified to apparent homogeneity from chicken liver mitochondria. P-protein is a homodimer having a Mr = approximately 200,000 and consisting of identical subunits with Mr = approximately 100,000. Each subunit appears to contain an equimolar pyridoxal 5'-phosphate which is bound to the protein, possibly through a protonated aldimine linkage. The isoelectric point of P-protein was 7.2. P-protein could bind glycine, showing a Kd of 33 mM for it, and could catalyze glycine decarboxylation even though the rate of decarboxylation catalyzed by P-protein alone was extremely low. The product of glycine decarboxylation was methylamine and the Km for glycine. Methylamine could bind to P-protein, giving a Kd value of 63 mM, and it inhibited the glycine decarboxylation. P-protein alone could also slightly catalyze the exchange of carboxyl carbon of glycine with CO2 and the exchange appeared to obey a ping-pong mechanism. Both glycine decarboxylation and the glycine-CO2 exchange catalyzed by P-protein were stimulated 100-fold or more by the addition of lipoic acid, which is a functional group of H-protein. We may define P-protein as glycine decarboxylase although P-protein alone exhibits only very low catalytic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1503794954,"An adhesion-deficient variant, designated M3A, was derived from the anchorage-dependent L6 skeletal muscle myoblast line (Schubert, D., and La Corbiere, M. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11557-11563). To investigate the defect in the M3A variant, adhesion to various substrata was studied. M3A adhered rapidly to substrate-attached material (SAM) prepared from L6 cultures and serum, but adhered slowly to SAM derived from M3A itself. The role of collagen and fibronectin in the adhesion of M3A cells to L6- and M3A-derived SAMs was ruled out, but several experiments suggested that glycosaminoglycans play a rate-limiting role in the adhesion process. The adhesive interaction of the M3A cells with the different substrata is specific with respect to the glycosaminoglycans involved, since the type and concentration of purified glycosaminoglycans required to inhibit the interaction is unique to each surface. An alteration in glycosaminoglycan synthesis by M3A cells may account for the difference in the adhesive properties of SAM derived from L6 and from the M3A variant."

https://openalex.org/W1555461829,"Calcium ion induces rapid depolymerization of microtubules, and the mechanism of interaction of Ca2+ with cytoskeletal components may be metabolically significant. The sufficiency of an endwise depolymerization model for describing calcium-induced disassembly was demonstrated by three criteria: (a) correlation of the observed time course of disassembly with the initial polymer length distribution using a kinetic model described elsewhere (Kristofferson, D., Karr, T. L., and Purich, D. L. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8567-8572); (b) observation that the initial rate of calcium-induced disassembly parallels the microtubule number of concentration which is experimentally manipulated by mechanical shearing; and (c) determination of the average polymer length, microtubule number concentration, and extent of depolymerization at various levels of added calcium ion to achieve successive partial disassembly extents. The rate constant for protomer release and other aspects of the disassembly mechanisms are also presented. Critical concentration measurements at low calcium ion levels are also consistent with endwise interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1490013763,"Beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase has been purified from an acetone extract of Aspergillus niger. The protein has a Mr = 149,000. It contains neither Mn2+, Zn2+, nor cysteine and exhibits no cation requirement for activity. Isoelectric focusing separates two isozymes; the major isoenzyme has a pI = 4.4. Both isozymes exhibit beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and beta-glucosidase, as well as glucosaminidase activity. The mechanism of action of this enzyme has been studied in detail using a variety of substrate structure/activity and kinetic experiments. Rate data plotted versus pH depends on the following ionization constants, respectively: for pKm, 2.95; for log Kcat, 7.6; and for log kcat/Km, 2.95 and 8.25. The kcat value of H2O/D2O for p-nitrophenyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminide hydrolysis is 1.27 at pH 4.6 and 1.00 at pH 7.0. The rho value for the hydrolysis of para-substituted phenylglucosaminides is +0.36; rho for the hydrolysis of fluoro-substituted N-acetyl derivatives is -1.41. Two sulfur-containing substrate analogues, the 1-thioglucosaminide, and the N-thioacetyl derivative, exhibit either no or little substrate activity. The hydrolysis of the 2,4-dinitrophenyl-glucosaminide is not biphasic as indicated by stopped flow kinetic studies. These several results are interpreted to show that: 1) enzymatic nucleophilic catalysis is not employed by beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase; 2) the glycosidic oxygen is protonated very early in the reaction, perhaps even in the Michaelis complex; 3) the acetamido oxygen provides anchimeric assistance to hydrolysis via charge stabilization of the oxocarbonium ion (or via oxazoline formation); 4) additional charge stabilization is provided by an enzymic anion, perhaps a side chain carboxylate group. The role of the acetamido group is discussed and comparisons are made between lysozyme, beta-galactosidase, and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase."
https://openalex.org/W1916344039,"Abstract The mechanisms of transport of pyridoxine (PN) and pyridoxal (PL) into erythrocytes have been investigated using the rapid-mixing technique with 3H-labeled substrates. Erythrocytes take up PN by passive diffusion as indicated by the fact that the initial influx process is nonsaturable and is not affected by pyridoxamine (PM), PL, or 4'-deoxypyridoxine. Transport of PL has the same characteristics. The transport of both PN and PL is temperature-dependent with a sharp increase in rate of uptake between 15 and 20 degrees C. The accumulation of 3H from [3H]PN against a concentration gradient was the result of phosphorylation. When the phosphorylation of [3H]PN was reduced by adding 160 microM unlabeled PN, PL, PM, or 4'-deoxypyridoxine, the cell:medium concentration ratio for 3H did not exceed unity. In contrast, with [3H]PL, 1.6 mM concentrations of these unlabeled substrates did not reduce the cell:medium concentration ratio of 3H. This kinase-in-dependent accumulation of PL against a concentration gradient, in the absence of evidence for mediated transport, suggested that binding by an intracellular protein was responsible. Evidence for such binding was obtained from Sephadex G-75 gel filtration, ultrafiltration, and equilibrium dialysis studies with [3H]PL. Reduction of the PL x protein complex with NaBH4 resulted in a stable pyridoxyl protein. The high binding capacity and the molecular weight by gel filtration suggest that hemoglobin is the binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1604990278,"Aspartic acid beta-[3H]methyl ester has been isolated from proteolytic digests of [3H]methylated human red blood cell membranes. The digestion product was identified by its co-elution with an ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and thin layer chromatography. The rate of hydrolysis of the methyl group of the isolated compound was determined at serveral pH values and was found to be identical with that of aspartic acid beta-methyl ester. This radioactive compound could be isolated from membranes prepared from broken cells incubated with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine or from intact cells incubated with L-[methyl-3H]methionine. NO evidence was obtained for the presence of glutamic acid gamma-methyl ester in these digests. We suggest on the basis of these results that a major site of protein methylation in human red blood cell membrane proteins is at aspartyl residues."

https://openalex.org/W1510488434,"Prior studies have described two functionally distinct ligand-binding sites on whole diphtheria toxin, the NAD site, which catalyzes the intracellular ADP-ribosylation reaction, and the P site, which affects toxin binding to sensitive cells. Occupancy of the P site by ATP or other phosphorylated compounds inhibits toxin attachment to cells. Here we show that binding of NAD site and P site ligands is competitive; and we characterize ligand-binding properties of two mutant forms of the toxin, CRM 45 and CRM 197. The data suggest that the NAD site, on the A moiety, lies immediately adjacent to the P site, formed by a strongly cationic region on the COOH-terminal half of B. The cationic character of the P site slightly alters the substrate specificity of the NAD site, and occupancy of either of the sites blocks ligand binding to the other. Possible roles of the P site in toxin attachment are discussed."

The sequence is highly conserved among chloroplastid 4.5 S RNAs but not related to either the 5 S or 5.8 S rRNA species. When compared with 4.5 S RNAs from other origins, the results indicate that this molecule bears little sequence homology to the mammalian nuclear 4.5 S RNA but suggest that chloroplastid 4.5 S RNA may be related to the bacerial 4.5 S species. An estimate for the secondary structure of the wheat 4.5 S molecule was deduced from products of limited pancreatic and T1 ribonuclease digestion, and similarities with the Escherichia coli 4.5 S RNA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1480058557,"Uptakes of radioactive C1- or 1- by gastric microsomal vesicles were stimulated 2- to 8-fold by AtP. The sensitivity of those uptakes to a C1- in equilibrium OH- ionophore and to osmotic swelling suggested they were due to transport rather than to binding. The ATP effect was labile, but dithiothreitol and methanol improved its stability. The stimulation of anion transport required magnesium; GTP and UTP were less potent than ATP whereas ADP and AMP had no effect. The apparent Km for ATP was estimated to be 2 X 10(-4) M at 22 degrees C. The rate of the ATP-dependent transport showed saturation-type kinetics, with half-maximal uptake at 10 mM for I- and 15 mM for C1-. Nonradioactive C1-, I-, and SCN- competed with 125I- uptake while SO42- did not. K+ valinomycin increased the ATP-dependent C1- uptake. The thermostable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases inhibited the effect of ATP. These results suggest the existence of an anion conductance, permeant to C1-, I-, and SCN- and nonpermeant to SO42-, which could be linked to a cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1552857544,"Poly(A+) RNA (RNA containing a polyadenylic acid sequence) was isolated from individual livers of rats fed standard lab chow, fasted, or fasted and refed a high carbohydrate diet. The level of functional mRNA coding for pyruvate kinase was assayed using a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system. The total 35S incorporation into newly synthesized liver pyruvate kinase was measured and compared to 35S incorporation into albumin, total trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins, and released polypeptide chains. The relative level of mRNA coding for liver pyruvate kinase decreases almost 60% upon fasting and increases approximately 15-fold upon refeeding with a high carbohydrate diet for 24 h. These observed changes in the amount of mRNA coding for liver pyruvate kinase agree with the previously reported changes in the relative rates of liver pyruvate kinase synthesis measured in vivo during these dietary stresses. Thus, it is suggested that the alterations in the amount of pyruvate kinase in liver in response to these dietary stresses primarily result from alteration in the amount of functional mRNA coding for the enzyme."

Illumination of ATP with ultraviolet light (253.7 nm) in the presence of various proteins resulted in photoinduced cross-linking only with Fraction II of diphtheria toxin. Under the same conditions, NAD was cross-linked most effectively to Fragment A, followed by Fraction II and CRM 45. For both ATP and NAD, the degree of protein labelling correlated well with binding data, suggesting that photoinduced cross-linking ocurred only at the high affinity binding sites for these ligands. Nonspecific labeling of unrelated proteins was consistently less than 5% of that observed for Fraction II. Analysis of nicked and reduced Fraction II . ligand complexes on SDS polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that essentially all of the cross-linked label migrated with the A fragment, whether photolysis was performed with ATP or NAD."
https://openalex.org/W1558900502,"When two different inhibitors, which are unrelated in structure, inhibit transport by binding to the carrier on the same side of the membrane, it is important for an understanding of the mechanism to decide whether they add to a single common site or to two separate sites. To help resolve this problem, kinetic tests are described for determining whether the inhibitors compete with one another. The test involves measuring the inhibition produced by the inhibitors when acting alone or together. The rate observed with both inhibitors present is then compared with that predicted from the separate inhibitions, for the case of either one or two inhibition sites. The test is applied to the inhibition of glucose transport in erythrocytes by cytochalasin B and the steroids androstenedione and androstanedione. These inhibitors were previously shown to bind to sites which are distinct from the substrate site and which are only present in the inward-facing form of the carrier. Cytochalasin B is now found to compete with the steroids. This finding, together with the earlier evidence that both inhibitors sterically protect the carrier against reaction with fluorodinitrobenzene, leads us to conclude that a single site binds both types of inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1503362678,"The luminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum has been shown to possess a fatty acid reductase based on the stimulation of the aldehyde-dependent luminescent reaction on incubation of the enzyme with ATP, NADPH, and tetradecanoic acid (Riendeau, D., and Meighen, E. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7488-7490). A direct, luciferase-independent assay for the fatty acid reductase has now been developed using [3H]tetradecanoic acid as substrate and thin layer chromatography to separate and identify the products of the reaction. Tritiated aldehyde was the only product of the reaction at early times of assay, and the amount produced was linearly dependent on time and extract concentration. The labeled aldehyde was further reduced to alcohol after prolonged incubation, indicating that long chain aldehyde reductase(s) are also present in bioluminescet bacteria. Measurement of the fatty acid reductase activity in extracts during growth and development of the bioluminescent bacteria showed that the fatty acid reductase activity is co-induced with luciferase, suggesting that these enzymes are coordinately regulated and directly implicating the fatty acid reductase in aldehyde biosynthesis in the bacterial bioluminescent system."

The tubulin can be obtained about 90% electrophoretically pure in 2 to 3 h without glycerol or GTP. It retains its ability to bind colchicine. Compared to tubulin purified by the assembly-disassembly procedure, affinity-purified tubulin has a higher critical concentration for polymerization and the purified protein appears to be free of high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins. Tubulin binding to the lactoperoxidase affinity column protects the colchicine binding site against decay at 4 degrees C, whereas the interaction of tubulin with soluble lactoperoxidase does not."
https://openalex.org/W1536218079,"Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (at 55.3 MHz) have been obtained of 19F-2H double-labeled phospholipids in pure lipid bilayers, and of 2H-labeled lipid in a 19F-labeled bilayer, as a function of concentration, to assess the perturbing influence of 19F sites in lipid hydrocarbon chains. Order parameters of 2H-labeled sites adjacent to C-8 myristic fluorine probes in pure lipid bilayers, and 19F spin label order parameters themselves, are about 30% lower than those deduced from the use of nonperturbing 2H probes. The effect is intramolecular rather than intermolecular and presumably represents increased gauche states due to the increased size of the 19F label. This effect is consistent with the view that difluoromethylene fatty acyl chains function in a manner approximating that of unsaturated fatty acyl chains. The differences disappear in the presence of cholesterol at very high order parameters (Smol approximately 0.8 to 0.9). These results represent the first attempt at elucidating the perturbing effects of a high sensitivity probe (19F) and indicate that caution must be used when using spectroscopic probes to deduce the absolute magnitude of hydrocarbon chain order parameters."

However, in cells obtained by scraping the intestine, the enzyme was mostly inactive (phosphorylated) and could be activated several-fold on incubation with a crude phosphatase preparation. Reductase activity in microsomes from ileal epithelial cells could be inactivated extensively by incubation with Mg . ATP in the absence of any exogenous factors. When cells isolated in phosphate-buffered saline were incubated in bicarbonate-containing buffers, there was a time-dependent decrease in the apparent activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase with little change in the total activity of the enzyme. On transferring the cells to a buffer without bicarbonate, the decrease in the apparent activity of the enzyme was fully reversed. There was no change in both the apparent and the total activities of reductase when cells were incubated in buffers lacking bicarbonate. Sterol synthetic rates in isolated intestinal cells were reflective of the fraction of reductase in the active form. These results strongly suggest the operation of a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism for short term modulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase activity in the intact mucosal cell. The bicarbonate anion appears to function as an activator of this modulation system."
https://openalex.org/W1634496113,"Aggregates of double-walled rings (46 nm diameter) were formed upon warming (37 degrees C) ion exchange purified bovine brain tubulin (1.5 to 2.0 mg/ml) in the presence of 1.0 mM ATP and 5.0 mM Mg2+. The formation of aggregated rings was blocked by GDP (1.0 mM), but when GTP (1.0 mM) was added subsequently, the block was overcome. Warming in the presence of ATP and GTP simultaneously produced a mixture of microtubules and aggregated rings. The tubulin preparations used were demonstrated to be devoid of transphosphorylase, and it is therefore clear that the action of ATP in the induction of aggregated rings was not mediated by transphosphorylation. These results are consistent with an interaction of nucleotide with tubulin at a site distinct from the previously described N- and E-sites."
https://openalex.org/W1526375803,"A variant of the anchorage-dependent L6 skeletal muscle myoblast cell line which grows in suspension culture was selected. This cell line, designated M3A, is aneuploid and tumorigenic, while the parental L6 line is near diploid and nontumorigenic. L6 secretes high molecular weight collagen alpha-chains, and M3A secretes a collagen-like protein of Mr = 56,000, or approximately half the size of collagen alpha-chains. Finally, both L6 and M3A synthesize hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and chondroitin. The latter glycosaminoglycan is not, however, released into the culture medium by M3A, nor is it found in the substrate-attached material synthesized by M3A. The changes in secreted and substrate-attached material synthesized by M3A are discussed in relation to its altered growth characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1579500147,"The nonenzymatic reduction of methemoglobin by the reduced form of flavin mononucleotide was studied under various conditions by following the reaction with a stopped flow apparatus. The reaction was very fast, compared with the reduction of the flavin by NADPH-flavin reductase of human erythrocytes, and followed a second order rate law: the rate constant (K) for the reduction of methemoglobin by reduced flavin mononucleotide was determined to be 5.5 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 25 degrees C. The reaction was not influenced by changing phosphate buffer concentration from 10 to 100 mM. The rate of reduction at the physiological pH, 7.0, was about 95% of the maximal value that observed at around pH 6.4. Formation of deoxyhemoglobin and oxidized form of flavin mononucleotide by the reaction proceeded stoichiometrically in a ratio of unity. These results apparently indicate that the limiting step for the reduction of methemoglobin by the NADPH-flavin reductase system in human erythrocytes is the enzymatic reduction of flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1527856315,"Abstract Knowledge of the position and characteristics of the four spectrin phosphorylation sites (Harris, H. W., Jr., and Lux, S. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11512-11520) was used to study the kinetics of spectrin phosphorylation in the intact red cell. Incubation of intact erythrocytes in the presence of [32P]orthophoshate produced a simultaneous increase in the specific activities of all the spectrin phosphorylation sites. The dephosphorylation of spectrin followed an identical pattern. Spectrin phosphate turnover in intact red cells was then quantitatively compared to isotope labeling patterns produced by phosphorylation of spectrin in various cell-free systems (in vitro phosphorylation). 33P-Labeled spectrin dimer, prepared by preincubation of red cells in [33P]orthophosphate, was phosphorylated by a spectrin kinase preparation (Hosey, M. M., and Tao, M. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 482, 348-357) and [gamma-32P]ATP. Under conditions where no dephosphorylation occurred as judged by loss of 33P label, 0.46 +/- 0.1 mol of 32P-labeled phosphate was incorporated/mol of spectrin dimer. The exogenous 32P label was located in a position and ratio identical with that of the endogenous 33P lebel. Similar results were obtained when the membrane-bound spectrin present in ghosts was phosphorylated using the procedure of Birchmeier and Singer (1977) J. Cell Biol. 73, 647-659). These data indicate that within the intact red cell all of the spectrin phosphates possess an identical rate of isotope exchange and approximately 90% of the spectrin phosphorylation sites are occupied. The remaining 10% may be phosphorylated in vitro by soluble or membrane-bound spectrin kinase in a pattern that is identical with that of the intact erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1540961092,"Solvent extracts of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens contain 2-[3, 7, 11, 15-tetramethylhexadecyl]-3, 5, 6-trimethyl-benzoquinol (deoxy-alpha-tocopherolquinol) that can serve as an alternate electron donor for alpha-tocopherolquinol for the biohydrogenation of cis-9, trans-11-octadecadienoate. In addition, the cell extracts contain deoxy-alpha-tocopherolquinone. This compound arises metabolically from alpha-tocopherolquinone via dehydration to trimethylphytylbenzoquinone followed by hydrogenation to deoxy-alpha-tocopherolquinone. Although the hydrogenation of the isoprene double bond and the conjugated fatty acid both use NADH as the primary reductant, the two reactions appear to be catalyzed by different enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1591300185,"Abstract Sindbis 42 S genome RNA was isolated from virions and translated in vitro before and after purification by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation under denaturing conditions. In intact 42 S RNA, only the 5'-proximal initiation site for the synthesis of nonstructural proteins was used. The internally located start site for viral structural protein formation was active in broken genome RNA molecules where, as a consequence of fragmentation, it was closer to a 5' end. The results of several kinds of experiments indicate that the fragmentation-dependent synthesis of structural proteins directed by virion RNA was not due to the presence of 26 S subgenomic messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1664134243,"The effects of beta-endorphin and various enkephalins on protein synthesis in eukaryotic cell-free systems have been examined. Beta-Endorphin, Leu-enkephalin, and Met-enkephalin inhibit the incorporation of radioactive leucine into globin in the presence of reticulocyte poly(A)+ RNA and of radioactive phenylalanine into polyphenylalanine in the presence of poly(U); however, the poly(U)-dependent synthesis of polyphenylalanine from Phe-tRNA is not inhibited. the aminoacylation of tRNAPhe is markedly inhibited by enkephalin, indicating that the sensitive component is Phe-tRNA synthetase. Other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are not significantly affected. The interaction between enkephalin and Phe-tRNA synthetase is reversible; activity is restored by dialysis of enzyme-enkephalin reaction mixtures. Morphine, vasopressin and analogues of vasopressin, and enkephalin analogues such as [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin and [D-Ala2,Met]enkephalinamide have no effect on translation. The results suggest that the effects on protein synthesis are probably not related to opiate effects."
