The avoidance of large-scale plasma instabilities called disruptions within these reactors2,3 is one of the most pressing challenges4,5, because disruptions can halt power production and damage key components. Disruptions are particularly harmful for large burning-plasma systems such as the multibillion-dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project6 currently under construction, which aims to be the first reactor that produces more power from fusion than is injected to heat the plasma. Here we present a method based on deep learning for forecasting disruptions. Our method extends considerably the capabilities of previous strategies such as first-principles-based5 and classical machine-learning7–11 approaches. In particular, it delivers reliable predictions for machines other than the one on which it was trained—a crucial requirement for future large reactors that cannot afford training disruptions. Our approach takes advantage of high-dimensional training data to boost predictive performance while also engaging supercomputing resources at the largest scale to improve accuracy and speed. Trained on experimental data from the largest tokamaks in the United States (DIII-D12) and the world (Joint European Torus, JET13), our method can also be applied to specific tasks such as prediction with long warning times: this opens up the possibility of moving from passive disruption prediction to active reactor control and optimization. These initial results illustrate the potential for deep learning to accelerate progress in fusion-energy science and, more generally, in the understanding and prediction of complex physical systems. Using data from plasma-based tokamak nuclear reactors in the US and Europe, a machine-learning approach based on deep neural networks is taught to forecast disruptions, even those in machines on which the algorithm was not trained."

These remodellers function in most aspects of genome utilization including transcription-factor binding, DNA replication and repair1,2. Although they are frequently mutated in cancer3, it remains largely unclear how the four mammalian remodeller families (SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD and INO80) orchestrate the global organization of nucleosomes. Here we generated viable embryonic stem cells that lack SNF2H, the ATPase of ISWI complexes, enabling study of SNF2H cellular function, and contrast it to BRG1, the ATPase of SWI/SNF. Loss of SNF2H decreases nucleosomal phasing and increases linker lengths, providing in vivo evidence for an ISWI function in ruling nucleosomal spacing in mammals. Systematic analysis of transcription-factor binding reveals that these remodelling activities have specific effects on binding of different transcription factors. One group critically depends on BRG1 and contains the transcriptional repressor REST, whereas a non-overlapping set of transcription factors, including the insulator protein CTCF, relies on SNF2H. This selectivity readily explains why chromosomal folding and insulation of topologically associated domains requires SNF2H, but not BRG1. Collectively, this study shows that mammalian ISWI is critical for nucleosomal periodicity and nuclear organization and that transcription factors rely on specific remodelling pathways for correct genomic binding."

In this sense, this study: i) evaluated the effect of Azospirillum brasilense on the initial development of maize genotypes; ii) investigated the influence of A. brasilense inoculation on NUE under nitrogen deficit; and iii) sought for more NUE genotypes with higher responsiveness to A. brasilense inoculation. Twenty-seven maize genotypes were evaluated in three independent experiments. The first evaluated the initial development of maize genotypes with and without A. brasilense (strain Ab-V5) inoculation of seeds on germination paper in a growth chamber. The second and third experiments were carried out in a greenhouse using Leonard pots and pots with substrate, respectively, and the genotypes were evaluated at high nitrogen, low nitrogen and low nitrogen plus A. brasilense Ab-V5 inoculation. The inoculation of seeds with A. brasilense Ab-V5 intensified plant growth, improved biochemical traits and raised NUE under nitrogen deficit. The inoculation of seeds with A. brasilense can be considered an economically viable and environmentally sustainable strategy for maize cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W2936150432,"Tuberculosis (TB) infection was responsible for an estimated 1.3 million deaths in 2017. Better diagnostic tools are urgently needed. We sought to determine whether accurate TB antigen detection in blood or urine has the potential to meet the WHO target product profiles for detection of active TB.We developed Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassays for Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and ESAT-6 detection with detection limits in the pg/ml range and used them to compare the concentrations of the two antigens in the urine and serum of 81 HIV-negative and -positive individuals with presumptive TB enrolled across diverse geographic sites.LAM and ESAT-6 overall sensitivities in urine were 93% and 65% respectively. LAM and ESAT-6 overall sensitivities in serum were 55% and 46% respectively. Overall specificity was ≥97% in all assays. Sensitivities were higher in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative patients for both antigens and both sample types, with signals roughly 10-fold higher on average in urine than in serum. The two antigens showed similar concentration ranges within the same sample type and correlated.LAM and ESAT-6 can be detected in the urine and serum of TB patients, regardless of the HIV status and further gains in clinical sensitivity may be achievable through assay and reagent optimization. Accuracy in urine was higher with current methods and has the potential to meet the WHO accuracy target if the findings can be transferred to a point-of-care TB test."

Three variable selection algorithms namely: Correlation-based feature selection (CFS), Partial least squares regression (PLS) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) were tested for their diagnostic performance. For each selected set of metabolites and the panel consists of metabolites common in three selection algorithms so-called overlapping set (OL), support vector machine (SVM) models were developed for which parameter selection was performed busing 10-fold cross validations. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for IUGR diagnosis. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) was performed to identify which metabolic pathways were perturbed as a direct result of IUGR in cord blood serum.All selected metabolites and their overlapping set achieved statistically significant accuracies in the range of 0.78-0.82 for their optimized SVM models. The model utilizing all metabolites in the dataset had an AUC = 0.91 with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity equal to 0.80. CFS and OL (Creatinine, C2, C4, lysoPC.a.C16.1, lysoPC.a.C20.3, lysoPC.a.C28.1, PC.aa.C24.0) showed the highest performance with sensitivity (0.87) and specificity (0.87), respectively. MSEA revealed significantly altered metabolic pathways in IUGR cases. Dysregulated pathways include: beta oxidation of very long fatty acids, oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, phospholipid biosynthesis, lysine degradation, urea cycle and fatty acid metabolism.A systematically selected panel of metabolites was shown to accurately detect IUGR in newborn cord blood serum. Significant disturbance of hepatic function and energy generating pathways were found in IUGR cases."
https://openalex.org/W2937442700,"The neurocranium of sarcopterygian fishes was originally divided into an anterior (ethmosphenoid) and posterior (otoccipital) portion by an intracranial joint, and underwent major changes in its overall geometry before fusing into a single unit in lungfishes and early tetrapods1. Although the pattern of these changes is well-documented, the developmental mechanisms that underpin variation in the form of the neurocranium and its associated soft tissues during the evolution of sarcopterygian fishes remain poorly understood. The coelacanth Latimeria is the only known living vertebrate that retains an intracranial joint2,3. Despite its importance for understanding neurocranial evolution, the development of the neurocranium of this ovoviviparous fish remains unknown. Here we investigate the ontogeny of the neurocranium and brain in Latimeria chalumnae using conventional and synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography as well as magnetic resonance imaging, performed on an extensive growth series for this species. We describe the neurocranium at the earliest developmental stage known for Latimeria, as well as the major changes that the neurocranium undergoes during ontogeny. Changes in the neurocranium are associated with an extreme reduction in the relative size of the brain along with an enlargement of the notochord. The development of the notochord appears to have a major effect on the surrounding cranial components, and might underpin the formation of the intracranial joint. Our results shed light on the interplay between the neurocranium and its adjacent soft tissues during development in Latimeria, and provide insights into the developmental mechanisms that are likely to have underpinned the evolution of neurocranial diversity in sarcopterygian fishes. Micro-computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of a growth series of the coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae traces the ontogeny of the brain and neurocranium, which sheds light on neurocranial evolution in sarcopterygian fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2938426651,"Background A scientific understanding of the effects of seasonal changes on sleep duration and sleep problems such as insomnia and hypersomnia has yet to be elucidated; however, such an understanding could aid the establishment of an optimal sleep hygiene program to treat such problems. Methods We investigated the effects of seasonal changes on sleep duration and sleep problems in Japanese community residents. Data on 1,388 individuals aged 15–89 years who participated in the Survey of Seasonal Variations in Food Intakes conducted by the National Institute of Health and Nutrition of Japan (2004–2007) were analyzed. Participants completed a questionnaire including items on sleep duration and sleep problems (difficulty initiating sleep [DIS], difficulty maintaining sleep [DMS]/early morning awakening [EMA], and excessive daytime sleepiness [EDS]). Data were prospectively collected at four time points (spring, summer, fall, and winter). Results Seasonal changes in sleep duration were found, with the longest in winter and the shortest in summer (winter–summer difference: 0.19 h). The seasonality of sleep duration was influenced by age, sex, and residential area. In terms of age, seasonal changes in sleep duration were found in the middle and old age groups, but not in the young age group. Seasonal changes in the frequencies of sleep problems were found for some items in the young age group (DMS/EMA and EDS) and middle age group (DIS and DMS/EMA); however, no such changes were observed in the old age group. Conclusion Seasonal effects on sleep and sleep problems were found in Japanese community residents, but these varied between age groups. Furthermore, seasonal changes in sleep duration were influenced by sex and residential area."
https://openalex.org/W2938962285,"Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) genetic variants G1 and G2, compared to the common allele G0, are major risk factors for non-diabetic kidney disease in African descent populations. APOL1 is a minor protein component of HDL, as well as being expressed in podocytes and vascular cells. Reverse cholesterol transport involves the transport of cholesterol to HDL by cellular ATP-binding cassette; ABCA1 and ABCG1 with subsequent delivery from peripheral tissues to the liver. With impaired reverse cholesterol transport, lipid accumulation occurs and macrophages morphologically transform into foam cells, releasing inflammatory factors. We asked whether the APOL1 risk variants alter peripheral cholesterol metabolism and specifically affect macrophage cholesterol efflux. Tissues and bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes were isolated from wild-type mice (WT) and from BAC/APOL1 transgenic (APOL1-G0, APOL1-G1, and APOL1-G2) mice, which carry a bacterial artificial chromosome that contains the human APOL1 genomic region. Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using M-CSF, and then polarized into M1 and M2 macrophages. Cholesterol content, cholesterol efflux, and ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression were measured. Kidney, spleen, and bone marrow-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed increased cholesterol accumulation and decreased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA levels. BM-derived macrophages from APOL1-G1 and -G2 mice showed significantly reduced cholesterol efflux compared to WT or APOL1-G0 macrophages. Taken together, the evidence suggests that APOL1-G1 and -G2 risk variants impaired reverse cholesterol transport through decreased expression of cholesterol efflux transporters suggesting a possible mechanism to promote macrophage foam cell formation, driving inflammation in the glomerulus and renal interstitium."

Our aim was to use RNA sequencing of duodenal biopsies in patients with active CD, CD in remission, and non-CD controls to gain insight into CD pathophysiology, identify additional genetic signatures linked to CD, and possibly uncover targets for future therapeutic agents.We performed whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing of intestinal biopsies in subjects with active and remission CD and non-CD controls. We also performed functional pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes to identify statistically significant pathways that are up or down regulated in subjects with active CD compared to remission CD.We identified the upregulation of novel genes including IL12R, ITGAM and IGSF4 involved in the immune response machinery and cell adhesion process in the mucosa of subjects with active CD compared to those in remission. We identified a unique signature of genes, related to innate immunity, perturbed exclusively in CD irrespective of disease status. Finally, we highlight novel pathways of interest that may contribute to the early steps of CD pathogenesis and its comorbidities such as the spliceosome, pathways related to the innate immune response, and pathways related to autoimmunity.Our study confirmed previous findings based on GWAS and immunological studies pertinent to CD pathogenesis and describes novel genes and pathways that with further validation may be found to contribute to the early steps in the pathogenesis of CD, ongoing inflammation, and comorbidities associated with CD."
https://openalex.org/W2940241260,"Stories are often used in health communication because of accumulating evidence of their potential to affect people’s attitudes and health behavioral intentions. Similarity between the reader and the story’s protagonist appears to positively influence narrative persuasion, but the exact role of similarity on persuasive outcomes is debated, as some research finds clear effects of similarity manipulations whereas others do not. Possibly, these mixed results were found because the similarity manipulations were not always relevant to the topic of the story. We conducted an experiment (N = 582) in which we varied the age and gender of the protagonist, features that were of central relevance to the story’s topic, namely breast cancer versus testicular cancer. There were two groups of participants: 324 students (mean age: 21.46 years) and 258 older adults (mean age: 56.83 years). Age similarity (but not gender similarity) had an effect on identification with the protagonist, transportation (i.e. the experience of being absorbed into a story), and the intention to donate, but only for students. For older adults, age or gender of the protagonist did not seem to matter, as nearly no differences in persuasive measures were found. As far as the underlying mechanism is concerned, the results of structural equation modeling showed that the concept of ‘perceived similarity’ would be a relevant addition to models of narrative persuasion, as it was significantly related to the narrative processes of transportation and identification, which, in turn, predicted attitudes and behavioral intentions, both directly—in the case of transportation—or indirectly, via the emotion of compassion. We conclude that both manipulated and perceived similarity are important for narrative persuasion, and that it should be kept on the research agenda of health communication."
https://openalex.org/W2938726276,"At present, single-trait best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is the standard method for genetic selection in soybean. However, when genetic selection is performed based on two or more genetically correlated traits and these are analyzed individually, selection bias may arise. Under these conditions, considering the correlation structure between the evaluated traits may provide more-accurate genetic estimates for the evaluated parameters, even under environmental influences. The present study was thus developed to examine the efficiency and applicability of multi-trait multi-environment (MTME) models by the residual maximum likelihood (REML/BLUP) and Bayesian approaches in the genetic selection of segregating soybean progeny. The study involved data pertaining to 203 soybean F2:4 progeny assessed in two environments for the following traits: number of days to maturity (DM), 100-seed weight (SW), and average seed yield per plot (SY). Variance components and genetic and non-genetic parameters were estimated via the REML/BLUP and Bayesian methods. The variance components estimated and the breeding values and genetic gains predicted with selection through the Bayesian procedure were similar to those obtained by REML/BLUP. The frequentist and Bayesian MTME models provided higher estimates of broad-sense heritability per plot (or heritability of total effects of progeny; ) and mean accuracy of progeny than their respective single-trait versions. Bayesian analysis provided the credibility intervals for the estimates of . Therefore, MTME led to greater predicted gains from selection. On this basis, this procedure can be efficiently applied in the genetic selection of segregating soybean progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2940179473,"The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum has become a common and dominant macrobenthic species in coastal areas of the northwestern Pacific and temperate waters of Europe; it is also a major cultured shellfish, with annual worldwide production exceeding 3.3 million tonnes. This species faces greater risk of exposure to hypoxia as eutrophication worsens throughout its coastal habitats; however, its tolerance to hypoxia remains unclear, and the toxicological indicators including LC50 and LT50 have not yet been assessed. Previous studies on the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos have focused largely on functional responses, such as metabolism and gene expression, leaving potential structural damage to the mitochondria or the cells unknown. In this study we assessed the effects of hypoxia on Manila clam in terms of survival, behavior, metabolism and cellular damage, using a newly designed automated hypoxia simulation device that features exceptional accuracy and good stability. The clams exhibited strong tolerance to hypoxia as the 20-day LC50 for dissolved oxygen (DO) was estimated to be 0.57 mg L-1, and the LT50 at 0.5 mg L-1 DO was 422 hours. Adaptations included fewer buried clams and a depressed metabolism, while the unexpected rise in the activities of key enzymes involved in glycolysis may indicate a diverse strategy of shellfish under hypoxia. Cellular damage was observed as collapse of the mitochondrial cristae and both cellular and mitochondrial vacuolization. This multi-level study complements and updates our knowledge of the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos, by improving our understanding of the potential for marine ecological transformation under hypoxic conditions and providing useful information for Manila clam farming."
https://openalex.org/W2937906090,"Cochlear implants provide an effective treatment option for those with severe hearing loss, including those with preserved low frequency hearing. However, certain issues can reduce implant efficacy including intracochlear tissue response and delayed loss of residual acoustic hearing. We describe a mouse model of cochlear implantation with chronic electric stimulation that can be used to study cochlear implant biology and related pathologies.Twelve normal hearing adult CBA/J mice underwent unilateral cochlear implantation and were evenly divided into one group receiving electric stimulation and one not. Serial impedance and neural response telemetry (NRT) measurements were made to assess implant functionality. Functionality was defined as having at least one electrode with an impedance ≤ 35 kOhms. Mouse cochleae were harvested for histology and 3D x-ray microscopy 21 days post-operatively, or, in case the implant was still functional, at a later time point when the implant failed. A separate experiment measured the hearing preservation rate in 7 adult CBA/J mice undergoing unilateral cochlear implantation with serial auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE).Implants maintained functionality for a mean of 35 days in the non-stimulated group and 19.8 days in the stimulated group. Reliable NRT and behavioral responses to electric stimulation were recorded. A robust intracochlear peri-implant tissue response with neo-ossification was seen in all cochleae. Six of seven mice maintained intact low frequency hearing up to 6 weeks following cochlear implantation.We demonstrate the feasibility of cochlear implantation and behaviorally significant electric stimulation in the mouse, with the potential for hearing preservation. This model may be combined with established mouse models of hearing loss and the large genetic and molecular research toolkit unique to the mouse for mechanistic and therapeutic investigations of cochlear implant biology."

It is a severe form of allergies in warm and dry tropical and sub-tropical countries. Its prevalence in Ethiopia ranges from 5.2% to7.3%. Most studies are institution based and do not address specific factors associated with vernal keratoconjunctivitis. There is no a study that shows the magnitude of vernal keratoconjunctivitis in the study area.To assess the prevalence of vernal keratoconjunctivitis and its associated factors among children in Gambella town, Southwest Ethiopia, 2018.A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 25 to May 12, 2018, in Gambella town. A total of 578 study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire, torch, and magnifying loop were used to collect data. The data was entered into epidemiological information 7.1 and exported to statistical package for social science for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis model was fitted to identify factors associated with vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Odds ratio with respected 95% CI was used to identify the direction and strength of association.A total of 574 children participated in this study representing a response rate of 99.30%. The mean age of the participants was 9.74±4.0 years. The prevalence of vernal keratoconjunctivitis was 11.10% (95% CI: 8.70, 13.90). Male sex (adjusted odds ratio = 4.12(95% CI: 1.42, 11.91)), close animal contact (adjusted odds ratio = 3.45(95% CI: 1.14, 10.41)), dust exposure (adjusted odds ratio = 3.38(95% CI: 1.31, 10.04)), and personal systemic allergy history (adjusted odds ratio = 4.82(1.40, 16.72) were independently associated with vernal keratoconjunctivitis.The prevalence of VKC was high among children in Gambella town. Sex being male, close animal contact, personal systemic allergy history, and dust exposure were positively associated with vernal keratoconjunctivitis independently."

We retrospectively reviewed the data of 912 patients (354 men, 558 women) with primary cranial nerve disorders (trigeminal neuralgia, 602 patients; hemifacial spasm, 296 patients; glossopharyngeal neuralgia, 14 patients) who underwent MVD in the Neurosurgery Department of Lanzhou University Second Hospital between July 2007 and June 2018. Potential risk factors for PODE were identified using univariate and multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis.Of the 912 patients, 221 (24.2%) patients developed PODE. Patients with PODE were significantly older and significantly more likely to be male than patients without PODE. A history of hypertension, preoperative carbamazepine therapy, and postoperative sleep disturbance and tension pneumocephalus were independently associated with PODE. Variables such as body-mass index, smoking and drinking habits, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, mean operative time, affected vessel, mean blood loss, postoperative intensive care unit stay, postoperative fever (>38°C), and routine laboratory results were not associated with PODE in our patients.PODE is a common complication after MVD, and is associated with multiple risk factors, including old age, male sex, hypertension, preoperative carbamazepine use, postoperative sleep disturbance, and tension pneumocephalus."

We investigated the determinants of facility based deliveries among women in urban slums of Kampala city, Uganda.A cross sectional study using quantitative methods was used. A total of 420 mothers who had delivered in the past one year preceding the survey, were randomly selected and interviewed using a pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent predictors of facility based deliveries.Ninety-five percent of respondents attended at least one antenatal care visit and 66.1%delivered in a health facility. Independent predictors of health facility births included exposure to media concerning facility delivery (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.6-3.9), ANC attendance less than 4 times (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and timing of first ANC visit in the 2 and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy (OR = 0.5 95% CI = 0.3-0.8).Despite good physical access, a third of mothers did not deliver in health facilities. Increasing health facility births among the slum dwellers can be improved through interventions geared at increased awareness, starting ANC in early stages of pregnancy and attending at least 4 ANC visits."
https://openalex.org/W2937624733,"Massively parallel sequencing technologies have made it possible to generate large quantities of sequence data. However, as research-associated information is transferred into clinical practice, cost and throughput constraints generally require sequence-specific targeted analyses. Therefore, sample enrichment methods have been developed to meet the needs of clinical sequencing applications. However, current amplification and hybrid capture enrichment methods are limited in the contiguous length of sequences for which they are able to enrich. PCR based amplification also loses methylation data and other native DNA features. We have developed a novel technology (Negative Enrichment) where we demonstrate targeting long (>10 kb) genomic regions of interest. We use the specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 single guide RNA (Cas9/sgRNA) complexes to define 5' and 3' termini of sequence-specific loci in genomic DNA, targeting 10 to 36 kb regions. The complexes were found to provide protection from exonucleases, by protecting the targeted sequences from degradation, resulting in enriched, double-strand, non-amplified target sequences suitable for next-generation sequencing library preparation or other downstream analyses."

The objective of the current study was to investigate barriers and facilitators of communication between persons with Parkinson's disease, carepartners, and physicians, specifically in the setting of off periods, with the goal of identifying ways to improve patient-carepartner-physician communication.We interviewed persons with Parkinson's, carepartners, and physicians (specialists and non-specialists) using a semi-structured questionnaire to identify and describe experiences, barriers, and facilitators relating to communication about off periods in Parkinson's disease. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to analyze interview transcripts and compare themes between participating groups.Twenty persons with Parkinson's and their carepartners and 20 physicians (10 specialists, 10 non-specialists) participated in interviews. Identified communication barriers included patient-level (e.g. cognitive impairment, reluctance to discuss symptoms), caregiver-level (e.g. caregiver absence), and physician-level (e.g. distraction by technology, lack of appreciation of the burden of off periods) factors. Other barriers included the challenging nature of off periods themselves. Positive physician characteristics such as empathy, respect, and taking time to listen were major facilitators of communication regarding off periods. Persons with Parkinson's, carepartners, and physicians described using various tools (e.g. home diaries, questionnaires, mobile phone videos) to aid communication regarding off periods but participants identified a need for more formal educational materials.Physicians caring for persons with Parkinson's can improve communication through more patient-centered practice but there is a need for improved educational tools regarding off periods. Further research is needed to identify optimal strategies for communication about off periods and preferred approaches for off period education."
https://openalex.org/W2936760181,"Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an invasive stink bug species that feeds on cruciferous plants and can cause substantial damage to crops. Little is known about the dispersal behavior of B. hilaris, but movement is important because of the way this pest moves from senescing weed hosts into crop fields. Perhaps, B. hilaris residing on declining weed hosts become starved, which alters their normal locomotor activity and initiates dispersal. We examined the influence of starvation on the locomotor behavior of multiple life stages of B. hilaris under laboratory and outdoor conditions. We starved nymph (2nd/3rd and 4th/5th instars) and adult (female and male) stages for 0, 24, and 48 h. We measured distance moved in the laboratory and then distance moved and turning ratio outdoors. In the laboratory, the younger nymphs moved shortest distances when starved for 24 h, whereas late-instar nymphs (4th-5th instars) and adult B. hilaris that were starved moved farther than non-starved individuals. In the outdoor setting, environmental conditions, specifically surface temperature were important in determining how starvation affected distance moved. Starved insects were more responsive (moved farther) for a given change in temperature than non-starved insects. At lower temperatures, B. hilaris tended to move farther when non-starved and at higher temperatures, moved longer distances when starved, at least for certain stages. Increased starvation also led to more directional movement. Our results indicate that starvation influences aspects of movement for B. hilaris and that these effects can be influenced by temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2938238380,"Several self-report measures of conspiracist beliefs have been developed in Western populations, but examination of their psychometric properties outside Europe and North America is limited. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of three widely-used measures of conspiracist beliefs in Iran. We translated the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI), Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), and Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale (GCBS) into Persian. Factorial validity was examined using principal-axis factor analysis in a community sample from Tehran, Iran (N = 544). Further, the relationships between scores on these measures and hypothesized antecedents (i.e., education, schizotypal personality, information processing style, superstitious beliefs, religiosity, and political orientation) were examined. Overall, we failed to find support for the parent factor structures of two of the three scales (BCTI and GCBS) and evidence of construct validity for all three scales was limited. These results highlight the necessity of further psychometric work on existing measures of conspiracy theories in diverse culturo-linguistic groups and the development of context-specific measures of conspiracist beliefs."
https://openalex.org/W2937725847,"Objective To assess school policies, built environment and practices for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in schools of Delhi, India. Methods School built environments and policies were assessed using a structured observation checklist in 10 private and 9 government schools which were randomly selected from all 184 co-educational schools with primary to senior secondary level education in Delhi, India. A self-administered questionnaire was also completed by teachers from each school (n = 19) to capture information specific to school policies. Surveys were also conducted with parent of students in class II (aged 6–7 years; n = 574) and student in class XI (aged 15–16 years, n = 755) to understand school practices. Results The majority of government (88.9%; n = 8) and private (80%; n = 8) schools reported having comprehensive school health policy. In terms of specific health behaviours, policies related to diet and nutrition in government schools were mostly restricted to primary levels with provision of the mid-day meal programme. All schools had two physical education periods per week of about 45–50 minutes. Most schools were compliant with tobacco-free school guidelines (n = 15 out of 19) and had alcohol control policies (n = 13 out of 19). Parent and student reports of practices indicated that school policies were not consistently implemented. Conclusion Most schools in Delhi have policies that address health behaviours in students, but there was considerable variation in the types and number of policies and school environments. Government schools are more likely to have policies in place than private schools. Further work is needed to evaluate how these policies are implemented and to assess their impact on health outcomes."

This study describes the expression patterns of senescence markers P53, DEC1 and DCR2 and assesses their significance on patient survival as a single or combined marker with P16 or P14 using breast cancer progression series. One thousand and eighty (1080) patients with primary invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type, were recruited through an 11-year retrospective study period. We constructed tissue microarrays of normal, benign hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma from each patient and performed immunohistochemical staining to study the protein expression. Statistical analysis includes Pearson chi-square, Kaplan-Meier log ran test and Cox proportional hazard regression were undertaken to determine the associations and predict the survival outcomes. P53, DEC1 and DCR2 expression correlated significantly with normal, benign, premalignant and malignant tissues with (p<0.05). The expression profile of these genes increases from normal to benign to premalignant and plateaued from premalignant to malignant phenotype. There is a significant association between P53 protein expression and age, grade, staging, lymphovascular invasion, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 whereas DCR2 protein expression significantly correlated with tumour grade, hormone receptors status and HER2 (p<0.05 respectively). P53 overexpression correlated with increased risk of relapse (p = 0.002) specifically in patients who did not receive hormone therapy (p = 0.005) or chemotherapy (p<0.0001). The combination of P53+/P16+ is significantly correlated with poor overall and disease-free survival, whereas a combination of P53+/P14+ is associated with worse outcome in disease-free survival (p<0.05 respectively). P53 overexpression appears to be a univariate predictor of poor disease-free survival. The expression profiles of DEC1 and DCR2 do not appear to correlate with patient survival outcomes. The combination of P53 with P16, rather P53 expression alone, appears to provide more useful clinical information on patient survival outcomes in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2936539185,"The way animals respond to a stimulus depends largely on an internal comparison between the current sensation and the memory of previous stimuli and outcomes. We know little about the accuracy with which the physical properties of the stimuli influence this type of memory-based discriminative decisions. Research has focused largely on discriminations between stimuli presented in quick succession, where animals can make relative inferences (same or different; higher or lower) from trial to trial. In the current study we used a memory-based task to explore how the stimulus’ physical properties, in this case tone frequency, affect auditory discrimination and generalization in mice. Mice performed ad libitum while living in groups in their home quarters. We found that the frequency distance between safe and conditioned sounds had a constraining effect on discrimination. As the safe-to-conditioned distance decreased across groups, performance deteriorated rapidly, even for frequency differences significantly larger than reported discrimination thresholds. Generalization width was influenced both by the physical distance and the previous experience of the mice, and was not accompanied by a decrease in sensory acuity. In conclusion, memory-based discriminations along a single stimulus dimension are inherently hard, reflecting a high overlap between the memory traces of the relevant stimuli. Memory-based discriminations rely therefore on wide sensory filters."
https://openalex.org/W2937032367,"Background and objective The revised World Health Organization classification of 2016 for myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia added a section of myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition. The main objective of our study was to evaluate the frequency of hematologic and solid malignancies in the family history of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by using a systemic pedigree interview. The family history was taken of 50 patients between 24 and 80 years. Findings 8/50 (16%) patients with AML had family members with hematologic malignancies. 2/50 (4%) patients had family members of first degree with hematologic malignancies. Furthermore in 42/50 (84%) of AML patients solid malignancies were documented in family members of any degree and in 31/50 (62%) in family members of first degree. The most commonly occurring malignancies in our cohort were breast and colorectal cancer. We analyzed the pedigrees for cancer syndromes that can be associated with acute leukemia like Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Lynch syndrome and hereditary breast cancer. 2/50 (4%) patients fulfilled the criteria for familial breast and ovarian cancer from the German consortium and 1/50 (2%) patients fulfilled the Bethesda Guidelines criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. No pedigree met the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In 29 cases we compared the patient history obtained in the routine work-up with our data. The accuracy of the obtained family history was 23%, outlining that in the clinical routine information about family histories often escapes notice. Conclusion Our study shows that though generally considered a sporadic disease, the presence of hematologic and solid malignancies in the family history of AML patients is relatively high. One should keep in mind that cancer syndromes like hereditary breast cancer are associated with a higher incidence of leukemia. These data are relevant in the context of family donor search for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, genetic counseling and testing as well as cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2936748791,"X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (Xrcc1), a key DNA repair gene, plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability and is highly expressed in the early stages of spermatogenesis, but the exact functions remain elusive. Here we generated primordial germ cell-specific Xrcc1 knockout (cXrcc1-/-) mice to elucidate the effects of Xrcc1 on spermatogenesis. We demonstrated that Xrcc1 deficiency results in infertility in male mice due to impaired spermatogenesis. We found that cXrcc1-/- mice exhibited smaller size of testes as well as lower sperm concentration and motility than the wild-type mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Xrcc1 deficiency in primordial germ cells induced elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, mitochondria dysfunction, apoptosis, and loss of stemness of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in testes. In Xrcc1-deficienct SSCs, elevated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction could be partially reversed by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), whereas NAC treatment did not restore the fertility or ameliorate the apoptosis caused by loss of Xrcc1. Overall, our findings provided new insights into understanding the crucial role of Xrcc1 during spermatogenesis.-Xu, C., Xu, J., Ji, G., Liu, Q., Shao, W., Chen, Y., Gu, J., Weng, Z., Zhang, X., Wang, Y., Gu, A.

https://openalex.org/W2937499686,"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare pulmonary vascular disease, is often misdiagnosed due to nonspecific symptoms. The objective of the study was to develop, refine and validate a case ascertainment algorithm to identify CTEPH patients within the French exhaustive hospital discharge database (PMSI), and to use it to estimate the annual number of hospitalized patients with CTEPH in France in 2015, as a proxy for disease prevalence. As ICD-10 coding specifically for CTEPH was not available at the time of the study, a case ascertainment algorithm was developed in close collaboration with an expert committee, using a two-step process (refinement and validation), based on matched data from PMSI and hospital medical records from 2 centres. The best-performing algorithm (specificity 95%, sensitivity 70%) consisted of ≥1 pulmonary hypertension (PH) diagnosis during 2015 and any of the following criteria over 2009–2015: (i) CTEPH interventional procedure, (ii) admission for PH and pulmonary embolism (PE), (iii) PE followed by hospitalization in competence centre then in reference centre, (iv) history of PE and right heart catheterization. Patients with conditions suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension were excluded. A total of 3,138 patients hospitalized for CTEPH was estimated for 2015 (47 cases/million, range 43 to 50 cases/million). Assuming that patients are hospitalized at least once a year, the present study provides an estimate of the minimal prevalence of CTEPH and confirms the heavy burden of this disease."

Uncontrolled asthma is a major public health problem worldwide, but there is a lack of data on asthma control and its causes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Objective To determine the socio-demographic, environmental, clinical, and biological factors and comorbidities associated with uncontrolled adult asthma in Kinshasa, DRC. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of 216 male and female asthmatics aged 18 and over consecutively recruited from tertiary clinics and the community in Kinshasa between June 2017 and February 2018. For each subject, socio-demographic, clinical, para clinical and environmental data were recorded. Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) values were obtained by Spirometry, allergen testing performed using the skin prick test, serum vitamin D levels measured by radioimmunoassay, and asthma control assessed using the asthma control test (ACT) score. Multiple logistic regression identified factors associated with uncontrolled asthma. Results The average age of participants was 45.2 (SD 17.6) years, 74% were female, and 42% had a low educational level. Among all asthmatics, the prevalence of uncontrolled asthma was 56%, abnormal serum vitamin D level 95%, abnormal FEV1 65%, sensitization to two allergens (cat dander and dust mites) 18%, sleep disorders 37%, and heartburn 60%. Male (aOR 2.24; 95% CIs 1.04–4.79), low educational level (aOR 3.26; 95% CIs 1.54–6.67), sensitization to both cat dander and dust mites (aOR 2.67; 95% CIs 1.16–6.14), FEV1 ≤80% (aOR 2.07; 95% CIs 1.08–3.96), abnormal serum vitamin D level (aOR 5.11; 95% CIs 1.17–22.33), sleep disorders (aOR 1.96; 95% CIs 1.04–3.71), and heartburn (aOR 2.02; 95% CIs 1.04–3.92) were significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma. Conclusion Uncontrolled asthma is common in Kinshasa, and these factors associated with uncontrolled asthma may be considered as targets for future intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2951980057,"Primnoa pacifica is the most ecologically important coral species in the North Pacific Ocean and provides important habitat for commercially important fish and invertebrates. Ocean acidification (OA) is more rapidly increasing in high-latitude seas because anthropogenic CO2 uptake is greater in these regions. This is due to the solubility of CO2 in cold water and the reduced buffering capacity and low alkalinity of colder waters. Primnoa pacifica colonies were cultured for six to nine months in either pH 7.55 (predicted Year 2100 pH levels) or pH 7.75 (Control). Oocyte development and fecundity in females, and spermatocyst stages in males were measured to assess the effects of pH on gametogenesis. Oocyte diameters were 13.6% smaller and fecundities were 30.9% lower in the Year 2100 samples. A higher proportion of vitellogenic oocytes (65%) were also reabsorbed (oosorption) in the Year 2100 treatment. Lower pH appeared to advance the process of spermatogenesis with a higher percentage of later stage sperm compared to Control. There was a laboratory effect observed in all measurement types, however this only significantly affected the analyses of spermatogenesis. Based on the negative effect of acidification on oogenesis and increased rate of oosorption, successful spawning could be unlikely in an acidified ocean. If female gametes were spawned, they are likely to be insufficiently equipped to develop normally, based on the decreased overall size and therefore subsequent limited amount of lipids necessary for successful larval development."
https://openalex.org/W2936344092,"In areas where konzo (a cassava cyanide related paralytic disorder) persists, the agronomic factors causing increased cyanogenic glucoside levels in cassava, during periods without water stress, are hardly known. However, through their assessment of cassava root toxicity, using its bitter taste, farmers may have noticed factors unrelated to water stress that additionally influence the cyanogenic glucoside content of cassava cultivated in these areas. Increased cassava root bitterness is often associated with an increase in cyanogenic glucoside levels, making it a good indicator of changes in root cyanogenic glucoside content. Bitter cassava varieties that are preferentially planted by people living in most konzo-affected areas, are an additional known contributor to high cyanogenic glucosides. It is water stress that further increases the inherent toxicity of the planted bitter cassava varieties. Using konzo-affected Mtwara region in Tanzania as a case study, a household survey was carried out to identify the overlooked agronomic factors that additionally influence cyanogenic glucoside levels in cassava cultivated in konzo-affected areas. A total of 120 farmers were interviewed and they mentioned a number of factors unrelated to water stress, as agronomic factors that influenced cassava root bitterness and hence cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava. The mentioned factors included; certain soil characteristics (14.2%), plant age at harvest (7.5%), poor weeding (0.8%), piecemeal harvesting (0.8%), and branch pruning (0.8%). The revealed factors constitute permanent environmental characteristics and crop management practices commonly used by farmers living in konzo-affected Mtwara region in Tanzania. The revealed factors could be contributing to increased cyanogenic glucoside levels in cassava, during periods without water stress in areas where konzo persists."

We compared the FIGO stage before and after FDG-PET/CT. Maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the primary lesion were determined. We compared these parameters between the HIV-infected and uninfected woman and also determined their abilities to predict the presence of distant metastasis.126 women, mean age 48.05 ± 11.80 years were studied. Seventy-three patients were HIV-infected. The disease was upstaged in 65 patients, 32 of which were upstaged to stage IVB. HIV-infected women were younger (43.36 ± 8.03 years versus 54.51 ± 13.12, p<0.001) and had more advanced disease (p = 0.022) compared with HIV-uninfected. In a univariate logistic regression adjusted for the FIGO stage of the disease, there were significant associations between MTV and TLG of the primary tumor and distant metastasis. SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV and TLG performed well in predicting the presence of distant metastasis with areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.63, 0.66, 0.80 and 0.77 respectively. These performances improved after adjustment for the FIGO stage of the disease with AUCs of 0.80, 0.79, 0.84 and 0.82 for SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV and TLG respectively.Inclusion of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in the pre-therapy assessment of cervical cancer improves the accuracy of staging in about half of the patients. The metabolic parameters of the primary tumor perform well in predicting the presence of distant metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2938843876,"Human papillomavirus has been identified as a main etiological agent in the development of cervical cancer. HPV 16 and 18 have been reported the most widely prevalent genotypes worldwide. We conducted a study analyzing the prevalence of high and low risk human papillomavirus viral types in the Mexican state of Aguascalientes and neighboring cities in the states of Jalisco and Zacatecas in central Mexico. Specific viral genotype was determined by a PCR and hybridization-based detection test. The presence of 37 high- and low-risk HPV genotypes was evaluated in 883 female participants. Of these, 350 presented low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL), 176 presented high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL), 107 suffered from cervical cancer and 250 women with negative cytological report for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM). HPV 51 was the most prevalent genotype, followed by HPV 16: overall prevalence of HPV 51, including single infections and co-infections was 31.2% in women with LGSIL, whereas prevalence of HPV 16 was 25.1%. Among women with HGSIL, HPV 51 prevalence was 47.2% and HPV 16 was 30.1%. Prevalence of HPV 51 in women with cervical cancer was 49.5% and type 16 was 33.6%. Between single and co-infections, most co-infections were not associated with later stages of the disease, except 51/16 and some others. HPV 51 showed a significant correlation with the progression of the disease (OR = 10.81 for LGSIL, 19.38 for HGSIL and 22.95 for ICC), and when analyzing all other genotypes, five different groups depending on their correlation with all lesion grades were determined. According to our findings, HPV genotype 51 has a higher prevalence than HPV 16 and 18 in the Mexican state of Aguascalientes and neighboring cities in the states of Jalisco and Zacatecas in Central Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W2939861346,"In GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), the fast emission of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can result in the formation of hot spots near the gate region where high electric fields produce hot electrons. In this work, we investigate the probability of phonon emission as a function of electron energy for confined and interface (IF) phonon modes for wurtzite GaN/InGaN/GaN heterostructures. Hot electrons radiate optical phonons which decay, anharmonically, into acoustic phonons that are essentially heat carriers. Herein, phonon engineering concepts are introduced which facilitate thermal management through the production of polar optical phonons. Some of the electrons near a semiconductor gate which manifests a strong electric field, are accelerated and the resulting hot electrons will produce confined and interface modes when the electrons are incident on a suitably-placed quantum well. This paper focuses on the production of confined and interface phonons. It is shown that interface modes may be preferentially produced which lead to elongated, lower-temperature hot spots."
https://openalex.org/W2939641888,"Since the late 1990s, particularly since the global financial crisis, the core inflation of main developed economies' has been persistently below target. The factors hindering the achievement of inflation targets are nothing more than commodity price, oil supply, weakness of aggregate demand, and various other factors. In addition, technology and globalization have also played a significant role. This paper uses an extended hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) model to quantify the contribution of technology and globalization variables to inflation in the United States (U.S.). The analysis suggests that technology and globalization well explain the low inflation dynamics in the U.S., as the impact of globalization on domestic inflation has been weakening over the past 20 years or so, while the impact of technology on inflation has been increasing. At present, technology exerts a greater role than globalization on low-inflation in the U.S.. This raises a different perspective for understanding the phenomenon of low inflation in the U.S. and other regions."

Results revealed that during maturity stage, in north-south and east-west, the initial fluorescence (Fo) at ‘65 + 65’ were higher than those under‘160 + 40’; the maximum quantum yield of PS2 photochemistry(ΦP0), basal quantum yield of non-photochemical processes in PS2(ΦN0)of the lower leaves and photosynthetic rate of the upper and ear leaves under‘160 + 40’were higher than those under‘65 + 65’. The polyphenoloxidase (POD) activities of leaves at different positions under ‘160 + 40’ were higher than that under‘65 + 65’, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was lower. The photosynthesis rate, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity of leaves at different positions under southwestern 20° ‘160 + 40’ were higher than others. Whilst MDA content ‘160 + 40’ were lower. Therefore, in De Hui City, Jilin Province, southwestern 20° ‘160 + 40’ delayed leaf senescence at the late stage of growth of maize, as well as the effect of increasing maize yield was most obvious."
https://openalex.org/W2938135295,"The study aims to clarify the mechanism in patients with neurally mediated syncope (NMS), focusing on the adenylate cyclase (AC) activity level in lymphocytes. This study included 40 subjects: 22 healthy volunteers and 18 NMS patients. We investigated the changes in AC activity that occur during of syncope at rest and during the head-up tilt (HUT) test. We obtained 8 mL of blood at rest time and four times during the HUT test. Then, we measured the AC activity and the test reagent was added to the lymphocytes (10,000) and reacted for 30 min at room temperature. We were able to determine the standard value of AC activity when adrenaline (AD) and isoproterenol (IP) were added to lymphocytes. The results of our study showed one of the causes of NMS has a difference in AC activity level and classification of the patients into two different types of NMS was possible: either the vasodepressor type (VT) or mixed type (MT). At rest time, VT patients showed significantly higher AC activity (AD; 100 μM: p = 0.005, IP; 50 μM: p = 0.02) and MT patients showed significantly lower AC activity (AD; 10 μM: p = 0.02, IP; 50 μM: p = 0.004) than the average AC activity in healthy volunteers. Moreover, VT patients had significantly higher AC activity than healthy volunteers at the four points of the HUT test. MT patients had significantly lower AC activity (AD: p = 0.04 and IP: p = 0.04) than healthy volunteers at the rest time of HUT. Our study showed a significant difference in AC activities between NMS patients and healthy volunteers at rest. Therefore, a detailed NMS diagnosis can be made by examining AC activity levels in blood taken at rest time."
https://openalex.org/W2938327486,"Background Manual skull drilling is an old but in modern neurosurgery still established procedure which can be applied quickly and universally in emergency situations. Electrical drilling requires more complex equipment and is usually reserved to the Operating Room (OR). It also seems desirable to apply an electrical drill for bedside usage but a suitable product does not exist so far. Method Our experimental study using a manually and an electrically driven skull drill included a total of 40 holes drilled into synthetic biomechanical sheets. Half of the holes were produced with a prototype electrical drilling machine of the company Kaiser Technology and half of them with a traditional manual drill. Different drilling parameters such as the geometry of the borehole, the drilling forces and the drilling vibrations were captured during all experiments. Results The electrical drilling needed higher vertical force by the operators and a longer time to penetrate the sheet. A reason was the relatively lower rotational speed provided by this particular drill. When drilling electrically the vibrations were substantially less which in turn led to a more precise shape of the holes (revealed by observation via a microscope). Conclusions The electrification of bedside drilling can in principle enable emergency craniostomies to be performed with greater ease and accuracy. The power of the electric drive, however, must be at least equivalent to the power of the traditional manual drill. Otherwise, the vertical forces exerted on the scull by the operator become inhibitive. The challenge is to combine cost-efficiency and re-sterilizability of an electrically driven drilling machine which at the same time is small and simple enough to qualify for emergency applications."
https://openalex.org/W2940135444,"In the search for novel agents against oral pathogens in their planktonic and biofilm form, we have focused our attention on 10-undecynoic acid as the representative of the acetylenic fatty acids. Using macro-broth susceptibility testing method we first established MIC value. Next, the MBC value was determined from a broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration test by sub-culturing it to BHI agar plates that did not contain the test agent. Anti-biofilm efficacy was tested in 96-well plates coated with saliva using BHI broth supplemented with 1% sucrose as a standard approach. Based on obtained results, MIC value for 10-undecynoic acid was established to be 2.5 mg/ml and the MBC value to be 5 mg/ml. The MBIC90 showed to be 2.5 mg/ml, however completed inhibition of biofilm formation was achieved at 5.0 mg/ml. MBBC concentration revealed to be the same as MBC value, causing approximately 30% reduction at the same time in biomass of pre-existing biofilm, whereas application of 7.0 mg/ml of 10-undecynoic acid crossed the 50% eradication mark. Strong anti-adherent effect was observed upon 10-undecynoic acid application at sub-MBC concentrations as well, complemented with suppression of acidogenicity and aciduricity. Thus, we concluded that 10-undecynoic acid might play an important role in the development of alternative or adjunctive antibacterial and anti-biofilm preventive and/or therapeutic approaches."

We here assessed the immunological and oxidative responses to cervical irradiation in an animal model for radiation-induced cervicitis. Rats were sedated and either exposed to 20 Gy of ionising radiation given by a linear accelerator or only sedated (controls) and euthanized 1–14 days later. The expressions of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and coupled intracellular pathways in the cervix were assessed with immunohistofluorescence and western blot. Expression of cytokines were analysed with the Bio-Plex Suspension Array System (Bio-Rad). We showed that TLRs 2–9 were expressed in the rat cervix and cervical irradiation induced up-regulation of TLR5, TRIF and NF-κB. In the irradiated cervical epithelium, TLR5 and TRIF were increased in concert with an up-regulation of oxidative stress (8-OHdG) and antioxidant enzymes (SOD-1 and catalase). G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-10, IL- 17A, IL-18 and RANTES expressions in the cervix decreased two weeks after cervical irradiation. In conclusion, the rat uterine cervix expresses the TLRs 2–9. Cervical irradiation induces immunological changes and oxidative stress, which could have importance in the development of adverse effects to radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2938619217,"People high in negative affect (anxiety or depression) show cognitive distortions, specific thinking errors which contribute to the maintenance of their condition. It is thought that weak attentional control is a risk factor for negative affect and emotional disorders, because weak attentional control exaggerates the expression of attentional bias, another cognitive feature of emotional disorders. We wondered whether weak attentional control might similarly exaggerate the expression of cognitive distortions. In two samples of students from Turkey and the UK, we found that weak attentional control was indeed related to cognitive distortions, but this relationship was explained by both variables’ relationships with negative affect. This suggests that weak attentional control, while related to negative affect, does not necessarily exaggerate all of its cognitive features. There seems to be a limit on the affective consequences of poor attentional control, which may limit its clinical usefulness as a risk factor for emotional disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2951334989,"Hierarchical structures are ubiquitous in human and animal societies, but a fundamental understanding of their raison d'\^etre has been lacking. Here, we present a general theory in which hierarchies are obtained as the optimal design that strikes a balance between the benefits of group productivity and the costs of communication for coordination. By maximising a generic representation of the output of a hierarchical organization with respect to its design, the optimal configuration of group sizes at different levels can be determined. With very few ingredients, a wide variety of hierarchically ordered complex organisational structures can be derived. Furthermore, our results rationalise the ubiquitous occurrence of triadic hierarchies, i.e., of the universal preferred scaling ratio between $3$ and $4$ found in many human and animal hierarchies, which should occur according to our theory when production is rather evenly contributed by all levels. We also provide a systematic approach for optimising team organisation, helping to address the question of the optimal `span of control'. The significantly larger number $\sim 3-20$ of subordinates a supervisor typically manages is rationalised to occur in organisations where the production is essentially done at the bottom level and in which the higher levels are only present to optimise coordination and control."
https://openalex.org/W2935962333,"The phenolic composition and content of olive fruit are some of the attributes that determine oil quality. This composition depends on the olive variety, the cultivation system, and the fruit's ripeness. This study considered two olive varieties (Manzanilla and Morisca), under two water regimes (irrigated and rainfed), harvested at three stages of maturation (S1, S2, and S3), over three consecutive campaigns (2011, 2012, and 2013). The accumulation of phenols in the fruit was found to depend only on the stage of ripeness, while the flavonoid and phenylpropanoid contents depended also on the variety and the water regime. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was linked to O2- production, which in turn depended on water regime, variety, and stage of maturation (this last being a process involving ROS). The peroxidase (POX) activity seemed only to depend on ripeness, while polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity varied from year to year as well as presenting a strong ripeness dependence that was in clear coherence with the levels of phenolic compounds that the olives accumulate. All these relationships between the variables and the factors conform a dataset with the structure of a multidimensional array that is difficult to interpret using conventional techniques of statistical analysis. This work takes a novel approach (MultiDimensional Scaling associated with a Partial Triadic Analysis, MDS-PTA) to the analysis of this type of data structure which allows its correct interpretation. The analysis showed that the state of maturation of the olives is the most clearly discriminating factor, far more so than the cultivar, water regime, or year. Thus, the phenols and the total antioxidant activity (FRAP) showed strong clustering, being closely related in all three years studied. The oxidant and antioxidant activities showed a certain tendency to cluster, although in these cases the year also had an influence as a factor, indicating that these parameters depend more on external factors and less on ripeness."
https://openalex.org/W2939247047,"Blind individuals are particularly dependent on their hearing for defining space. It has been found that both children and adults with visual impairments can struggle with complex spatial tasks that require a metric representation of space. Nonetheless the variability of methods employed to assess spatial abilities in absence of vision is wide, especially in the case of visually impaired children. For this reason, it would be necessary to define a battery of tests that appropriately assess different aspects of spatial perception and to investigate its reliability in order to provide a standard assessment of spatial abilities not only in experimental but also in clinical settings. The aim of this study is to determine the test-retest reliability of a battery of six spatial tasks (BSP, Blind Spatial Perception) and provide the first gold standard for assessing spatial cognition deficits in visually impaired children. Thirty visually impaired children aged 6-17 participated in two identical sessions, at a distance of 10 weeks, in which they performed six spatial tasks: auditory bisection, auditory localization, auditory distance discrimination, auditory reaching, proprioceptive reaching, and general mobility. Test-retest reliability was assessed using the test-retest scatter plots, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and coefficient of variation (CV). The results showed good-to-excellent reliability for all six tests, with average ICC values ranging from 0.77 to 0.89 and average CV values ranging from 3.44% to 15.27%. In conclusion, the newly proposed battery (BSP) results as a reliable tool to identify spatial impairments in visually impaired children."
https://openalex.org/W2935919984,"Objectives Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHTS) is a tremendous public health hazard, leading to morbidity and premature mortality worldwide, with racial and ethnic minorities and those of lower socioeconomic status disproportionately affected. Flight attendants were historically exposed to high levels of SHTS in the aircraft cabin. The health effects of active smoking are known to persist for up to a lifetime, but the legacy effects of SHTS exposure have not been well characterized. Design We aimed to evaluate the legacy health effects of occupational SHTS exposure among never smoking workers using the resources of the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study, a large study of cabin crew health. We evaluated associations between SHTS exposure and a range of diagnoses using multivariate logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), employing a case-control sampling method and applying the bootstrap method to increase accuracy and precision of results. Results We found no evidence of positive associations between SHTS and any cancer, but observed associations between SHTS and cardiac outcomes, including myocardial infarction (OR = 140, 95% CI: 1·04, 3·27) and peripheral artery disease (OR = 1·27, 95% CI: 1·00, 1·97). We also found associations between SHTS exposure and repeated pneumonia (OR = 1·06, 95% CI: 1·02, 1·10). Conclusions Our study reports associations between legacy SHTS exposure going back decades and severe cardiac and respiratory health outcomes. Given the high prevalence of ongoing and historical SHTS exposure, our findings, if confirmed, have important implications for smoking cessation efforts, health education, and clinical guidelines."

It can be differentiated between two strategies to stop selectively: the fast but global stop all, then discriminate strategy and the slower but more selective first discriminate, then stop strategy. It is assumed that the first discriminate, then stop strategy is especially used when information regarding which action might have to be stopped is already available beforehand. Moreover, it is supposed that both strategies differ in matters of basal ganglia pathways used for their execution. Aim of the present study was to investigate the use of the two strategies in situations requiring selective changing of an action. Eighteen healthy male participants performed a selective stop-change task with informative and uninformative cues during fMRI. Behavioral results show that informative cues led to a benefit in both inhibition times and selectivity. FMRI data revealed that the same cortico-subcortical pathway was used with informative and uninformative cues. Behavioral and neuronal results indicate that participants used the first discriminate, then stop strategy for selective inhibition irrespective of the amount of previously available information. Moreover, the neural activity data indicate that the benefit in the informed condition was produced by an efficient preparation for the concrete change process. Possible factors that might affect which strategy is used for selective stopping are the level of previously available information (foreknowledge) and the experimental set-up, as e.g. task complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2940143296,"Persulfate (PSF) is a strong oxidant that has been used extensively in the In-Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) technology. The geoenvironmental impact of PSF treatment is barely investigated. This situation should be carefully considered as it may affect the reutilization of contaminated soil as engineering materials. This paper studied the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) by PSF with Nano Zero-Valent Iron (nZVI) and percarbonate (SPC) activated/enhanced and their subsequent impacts on the engineering properties of soil. The physicochemical and geotechnical properties of soils before and after treatment were evaluated using batch experiments. The results indicate that the introduced pristine PSF can be activated by some naturally occurring matters and subsequently lead to the mineralization of BPA. Both non-activated PSF and activated/enhanced PSF treatment led to the soil improvement in the undrained shear strength at different degrees. The primary mechanism of soil improvement is ascribed to the heterogeneous sulfate and/or carbonate precipitation. Meanwhile, Ca2+ in the pore fluid played a significant role in the enhancement of the soil strength. A conclusion was drawn that the treatment of both non-activated PSF, nZVI- and SPC-activated PSF treatment can achieve removal of BPA and soil improvement in the short-term simultaneously. This study can improve the PSF-involved remediation of brownfields and dredged sediments for a sustainable and low-carbon society."
https://openalex.org/W2940234560,"Although the relationship between public policies and disaster risk is apparent, its nature is not so evident. The dominant model, the disaster management cycle, is based on the principle of response and return to normalcy. In addition, it is accepted that policies are based on constant legal development and that risk governance is responsive to successive disasters. The temporal pattern of large nature-triggered and technological disaster events in Japan since the end of WWII has been researched by measuring the duration of events and discontinuities between them as well as the development of the regulation of disaster risk. The evolutionary relationship between these two parameters and other political and economic factors was reconstructed through the notion of disaster timescape. Results do not support the notion of disaster cycle, nor a return to normalcy at the national scale, but a timescape of overlapping and successive events. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a clear association between major events and legal development on disaster risk, neither between this and economic or political crises. Nor is there continual evolution of regulation of disaster risk but, rather, a sequence of long periods of quiescence and acceleration more indicative of policy punctuation. The disaster timescape points to greater complexity with the interaction of multiple driving forces and an unstable balance that goes beyond a simple linear cause and effect. In the disaster timescape, there appear to be overlapping trajectories of environmental, social, political and economic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2939706277,"In this paper we apply some higher order symplectic numerical methods to analyze the dynamics of 3-site Toda lattices (reduced to relative coordinates). We present benchmark numerical simulations that has been generated from the HOMsPY (Higher Order Methods in Python) library. These results provide detailed information of the underlying Hamiltonian system. These numerical simulations reinforce the claim that the symplectic numerical methods are highly accurate qualitatively and quantitatively when applied not only to Hamiltonian of the Toda lattices, but also to other physical models. Excepting exactly integrable models, these symplectic numerical schemes are superior, efficient, energy preserving and suitable for a long time integrations, unlike standard non-symplectic numerical methods which lacks preservation of energy (and other constants of motion, when such exist)."
https://openalex.org/W2937049852,"Prior to being spread throughout broader China, multiple human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 genotypes were originally discovered in the Yunnan Province. As the HIV-1 epidemic continues its spread in Yunnan, knowledge of the influence of gender, age, and ethnicity to instances of HIV reservoirs will benefit monitoring the spread of HIV.The degree to which T cells are depleted during an HIV infection depends on the levels of immune activation. T-cell subsets were assessed in newly-diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients in Yunnan, and the influence of age, gender, and ethnicity were investigated. Patients that were newly diagnosed with the HIV-infection between the years 2015 and 2018 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical College were selected for this study (N = 408). The lymphocyte levels and T cell subsets were retrospectively measured in whole blood samples by FACS analysis.The median CD4 count was 224 ± 191 cells/μl. Significantly higher mean frequencies and absolute numbers were observed in CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD45+, and CD3+CD4+/CD45+ in females compared to males. Han patients showed a higher total number of CD3+T cells and the ratio of CD3+ /CD45+ cells compared to any other ethnic minority (P < 0.001). The numbers of CD3+ T-cells, CD3+CD8+ T cells, and CD45+ T cells were highest in the age group ≥ 60. Significant differences were observed in the counts of CD3+, CD3+CD8+, and CD45+ cells and the ratio of CD3+/CD45+ and CD3+CD4+/CD45+ cells between the ≤ 29 and 30-59 age groups.This study has revealed that low levels of CD4+ T cells can be observed in newly-diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients in the Yunnan province. It has also been demonstrated that gender, age, and ethnicity have a significant association with the ratio of T-cell subsets that may contribute to virus progression and disease prognosis in individuals belonging to certain subsets of the population. This study has highlighted the importance of HIV/AIDS screening in at-risk populations to ensure timely and adequate clinical management in Yunnan."
https://openalex.org/W2940176836,"RecA is a multifunctional protein that plays a central role in DNA repair in bacteria. The structural Make ATP Work motif (MAW) is proposed to control the ATPase activity of RecA. In the present work, we report the biochemical activity and structural effects of the L53Q mutation at the MAW motif of the RecA protein from H. seropedicae (HsRecA L53Q). In vitro studies showed that HsRecA L53Q can bind ADP, ATP, and ssDNA, as does wild-type RecA. However, the ATPase and DNA-strand exchange activities were completely lost. In vivo studies showed that the expression of HsRecA L53Q in E. coli recA1 does not change its phenotype when cells were challenged with MMS and UV. Molecular dynamics simulations showed the L53Q point mutation did not cause large conformational changes in the HsRecA structure. However, there is a difference on dynamical cross-correlation movements of the residues involved in contacts within the ATP binding site and regions that hold the DNA binding sites. Additionally, a new hydrogen bond, formed between Q53 and T49, was hypothesized to allow an independent motion of the MAW motif from the hydrophobic core, what could explain the observed loss of activity of HsRecA L53Q."
