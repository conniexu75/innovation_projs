Endotherms have a much broader range of activity that can be sustained by this augmented aerobic metabolism. Ectotherms are more reliant upon, and limited by, anaerobic metabolism during activity. A principal factor in the evolution of endothermy was the increase in aerobic capacities to support sustained activity."

https://openalex.org/W2082109925,"Spontaneous rhythmic activity in isolated cardiac pacemaker cells can be terminated by a brief, subthreshold, depolarizing or hyperpolarizing perturbation of the proper magnitude applied at a specific point in the pacemaker cycle. Evidence is provided in support of a topological theory of the existence of a ""singular"" point in cardiac oscillators."

https://openalex.org/W2031833415,D-Arabinitol was identified as a major metabolite of Candida species in human subjects. Gas-liquid chromatography was used to measure the concentration of D-arabinitol in serum. The study included subjects who were healthy and cancer patients who had proven invasive candidiasis or were colonized with Candida. D-Arabinitol concentrations greater than 1.0 microgram per milliliter were found in serum from patients with invasive infection. This technique may prove valuable in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.

https://openalex.org/W1973137087,"The interaural phase sensitivity of neurons was studied through the use of binaural beat stimuli. The response of most cells was phase-locked to the beat frequency, which provides a possible neural correlate to the human sensation of binaural beats. In addition, this stimulus allowed the direction and rate of interaural phase change to be varied. Some neurons in our sample responded selectively to manipulations of these two variables, which suggests a sensitivity to direction or speed of movement."

https://openalex.org/W1975175075,Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of specific immunoglobulin G antibody to HRP is selectively absorbed from the gut lumen and transferred by intestinal epithelial cells to the lamina propria in newborn rats. The HRP is not transferred in detectable amounts in the absence of the antibody. Transport of maternally derived antigen via antigen-antibody complexes may have important influences on the developing immune system in young mammals.

https://openalex.org/W2064455528,"Separate perfusions of canine coronary arteries with colored silicone-rubber compound reveal that in the region where two microcirculations abut, capillaries derived from individual large vessels are discrete, with no interconnections. Terminal homologous capillaries form loops rather than anastomosing with heterologous capillaries. This anatomic arrangement may account for discrete myocardial infarctions without ischemic border zones."

https://openalex.org/W2009163780,"The distribution of mass in an object held in the hand, as described by its moment of inertia, is a fundamental and potent but largely unrecognized contributor to the object's ""feel."" A limited set of experiments has produced Weber fractions for human differential sensitivity to this property in the approximate range of 1/5 to 1/3, which is about ten times the Weber fraction reported for lifted weights."
https://openalex.org/W1579460495,"Histamine membrane receptors are defined as either H1 (blocked by diphenhydramine-like antagonists) or H2 (blocked by cimetidine-like agents). We now report the solubilization, separation, and partial characterization of specific H1 and H2 membrane receptors from calf thymocytes. Membrane fragments were incubated with [3H]histamine either alone or with unlabeled histamine, diphenhydramine, or cimetidine. Maximal specific binding occurred with incubation at 37 degrees C for 2 h at a concentration of 5 x 10(-6) M [3H]histamine. Labeled receptors were solubilized from membranes with 0.3 M KCl and 1% Nonidet 40. Chromatography of the solubilized labeled receptors on ion exchange columns revealed two classes of receptor. One class bound to DEAE-cellulose and eluted as a sharp peak at 0.15 M NaCl/Pi. The other bound to phosphocellulose and eluted as a sharp peak at 0.55 M NaCl/Pi. Initial incubation of the membranes in the presence of the H1 receptor antagonist diphenhydramine virtually abolished the DEAE-cellulose peak, while incubation with cimetidine, the H2 receptor antagonist, blocked the phosphocellulose peak. We conclude that H1 and H2 histamine receptors are physically separable and can be defined by their ability to bind to either DEAE-cellulose or phosphocellulose."

https://openalex.org/W1570300916,"Cultured fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies were used to develop a system for studying insulin resistance in human tissue in vitro. Uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid by cultured human skin fibroblasts was found to occur by a combination of saturable and nonsaturable processes. Insulin stimulated uptake by decreasing the Km of the saturable transport system from 0.58 mM to 0.26 mM. The maximal velocity of saturable uptake was 16.6 nmol/10(7) cells/min in both the presence and absence of insulin. Uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid at 0.2 mM was studied in human skin fibroblasts with and without chronic exposure to insulin for 4 days at an initial concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. Unstimulated uptake was increased from 17 to 20 nmol/10(8) cells/min, and the increase in uptake due to maximal stimulation by insulin was unchanged at 16 nmol/10(8) cells/min in the cells exposed chronically to insulin. The apparent Km for insulin was increased from 80 microunits/ml to 2400 microunits/ml in the insulin-exposed cells. Thus, chronic exposure to insulin induces resistance of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by decreasing the apparent affinity for insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1977845354,"Dustfall along roads and trails being used recreationally in the Clear Creek area of San Benito County, California, located in the New Idria serpentinite, was found to be 90 percent or more chrysotile asbestos. Personal samplers worn by motorcyclists using one of the trails showed concentrations of airborne fibers ranging from 0.3 to 5.3 fibers per milliliter, according to methods prescribed for monitoring occupational exposures. The present workplace standard for brief exposures to asbestos is 10 fibers per milliliter; 5 fibers per milliliter is the proposed standard. The average total dust concentration estimated from personal samplers was approximately 20 milligrams per cubic meter of roughly 90 percent chrysotile. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of asbestos exposures of this magnitude, in size ranges known to be pathogenic, resulting from natural deposits not associated with mining, milling, or industrial use."
https://openalex.org/W1551357661,"Methotrexate transport in L1210 cells is mediated by a carrier protein that can bind organic and inorganic phosphate compounds in addition to the various folate substrates. The photoaffinity labeling agent, 8-azidoadenosine 5'-monophosphate (8-azido-AMP), also interactis (Ki = 140 microM) with the receptor site for this transport system, and upon irradiation with ultraviolet light, irreversibly inhibits methotrexate uptake. Protection against this inactivation is afforded by either a substrate (methotrexate) or a competitive inhibitor (inorganic phosphate). The light-induced reaction proceeds rapidly (t1/2 = 2 min at 23 degrees C under the conditions described) and produces half-maximal reduction in the transport rate when the 8-azido-AMP concentration is 65 microM. complete photoinactivation of methotrexate transport could not be obtained from a single exposure to 8-azido-AMP (up to 1.0 mM), but it could be achieved by the repetitive illumination of cells in a fresh medium. The phosphate and folate/adenine transport systems of L1210 cells are not affected by irradiation in the presence of 8-azido-AMP."

https://openalex.org/W2047018680,"Estradiol-17 beta stimulates the synthesis of numerous proteins exported into the culture medium by Xenopus tadpole liver tissue obtained after stage 50 and throughout metamorphosis to stage 66. Although estrogen-induced vitellogenin can be detected as early as stage 54, it is a minor percentage of the exported proteins until after the completion of metamorphosis. In hepatic tissue obtained after metamorphosis, the hormone evokes the synthesis of vitellogenin specifically without affecting the labeling of other secreted proteins."
