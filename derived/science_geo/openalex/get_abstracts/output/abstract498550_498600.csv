https://openalex.org/W2008343182,"Disease tolerance is the ability of the host to reduce the effect of infection on host fitness. Analysis of disease tolerance pathways could provide new approaches for treating infections and other inflammatory diseases. Typically, an initial exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a state of refractoriness to further LPS challenge (endotoxin tolerance). We found that a first exposure of mice to LPS activated the ligand-operated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which provided an activating ligand to the former, to downregulate early inflammatory gene expression. However, on LPS rechallenge, AhR engaged in long-term regulation of systemic inflammation only in the presence of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). AhR-complex-associated Src kinase activity promoted IDO1 phosphorylation and signalling ability. The resulting endotoxin-tolerant state was found to protect mice against immunopathology in Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, pointing to a role for AhR in contributing to host fitness. Initial exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces endotoxin tolerance, which reduces immunological reactions to LPS; here it is shown that primary LPS challenge is controlled by AhR, TDO2 and IL-10, whereas sustained effects require AhR, IDO1 and TGF-β, allowing for disease tolerance with reduced immunopathology in infections. Endotoxin tolerance is an aspect of innate immunity in which prior exposure to a bacterial endotoxin (or lipopolysaccharide) reduces the host's response to subsequent exposure. Despite a recent resurgence of interest in this effect, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This paper shows that the development of endotoxin tolerance is dependent on tryptophan catabolism through the sequential involvement of the metabolic enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2). This leads to kynurenine production which activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR. Primary endotoxin challenge is controlled by AhR, TDO2 and interleukin, whereas sustained tolerance requires AhR, IDO1 and the cytokine TGF-β, allowing for pathogen clearance with little immunopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2064254630,"Cotranslational protein translocation is a universally conserved process for secretory and membrane protein biosynthesis. Nascent polypeptides emerging from a translating ribosome are either transported across or inserted into the membrane via the ribosome-bound Sec61 channel. Here, we report structures of a mammalian ribosome-Sec61 complex in both idle and translating states, determined to 3.4 and 3.9 Å resolution. The data sets permit building of a near-complete atomic model of the mammalian ribosome, visualization of A/P and P/E hybrid-state tRNAs, and analysis of a nascent polypeptide in the exit tunnel. Unprecedented chemical detail is observed for both the ribosome-Sec61 interaction and the conformational state of Sec61 upon ribosome binding. Comparison of the maps from idle and translating complexes suggests how conformational changes to the Sec61 channel could facilitate translocation of a secreted polypeptide. The high-resolution structure of the mammalian ribosome-Sec61 complex provides a valuable reference for future functional and structural studies."

By blocking mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces HIF-1α protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/− mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives HIF-1α protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, a process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives HIF-1α synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3. Interestingly, we observed a disconnect between HIF-1α protein levels and VEGF-A expression. Although both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 regulate HIF-1α translation, VEGF-A is primarily under the control of 4E-BP1/eIF4E. S6K1 inhibition reduces HIF-1α but not VEGF-A expression, suggesting that mTORC1 mediates VEGF-A expression via both HIF-1α-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our work has important implications for the treatment of vascularised tumours, where mTORC1 acts as a central mediator of STAT3, HIF-1α, VEGF-A and angiogenesis via multiple signalling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2059144079,"Treatment with exogenous leptin has been reported to improve hyperglycemia in mouse models of type 1 diabetes through lowering of glucagon signaling. Jerry Shulman and his colleagues now report that the more primary beneficial effect of leptin on hyperglycemia is by reducing the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These results give further credence to the possible use of leptin therapy for this form of diabetes. Leptin treatment reverses hyperglycemia in animal models of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes (T1D)1,2,3,4,5,6, spurring great interest in the possibility of treating patients with this hormone. The antidiabetic effect of leptin has been postulated to occur through suppression of glucagon production, suppression of glucagon responsiveness or both; however, there does not appear to be a direct effect of leptin on the pancreatic alpha cell7. Thus, the mechanisms responsible for the antidiabetic effect of leptin remain poorly understood. We quantified liver-specific rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis and substrate oxidation in conjunction with rates of whole-body acetate, glycerol and fatty acid turnover in three rat models of poorly controlled diabetes, including a model of diabetic ketoacidosis8. We show that the higher rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis in all these models could be attributed to hypoleptinemia-induced activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in higher rates of adipocyte lipolysis, hepatic conversion of glycerol to glucose through a substrate push mechanism and conversion of pyruvate to glucose through greater hepatic acetyl-CoA allosteric activation of pyruvate carboxylase flux. Notably, these effects could be dissociated from changes in plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations and hepatic gluconeogenic protein expression. All the altered systemic and hepatic metabolic fluxes could be mimicked by infusing rats with Intralipid or corticosterone and were corrected by leptin replacement. These data demonstrate a critical role for lipolysis and substrate delivery to the liver, secondary to hypoleptinemia and HPA axis activity, in promoting higher hepatic gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia in poorly controlled diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1994264890,"It is widely held that the frontal eye field (FEF) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) modulates processing in visual cortex with attention, although the evidence that it is necessary is equivocal. To help identify critical sources of attentional feedback to area V4, we surgically removed the entire lateral PFC, including the FEF, in one hemisphere and transected the corpus callosum and anterior commissure in two macaques. This deprived V4 of PFC input in one hemisphere while keeping the other hemisphere intact. In the absence of PFC, attentional effects on neuronal responses and synchrony in V4 were substantially reduced and the remaining effects of attention were delayed in time, indicating a critical role for PFC. Conversely, distracters captured attention and influenced V4 responses. However, because the effects of attention in V4 were not eliminated by PFC lesions, other sources of top-down attentional control signals to visual cortex must exist outside of PFC."
https://openalex.org/W1964122947,"Genetic mutations in tumor cells cause several unique metabolic phenotypes that are critical for cancer cell proliferation. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induce oncogenic addiction in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). However, the linkage between oncogenic mutated EGFR and cancer cell metabolism has not yet been clearly elucidated. Here we show that EGFR signaling plays an important role in aerobic glycolysis in EGFR-mutated LAD cells. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) decreased lactate production, glucose consumption, and the glucose-induced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), indicating that EGFR signaling maintained aerobic glycolysis in LAD cells. Metabolomic analysis revealed that metabolites in the glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), pyrimidine biosynthesis, and redox metabolism were significantly decreased after treatment of LAD cells with EGFRTKI. On a molecular basis, the glucose transport carried out by glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) was downregulated in TKI-sensitive LAD cells. Moreover, EGFR signaling activated carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD), which catalyzes the first step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We conclude that EGFR signaling regulates the global metabolic pathway in EGFR-mutated LAD cells. Our data provide evidence that may link therapeutic response to the regulation of metabolism, which is an attractive target for the development of more effective targeted therapies to treat patients with EGFR-mutated LAD."

https://openalex.org/W2010543985,"Metformin is a first-line antidiabetic agent taken by 150 million people across the world every year, yet its mechanism remains only partially understood and controversial. It was proposed that suppression of glucose production in hepatocytes by metformin is AMPK-independent; however, unachievably high concentrations of metformin were employed in these studies. In the current study, we find that metformin, via an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism, suppresses glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression in primary hepatocytes at concentrations found in the portal vein of animals (60-80 μM). Metformin also inhibits gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver of mice administered orally with metformin. Furthermore, the cAMP-PKA pathway negatively regulates AMPK activity through phosphorylation at Ser-485/497 on the α subunit, which in turn reduces net phosphorylation at Thr-172. Because diabetic patients often have hyperglucagonemia, AMPKα phosphorylation at Ser-485/497 is a therapeutic target to improve metformin efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2044443368,"Functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum (STR) is thought critical for cognition and has been linked to conditions like autism and schizophrenia. We recorded from multiple electrodes in PFC and STR while monkeys acquired new categories. Category learning was accompanied by an increase in beta band synchronization of LFPs between, but not within, the PFC and STR. After learning, different pairs of PFC-STR electrodes showed stronger synchrony for one or the other category, suggesting category-specific functional circuits. This category-specific synchrony was also seen between PFC spikes and STR LFPs, but not the reverse, reflecting the direct monosynaptic connections from the PFC to STR. However, causal connectivity analyses suggested that the polysynaptic connections from STR to the PFC exerted a stronger overall influence. This supports models positing that the basal ganglia ""train"" the PFC. Category learning may depend on the formation of functional circuits between the PFC and STR."
https://openalex.org/W2052322970,"Understanding how chance historical events shape evolutionary processes is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Direct insights into the extent and causes of evolutionary contingency have been limited to experimental systems, because it is difficult to know what happened in the deep past and to characterize other paths that evolution could have followed. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction, directed evolution and biophysical analysis to explore alternative 'might-have-been' trajectories during the ancient evolution of a novel protein function. We previously found that the evolution of cortisol specificity in the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was contingent on permissive substitutions, which had no apparent effect on receptor function but were necessary for GR to tolerate the large-effect mutations that caused the shift in specificity. Here we show that alternative mutations that could have permitted the historical function-switching substitutions are extremely rare in the ensemble of genotypes accessible to the ancestral GR. In a library of thousands of variants of the ancestral protein, we recovered historical permissive substitutions but no alternative permissive genotypes. Using biophysical analysis, we found that permissive mutations must satisfy at least three physical requirements--they must stabilize specific local elements of the protein structure, maintain the correct energetic balance between functional conformations, and be compatible with the ancestral and derived structures--thus revealing why permissive mutations are rare. These findings demonstrate that GR evolution depended strongly on improbable, non-deterministic events, and this contingency arose from intrinsic biophysical properties of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2055032691,"Matthew Berriman and colleagues report the whole-genome sequences of the human-infective whipworm Trichuris trichiura and the mouse-infective laboratory model Trichuris muris. Their transcriptome analyses and examination of T. muris infection in mice provide insights into host response to infection and potential drug targets for this major soil-transmitted helminth. Whipworms are common soil-transmitted helminths that cause debilitating chronic infections in man. These nematodes are only distantly related to Caenorhabditis elegans and have evolved to occupy an unusual niche, tunneling through epithelial cells of the large intestine. We report here the whole-genome sequences of the human-infective Trichuris trichiura and the mouse laboratory model Trichuris muris. On the basis of whole-transcriptome analyses, we identify many genes that are expressed in a sex- or life stage–specific manner and characterize the transcriptional landscape of a morphological region with unique biological adaptations, namely, bacillary band and stichosome, found only in whipworms and related parasites. Using RNA sequencing data from whipworm-infected mice, we describe the regulated T helper 1 (TH1)-like immune response of the chronically infected cecum in unprecedented detail. In silico screening identified numerous new potential drug targets against trichuriasis. Together, these genomes and associated functional data elucidate key aspects of the molecular host-parasite interactions that define chronic whipworm infection."
https://openalex.org/W2007669329,"Forced vital capacity (FVC), a spirometric measure of pulmonary function, reflects lung volume and is used to diagnose and monitor lung diseases. We performed genome-wide association study meta-analysis of FVC in 52,253 individuals from 26 studies and followed up the top associations in 32,917 additional individuals of European ancestry. We found six new regions associated at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with FVC in or near EFEMP1, BMP6, MIR129-2-HSD17B12, PRDM11, WWOX and KCNJ2. Two loci previously associated with spirometric measures (GSTCD and PTCH1) were related to FVC. Newly implicated regions were followed up in samples from African-American, Korean, Chinese and Hispanic individuals. We detected transcripts for all six newly implicated genes in human lung tissue. The new loci may inform mechanisms involved in lung development and the pathogenesis of restrictive lung disease."

https://openalex.org/W2119961443,"Growing clinical and experimental evidence suggests that sterile inflammation contributes to alcoholic liver disease (ALD). High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is highly induced during liver injury; however, a link between this alarmin and ALD has not been established. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine whether HMGB1 contributes to the pathogenesis of ALD. Liver biopsies from patients with ALD showed a robust increase in HMGB1 expression and translocation, which correlated with disease stage, compared with healthy explants. Similar findings were observed in chronic ethanol-fed wild-type (WT) mice. Using primary cell culture, we validated the ability of hepatocytes from ethanol-fed mice to secrete a large amount of HMGB1. Secretion was time- and dose-dependent and responsive to prooxidants and antioxidants. Selective ablation of Hmgb1 in hepatocytes protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury due to increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, phosphorylated 5'AMP-activated protein kinase-α, and phosphorylated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α expression along with elevated LDL plus VLDL export. Native and post-translationally modified HMGB1 were detected in humans and mice with ALD. In liver and serum from control mice and in serum from healthy volunteers, the lysine residues within the peptides containing nuclear localization signals (NLSs) 1 and 2 were non-acetylated, and all cysteine residues were reduced. However, in livers from ethanol-fed mice, in addition to all thiol/non-acetylated isoforms of HMGB1, we observed acetylated NLS1 and NLS2, a unique phosphorylation site in serine 35, and an increase in oxidation of HMGB1 to the disulfide isoform. In serum from ethanol-fed mice and from patients with ALD, there was disulfide-bonded hyperacetylated HMGB1, disulfide-bonded non-acetylated HMGB1, and HMGB1 phosphorylated in serine 35. Hepatocytes appeared to be a major source of these HMGB1 isoforms. Thus, hepatocyte HMGB1 participates in the pathogenesis of ALD and undergoes post-translational modifications (PTMs) that could condition its toxic effects."

https://openalex.org/W2071465358,"Genetic studies have suggested a functional link between cholesterol/sphingolipid metabolism and endocytic membrane traffic. Here we show that perturbing the cholesterol/sphingomyelin balance in the plasma membrane results in the massive formation of clusters of narrow endocytic tubular invaginations positive for N-BAR proteins. These tubules are intensely positive for sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1). SPHK1 is also targeted to physiologically occurring early endocytic intermediates, and is highly enriched in nerve terminals, which are cellular compartments specialized for exo/endocytosis. Membrane recruitment of SPHK1 involves a direct, curvature-sensitive interaction with the lipid bilayer mediated by a hydrophobic patch on the enzyme's surface. The knockdown of SPHKs results in endocytic recycling defects, and a mutation that disrupts the hydrophobic patch of Caenorhabditis elegans SPHK fails to rescue the neurotransmission defects in loss-of-function mutants of this enzyme. Our studies support a role for sphingosine phosphorylation in endocytic membrane trafficking beyond the established function of sphingosine-1-phosphate in intercellular signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2029284984,"An outstanding problem in the field of high-transition-temperature (high Tc) superconductivity is the identification of the normal state out of which superconductivity emerges in the mysterious underdoped regime. The normal state uncomplicated by thermal fluctuations is effectively accessed by the use of applied magnetic fields sufficiently strong to suppress long-range superconductivity at low temperatures. Proposals in which the normal ground state is characterised by small Fermi surface pockets that exist in the absence of symmetry breaking have been superseded by models based on the existence of a superlattice that breaks the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice. Recently, a charge superlattice model that positions a small electron-like Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the nodes (where the superconducting gap is minimum) has been proposed a replacement for the prevalent superlattice models that position the Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the pseudogap at the antinodes (where the superconducting gap is maximum). Although some ingredients of symmetry breaking have been recently revealed by crystallographic studies, their relevance to the electronic structure remains unresolved. Here we report angle-resolved quantum oscillation measurements in the underdoped copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6+x. These measurements reveal a normal ground state comprising electron-like Fermi surface pockets located in the vicinity of the superconducting gap minima (or nodes), and further point to an underlying superlattice structure of low frequency and long wavelength with features in common with the charge order identified recently by complementary spectroscopic techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2046255080,"Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are leading to physical changes in marine environments including parallel decreases in ocean pH and increases in seawater temperature. This study examined the impacts of a six month exposure to combined decreased pH and increased temperature on the immune response and disease status in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis L. Results provide the first confirmation that exposure to future acidification and warming conditions via aquarium-based simulation may have parallel implications for bivalve health. Collectively, the data suggests that temperature more than pH may be the key driver affecting immune response in M. edulis. Data also suggests that both increases in temperature and/or lowered pH conditions may lead to changes in parasite abundance and diversity, pathological conditions, and bacterial incidence in M. edulis. These results have implications for future management of shellfish under a predicted climate change scenario and future sustainability of shellfisheries. Examination of the combined effects of two stressors over an extended exposure period provides key preliminary data and thus, this work represents a unique and vital contribution to current research efforts towards a collective understanding of expected near-future impacts of climate change on marine environments."

https://openalex.org/W2081681887,"Retraction of flawed articles is an important mechanism for correction of the scientific literature. We recently reported that the majority of retractions are associated with scientific misconduct. In the current study, we focused on the subset of retractions for which no misconduct was identified, in order to identify the major causes of error. Analysis of the retraction notices for 423 articles indexed in PubMed revealed that the most common causes of error-related retraction are laboratory errors, analytical errors, and irreproducible results. The most common laboratory errors are contamination and problems relating to molecular biology procedures (e.g., sequencing, cloning). Retractions due to contamination were more common in the past, whereas analytical errors are now increasing in frequency. A number of publications that have not been retracted despite being shown to contain significant errors suggest that barriers to retraction may impede correction of the literature. In particular, few cases of retraction due to cell line contamination were found despite recognition that this problem has affected numerous publications. An understanding of the errors leading to retraction can guide practices to improve laboratory research and the integrity of the scientific literature. Perhaps most important, our analysis has identified major problems in the mechanisms used to rectify the scientific literature and suggests a need for action by the scientific community to adopt protocols that ensure the integrity of the publication process.—Casadevall, A., Steen, R.

https://openalex.org/W2044508618,"Many Gram-positive bacteria coordinate cellular processes by signaling through Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPKs), but the architecture of these phosphosignaling cascades is unknown. To investigate the network structure of a prokaryotic STPK system, we comprehensively explored the pattern of signal transduction in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr kinome. Autophosphorylation is the dominant mode of STPK activation, but the 11 M. tuberculosis STPKs also show a specific pattern of efficient cross-phosphorylation in vitro. The biochemical specificity intrinsic to each kinase domain was used to map the provisional signaling network, revealing a three-layer architecture that includes master regulators, signal transducers, and terminal substrates. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the STPKs are specifically localized in the cell. Master STPKs are concentrated at the same subcellular sites as their substrates, providing additional support for the biochemically defined network. Together, these studies imply a branched functional architecture of the M. tuberculosis Ser/Thr kinome that could enable horizontal signal spreading. This systems-level approach provides a biochemical and spatial framework for understanding Ser/Thr phospho-signaling in M. tuberculosis, which differs fundamentally from previously defined linear histidine kinase cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1965215617,"Hydroperoxides of amino acid and amino acid residues (tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan, and histidine) in proteins are formed during oxidative modification induced by reactive oxygen species. Amino acid hydroperoxides are unstable intermediates that can further propagate oxidative damage in proteins. The existing assays (oxidation of ferrous cation and iodometric assays) cannot be used in real-time measurements. In this study, we show that the profluorescent coumarin boronic acid (CBA) probe reacts with amino acid and protein hydroperoxides to form the corresponding fluorescent product, 7-hydroxycoumarin. 7-Hydroxycoumarin formation was catalase-independent. Based on this observation, we have developed a fluorometric, real-time assay that is adapted to a multiwell plate format. This is the first report showing real-time monitoring of amino acid and protein hydroperoxides using the CBA-based assay. This approach was used to detect protein hydroperoxides in cell lysates obtained from macrophages exposed to visible light and photosensitizer (rose bengal). We also measured the rate constants for the reaction between amino acid hydroperoxides (tyrosyl, tryptophan, and histidine hydroperoxides) and CBA, and these values (7-23 M(-1) s(-1)) were significantly higher than that measured for H2O2 (1.5 M(-1) s(-1)). Using the CBA-based competition kinetics approach, the rate constants for amino acid hydroperoxides with ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimic, were also determined, and the values were within the range of 1.1-1.5 × 10(3) M(-1) s(-1). Both ebselen and boronates may be used as small molecule scavengers of amino acid and protein hydroperoxides.

Using mouse models and multiphoton intravital imaging, we have identified a crucial effect of SHP2 on TNBC cell motility in vivo. Further, analysis of TNBC cells revealed that SHP2 also influences cell migration, chemotaxis and invasion in vitro. Unbiased phosphoproteomics and biochemical analysis showed that SHP2 activates several SRC-family kinases and downstream targets, most of which are inducers of migration and invasion. In particular, direct interaction between SHP2 and c-SRC was revealed by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. These results suggest that SHP2 is a crucial factor during early steps of TNBC migration to distant organs."

To further characterize this novel mechanism of translation initiation, we have used proteomics to identify the components of the norovirus translation initiation factor complex. This approach revealed that VPg binds directly to the eIF4F complex, with a high affinity interaction occurring between VPg and eIF4G.

https://openalex.org/W2070657569,"Motivated by recent experimental studies, we derive and analyze a two-dimensional model for the contraction patterns observed in protoplasmic droplets of Physarum polycephalum. The model couples a description of an active poroelastic two-phase medium with equations describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the intracellular free calcium concentration. The poroelastic medium is assumed to consist of an active viscoelastic solid representing the cytoskeleton and a viscous fluid describing the cytosol. The equations for the poroelastic medium are obtained from continuum force balance and include the relevant mechanical fields and an incompressibility condition for the two-phase medium. The reaction-diffusion equations for the calcium dynamics in the protoplasm of Physarum are extended by advective transport due to the flow of the cytosol generated by mechanical stress. Moreover, we assume that the active tension in the solid cytoskeleton is regulated by the calcium concentration in the fluid phase at the same location, which introduces a mechanochemical coupling. A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous state without deformation and cytosolic flows exhibits an oscillatory Turing instability for a large enough mechanochemical coupling strength. Numerical simulations of the model equations reproduce a large variety of wave patterns, including traveling and standing waves, turbulent patterns, rotating spirals and antiphase oscillations in line with experimental observations of contraction patterns in the protoplasmic droplets."

However, little is known about whether Ror2 function is conserved in other vertebrates or is involved in other non-canonical Wnt ligands in vivo. In this study we demonstrated that overexpression of dominant-negative ror2 (ror2-TM) mRNA in zebrafish embryos resulted in convergence and extension defects and incompletely separated eyes, which is consistent with observations from slb/wnt11 mutants or wnt11 knockdown morphants. Moreover, the co-injection of ror2-TM mRNA and a wnt11 morpholino or the coexpression of ror2 and wnt11 in zebrafish embryos synergetically induced more severe convergence and extension defects.

Overall, our data suggest an important role of Ror2 in mediating Wnt11 signaling and in regulating convergence and extension movements in zebrafish. The receptor-tyrosine kinase Ror2 acts as an alternative receptor or co-receptor for Wnt5a and mediates Wnt5a-induced convergent extension movements during embryogenesis in mice and Xenopus as well as the polarity and migration of several cell types during development. However, little is known about whether Ror2 function is conserved in other vertebrates or is involved in other non-canonical Wnt ligands in vivo. In this study we demonstrated that overexpression of dominant-negative ror2 (ror2-TM) mRNA in zebrafish embryos resulted in convergence and extension defects and incompletely separated eyes, which is consistent with observations from slb/wnt11 mutants or wnt11 knockdown morphants. Moreover, the co-injection of ror2-TM mRNA and a wnt11 morpholino or the coexpression of ror2 and wnt11 in zebrafish embryos synergetically induced more severe convergence and extension defects.

In vertebrates, gastrulation is a phase of essential fundamental morphogenetic movements that facilitate the formation of the basic germ layers and the body axis during early embryonic development. During gastrulation, convergence and extension movements narrow a group of embryonic cells mediolaterally and lengthen them anteroposteriorly (1Keller R. Davidson L. Edlund A. Elul T. Ezin M.

Ror2, which belongs to the Ror family of receptor-tyrosine kinases, is an orphan receptor (14Oishi I. Suzuki H. Onishi N. Takada R. Kani S. Ohkawara B. Koshida I. Suzuki K. Yamada G. Schwabe G.C.

The identification of Wnt binding domains in Ror2 suggested that noncanonical Wnt ligands may trigger alternative receptors, i.e. receptors other than Fzd (15Kim C. Forrester W.C.

This makes more complexes between receptors-co-receptors and noncanonical Wnt ligands on the cell membrane and even downstream components in the cytoplasm. For example, in the regulation of convergent extension movements in Xenopus gastrulation, XWnt-5A regulates XPAPC gene expression through XRor2 and downstream PI3 kinase and cdc42, which activate the JNK signaling cascade by mediating the expression of the transcription factors ATF2 and c-jun (17Schambony A.

However, whether the role of Ror2 is conserved in other vertebrates or whether Ror2 mediates the effects of other ligands in gastrulation movements is not completely understood. In this study we demonstrate that Ror2 is required for normal convergence and extension movements in zebrafish. The overexpression of a dominant-negative Ror2 results in convergence and extension defects and zebrafish embryo eye fusion, which is a phenocopy of slb/wnt11 mutants and wnt11 knockdown morphants. Ror2 interacts with Wnt11 and mediates Wnt11 signaling during gastrulation movements via Dsh and RhoA. RNA polymerase and RNase-free DNase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).

Anti-His antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Wild type zebrafish (Danio rerio; Tuebingen strain) were maintained on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle and fed twice daily. Embryos were obtained by natural cross-breeding. Fertilized eggs were raised at 28.5 °C and staged according to Kimmel et al. (20Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Stages of embryonic development of the zebrafish.Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8709) Google Scholar). 2-Phenylthiourea (0.003% (w/v)) was added to the embryo rearing solution in some experiments to inhibit embryo pigment formation. All of the experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Ethical Committee of Experimental Animal Care at Ocean University of China. Using the human ROR2 amino acid sequence as a query, the zebrafish genome database was searched using tBLASTN, and the zebrafish Ror2-like sequence was obtained (NCBI: XM_684589.6). The primers were designed as follows based on the sequence: forward, 5′-TCCCATCGATAGCCACCATGTTCCCTGTAAGGATGTATCAT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCGTTATGCGTCAGAGTTGATTTCATTG-3′. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with the MEGA4 software (The Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ) with the JTT model. Bootstrap analyses were run on 1000 replications. Total RNA was isolated from embryos using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) (Sangon, Shanghai, China) and SuperScript® II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using TaqDNA polymerase with the following primers: forward, 5′-GCACGCACACACTCACTCAGTTATC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCGGACCTCTCGTGCCCTCCT-3′. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as reported previously (21Maures T.J. Duan C. Structure, developmental expression, and physiological regulation of zebrafish IGF binding protein-1.Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2722-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the ror2 partial ORF was used to generate sense and antisense riboprobes using DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) following standard procedures. Amplified cDNAs were subcloned into the pCS2+enhanced GFP expression vector (22Li Y. Xiang J. Duan C.

The following primers were used to generate Ror2-Y647F, Ror2-S863A, and Ror2-Y647F-S863A mutant constructs: Ror2-Y647F (forward, 5′-GGTCTACTCCGCGGACTTCTACAAACTTATGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTCTACTCCGCGGACTTCTACAAACTTATGGG-3′); Ror2-S863A (forward, 5′-GGCTGGGTCGCACCATGCCGGCAGCGGCTCCACC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTGGAGCCGCTGCCGGCATGGTGCGACCCAGCC-3′).Ror2-TM, which corresponds to bases 1–1422 of zebrafish ror2, was constructed by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-TCCCATCGATAGCCACCATGTTCCCTGTAAGGATGTATCAT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCGTTATGCCGACAAGTTGAGTTCTCGT-3′. pcDNA3.1-Wnt11 was constructed by subcloning Wnt11 into the pcDNA3.1 vector. To test the blocking efficiency of ror2-MO, reporter plasmids were constructed by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-CCATCGATGGACACCTTTACGGCTGAGCGGGATGA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCGAGCCGGCGACTGCCCTGTATTGCC-3′. The PCR products were then cloned into pCS2-enhanced GFP. All of the plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (Shanghai Sangon Co. Ltd.). Two non-overlapping, translation-blocking morpholinos (MOs) that target zebrafish ror2 were synthesized by Gene Tools, LLC. The morpholino sequences were as follows: ror2-MO1, 5′-CAGTGTAACAACTTCCAAACTCTCC-3′; ror2-MO2, 5′-TGATACATCCTTACAGGGAACATTC-3′. The wnt11 MO was synthesized according to a published sequence (13Matsui T. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Callol-Massot C. Capdevila J. Rodríguez-Esteban C. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Noncanonical Wnt signaling regulates midline convergence of organ primordia during zebrafish development.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A standard control MO was used as the control. The morpholinos were resuspended in 1× Danieau medium (58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.6 mm Ca(NO3)2, and 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). All of the MOs and mRNA were injected into embryos at the one-cell stage. After injection, the embryos were placed in embryo-rearing medium and maintained at 28.5 °C. Donor embryos were injected with the control MO or ror2-TM mRNA mixed with lineage markers (Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546) at the one-cell stage. Host embryos were wild-type embryos or embryos injected with Wnt11 MO at the one-cell stage. When the host embryos were at the shield stage, 20–30 cells were removed from each donor embryo at the sphere stage by using a needle into the center of lateral mesoderm of a host embryo. The host embryos were then allowed to develop until ∼11 hours post-fertilization (hpf) for imaging. The images were acquired with a stereo fluorescence microscope (M165FL, Leica). The distance between Alexa Fluor 546- and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled cells in 10 embryos from each group was analyzed and calculated as previously reported (23Lin S. Baye L.M. Westfall T.A. Slusarski D.C. Wnt5b-Ryk pathway provides directional signals to regulate gastrulation movement.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For assessing ligand-receptor interactions by transplantation, donor embryos were injected with 800 pg of ror2 mRNA + 400 pg of membrane gfp mRNA + 4 ng of wnt11 MO or 800 pg of ror2-TM mRNA + 400 pg of membrane gfp mRNA + 4 ng of wnt11 MO. Host embryos were injected with 100 pg of wnt11 mRNA. At the sphere stage, 20–30 cells were transplanted into the blastodermal margin of each host embryo. At the shield stage, embryos with transplanted cells in the lateral or ventral mesoderm were selected and allowed to grow to 90% epiboly for imaging with a 63× water immersion objective on a Leica DM2500 fluorescence microscope. Cell roundness was measured by Image J software (National Institutes of Health), and ∼100 cells from each group were analyzed as previously reported (11Kilian B. Mansukoski H. Barbosa F.C. Ulrich F. Tada M. Heisenberg C.P. The role of Ppt/Wnt5 in regulating cell shape and movement during zebrafish gastrulation.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To prepare protein-expressing cells, HEK293T (2 × 106) cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes for 24 h, after which the cells were transfected with 4.5 μg of receptor Ror2-FLAG and ligand pcDNA3.1-Wnt11 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) separately. Five hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and mixed in a ratio of 1:4 (receptor cells: ligand cells) and then reseeded in a 10-cm dish for co-culture. After 24 h of co-culture, cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells with 800 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease-inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and removing the insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A total of 15 μl of the lysate was used as a whole-cell lysate by adding 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The remaining lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by incubation with 2 μg of an anti-His antibody or 2 μg of an anti-FLAG antibody at 4 °C overnight. Then 40 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose was added to the lysates, which were further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 2 min, washed 4 times with 1 ml of PBS buffer, and dissolved in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates or whole-cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes. The primary antibodies were as follows: anti-His and anti-FLAG M2 (24Yamamoto S. Nishimura O. Misaki K. Nishita M. Minami Y. Yonemura S. Tarui H. Sasaki H. Cthrc1 selectively activates the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt signaling by stabilizing the Wnt-receptor complex.Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Values are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's t test was used for comparisons between two groups. One-way analysis of variance following Tukey's multiple comparison test was used for comparisons among multiple groups. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA), and significance was defined as p < 0.05 or greater. To address the function of Ror2 in zebrafish development, we cloned zebrafish ror2 by searching the zebrafish genome database. Zebrafish Ror2, a member of the type-I transmembrane receptor-tyrosine kinase family, contains an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and a Cys-rich domain. The intracellular region of zebrafish Ror2 contains a tyrosine kinase domain, a proline-rich domain (PRD), and two Ser/Thr-rich domains (Ser/Thr1 and Ser/Thr2) (Fig. 1A). The sequence alignment of zebrafish Ror2 with human, mouse, and Xenopus Ror2 proteins revealed a high level of identity, suggesting that Ror2 is a well-conserved protein in vertebrates (Fig. 1A). The phylogenetic analysis showed that the putative zebrafish Ror2 was clustered together with Ror2 of other species and separated from the Ror1 branch, another family member of Ror (Fig. 1B). To investigate the role of Ror2, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression pattern of ror2 using RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization. RT-PCR results revealed that zebrafish ror2 was maternally deposited and highly expressed at 6–9 hpf. Although ror2 expression decreased at 12–16 hpf, elevated expression levels were maintained from 20 hpf (Fig. 1C). Whole-mount in situ hybridization with a zebrafish ror2 antisense probe indicated the ubiquitous presence of ror2 transcripts at different developmental stages, and the expression occurred predominantly in the brain at 24 and 48 hpf (Fig. 1D). The ubiquitous and dynamic expression of ror2 implies that zebrafish Ror2 may play an important role in the regulation of embryonic development. To investigate the role of Ror2 in embryonic development, ror2 knockdown was performed using translation-blocking MOs. We evaluated the efficiency of the ror2-targeting MOs (ror2-TB1-MO and ror2-TB2-MO) by co-injecting zebrafish with the MOs and a ror2 5′-UTR-GFP expression construct. Both the ror2-TB1-MO and the ror2-TB2-MO successfully blocked the expression of the GFP-tagged reporter. Subsequently, we injected ror2-TB1-MO (8 ng) or ror2-TB2-MO (8 ng) into zebrafish embryos that were at the one-cell stage. Unexpectedly, the injected embryos exhibited normal morphology at 11 hpf. The expression pattern of dlx3b (indicates the edges of the neural plate) and hgg (indicates the prechordal plate), which are markers for gastrulation convergence and extension movements, did not change (data not shown). We propose that the inability of ror2 MO knockdown to block convergence and extension movements resulted from the presence of abundant maternally deposited Ror2 protein. To further investigate the role of Ror2 in embryonic development, a dominant-negative form of zebrafish Ror2, Ror2-TM, which contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the zebrafish Ror2 protein but lacks the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2A), was developed according to the structure from a dominant-negative mouse ROR2 used previously in cultured cells (25Mikels A.J. Nusse R. Purified Wnt5a protein activates or inhibits β-catenin-TCF signaling depending on receptor context.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Injection of ror2-TM mRNA in zebrafish embryos induced severe defects in anterior-posterior extension after gastrulation (Fig. 2B, upper row). In addition, the ror2-TM-injected embryos showed broader notochords and somites than gfp-injected embryos at 12 hpf, indicating that convergence might be impaired by Ror2 disruption (Fig. 2B, lower row). Overexpression of ror2-TM significantly increased the percentage, in a dose-dependent manner, of embryos with an enlarged angle between the anterior and posterior ends as well as a broader mediolateral distance (Fig. 2C). This defect was not due to alterations in the dorsoventral axis, which was evidenced by a normal expression pattern of the dorsoventral axis marker genes chordin (chd) and even-skipped-1 (eve1) (data not shown). At 24 hpf, the ror2-TM-injected embryos exhibited eye fusion, which was not observed in the gfp-injected control group. According to the interocular distances or cyclopia, overexpression of ror2-TM significantly increased the fusion of the eyes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, D and E). Using in situ hybridization, we also evaluated the expression pattern of hgg, dlx3b, and ntl (indicates the nascent notochord) for convergence and extension movements. The ror2-TM-injected embryos were separated into three categories according to the width of the neural plate: normal (<380 μm), moderate (380–460 μm), and severe (>460 μm). According to the position of hgg anterior to dlx3b, the injected embryos were also separated into three categories: normal (hgg anterior to dlx3b), moderate (less than half of hgg expression posterior to dlx3b), and severe (more than half of hgg expression posterior to dlx3b). Compared with the gfp-injected embryos, the ror2-TM-injected embryos exhibited a wider neural plate (dlx3b) and a more posteriorly positioned prechordal plate (hgg) at the tail bud stage (Fig. 2, F–H). Collectively, these results suggest that Ror2 is required for convergence and extension movements. Forced expression of ror2 mRNA in the zebrafish embryos also inhibited the mediolateral narrowing and anterior-posterior lengthening of the development axis, resulting in convergence and extension defects (Fig. 2I). Overexpression of ror2 mRNA significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner the angle between the anterior and posterior ends of the embryo as well as the mediolateral distance of the embryo (Fig. 2J). The expression pattern of hgg and dlx3b was also analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization at the tail bud stage (10 hpf). Compared with the controls, the ror2-injected embryos exhibited a more posteriorly positioned prechordal plate and a wider neural plate at the tail bud stage (Fig. 2, K–M). Taken together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of either ror2-TM or ror2 in zebrafish embryos impairs convergence and extension movements during gastrulation. Genetic evidence underscores the importance of Wnt in regulating convergence and extension movements during zebrafish embryo gastrulation (13Matsui T. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Callol-Massot C. Capdevila J. Rodríguez-Esteban C. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Noncanonical Wnt signaling regulates midline convergence of organ primordia during zebrafish development.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Zebrafish wnt11 is expressed in the anterior paraxial mesendoderm, and wnt11/silberblick mutants show elongated prechordal plates and shorter notochords, which correlate with a partial fusion of the eyes at later developmental stages (10Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saúde L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W. Silberblick/Wnt11 mediates convergent extension movements during zebrafish gastrulation.Nature. 2000; 405: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 11Kilian B. Mansukoski H. Barbosa F.C.

Therefore, we speculate that Ror2 mediates Wnt11 activity, which regulates convergence and extension movements in zebrafish. To evaluate whether Wnt11 and Ror2 interact, a double knockdown of wnt11 and ror2 was performed simultaneously. A low dose injection of wnt11 MO (0.25 ng) or ror2-TM mRNA (200 pg) individually generated mild convergence and extension defects (15 and 25% of the total, respectively) (Fig. 3A). The co-injection of ror2-TM mRNA and wnt11 MO resulted in enhanced convergence and extension defects (70% of the total; Fig. 3A). The altered expression patterns of hgg and dlx3b also supported the enhanced convergence and extension defects after co-injection of ror2-TM mRNA and wnt11 MO (Fig. 3, B–D). We also analyzed eye defects after co-injection of low doses of wnt11 MO and ror2-TM mRNA. A low dose of wnt11 MO or ror2-TM mRNA generated mild eye defects (8 and 20%, respectively, of the total), whereas co-injection of low doses of ror2-TM mRNA and wnt11 MO synergistically enhanced the eye defects (40% of the total) (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, we coexpressed wnt11 mRNA and ror2 mRNA. A low dose of wnt11 mRNA (25 pg) or a low dose of ror2 mRNA (100 pg) individually generated mild convergence and extension defects (5 and 20% of the total, respectively), whereas coexpression of ror2 mRNA and wnt11 mRNA synergistically enhanced convergence and extension defects (50% of the total) (Fig. 3F). These results were consistent with the expression patterns of hgg and dlx3b (Fig. 3, G–I). Therefore, Ror2 acts synergistically with Wnt11 in zebrafish development to regulate convergence and extension movements. To address the interaction of Wnt11 and Ror2 in cell migration during gastrulation, a series of transplantation assays was performed. Donor embryos were injected with cMO or Ror2-TM mRNA combined with fluorescent lineage markers. Host embryos were uninjected or were injected with wnt11 MO. Then labeled cells from ∼3 hpf donor embryos were mixed and transplanted into the center of lateral mesoderm of shield-stage host embryos because cells in this region of the embryo migrate in a ventral-to-dorsal direction and extend in both anterior and posterior directions. After gastrulation of host embryos was completed, the distribution of transplanted cells was scored. As shown in Fig. 4A, the donor cells from two control MOs-injected embryos showed similar convergence and extension movements in wild-type host embryos. By contrast, the ror2-TM-injected cells indicated reduced convergent movements when compared with cMO-injected cells (Fig. 4B). Whereas wnt11 was knocked down in host embryos, both of the donor cells from cMO- and ror2-TM-injected embryos showed reduced convergent movements (Fig. 4C). To quantify the migration distance of donor cells, the mean distance from the center of the embryos to the red- or green-labeled cells was measured, and the difference between these two groups of cells"

In primary mouse cortical neurons, both isoflurane and hypoxic preconditioning induced autophagy. Isoflurane and hypoxic preconditioning protected against subsequent oxygen glucose deprivation or glutamate injury, whereas pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine or KU55933) abolished preconditioning-induced tolerance. Pretreatment with SPK2 inhibitors (ABC294640 and SKI-II) or SPK2 knockdown prevented preconditioning-induced autophagy. Isoflurane also induced autophagy in mouse in vivo as shown by Western blots for LC3 and p62, LC3 immunostaining, and electron microscopy. Isoflurane-induced autophagy in mice lacking the SPK1 isoform (SPK1(-/-)), but not in SPK2(-/-)mice. Sphingosine 1-phosphate and the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist FTY720 did not protect against oxygen glucose deprivation in cultured neurons and did not alter the expression of LC3 and p62, suggesting that SPK2-mediated autophagy and protections are not S1P-dependent. Beclin 1 knockdown abolished preconditioning-induced autophagy, and SPK2 inhibitors abolished isoflurane-induced disruption of the Beclin 1/Bcl-2 association. These results strongly indicate that autophagy is involved in isoflurane preconditioning both in vivo and in vitro and that SPK2 contributes to preconditioning-induced autophagy, possibly by disrupting the Beclin 1/Bcl-2 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2021773076,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase belongs to the highly conserved eukaryotic family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases. TOR proteins are found at the core of two evolutionary conserved complexes, known as TORC1 and TORC2. In fission yeast, TORC2 is dispensable for proliferation under optimal growth conditions but is required for starvation and stress responses. TORC2 has been implicated in a wide variety of functions; however, the signals that regulate TORC2 activity have so far remained obscure. TORC2 has one known direct substrate, the AGC kinase Gad8, which is related to AKT in human cells. Gad8 is phosphorylated by TORC2 at Ser-546 (equivalent to AKT Ser-473), leading to its activation. Here, we show that glucose is necessary and sufficient to induce Gad8 Ser-546 phosphorylation in vivo and Gad8 kinase activity in vitro. The glucose signal that activates TORC2-Gad8 is mediated via the cAMP/PKA pathway, a major glucose-sensing pathway. By contrast, Pmk1, similar to human extracellular signal-regulated kinases and a major stress-induced mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) in fission yeast, inhibits TORC2-dependent Gad8 phosphorylation and activation. Inhibition of TORC2-Gad8 also occurs in response to ionic or osmotic stress, in a manner dependent on the cAMP/PKA and Pmk1-MAPK signaling pathways. Our findings highlight the significance of glucose availability in regulation of TORC2-Gad8 and indicate a novel link between the cAMP/PKA, Pmk1/MAPK, and TORC2-Gad8 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2075215717,"Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related death in oncology patients. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that cancer cells usurp to promote metastatic dissemination is critical for the development and implementation of novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. Here we show that the membrane protein RECK (Reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs) controls breast cancer metastasis by modulating a novel, non-canonical and convergent signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3)-dependent angiogenic program. Neoangiogenesis and STAT3 hyperactivation are known to be fundamentally important for metastasis, but the root molecular initiators of these phenotypes are poorly understood. Our study identifies loss of RECK as a critical and previously unknown trigger for these hallmarks of metastasis. Using multiple xenograft mouse models, we comprehensively show that RECK inhibits metastasis, concomitant with a suppression of neoangiogenesis at secondary sites, while leaving primary tumor growth unaffected. Further, with functional genomics and biochemical dissection we demonstrate that RECK controls this angiogenic rheostat through a novel complex with cell surface receptors to regulate STAT3 activation, cytokine signaling, and the induction of both vascular endothelial growth factor and urokinase plasminogen activator. In accordance with these findings, inhibition of STAT3 can rescue this phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study uncovers, for the first time, that RECK is a novel regulator of multiple well-established and robust mediators of metastasis; thus, RECK is a keystone protein that may be exploited in a clinical setting to target metastatic disease from multiple angles."
https://openalex.org/W1985899370,"During the development of forebrain connectivity, ascending thalamocortical and descending corticofugal axons first intermingle at the pallial-subpallial boundary to form the internal capsule (IC). However, the identity of molecular cues that guide these axons remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the transmembrane protein Linx is robustly expressed in the prethalamus and lateral ganglionic eminence-derived corridor and on corticofugal axons, but not on thalamocortical axons, and that mice with a null mutation of Linx exhibit a complete absence of the IC. Moreover, regional inactivation of Linx either in the prethalamus and LGE or in the neocortex leads to a failure of IC formation. Furthermore, Linx binds to thalamocortical projections, and it promotes outgrowth of thalamic axons. Thus, Linx guides the extension of thalamocortical axons in the ventral forebrain, and subsequently, it mediates reciprocal interactions between thalamocortical and corticofugal axons to form the IC."
https://openalex.org/W2095674737,"MAP7 domain containing protein 3 (MAP7D3), a newly identified microtubule associated protein, has been shown to promote microtubule assembly and stability. Its microtubule binding region has been reported to consist of two coiled coil motifs located at the N-terminus. It possesses a MAP7 domain near the C-terminus and belongs to the microtubule associated protein 7 (MAP7) family. The MAP7 domain of MAP7 protein has been shown to bind to kinesin-1; however, the role of MAP7 domain in MAP7D3 remains unknown. Based on the bioinformatics analysis of MAP7D3, we hypothesized that the MAP7 domain of MAP7D3 may have microtubule binding activity. Indeed, we found that MAP7 domain of MAP7D3 bound to microtubules as well as enhanced the assembly of microtubules in vitro. Interestingly, a longer fragment MDCT that contained the MAP7 domain (MD) with the C-terminal tail (CT) of the protein promoted microtubule polymerization to a greater extent than MD and CT individually. MDCT stabilized microtubules against dilution induced disassembly. MDCT bound to reconstituted microtubules with an apparent dissociation constant of 3.0 ± 0.5 µM. An immunostaining experiment showed that MDCT localized along the length of the preassembled microtubules. Competition experiments with tau indicated that MDCT shares its binding site on microtubules with tau. Further, we present evidence indicating that MDCT binds to the C-terminal tail of tubulin. In addition, MDCT could bind to tubulin in HeLa cell extract. Here, we report a microtubule binding region in the C-terminal region of MAP7D3 that may have a role in regulating microtubule assembly dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2052792358,"Adipogenesis represents a key process in adipose tissue development and remodeling, including during obesity. Exploring the regulation of adipogenesis by extracellular ligands is fundamental to our understanding of this process. Adenosine, an extracellular nucleoside signaling molecule found in adipose tissue depots, acts on adenosine receptors. Here we report that, among these receptors, the A2b adenosine receptor (A2bAR) is highly expressed in adipocyte progenitors. Activation of the A2bAR potently inhibits differentiation of mouse stromal vascular cells into adipocytes, whereas A2bAR knockdown stimulates adipogenesis. The A2bAR inhibits differentiation through a novel signaling cascade involving sustained expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a regulator of stem cell maintenance. Knockdown of KLF4 ablates the ability of the A2bAR to inhibit differentiation. A2bAR activation also inhibits adipogenesis in a human primary preadipocyte culture system. We analyzed the A2bARKLF4 axis in adipose tissue of obese subjects and, intriguingly, found a strong correlation between A2bAR and KLF4 expression in both subcutaneous and visceral human fat. Hence, our study implicates the A2bAR as a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and the A2bAR-KLF4 axis as a potentially significant modulator of adipose biology."
https://openalex.org/W2031907093,"Recent studies have revealed negligible immunogenicity of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in syngeneic mice and in autologous monkeys. Therefore, human iPS cells would not elicit immune responses in the autologous setting. However, given that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic iPS cells would likely be used for medical applications, a more faithful model system is needed to reflect HLA-matched allogeneic settings. Here we examined whether iPS cells induce immune responses in the swine leukocyte antigen (SLA)-matched setting. iPS cells were generated from the SLA-defined C1 strain of Clawn miniature swine, which were confirmed to develop teratomas in mice, and transplanted into the testes (n = 4) and ovary (n = 1) of C1 pigs. No teratomas were found in pigs on 47 to 125 days after transplantation. A Mixed lymphocyte reaction revealed that T-cell responses to the transplanted MHC-matched (C1) iPS cells were significantly lower compared to allogeneic cells. The humoral immune responses were also attenuated in the C1-to-C1 setting. More importantly, even MHC-matched iPS cells were susceptible to innate immunity, NK cells and serum complement. iPS cells lacked the expression of SLA class I and sialic acids. The in vitro cytotoxic assay showed that C1 iPS cells were targeted by NK cells and serum complement of C1. In vivo, the C1 iPS cells developed larger teratomas in NK-deficient NOG (T-B-NK-) mice (n = 10) than in NK-competent NOD/SCID (T-B-NK+) mice (n = 8) (p<0.01). In addition, C1 iPS cell failed to form teratomas after incubation with the porcine complement-active serum. Taken together, MHC-matched iPS cells can attenuate cellular and humoral immune responses, but still susceptible to innate immunity in pigs."

Microsclerotia are its main survival and dormancy structures and serve as the primary inoculum on many hosts. Studies were conducted to determine the effect of temperature (5 to 50°C), pH (2 to 12) and nutrient regimes on microsclerotia germination. The optimal condition for microsclerotium germination was 20°C with pH 8.0 whereas nutrient regimes had no significant effect on its germination. The whole genome wide expression profiles during microsclerotium germination were characterized using the Illumina sequencing technology. Approximately 7.4 million of 21-nt cDNA tags were sequenced in the cDNA libraries derived from germinated and non-germinated microsclerotia. About 3.9% and 2.3% of the unique tags were up-regulated and down-regulated at least five-fold, respectively, in the germinated microsclerotia compared with the non-germinated microsclerotia. A total of 1654 genes showing differential expression were identified. Genes that are likely to have played important roles in microsclerotium germination include those encoding G-protein coupled receptor, lipase/esterase, cyclopentanone 1,2-monooxygenase, H(+)/hexose cotransporter 1, fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain, thymus-specific serine protease, glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. These genes were mainly up-regulated or down-regulated only in germinated microsclerotia, compared with non-germinated microsclerotia. The differential expression of genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of 20 randomly selected genes from the 40 most differentially expressed genes."
https://openalex.org/W2005972439,"The importance of B-isoform of leptin receptor (LEPR-B) signaling in the hypothalamus, pancreas, or liver has been well characterized, but in the intestine, a unique site of entry for dietary nutrition into the body, it has been relatively ignored. To address this question, we characterized a mouse model deficient for LEPR-B specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). (IEC)LEPR-B-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were generated by Cre-Lox strategy and fed a normal or high-fat diet (HFD). The analyses of the animals involved histology and immunohistochemistry of intestinal mucosa, indirect calorimetric measurements, whole-body composition, and expression and activities of nutrient transporters. (IEC)LEPR-B-KO mice exhibited a 2-fold increase in length of jejunal villi and have normal growth on a normal diet but were less susceptible (P<0.01) to HFD-induced obesity. No differences occurred in energy intake and expenditure between (IEC)LEPR-B-WT and -KO mice, but (IEC)LEPR-B-KO mice fed an HFD showed increased excreted fats (P<0.05). Activities of the Na(+)/glucose cotransporter SGLT-1 and GLUT2 were unaffected in LEPR-B-KO jejunum, while GLUT5-mediated fructose transport and PepT1-mediated peptide transport were substantially reduced (P<0.01). These data demonstrate that intestinal LEPR-B signaling is important for the onset of diet-induced obesity. They suggest that intestinal LEPR-B could be a potential per os target for prevention against obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2070207957,"The physiological function of urate is poorly understood. It may act as a danger signal, an antioxidant, or a substrate for heme peroxidases. Whether it reacts sufficiently rapidly with lactoperoxidase (LPO) to act as a physiological substrate remains unknown. LPO is a mammalian peroxidase that plays a key role in the innate immune defense by oxidizing thiocyanate to the bactericidal and fungicidal agent hypothiocyanite. We now demonstrate that urate is a good substrate for bovine LPO. Urate was oxidized by LPO to produce the electrophilic intermediates dehydrourate and 5-hydroxyisourate, which decayed to allantoin. In the presence of superoxide, high yields of hydroperoxides were formed by LPO and urate. Using stopped-flow spectroscopy, we determined rate constants for the reaction of urate with compound I (k1 = 1.1 × 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)) and compound II (k2 = 8.5 × 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)). During urate oxidation, LPO was diverted from its peroxidase cycle because hydrogen peroxide reacted with compound II to give compound III. At physiologically relevant concentrations, urate competed effectively with thiocyanate, the main substrate of LPO for oxidation, and inhibited production of hypothiocyanite. Similarly, hypothiocyanite-dependent killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by urate. Allantoin was present in human saliva and associated with the concentration of LPO. When hydrogen peroxide was added to saliva, oxidation of urate was dependent on its concentration and peroxidase activity. Our findings establish urate as a likely physiological substrate for LPO that will influence host defense and give rise to reactive electrophilic metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2118208440,"This study was undertaken to reveal the mechanisms by which RLIP76 regulates endothelial cell angiogenic responses. RLIP76 is an effector of the angiogenic modulator, R-Ras. RLIP76 is overexpressed in many tumors, required for tumor angiogenesis, and blockade of RLIP76 results in tumor regression in multiple models. We report here that RLIP76 was required for expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in carcinoma and melanoma cells. Conditioned medium derived from RLIP76-depleted tumor cells, but not control knockdown cells, could not stimulate proliferation, migration, or Matrigel cord formation in endothelial cell cultures, which indicates that RLIP76 regulates angiogenic components of the tumor cell secretome. Recombinant VEGF added to conditioned medium from RLIP76-knockdown tumor cells restored these endothelial cell functions. Transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which drives VEGF expression, was blocked in RLIP76-depleted tumor cells. RLIP76 was required for PI3-kinase activation, known to regulate HIF-1, in these cells. However, HIF-1α expression and nuclear localization were unaffected by RLIP76 knockdown, which suggests that RLIP76 regulates HIF-1 at the functional level. Thus, RLIP76 regulates tumor cell transactivation of endothelial cells via control of VEGF expression and secretion, providing a new important link in the mechanism of tumor cell induction of angiogenesis.—Lee, S., Goldfinger, L.

Methods In a prospective study of forty-five patients with a primary macula-off RRD of 24 hours to 6 weeks duration, the height of the macular detachment was determined by ultrasonography. At 12 months postoperatively, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast acuity, and color confusion indexes (CCI) were obtained. Results Macular detachment was present for 2–32 (median 7) days before repair. A shorter duration of macular detachment was correlated with a better CCI saturé (p = 0.0026) and lower LogMAR BCVA (better Snellen visual acuity)(p = 0.012). Also, a smaller height of macular detachment was correlated with a lower LogMAR BCVA (p = 0.0034). A younger age and lower pre-operative LogMAR BCVA at presentation were both correlated with better postoperative contrast acuity in the total group (age: p = 1.7×10−4 and pre-operative LogMAR BCVA: p = 0.0034). Conclusion Functional recovery after macula-off RRD is affected by the duration and the height of the macular detachment. Recovery of contrast acuity is also affected by age and BCVA at presentation.

https://openalex.org/W2064917568,"Context Although many previous studies have examined the preference of patients for different pain measurement scales, preference for anchor descriptors has not been thoroughly discussed. Objectives To examine (1) the preferred end-phrases used in the VAS as anchor labels for Japanese patients with chronic pain, and (2) whether the preference differs according to factors such as age, sex, educational level, duration of pain, and pain intensity. Methods We performed an observational study in patients suffering from non-cancer chronic pain for more than 3 months at a pain center in Japan. The patients were asked to rate their pain intensity using four types of VAS that used the following different anchor descriptors: “worst pain” (“Worst”), “worst pain bearable” (“Bearable”), “worst pain imaginable” (“Imaginable”), and “worst pain you have ever experienced” (“Experienced”). They were also asked to rank the four scales according to ease of responding, and asked which descriptor best reflected their perceived pain. Results In total, 183 patients participated in the study. They consisted of 119 (65.0%) women and 64 (35.0%) men aged 18–84 years with the mean age of 56.9 years. “Experienced” was most preferred (69.8%), followed by “Bearable” (66.3%), “Worst” (48.8%), and “Imaginable” (16.9%). Factors such as age, sex, educational background, duration of pain, and pain intensity did not significantly affect the results. In 83.1% of patients, the preferred descriptor corresponded to the descriptor that best reflected patients' perceived pain. Conclusion The frequently used expression “worst pain imaginable” is considered to be difficult to understand for most patients. Widely preferred descriptors, such as “worst pain you have ever experienced” and “worst pain bearable”, should be used when evaluating perceived pain. The preference of anchor descriptors was not significantly affected by the factors such as age, sex, educational level, duration of pain, and pain intensity."

The truncated hemoglobin HbN of Mycobacterium tuberculosis displays a potent NO dioxygenase activity despite lacking a reductase domain. The mechanism by which HbN recycles itself during NO dioxygenation and the reductase that participates in this process are currently unknown. This study demonstrates that the NADH-ferredoxin/flavodoxin system is a fairly efficient partner for electron transfer to HbN with an observed reduction rate of 6.2 μm/min−1, which is nearly 3- and 5-fold faster than reported for Vitreoscilla hemoglobin and myoglobin, respectively. Structural docking of the HbN with Escherichia coli NADH-flavodoxin reductase (FdR) together with site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the CD loop of the HbN forms contacts with the reductase, and that Gly48 may have a vital role. The donor to acceptor electron coupling parameters calculated using the semiempirical pathway method amounts to an average of about 6.4 10−5 eV, which is lower than the value obtained for E. coli flavoHb (8.0 10−4 eV), but still supports the feasibility of an efficient electron transfer. The deletion of Pre-A abrogated the heme iron reduction by FdR in the HbN, thus signifying its involvement during intermolecular interactions of the HbN and FdR.

Subsequently, 91 received open biopsy and 2 received stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy. All results were compared with histological findings. The PPV, NPV and area under curve (AUC) of the mammography and breast MRI were calculated. Results There were 31 (31.0%) BI-RADS 3 microcalcifications and 69 (69.0%) BI-RADS 4. The PPV and NPV of mammography is 65.2% (45/69) and 90.3% (28/31). The PPV and NPV of breast MRI was 90.2% (46/51) and 95.9% (47/49). Among 31 BI-RADS 3 microcalcifications, the PPV and NPV of breast MRI was 100% (3/3) and 100% (28/28). Among 69 BI-RADS 4 microcalcifications, the PPV and NPV of breast MRI was 89.6% (43/48) and 90.5% (19/21).

Manystudies have provided reliable evidence that the transcription levels of reference genes are not constant at different developmental stages and in different experimental conditions. However, suitable reference genes which are stably expressed in polyploid preimplantation embryos of different developmental stages have not yet been identified. Therefore, it is critical to verify candidate reference genes to analyze gene expression accurately in both diploid and polyploid embryos. We examined the expression levels of 12 candidate reference genes in preimplantation embryos of four different ploidies at six developmental stages. Stability analysis of the reference genes was performed by four independent software programs, and the stability of three genes was evaluated by comparison with the Oct4 expression level during preimplantation development in diploid embryos. The expression levels of most genes in the polyploid embryos were higher than that in the diploid embryos, but the increasing degree were disproportionate with the ploidies. There were no significant difference in reference gene expressions among embryos of different ploidies when they reached the morula stage, and the expression level remained flat until the blastocyst stage. Ubc, Ppia, and Pgk1 were the three most stable reference genes in diploid and polyploid embryos."

Among other things, there are expectations that published scientific results will be reliable, that research has the potential to contribute to the common good, and that research will be conducted ethically. Consequently, the scientific community needs to avoid lapses that prevent it from meeting these three expectations. This requires a strong commitment to trustworthy research practices, as well as mechanisms that diminish lapses that inevitably occur in complex endeavors such as scientific research. The author presents a model to assess the strength of commitment to trustworthy research and explores proven quality assurance mechanisms that can diminish lapses in research injurious to the public's trust. Some mechanisms identify in advance ways that things can go wrong so that steps can be taken to prevent them from going wrong in the first place. Other mechanisms investigate past errors or near misses to discover their causes so that they can be addressed to avoid similar future instances.

Pol η has been shown in vitro to efficiently and accurately bypass the UV-induced lesion, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) (6Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Mechanisms of accurate translesion synthesis by human DNA polymerase η.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that in the absence of Pol η, error-prone translesion synthesis across CPD lesions by other specialized DNA polymerases, including Pol ι, results in increased mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Pol η has also been shown to bypass cisplatin-induced cross-linked adducts (7Vaisman A. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Chaney S.G. Efficient translesion replication past oxaliplatin and cisplatin GpG adducts by human DNA polymerase η.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and oxidative lesions (8Kino K.

In addition, by virtue of its error-prone nature, Pol η has been implicated in immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation (9Pavlov Y.I. Rogozin I.B. Galkin A.P. Aksenova A.Y. Hanaoka F. Rada C. Kunkel T.A. Correlation of somatic hypermutation specificity and A-T base pair substitution errors by DNA polymerase η during copying of a mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain transgene.Proc. Natl.

Although no specific disorders are associated with the other Y-family TLS DNA polymerases, each of them has unique attributes. Pol ι, an ortholog of Pol η, is the only polymerase that is reported to use Hoogsteen base pairing to efficiently mispair dG residues across template dT (10Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Replication by human DNA polymerase-iota occurs by Hoogsteen base-pairing.Nature. 2004; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Pol κ specializes in the bypass of benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide-DNA adducts; it copies past these lesions in vitro, and cells depleted for Pol κ are sensitive to benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide (11Suzuki N. Ohashi E. Kolbanovskiy A. Geacintov N.E. Grollman A.P. Ohmori H. Shibutani S. Translesion synthesis by human DNA polymerase κ on a DNA template containing a single stereoisomer of dG-(+)- or dG-(-)-anti-N(2)-BPDE (7,8-dihydroxy-anti-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene).Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6100-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Bi X.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that mutagenic bypass activity by Pol κ homologs (DinB) consists predominantly of −1 frameshifts, which arise from the extra-helical displacement of DNA lesions (13Sale J.E. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R. Y-family DNA polymerases and their role in tolerance of cellular DNA damage.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). REV1, or deoxcytidyl transferase, is restricted to inserting dC residues opposite template lesions, including abasic sites and N2-dG adducts (14Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Deoxycytidyl transferase activity of yeast REV1 protein.Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). An additional non-catalytic, scaffolding role for REV1 that facilitates polymerase switch during TLS has also been proposed (15Edmunds C.E. Simpson L.J. Sale J.E. PCNA ubiquitination and REV1 define temporally distinct mechanisms for controlling translesion synthesis in the avian cell line DT40.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Due to the mutagenic nature of DNA synthesis by TLS DNA polymerases, cells employ an array of regulatory mechanisms to limit TLS activity, including post-translational modifications, relocalization upon DNA damage, and binding to accessory proteins (1Guo C. Kosarek-Stancel J.N. Tang T.S. Friedberg E.C. Y-family DNA polymerases in mammalian cells.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2363-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Sale J.E. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R. Y-family DNA polymerases and their role in tolerance of cellular DNA damage.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Some cancer cells take advantage of error-prone TLS to bypass DNA adducts generated by chemotherapeutic drugs (16Salehan M.R. Morse H.R. DNA damage repair and tolerance: a role in chemotherapeutic drug resistance.Br. J. Biomed. Sci. 2013; 70: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One manner in which they do so is by up-regulating the level of TLS DNA polymerases. For example, Pol κ levels are reported to be elevated in lung cancer (17O-Wang J. Kawamura K. Tada Y. Ohmori H. Kimura H. Sakiyama S. Tagawa M. DNA polymerase κ, implicated in spontaneous and DNA damage-induced mutagenesis, is overexpressed in lung cancer.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5366-5369PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Pol ι levels are increased in breast cancer (18Yang J. Chen Z. Liu Y. Hickey R.J. Malkas L.H. Altered DNA polymerase ι expression in breast cancer cells leads to a reduction in DNA replication fidelity and a higher rate of mutagenesis.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5597-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, cisplatin or oxaliplatin treatment has been shown to induce Pol η in non-small-cell lung cancer and gastric adenocarcinoma (19Ceppi P. Novello S. Cambieri A. Longo M. Monica V. Lo Iacono M. Giaj-Levra M. Saviozzi S. Volante M. Papotti M. Scagliotti G.

DNA polymerase η protein expression predicts treatment response and survival of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.J. Transl. Med. 2010; 8: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Overexpression of translesion DNA polymerases may reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy regimens and render cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy (21Albertella M.R. Lau A. O'Connor M.J. The overexpression of specialized DNA polymerases in cancer.DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Doles et al. (22Doles J. Oliver T.G. Cameron E.R. Hsu G. Jacks T. Walker G.C. Hemann M.T. Suppression of Rev3, the catalytic subunit of Polζ, sensitizes drug-resistant lung tumors to chemotherapy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 20786-20791Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and Xie et al. (23Xie K. Doles J. Hemann M.T. Walker G.C. Error-prone translesion synthesis mediates acquired chemoresistance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 20792-20797Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) demonstrated that suppression of REV3, the catalytic subunit of the B-family TLS polymerase Pol ζ, sensitizes drug-resistant lung tumors to chemotherapy. We screened several collections of small molecule compounds to identify inhibitors of TLS DNA polymerases that could potentiate the effect of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. We identified and report here on the surprising discovery of a modulator, which both stimulates and inhibits TLS DNA polymerases. We identified the compound as the biologically active sphingolipids, sphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine). We show that of all sphingolipids evaluated, sphingosine and sphinganine alone manifest this effect. Although low concentrations markedly stimulate the rate of DNA primer extension as well as the extent of nucleotide misincorporation and misextension by Pol η, high concentrations inhibit polymerase activity. These effects of sphingosine are specific to the Y-family TLS polymerases, Pols η, κ, and ι. Notably, sphingosine increases lesion bypass activity in cells, and sphingosine bound to model liposomes manifests similar effects as the free compound. Our studies have uncovered a novel mode of modulation of Pol η and have linked two responses of cells to stress, namely DNA lesion bypass by TLS DNA polymerases and sphingolipid-mediated signaling to control cell proliferation. Five small molecule libraries were analyzed; four were obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NCI-approved Oncology Drug Set, Mechanistic Set, Diversity Set II, and Natural Product Set II), and one consisting of 622 compounds enriched for nucleoside analogs, was from the Open Innovation Center for Drug Discovery, The University of Tokyo, Japan. The compounds were stored as 10 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide at −80 °C. d-erythro-Sphinganine, d-erythro-sphingosine, d-erythro-sphingosine-1-phosphate, and natural brain ceramide and sphingomyelin were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc (Alabaster, AL). l-erythro-Sphingosine was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Gel-purified synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The sequence of the primer-template (P/T1) used for measuring the effect of small molecules on DNA polymerase activity was 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAAT-3′ and 5′-GCGCGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAAGATTGCAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG-3′. The sequence of the primer-template (P/T2) used for evaluating CPD bypass activity in vitro was 5′-CACTGACTGTATGA-3′ and 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT-TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′, whereas that (P/T3) used for measurements of Vmax and Km values was 5′-CACTGACTGTATGATG-3′ and 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT-TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′,where T-T indicates the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer. The T-T DNA template was generously provided by S. Iwai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). A template containing two consecutive T residues in place of the CPD lesion was used in control reactions. Human DNA polymerase η (1–511 amino acids) was purified from insect cells as described (6Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Mechanisms of accurate translesion synthesis by human DNA polymerase η.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length Pols η, κ, and ι were purchased from Enzymax (Lexington, KY). Human Pols β and δ were expressed and purified as described (24Schmitt M.W. Matsumoto Y. Loeb L.A. High fidelity and lesion bypass capability of human DNA polymerase δ.Biochimie. 2009; 91: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), 5J.-C. Shen, unpublished data. whereas human Pol γ was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells. 6M. W. Schmitt, unpublished data. Calf thymus Pol α-primase complex and human Pol ϵ were generous gifts from F. Perrino (Wake Forest Park, NC) and S. Linn (Berkeley, CA), respectively. Samples containing the modulator were separated on an Agilent 1290 Infinity System. A Thermo Hypersil Gold UPLC column coupled to a C18 guard cartridge was used for fractionation employing a gradient of water and methanol as the mobile phase. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals for a total duration of 20 min, dried under N2, resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide, and evaluated in polymerase activity assays. Peak fractions were subject to a second round of ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) fractionation; the identity of the compound in the single fraction that tested positive for stimulatory activity was determined by mass spectrometry using a Waters Synapt G1 QTOF instrument. 5′-32P-labeled DNA primers (P) were hybridized to a 2-fold molar excess of complementary template (T) DNA. 10 nm of the P/T DNA substrate was extended by limiting amounts (∼0.2 nm) of DNA polymerase η in the absence or presence of the indicated sphingolipid at 37 °C for 10 min, unless stated otherwise. Reactions were carried out in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 60 mm KCl, and 2.5% glycerol. Control reactions for sphinganine or sphingosine (SO) contained 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, whereas those for ceramide, sphingomyelin, or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) included 10% methanol. Aliquots of the terminated reactions were electrophoresed through 14% polyacrylamide-urea gels; extension products were visualized by PhosphorImager analyses (GE Healthcare) and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). Measurements of the kinetic constants for single nucleotide incorporation by Pol η were carried out as described (25Kamath-Loeb A.S. Hizi A. Kasai H. Loeb L.A. Incorporation of the guanosine triphosphate analogs 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-NH2-dGTP by reverse transcriptases and mammalian DNA polymerases.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5892-5898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, we first systematically varied the enzyme concentration and reaction time using saturating concentrations of dNTPs. These experiments established the requisite conditions for subsequent kinetic analysis, i.e. linearity of incorporation with time during a fixed incubation period. Extension was then monitored as a function of dNTP and sphingosine concentrations. ∼ 2 × 107 human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (293T) were lysed by incubation in 500 μl of lysis buffer (200 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 155 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) on ice for 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the clarified supernatant was used for immunoprecipitating Pol η; ∼500 μg of total protein were incubated with the Pol η-specific monoclonal antibody, 5C6 for 1 h at 4 °C (26Akagi J. Masutani C. Kataoka Y. Kan T. Ohashi E. Mori T. Ohmori H. Hanaoka F. Interaction with DNA polymerase η is required for nuclear accumulation of REV1 and suppression of spontaneous mutations in human cells.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A 25% suspension of Protein A/G agarose beads was added to precipitate the complex, and incubation was carried out as described above. The enzyme-antibody complex coupled to beads was washed extensively with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol, and resuspended in 15 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 25% glycerol. Aliquots of the resuspended immune complex were diluted and assayed for CPD bypass activity in the absence or presence of 8 μm sphingosine. CPD bypass activity in cells was measured using a modification of our recently established oligonucleotide retrieval assay (27Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.C. Schmitt M.W. Loeb L.A. The Werner syndrome exonuclease facilitates DNA degradation and high fidelity DNA polymerization by human DNA polymerase δ.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 12480-12490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Shen J.C. Fox E.J. Ahn E.H. Loeb L.A. A rapid assay for measuring nucleotide excision repair by oligonucleotide retrieval.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A synthetic oligonucleotide containing a site-specific CPD lesion was extended by ligating oligonucleotides, 5′-AmMC6ACGGAGGGAATCGGAGGTCGC-3′ and 5′-CCTTCCACCTCCCATTCCTGATTCAGTCACTG-ddC-3′, at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. Complementary oligomers to form double-stranded ligation sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini were 5′-TGCTGACGAGGCGACCTCCG-3′ and 5′-AGGTGGAAGGCACTGACTGT-3′, respectively. After ligation, excess free oligomers were degraded by λ exonuclease. The ligation efficiency (20%) was calculated from the ratio of amplification of the ligated versus unligated template and used to normalize substrate concentrations. The template was then hybridized to a biotinylated primer, 5′-biotin-GCACGTCAGGCACGGCGTCCAGTGACTGAATCAGGAATGGGAGGTGGAAGGCACTGACTGTATGATG-3′, to form the partial duplex DNA substrate. This construct was transfected into SV40-immortalized fibroblast cells (GM0639) using calcium phosphate; the final concentration was 0.2 nm. After incubation for 2 h, oligonucleotides were retrieved via magnetic streptavidin bead capture by virtue of the 5′-biotin tag on the primer strand. Bypass efficiency was quantified by qPCR using the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Agilent) in a DNA Engine Opticon 2 machine (MJ Research). The PCR primer pairs for measuring unextended and extended/bypassed products were a/b (5′-GCACGTCAGGCACGGCGTC-3′ and 5′-CATCATACAGTCAGTGCCTTCCACCTCC-3′) and a/c (5′-GCACGTCAGGCACGGCGTC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGTCGCCTCGTCAGCATC-3′), respectively. % Bypass was calculated as the ratio of (amplification by primers a/c over primers a/b) × 100. To test for a difference in CPD bypass activity in SO-treated versus control cells, the experiment effect (shift in overall means on different experimental days seen in Fig. 5) and unequal variance among the different experiments were taken into account using a log transformation of the outcome with weighted least squares regression (29Seber G.A. Linear Regression Analysis. 2nd Ed. Wiley, Boston2003Crossref Google Scholar), including a variable for experiment in the model. Specifically, % bypass activity values were log-transformed, the variance of the transformed observations was calculated within each experiment, and this variance was used to inversely weight the observations in the least square regression. Variables for both treatment (variable of interest) and experiment (confounder) were included in the weighted least squares regression model. This resulted in normally distributed residuals as required for an unbiased test statistic with this small sample size. Liposomes were generated by using 2.5 mg of the synthetic phospholipid, 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (99% pure; Avanti Polar Lipids) either by itself or mixed with sphingosine or sphingomyelin at 20 mol % with respect to 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Lipids, dissolved in chloroform or methanol, were dispensed in glass tubes, and the organic solvents were first evaporated under a stream of argon and further dried under vacuum. Lipid films were hydrated by the addition of 0.25 ml of 1× Pol η reaction buffer. The lipid suspension was extruded through a 100-nm polycarbonate filter at room temperature (using the lipid extruder from Avanti Polar Lipids) to yield homogenous unilamellar vesicles. The vesicles were stored at 4 °C and used within 3 days of preparation. Fraction SO and SM bound to liposomes (f) was calculated using the formula, f = K × Cl/1 + K × Cl, where K = 1/CMC (critical micelle concentration), and Cl is the lipid concentration; we estimate that > 96% of SO and SM were bound to liposomes. We screened multiple libraries of small molecules for inhibitors of DNA polymerases as potential anti-tumor agents. To facilitate screening, we pooled the compounds into groups of four and evaluated their effects on the polymerase activity of DNA Pol η by monitoring the extension of an end-labeled primer. We identified one pool from the library of nucleoside analogs that markedly stimulated the polymerase activity of Pol η. Upon deconvolution, the stimulatory compound was identified as 6-chloropurine-tetrahydropyran (2-(6-aminopurin-9-yl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-2H-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-pyran-3,4,5-triol). This compound was obtained from two independent commercial sources. Mass spectrometric and NMR analyses revealed that one of the two preparations was homogenous but lacked stimulatory activity. However, the second preparation that stimulated Pol η activity had multiple components (Fig. 1A). To separate the stimulatory factor from other components, we fractionated the second preparation by chromatography through two sequential reverse-phase UPLC columns and assayed individual fractions for their effect on Pol η activity. A single fraction containing a compound with an m/z of 288.2902 (Fig. 1B) stimulated primer extension by Pol η (data not shown). This mass did not correspond to that of the starting compound (expected mass, 238.7). A search of the Scripps-Metlin database for molecules with a mass of 288.2902 ± 5 ppm offered three possibilities, two of which were deuterium compounds; the third was the sphingolipid, C-17 sphinganine (SA; Fig. 1C). To evaluate the effect of the identified sphingolipid, homogenous preparations of C-17 sphinganine were added to primer extension reactions. Surprisingly, we observed that it stimulated Pol η activity; the increase in nucleotide incorporation was linear with respect to SA concentrations from 1 to 10 μm; primer extension was enhanced by ∼100-fold (Fig. 2A). At higher concentrations, however, the activity declined precipitously. The decrease in activity could be related to the critical micelle concentration, reported to be in the low μm range (30Sasaki H. Arai H. Cocco M.J. White S.H. pH dependence of sphingosine aggregation.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 2727-2733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which could block the accessibility of the enzyme active site to deoxynucleotide substrates and/or the DNA primer-template. Stimulation was indifferent to the order of addition of Pol η and SA and was comparable with both truncated and full-length Pol η, indicating that the C-terminal 202 amino acids, which include the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding motifs, are dispensable for stimulation by SA (data not shown). Furthermore, stimulation was independent of DNA sequence context, occurring with a multitude of primer-template DNA substrates, including templates containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (data not shown and see Fig. 5A). Notably, the stimulatory effect was specific to Pol η and to Pols κ and ι, members of the Y-family DNA polymerases. Although the extent of stimulation of Pol κ paralleled that of Pol η, it was approximately an order of magnitude lower with Pol ι. In contrast, SA did not stimulate the primer extension activities of an array of other mammalian DNA polymerases, including nuclear and mitochondrial replicative DNA polymerases, Pols α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ (Fig. 2B). Sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) is identical to SO except for a single saturated bond. Because the common form of SO has an 18-carbon chain length, we examined the effect of C-18 SO on Pol η activity in this and all subsequent experiments carried out with SO. Similarly to C-17 SA, C-18 SO also elicited the dual response by Pol η (Fig. 2C and data not shown); fold increase and peak stimulatory concentration of SO, both d- and l-stereoisomers, were equivalent to that of SA. In addition, similarly to SA, it inhibited polymerase activity at concentrations exceeding 10 μm. SA and SO are involved in the de novo synthesis of ceramide and production of S1P, respectively (31Morad S.A. Cabot M.C. Ceramide-orchestrated signalling in cancer cells.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In contrast to SO, neither ceramide nor S1P, even at 10–50-fold higher concentrations than SA and SO, exhibited stimulatory or inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis by Pol η (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the robust stimulation observed with SO was unaffected when it was present together with S1P at a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that S1P likely does not interact functionally or interfere with interactions between SO and Pol η (data not shown). Free SO in the cell is generated from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (32Simbulan C.M. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Suzuki M. Shoji M. Taki T. Yoshida S. Sphingosine inhibits the synthesis of RNA primers by primase in vitro.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9007-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with the stimulatory effect of SO, we observed subtle yet reproducible stimulation of Pol η activity by sphingomyelin (Fig. 2C). A short chain (C4) derivative of SO, threoninol, had no effect on the activity of Pol η (data not shown), implicating the importance of both the carbon chain length as well as the functional head group of SO in eliciting the response by Pol η. As a control, we also included the non-ionic"
