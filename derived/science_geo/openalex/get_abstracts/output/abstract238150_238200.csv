https://openalex.org/W2139903462,"Working memory has been linked to elevated single neuron discharge in monkeys and to oscillatory changes in the human EEG, but the relation between these effects has remained largely unexplored. We addressed this question by measuring local field potentials and single unit activity simultaneously from multiple electrodes placed in extrastriate visual cortex while monkeys were performing a working memory task. We describe a significant enhancement in theta band energy during the delay period. Theta oscillations had a systematic effect on single neuron activity, with neurons emitting more action potentials near their preferred angle of each theta cycle. Sample-selective delay activity was enhanced if only action potentials emitted near the preferred theta angle were considered. Our results suggest that extrastriate visual cortex is involved in short-term maintenance of information and that theta oscillations provide a mechanism for structuring the recurrent interaction between neurons in different brain regions that underlie working memory."

Therefore, genetic variation in SLCO1A2 may have important implications to the disposition and tissue penetration of substrate drugs. In the present study, we demonstrate OATP1A2 protein expression in human brain capillary and renal distal nephron using immunohistochemistry. We also determined the extent of single nucleotide polymorphisms in SLCO1A2 upon analyses of ethnically defined genomic DNA samples (n = 95 each for African-, Chinese-, European-, and Hispanic-Americans). We identified six nonsynonymous polymorphisms within the coding region of SLCO1A2 (T38C (I13T), A516C (E172D), G559A (A187T), A382T (N128Y), A404T (N135I), and C2003G (T668S)), the allelic frequencies of which appeared to be ethnicity-dependent. In vitro functional assessment revealed that the A516C and A404T variants had markedly reduced capacity for mediating the cellular uptake of OATP1A2 substrates, estrone 3-sulfate and two δ-opioid receptor agonists, deltorphin II, and [d-penicillamine2,5]-enkephalin. On the other hand, the G559A and C2003G variants appeared to have substrate-dependent changes in transport activity. Cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy suggested that altered plasma membrane expression of the transporter may contribute to reduced transport activity associated with the A516C, A404T, and C2003G variants. The A404T (N135I) variant also showed a shift in the apparent molecular size, indicative of alterations in glycosylation status. Taken together, these data suggest that SLCO1A2 polymorphisms may be an important yet unrecognized contributor to inter-individual variability in drug disposition and central nervous system entry of substrate drugs.

Taken together, these data suggest that SLCO1A2 polymorphisms may be an important yet unrecognized contributor to inter-individual variability in drug disposition and central nervous system entry of substrate drugs. During the past decade, there has been an increasing recognition of the critical interplay between drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes as determinants of drug disposition and response. Indeed, the extent of targeted tissue entry for many drugs may be facilitated by drug transporters, which are often expressed in a tissue-specific manner with broad substrate specificities. Among the uptake transporters, members of the organic anion-transporting polypeptides (human, OATPs 1The abbreviations used are: OATP, organic anion-transporting polypeptide; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; BBB, blood-brain barrier; DPDPE, [d-penicillamine2,5]enkephalin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; rodents, Oatps) have been shown to be expressed in organs such as the central nervous system, liver, and intestine and mediate the cellular uptake of a large number of structurally divergent compounds (1Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Within this family, OATP1A2 (SLCO1A2, also known as human OATP-A or OATP1) was the first human OATP to be cloned and characterized (2Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1274-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). OATP1A2 mRNA has been detected in various tissues including the brain, liver, and kidney (2Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J.

Substrates of OATP1A2 include endogenous compounds such as bile acids, steroid hormones, and their conjugates, thyroid hormones, as well as drugs including fexofenadine, ouabain, peptides (e.g. deltorphin II, [d-penicillamine2,5]enkephalin, DPDPE), and the toxin, microcystin (2Kullak-Ublick G.A.

In humans, OATP1A2 has been reported to be the only OATP transporter detected in the brain capillary endothelium at present, suggesting that OATP1A2 may play a critical role in the central nervous system penetration of many drugs and hormones across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (7Gao B. Hagenbuch B. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Benke D. Aguzzi A. Meier P.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hagenbuch B. Gao B. Meier P.J. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar). Given the extent of its substrate specificity and expression in organs of importance to drug disposition and response, genetic variations in SLCO1A2 may have significant pharmacologic and toxicologic consequences. In the present study, we were able to confirm the expression of OATP1A2 at the level of the brain capillaries that make up the BBB. Moreover, we describe the identification and functional characterization of SNPs in SLCO1A2 from a population of European-, Chinese-, Hispanic-, and African-Americans. Genotypic frequencies of six nonsynonymous polymorphisms within the coding region of SLCO1A2 were dependent on ethnicity, and some of the genetic variants were associated with markedly reduced uptake transport activity for estrone 3-sulfate and two δ-opioid receptor agonists, [d-penicillamine2,5] enkephalin and deltorphin II. Our data indicate that SLCO1A2 polymorphisms may contribute to inter-individual variability in drug disposition and may be a heretofore unrecognized factor governing the central nervous system entry of some drugs. Materials—Radiolabeled [3H]estrone 3-sulfate (53 Ci/mmol), [tyrosyl-3,5-3H]deltorphin II (2-d-Ala, 38.5 Ci/mmol), [tyrosyl-2,6–3H(N)]enkephalin (d-penicillamine2,5, DPDPE, 34.0 Ci/mmol), and unlabeled estrone3-sulfate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled deltorphin II and DPDPE were obtained from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Recombinant vaccinia virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (vtf-7) was a gift provided by Dr. Bernard Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® expression vector and the monoclonal mouse anti-V5 antibody were purchased from Invitrogen. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy European-, African-, Chinese-, and Hispanic-American volunteers was purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). An enzymatic deglycosylation kit was obtained from Glyko (San Leandro, CA), and tunicamycin was purchased from Calbiochem. Immunohistochemistry reagents were obtained from Biogenex (San Ramon, CA). All other chemicals and reagents, unless stated otherwise, were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Immunohistochemistry of Normal Human Brain, Kidney, and Liver Sections—The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human OATP1A2 was custom-made using a synthesized C-terminal polypeptide of OATP1A2 (ECKDIYQKSTVLKDDELKTKL, Invitrogen) as the epitope. Paraffin-embedded sections from normal human brain, kidney, and liver tissues (5 μm) were obtained from Human Tissue Acquisition Shared Resources at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. Histopathological analyses were performed on Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained sections from the paraffin tissue specimens. Sections were deparaffinized using EZ-Dewax (Biogenex) followed by the antigen retrieval procedure using Retrieve-It® (pH 8, Biogenex) in the case of brain and liver tissue sections. Sections were incubated with the peroxidase blocking reagent (Biogenex) for 10 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After rinsing with PBS, sections were incubated with blocking buffer (Powerblock, Biogenex) for 60 min and subsequently incubated with anti-OATP1A2 antiserum diluted in blocking buffer (1:100–1:500 dilutions) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes, sections were incubated with the avidin and biotin blocking reagents (avidin-biotin blocking kit, Biogenex) to reduce nonspecific background staining due to endogenous biotin. After three washes with PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100, sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Biogenex) for 20 min and then with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Biogenex) for 20 min. After washes, the immune reaction was visualized using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Biogenex), and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin (Biogenex). The specificity of immunoreactive signals for OATP1A2 was verified by various negative controls, which were incubated with the rabbit preimmune serum, blocking buffer, or polyclonal antiserum that had been neutralized by preincubation with the antigenic peptide at 37 °C for 2 h. Identification of SNPs in SLCO1A2 and Determination of Genotypic Frequencies—Initially, total genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples obtained from healthy volunteer subjects (46 European- and 32 African-Americans) residing in middle-Tennessee who were judged to be healthy on the basis of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory test indicative of normal cardiac, renal, and liver function. The protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained. Further analyses of genetic variations in the human SLCO1A2 gene used ethnically defined genomic DNA samples from healthy volunteers (European-, African-, Chinese-, and Hispanic-American, n = 95 each). Initial screening involved the amplification of the 14 exonic regions of SLCO1A2 followed by nonisotopic single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. PCR was typically carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles using 25 ng of genomic DNA previously digested with the restriction endonuclease XhoI (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). Variations in the single-strand mobility patterns were clearly visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A search of available SNP databases, including PharmGKB (www.pharmgkb.org), IMS-JST Japanese SNP (snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp), NCBI dbSNP (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=snp), and GeneCards (bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards), was performed to identify any additional polymorphisms. The genotypic frequencies of the nonsynonymous SNPs identified by single-strand conformational polymorphism and available data base analyses (T38C, A516C, G559A, A382T, A404T and C2003G) were determined by either direct sequencing (ABI 3700 DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) or temperature-dependent capillary electrophoresis (Reveal®, SpectruMedix, State College, PA) of PCR products. Generation of Wild-type and Variant SLCO1A2 Expression Plasmids—Original SLCO1A2 plasmid containing the full-length cDNA in the pSPORT vector (pSPORT®/SLCO1A2) was a gift from Dr. P. Meier (University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland). The full open reading frame of human SLCO1A2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using pSPORT®/SLCO1A2 as the template and ligated into the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). The PCR primer pairs (5′-ATGGGAGAAACTGAGAAAAGA-3′ and 5′-CAATTTAGTTTTCAATTCATCATC-3′) were designed to amplify the SLCO1A2 open reading frame without the stop codon to generate epitope-tagged proteins when ligated into the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector. Both pSPORT®/SLCO1A2 and pEF6/V5-His-TOPO®/SLCO1A2 with the SLCO1A2 open reading frame inserted in the sense orientation downstream from the T7 promoter region were verified by direct sequencing and found to fully match the published reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_021094). This clone was termed SLCO1A2*1, and the position of the first base (A) of the translation start site was assigned as +1 position. Site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was performed to create the identified nonsynonymous allelic variants: T38C (I13T, *2), A516C (E172D, *3), G559A (A187T, *4), A382T (N128Y, *5), A404T (N135I, *6), and C2003G (T668S, *7). The presence of each mutation was sequence-verified. Expression of Variant SLCO1A2 Alleles—For transport studies, HeLa cells grown in 12-well plates (∼0.8 × 106 cells/well) were infected with vaccinia at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) and allowed to adsorb for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells in each well were then transfected with 1 μg of wild-type or variant SLCO1A2 cDNA packaged into either pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® or pSPORT® vector (Invitrogen), along with Lipofectin™ (Invitrogen), and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The parental plasmid lacking any insert was used as vector control. Transport was then evaluated using labeled drug substrates as outlined previously (9Kim R.B. Leake B. Cvetkovic M. Roden M.M. Nadeau J. Walubo A. Wilkinson G.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 1204-1209PubMed Google Scholar). To measure estrone 3-sulfate, deltorphin II, and DPDPE transport kinetics, radiolabeled drug uptake during the linear phase (the first 3 min) was assessed in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled respective compounds. Passive diffusion was determined by carrying out parallel experiments using the parental plasmid DNA lacking the transporter cDNA insert, and this value was then subtracted from the total uptake rate seen in the presence of the transporter cDNA. Michaelis-Menten-type nonlinear curve fitting was carried out to obtain estimates of the maximal uptake rate (Vmax) and the concentration at which half the maximal uptake occurs (Km) (Prism™, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All experiments were carried out in duplicate on at least 2–3 experimental days. OATP1A2 Cell Surface Expression—HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with wild-type or variant SLCO1A2 cDNA packaged into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® using a similar protocol for transport experiments. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS-Ca2+/Mg2+ (138 mm NaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) and then treated with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating agent (sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimide-SS-biotin, 1.5 mg/ml, Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine and then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with the same buffer to remove the remaining labeling agent. After washing with PBS-Ca2+/Mg2+, cells were disrupted with 700 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation. Following centrifugation, 140 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) was added to 600 μl of cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by adding 4× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 10 min at 95 °C. Similar to the biotinylated (cell surface-expressed) fractions, the total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis for detection of immunodetectable OATP1A2 with monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution, Invitrogen) and the intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein calnexin with polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (1:1000 dilution, StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) as described previously (10Tirona R.G. Leake B.F. Merino G. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35669-35675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—HepG2 and HeLa cells were grown on sterile uncoated 35-mm glass-bottomed microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and transfected at 70–80% confluency with 2 μg of V5-tagged wild-type or variant SLCO1A2 alleles (SLCO1A2*1–*7) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 70% methanol. Cells were then permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After rinsing with PBS, cells were placed in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with monoclonal antibody against V5 epitope (diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, cells were incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse antibody labeled with the fluorescent dye, Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. During the final washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, SYTOX® Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added for nucleic acid staining. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100-M inverted microscope equipped with a LSM510 laser scanning unit. A Zeiss 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture plan Apochromat oil immersion objective was used for all experiments. Confocal images were obtained using single excitation (595 nm) and emission (610–630 nm Texas Red) filter sets. Cells transfected with the parental plasmid lacking any insert were used as control. Cells transfected with V5-tagged SLCO1A2*1 plasmid without incubation with primary antibody were also used as an additional control. For slow frame scanning, confocal images were obtained by scanning either laterally (top view, x-y scans) or axially (side view, x-z scans) across the cell. Image analysis and processing were performed with Zeiss LSM and Adobe Photoshop software. Deglycosylation of Total and Cell Surface-expressed OATP1A2— HeLa cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with V5-tagged SLCO1A2*1 and *6 using a protocol similar to that for the transport experiments. Total and cell surface-expressed OATP1A2 variants (*1 and *6) were isolated as described previously and subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Glyko, San Leandro, CA). Briefly, total or cell surface-expressed OATP1A2 protein samples were subjected to denaturation and enzymatic deglycosylation by N-glycanase, sialidase A, and O-glycanase. Samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for detection of immunoreactive proteins with monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution). In separate experiments, tunicamycin, an inhibitor of the N-linked glycosylation of proteins, was added to a final concentration of 0.3 μg/ml during a 16-h transient transfection period. Total and cell surface-expressed OATP1A2 protein samples were isolated and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously. Statistical Analysis—Determination of the statistical differences between various group parameters was performed using analysis of variance (using Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test). p values of <0.05 were considered to reflect statistical significance. OATP1A2 Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical staining of OATP1A2 was performed to define the tissue distribution of OATP1A2 in the human brain and kidney using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human OATP1A2. Different dilutions of the antiserum (1:100–1:500) were used to optimize the detection of different expression levels in immunohistochemical analyses. Nonspecific background staining was absent even when immunohistochemical staining was performed with the highest antiserum concentration utilized (1:100). In normal human brain cortex sections, immunohistochemistry detected OATP1A2 expression almost exclusively in endothelial capillary cells (Fig. 1A). Preincubation of the polyclonal antiserum against OATP1A2 with the antigenic peptide abolished positive staining in brain capillary (Fig. 1A, inset). OATP1A2 expression in human kidney was localized to the apical domain of distal nephrons (Fig. 1B). In human liver sections, OATP1A2 expression appeared to be localized to the cholangiocytes (Fig. 1C). Genetic Variations in Human SLCO1A2 Gene—Initial single-strand conformational polymorphism analyses of all 14 exons of SLCO1A2 (using genomic DNA samples from 46 European- and 32 African-Americans) and a search of available SNP databases identified 11 nonsynonymous SNPs. Based on the reported genotypic frequencies and putative location of amino acid changes, we determined the allelic frequencies of six nonsynonymous SNPs (T38C, A516C, G559A, A382T, A404T, and C2003G) using ethnically defined genomic DNA (European-, African-, Chinese-, and Hispanic-American, n = 95 each) (Table I). T38C and A516C polymorphisms were more common in European-Americans (11.1 and 5.3%, respectively) than Hispanic- and African-Americans, whereas these SNPs were not observed with Chinese-Americans. G559A variation was observed only in Hispanic-Americans (0.5%), whereas A382T was found only in African-Americans (1.0%). However, A404T polymorphism was not detected in genomic DNA samples used in the present study. C2003G variation was observed in African- and Hispanic-Americans with varying allelic frequencies of 3.7 and 1.0%, respectively. None of the six nonsynonymous SNPs tested were observed in Chinese-Americans.Table IAllele frequencies of nonsynonymous SNPs in OATP1A2 among various ethnic populations Samples were taken from African-, European-, Chinese-, and Hispanic-Americans, n = 95 each.

OATP1A2*1 was capable of transporting known substrates, such as estrone 3-sulfate (Fig. 2A), deltorphin II (Fig. 2B), and DPDPE (Fig. 2C). To determine the relative transport efficiencies of the OATP1A2 variants, we compared the total cellular uptake (0.5 μm) at 30 min. Transport activities associated with OATP1A2*3 (A516C) and *6 (A404T) variants were significantly lower than the reference allele (*1) for all three substrates tested. The OATP1A2*4 (A404T) variant exhibited markedly reduced transport activity toward estrone 3-sulfate but not toward deltorphin II and DPDPE. In contrast, the OATP1A2*7 (C2003G) variant appeared to have the reduced cellular uptake of deltorphin II and DPDPE but normal uptake activity for estrone 3-sulfate. For a more comprehensive characterization, concentration-dependent uptake kinetics, utilizing uptake data during the linear phase (first 3 min), of estrone 3-sulfate and deltorphin II were examined for all seven allelic variants (Figs. 3 and 4). Consistent with initial screening results, some of the OATP1A2 variants (e.g.*3, A516C and *6, A404T) possessed significantly lower Vmax values for both estrone 3-sulfate and deltorphin II than the reference allele (OATP1A2*1). On the other hand, the OATP1A2*4 (A404T) variant showed significantly altered Vmax and Km values only for estrone 3-sulfate but not for deltorphin II. The other variants, OATP1A2*5 (A382T) and *7 (C2003G), also appeared to have altered Vmax values with deltorphin II. Due to low Vmax values, it was not feasible to obtain reliable Km values for those variants.Fig. 4Transport kinetics of the OATP1A2 variants for deltorphin II using varying concentrations of 5–100 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 4). Kinetic parameters were obtained using the amount of deltorphin II uptake during the initial 3-min nonlinear curve fitting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Total and Cell Surface Expression of OATP1A2 Variants— Immunoblot analyses of total OATP1A2 protein expression (Fig. 5A) indicated that the reduced transport activity of some OATP1A2 variants (*6, A404T and *7, C2003G) may be associated with alterations in total protein expression. In addition to the band corresponding to the expected molecular size of ∼74-kDa (2Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1274-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), the blots showed multiple band patterns, suggestive of various glycosylation status (Fig. 5, indicated by the arrows a–c) as well as possible dimer formation (Fig. 5, indicated by the arrow d). Interestingly, the OATP1A2*6 (A404T) variant also exhibited a shift in the mobility of immunoreactive bands, indicative of altered glycosylation status (Fig. 5). We also examined whether differences in cell surface expression could account for the decreased transport capacity of variant OATP1A2 transporters. Cell surface biotinylation experiments were performed to specifically capture plasma membrane-associated OATP1A2 (Fig. 5B). Similar to that seen with total cell lysate, OATP1A2*6 (A404T) and *7 (C2003G) variants showed significantly lower cell surface-associated expression of immunoreactive proteins. For OATP1A2*3 and *5, a lower intensity of bands of ∼71 and 100 kDa was noted (Fig. 5B). The enrichment of cell surface proteins within the biotinylated fractions was evidenced by the lack of immunodetectable calnexin (an intracellular protein) in the samples (Fig. 5B). In addition, the OATP1A2*6 (A404T) variant showed altered mobility the immunoreactive protein, indicative of possible changes in glycosylation status. Deglycosylation of Total and Cell Surface-expressed OATP1A2—When expressed in HeLa cells, the total and cell surface-expressed OATP1A2 protein appeared to possess multiple molecular masses including the predicted (unglycosylated) size (∼59 kDa), as well as larger molecular size forms of ∼71, 100, and 150 kDa (Fig. 5, A and B). We performed enzymatic deglycosylation experiments to determine whether this apparent difference reflects various the glycosylation status of total and cell surface-expressed OATP1A2. In addition, we also compared the deglycosylation pattern of the OATP1A2*6 (A404T) variant (which showed altered mobility in Fig. 5A) with that of OATP1A2*1. When subjected to enzymatic N-deglycosylation, both total and cell surface-expressed fractions of OATP1A2*1 and *6 showed a significant shift in mobility, resulting in similar apparent molecular sizes (Fig. 6). These observations are consistent with the presence of additional N-glycosylation sites in OATP1A2 protein as predicted by the NetNGlyc (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) and Scan-Prosite algorithms (us.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite); five putative N-glycosylation sites were identified, including Asn residues at the amino acid positions of 62, 124, 412, and 483 as well as the 135 position, corresponding to the OATP1A2*6 variant. Chemical deglycosylation experiments were also carried out using tunicamycin, an inhibitor of Asn-linked glycosylation. Similar to enzymatic deglycosylation results, tunicamycin treatment shifted the molecular masses of the immunoreactive bands of both total and cell surface-expressed OATP1A2*1 and *6 protein to a similar extent as that observed with enzymatically N-deglycosylated samples (Fig. 6). These results confirm that Asn-135 is a key glycosylation site in OATP1A2. Plasma Membrane Localization of OATP1A2 Variants Using Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cell surface biotinylation experiments and Western blot analysis of total cell lysates in transfected HeLa cells suggested that the reduced transport activities of certain OATP1A2 variants may be due to altered trafficking of the protein to the cell surface. To further assess our findings, we performed immunofluorescence confocal microscopy experiments from the liver-derived HepG2 as well as HeLa cells following transient transfection with the V5-tagged SLCO1A2 variants (*1–*7). Using primary antibody against V5 epitope and secondary antibody labeled with Texas Red, we observed that wild-type OATP1A2*1 protein was targeted to the plasma membrane of both HepG2 and HeLa cells when viewed axially (x-z scans) and laterally (x-y scans) (Fig. 7). The expression patterns of certain OATP1A2 variants, including OATP1A2*3 (A516C), *6 (A404T), and *7 (C2003G), suggested substantial alterations in cell surface trafficking in both HepG2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 7). Drug absorption, elimination, and targeted tissue penetration are now widely recognized to be significantly dependent on drug uptake and efflux transporters (11Kim R.B. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 33: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Mizuno N. Niwa T. Yotsumoto Y. Sugiyama Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 425-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Although the extent of our knowledge in terms of efflux transporters such as MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) is quite significant, only recently has there been the appreciation of the presence and importance of drug uptake transporters to the overall drug disposition process. A family of solute carriers, broadly referred to as OATP, appears to have particular relevance to drug disposition. Targeted expression of OATPs in organs such as the liver, intestine, kidney, and brain seems to alter the extent of drug bioavailability and possibly central nervous system penetration. Recently, a new classification and nomenclature system (OATP/SLCO superfamily) has been implemented to permit an unequivocal and species-independent identification of OATP genes and gene products (1Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Clearly, a better understanding of OATP transporters at the molecular level is likely to aid the development of drugs with more predictable bioavailability and efficacy profiles. In this report, we describe the differential expression pattern of OATP1A2 in human brain and kidney and the identification and functional characterization of nonsynonymous SNPs in SLCO1A2. We first assessed the expression of OATP1A2 using multiple human organ tissues via immunohistochemistry. We utilized an antibody raised against the C-terminal of OATP1A2, which appeared to be specific when compared with antibodies generated against OATP1B1 (OATP-C) and OATP1B3 (OATP-8) (data not shown). In the liver, OATP1A2 expression was localized specifically to cholangiocytes but not in hepatocytes. In the kidney, OATP1A2 was expressed specifically on the apical side of distal nephrons. Consistent with the reported literature (7Gao B. Hagenbuch B. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Benke D. Aguzzi A. Meier P.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar), we detected OATP1A2 mainly in the brain capillary. Genotypic analyses of subjects from various ethnic populations revealed that the allelic frequencies of six identified SNPs in SLCO1A2 are dependent on ethnicity (Table I), although the extent of genetic variation appeared modest when compared with other members of OATPs such as OATP1B1 and OATP2B1 (10Tirona R.G. Leake B.F. Merino G. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35669-35675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 13Nozawa T. Nakajima M. Tamai I. Noda K. Nezu J. Sai Y. Tsuji A. Yokoi T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). When the transport function of the wild-type and six SLCO1A2 allelic variants was assessed in vitro, the OATP1A2*3 (A516C, E172D) and *6 (A404T, N135I) variants demonstrated markedly reduced transport activity toward all three substrates tested, i.e. estrone 3-sulfate, deltorphin II, and DPDPE (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Other OATP1A2 variants showed altered transport activity in a substrate-specific manner (Figs. 3 and 4). For example, OATP1A2*4 (G559A, A187T) exhibited reduced uptake transport activity with estrone 3-sulfate but not with deltorphin II and DPDPE. However, the opposite was found to be the case with OATP1A2*5 (A382T, N128Y) and *7 (C2003G, T668S). Upon analysis of transport kinetic data, it was evident that mutations at codons 172 (OATP1A2*3), 187 (OATP1A2*4), 128 (OATP1A2*5), 135 (OATP1A2*6), and 668 (OATP1A2*7) have functional consequences. An OATP1A2 membrane topology map based on hydropathy analysis suggested that mutations associated with OATP1A2*3 (A516C) and *6 (A404T) are located in the transmembrane domain 4 and the second external loop, respectively (Fig. 8). Both mutations appear to be located in relatively conserved amino acid sequence regions in comparison with other related OATP members. These regions have been suggested to have a potentially important function in terms of substrate specificity based on sequence homology with an evolutionarily primitive Oatp cloned from skate liver (14Cai S.Y. Wang W. Soroka C.J. Ballatori N. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G702-G710Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reduced transport activities of these OATP1A2 variants (OATP1A2*6 and *7) may relate in part to reduced total OATP1A2 protein expression. In addition, the OATP1A2*6 variant exhibited significantly reduced cell surface-associated expression in HepG2 and HeLa cells when assessed using cell surface biotinylation or immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Similarly, confocal microscopy revealed significant loss of cell surface-associated expression for OATP1A2*3 and *7. It should be noted that there may be a degree of cell type-dependent differences in the extent of cell surface expression for variants such as OATP1A2*7. However, for the most part, there appeared to be good concordance in terms of SNP-induced differences in cell surface expression between the two cell lines. In addition, for OATP1A2*6 (A404T, N135I), loss of asparagine at this position appeared to result in altered glycosylation status, as indicated by a modest but readily noticeable shift in molecular size on Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). Indeed, the A404T (N135I) mutation, putatively located in the second external loop, is at a predicted consensus sites (Asn-X-(Ser/Thr)) for N-glycosylation (Fig. 8). The N-glycosylation of membrane-bound proteins has been demonstrated to play a number of important roles including modulation of biological activity, regulation of intracellular targeting, protein folding, and maintenance of protein stability. A recent study demonstrated that N-glycosylation also plays an important role in OAT1 transport activity (15Tanaka K. Xu W. Zhou F. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14961-14966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When tissue expression pattern and genetic variation in OATP1A2 are considered together, a number of novel insights regarding organ-specific elimination or drug entry become apparent. First, the presence of OATP1A2 in the distal tubules of the nephrons suggests a potentially important role for this transporter to reabsorption of drugs that are filtered or secreted at the level of the proximal tubule. Its expression at the level of the BBB is of particular clinical relevance given the broad substrate specificity for this transporter, including opioid peptide analogues such as deltorphin II and DPDPE (Fig. 2). The BBB, formed by the tight intracellular junctions of brain capillary endothelial cells, express a number of transporter proteins on the apical and basolateral membranes. Expression of transporters has been shown to be critical to the regulated and sometimes limited entry of xenobiotic compounds into the brain (16Fricker G. Miller D.S. Pharmacology. 2004; 70: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among multiple transporters expressed at the BBB, OATP1A2 may be one of the major uptake transporters that therapeutic drugs may use to gain the access to the brain (7Gao B. Hagenbuch B. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Benke D. Aguzzi A. Meier P.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar). The efficacy of analgesics and peptide-mimetic compounds may depend critically on OATP1A2-mediated transport across membrane barriers to their cellular target in the central nervous system. Accordingly, genetic variations associated with OATP1A2 may not only affect the disposition of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds in organs such as the kidney but also alter the extent of drug delivery to key tissue compartments such as the brain, thereby contributing to inter-individual variability in drug responsiveness. In summary, we report the identification and functional characterization of polymorphisms in human SLCO1A2. To our knowledge, this represents the first detailed examination of tissue-selective expression and characterization of polymorphisms in human OATP1A2 and creates the framework for further investigations of the consequences of SLCO1A2 polymorphisms in vivo. Considering its substrate specificity and expression in organs such as the brain and kidney, genetic variations in SLCO1A2 may be an important contributor to inter-individual variability in drug disposition and central nervous system entry of substrate drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2163667608,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is the single most important cytokine promoting renal fibrogenesis. p21-activated kinase-2 (PAK2) and activation of abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (c-abl) have been shown recently to be smad-independent, fibroblast-specific targets downstream of the activated TGF-beta receptor. In the current study we show that in cultured NRK49F-renal fibroblasts (but not in tubular or mesangial cells) TGF-beta similarly activates PAK2 as well as c-abl and induces cell proliferation. Inhibition of the c-abl kinase with imatinib mesylate prevents increased proliferation after TGF-beta addition without affecting PAK2. These in vitro findings were extended to rats with unilateral obstructive nephropathy, a disease model of TGF-beta-driven renal fibrogenesis. In obstructed kidneys, PAK2 and c-abl activity were increased but only c-abl activation was blocked by imatinib. Treatment with imatinib did not prevent renal interstitial infiltration of macrophages or phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of smad2/3 in obstructed kidneys. In contrast, imatinib substantially inhibited an increase in the number of interstitial fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and reduced the expression and interstitial accumulation of collagen type III, collagen type IV and fibronectin. These findings indicate that TGF-beta-induced activation of the nonreceptor c-abl tyrosine kinase regulates fibroblast proliferation and, by this means, is a costimulatory signal in TGF-beta-dependent renal fibrogenesis. Inhibition of c-abl activity with imatinib mesylate ameliorates experimental renal fibrosis in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2078770765,"The cellular response to DNA lesions entails the recruitment of several checkpoint and repair factors to damaged DNA, and chromatin modifications may play a role in this process. Here we show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae epigenetic modification of histones is required for checkpoint activity in response to a variety of genotoxic stresses. We demonstrate that ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 123 by the Rad6-Bre1 complex, is necessary for activation of Rad53 kinase and cell cycle arrest. We found a similar requirement for Dot1-dependent methylation of histone H3. Loss of H3-Lys(79) methylation does not affect Mec1 activation, whereas it renders cells checkpoint-defective by preventing phosphorylation of Rad9. Such results suggest that histone modifications may have a role in checkpoint function by modulating the interactions of Rad9 with chromatin and active Mec1 kinase."

Ligands with different intrinsic efficacies yielded distinct bioluminescence resonance energy transfer modulations, indicating the stabilization of distinct receptor conformations. We also found that peptides derived from the transmembrane domains of CXCR4 inhibited activation of this receptor by blocking the ligand-induced conformational transitions of the dimer.

Given the clinical interest in GPCRs, insights into the structural and functional organization of the receptor complexes have the potential to facilitate the design of new drug candidates with increased efficacy and selectivity. Resonance energy transfer (RET) techniques have emerged as methods of choice to study receptor dimerization in living cells.

In contrast, data obtained with RET techniques revealed that CXCR4 homo-dimers form spontaneously in the absence of ligand (3Issafras H. Angers S. Bulenger S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3378-3385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), whereas a small but reproducible increase was detected by others (24Toth P.T. Ren D. Miller R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As for CXCR4, agonist stimulation of CCR2 was found to promote the formation of dimers as revealed by chemical cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation, suggesting that receptor dimerization and activation are interconnected processes (19Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. de Ana A.M. Albar J.P. Martinez A.C. Mellado M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3628-3633Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization between CXCR4 and CCR2 has initially been proposed to occur only in the case of a frequent genetic variant of CCR2, termed CCR2V64I, but not for the wild-type form of CCR2 (20Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. de Ana A.M. Martinez A.C. Nature. 1999; 400: 723-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Given that CCR2V64I was associated with delayed AIDS progression (25Lee B. Doranz B.J. Rana S. Yi Y. Mellado M. Frade J.M. Martinez A.C. O'Brien S.J. Dean M. Collman R.G. Doms R.W. J.

Indeed, it has been speculated that the AIDS-protective phenotype of the variant could be the result of its block of HIV entry via CXCR4 (20Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. de Ana A.M. Martinez A.C. Nature. 1999; 400: 723-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In line with this proposition, the same authors proposed that the antiviral properties of a monoclonal anti-CCR2 anti-antibody resulted from its ability to force the heterodimerization of CCR2 with CXCR4 (23Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Del Real G. Serrano A. Hernanz-Falcon P. Soriano S.F. Vila-Coro A.J. De Ana A.M. Lucas P. Prieto I. Martinez A.C. Mellado M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results summarized above raise a number of questions concerning the dynamic nature of the homo- and heterodimerization processes regulating GPCR function. Among these, the question of whether receptor ligands can induce homo- or heterodimer association or dissociation or promote conformational changes within preformed dimers that remain stable through the activation cycle is still highly debated. The potential role of CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization in inhibiting HIV entry makes it a particularly relevant model to study this question. In addition to their role in HIV infection, these chemokine receptors have been shown to be involved in cancer metastasis as well as in various aspects of inflammatory diseases including the directed migration of leukocytes during acute immune responses and homing (28Feng Y.

Therefore, understanding the dynamics of CXCR4/CCR2 homo- and heterodimerization after ligand binding takes on a particular importance when considering their potential as drug targets for numerous disease states. In the present study, we took advantage of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) approaches to study CXCR4/CCR2 homo- and heterodimers in the course of receptor activation. We found that CXCR4 and CCR2 exist as constitutive homo- and heterodimers and that different ligands promote distinct conformational rearrangements of preformed stable oligomers. Our data also indicate that peptides derived from CXCR4 transmembrane domains block receptor activation by preventing the agonist-promoted conformational rearrangement of both CXCR4 homo- and CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimers. Plasmids—The cloning of CXCR4-YFP and CXCR4-RLuc have been described previously (3Issafras H. Angers S. Bulenger S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Labbe-Jullie C. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34666-34673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CCR2-YFP and CCR2-RLuc were constructed by ligating the coding sequence of CCR2, after its amplification by PCR, into the pGFP-N1-Topaze (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) and (hRLuc)-N3 (BioSignal) backbones of the CXCR4-YFP and -RLuc using the HinDIII and AgeI or HinDIII and BamHI sites, respectively. The constructs were sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted mutations. The 64V and 64I variants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Kunkel method. The amino acid sequence of the fusion linker regions between the terminal receptor residue and the initiator methionine of either YFP or RLuc were as follows: CXCR4-YFP, FHSSKPVATMVSKG; CXCR4-RLuc, FHSSKPGDPPARAT-MTSKV; CCR2-YFP, SAGLGPVATMVSKG; and CCR2-RLuc, SAGL-GDPPARATMTSKV. Bold italic characters identify linker residues resulting from the cloning strategy and that derive neither from the receptor nor the fluorophore sequences. The sequences of the linker regions and of the mutated residues were verified by direct sequencing. Reagents—SDF-1 and MCP-1 were purchased from PeproTech and AMD3100 was obtained from the NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program. TC14012, a T140 analogue with similar biological properties, was synthesized as described previously (35Tamamura H. Omagari A. Hiramatsu K. Gotoh K. Kanamoto T. Xu Y. Kodama E. Matsuoka M. Hattori T.

The sequences of the CXCR4 transmembrane domain-derived peptides as described in Tarasova et al. (36Tarasova N.I. Rice W.G. Michejda C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34911-34915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis as described previously (37Heveker N.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), purified to >95% purity and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. The sequences of the peptides are as follows: CXCR4-TMII, LLFVITLPFWAVDAVANWYFGNDD-OH; CXCR4-TMIV, VYVGVWIPALLLTIPDFIFANDD-OH; CXCR4-TMVI, VILILAFFACWLPYYIGISID-OH; CXCR4-TMVII, DDEALAFFHCCLNPILYAFL-NH2. β2AR-TMVI-1 (NH2-GIIMGTFTLCWLPFFIVNIVH-COOH) and β2AR-TMVI-2 (NH2-AIIMATFTACWLPFFIVNIVH-COOH) were described in Ref. 38Hebert T.E.

They were dissolved as 10 mm stocks in Me2SO and used freshly diluted at the concentrations indicated in the text and in the figure legends. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Wisent). 24 h before transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells per well in 6-well dishes. Transient transfections were performed using the FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche) in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) In general, 0.1 μg of CXCR4-RLuc or CCR2-RLuc was transfected alone or with increasing quantities of YFP-tagged CXCR4 or CCR2. The total amount of DNA transfected in each well was completed to 2 μg with empty vector. After overnight incubation, transfection medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h to allow cell recovery. Transfected cells were then seeded in 96-well white plates (with clear bottoms that had been pre-treated with poly-d-lysine) and left in culture for 24 h before being processed for BRET assay. Flow Cytometry—Transfected HEK293T cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA 24 h after cotransfection with CXCR4-RLUC and CXCR4-YFP as indicated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated on a Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient from whole blood. The cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin and cultured for 7 days in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 IU/ml interleukin-2. For CXCR4 staining, the cells were incubated 45 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum with anti-CXCR4 phycoerythrin-conjugated 12G5 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). They were then washed three times with PBS, and cell surface expression of CXCR4 was quantified by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). BRET Assays—For routine BRET measurements, cells were washed once with PBS 36 to 48 h after transfection and coelenterazine H (Nanolight Technology) added to a final concentration of 5 μm in PBS. Readings were then collected using a multidetector plate reader MITHRAS LB940 (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) allowing the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 480 ± 20 nm and 530 ± 20 nm windows for luciferase and YFP light emissions respectively. The BRET signal is determined by calculating the ratio of the light intensity emitted by the Receptor-YFP over the light intensity emitted by the Receptor-RLuc. The values were corrected by subtracting the background BRET signal detected when the Receptor-RLuc construct was expressed alone. To assess the effects of ligands, SDF-1, AMD3100, TC14012, and MCP-1 were added at the concentrations indicated in the text and in the figure legends and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of coelenterazine H and BRET reading. When indicated, ligands were added in presence of 0.1% BSA (Sigma). For experiments with transmembrane peptides, the cells were preincubated with the different peptides in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C before agonist exposure. For acquisition of full BRET spectra, cells were transfected as described above with different amounts of CXCR4-YFP for a given quantity of CXCR4-RLuc (0.1 μg). Cells were detached and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose. 200,000 cells were seeded in 100 μl of PBS in a 96-well plate with a clear bottom (Corning), and BRET scan was performed in a Flex-station 2 (Molecular Devices) by reading luminescence between 400 and 600 nm immediately after the addition of coelenterazine for cells expressing different [acceptor]/[donor] ratios. For BRET titration experiments, net BRET ratios were expressed as a function of the [acceptor]/[donor] ratio (39Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Total fluorescence and luminescence were used as relative measures of total expression of the acceptor and donor proteins, respectively. Total fluorescence was determined with MITHRAS using an excitation filter at 485 nm and an emission filter at 535 nm. Total luminescence was measured in the MITHRAS, 10 min after the addition of coelenterazine and the reading taken in the absence of emission filter. cAMP Production—To determine cAMP accumulation, HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well microplates at 105 cells/well (coated with 0.1% poly-d-lysine) 24 h before the experiment and labeled for 2–3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum containing 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Because CXCR4 is coupled to Gi proteins, the relative efficacy of SDF-1 to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP production was monitored in different conditions. Cells were stimulated in presence of 20 μm forskolin (Sigma) alone or 20 μm forskolin and 1 nm SDF-1 for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) and supplemented or not with 10 μm of each of the CXCR4 TM peptides. The reaction was terminated by removing the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine/ligand solution and the addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. [3H]cAMP was purified by sequential chromatography (Dowex resin/aluminum oxide). Binding Assays—SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 was assessed indirectly by flow cytometry as described previously (40Brelot A. Heveker N. Montes M. Alizon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23736-23744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In brief, the ability of SDF-1 to compete for the binding of the monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5 to CEM cells was used to determine SDF-1 binding. SDF-1 was co-incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with the antibody and SDF binding determined by the loss of 12G5 labeling, as determined by flow cytometry. To test whether CXCR4 TM peptides interfered with SDF-1 binding to CXCR4, the peptides were incubated with the cells 15 min before addition of SDF-1 and 12G5. Control tubes were incubated with peptides and 12G5, without SDF-1. For T14012 binding assay, CXCR4-expressing HEK293T cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA, washed twice in binding buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.5% BSA) and resuspended at final concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Total SDF-1 binding was measured with 0.1 nm125I-SDF-1 (2200 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) as tracer, and TC14012 competition assays were performed with 100 nm TC14012 in the presence or absence of 10 μm of each CXCR4 peptide. The samples were incubated for 90 min at 20 °C, and binding was terminated by rapid filtration through glass fiber (GF/C) filters (Whatman) using ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 M NaCl. The retained radioactivity was counted in a γ counter (1271 RIAgamma Counter; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Data Analysis—Data obtained in BRET assays were analyzed using Prism 3.0. Statistical significance of the differences between the different conditions were calculated using one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post-test for p values less than 0.05. Constitutive CXCR4 Dimers Revealed by BRET—The existence of constitutive CXCR4 dimers was probed by monitoring the occurrence of intermolecular interactions among CXCR4 molecules under basal conditions using a proximity-based BRET assay. For this purpose, a constant amount of CXCR4-RLuc expression vector was cotransfected with increasing amounts of CXCR4-YFP encoding plasmid. The entire emission spectrum between 400 and 600 nm was then analyzed for various CXCR4-YFP/CXCR4-RLuc (energy acceptor/energy donor) ratios after the addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine. As shown in Fig. 1, increasing the expression level of CXCR4-YFP led to a progressive increase in the amount of light emitted in the 510–550 nm region that resulted from the transfer of energy from the luciferase to the YFP with the ensuing emission of light by the latter (Fig. 1A). The occurrence of BRET between RLuc and YFP was further illustrated by the reduction in emission observed in the 450–510 nm part of the spectrum that corresponds to the region of overlap between RLuc (energy donor) emission and YFP (energy acceptor) excitation wavelengths allowing the energy transfer. The basal BRET observed in the absence of any receptor ligand indicates, in agreement with previous reports (3Issafras H. Angers S. Bulenger S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Labbe-Jullie C. Bouvier M.

Ther. 2004; 310: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), that CXCR4 exists as a constitutive homodimer. For all subsequent BRET experiments, the emission of light was measured only in the 460–500 nm and 510–550 nm windows, corresponding to the RLuc and YFP emission peaks, respectively, and the BRET defined as the ratio of light detected in these two channels after coelenterazine addition. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, the BRET signal increased as a hyperbolic function of the CXCR4-YFP/CXCR4-RLuc ratio. The saturation of the BRET titration curve is indicative of a specific protein-protein interaction, because random molecular collisions that would give rise to bystander BRET would be expected to increase nearly linearly over a wide range of YFP/RLuc (39Mercier J.F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 26604-26611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The selectivity of the observed signal is further supported by the fact that co-expression of CXCR4-RLuc with an unrelated GPCR, GBR2-YFP, led to marginal signal that progressed linearly over the same range of energy acceptor/donor. The positive BRET signal did not result from a non-physiological overexpression of the receptors, because CXCR4 immunostaining followed by flow cytometry analysis revealed that the highest expression levels reached in transfected HEK293T cells (1 μg of CXCR4-YFP + 0.1 μg of CXCR4-RLuc) was still lower than those observed in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Fig. 1B).Fig. 2Ligand effect on CXCR4 homodimers expressed at physiological levels in HEK293T cells.

A, saturation curves with and without ligands (700 nm SDF-1 or 500 nm TC14012). Saturation curves were obtained by plotting net BRET as a function of the [Acceptor]/[Donor] ratio (for more detail, see “Experimental Procedures”). As a control of specificity, CXCR4-RLuc BRET was also monitored with increasing quantities of GBR2-YFP in presence (○) or absence (⋄) of 700 nm SDF-1. Result represents one experiment of five that gave similar results.

https://openalex.org/W2166327688,"Direction selectivity in simple cells of primary visual cortex, defined from their spike responses, cannot be predicted using linear models. It has been suggested that the shunting inhibition evoked by visual stimulation is responsible for the nonlinear component of direction selectivity. Cortical inhibition would suppress a neuron's firing when stimuli move in the nonpreferred direction, but would allow responses to stimuli in the preferred direction. Models of direction selectivity based solely on input from the lateral geniculate nucleus, however, propose that the nonlinear response is caused by spike threshold. By extracting excitatory and inhibitory components of synaptic inputs from intracellular records obtained in vivo, we demonstrate that excitation and inhibition are tuned for the same direction, but differ in relative timing. Further, membrane potential responses combine in a linear fashion. Spike threshold, however, quantitatively accounts for the nonlinear component of direction selectivity, amplifying the direction selectivity of spike output relative to that of synaptic inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2010343750,"Peroxiredoxins (Prx) have recently moved into the focus of plant and animal research in the context of development, adaptation, and disease, as they function both in antioxidant defense by reducing a broad range of toxic peroxides and in redox signaling relating to the adjustment of cell redox and antioxidant metabolism. At-PrxII F is one of six type II Prx identified in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and the only Prx that is targeted to the plant mitochondrion. Therefore, it might be assumed to have functions similar to the human 2-Cys Prx (PRDX3) and type II Prx (PRDX5) and yeast 1-Cys Prx that likewise have mitochondrial localizations. This paper presents a characterization of PrxII F at the level of subcellular distribution, activity, and reductive regeneration by mitochondrial thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. By employing tDNA insertion mutants of A. thaliana lacking expression of AtprxII F (KO-AtPrxII F), it is shown that under optimal environmental conditions the absence of PrxII F is almost fully compensated for, possibly by increases in activity of mitochondrial ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione-dependent peroxidase. However, a stronger inhibition of root growth in KO-AtPrxII F seedlings as compared with wild type is observed under stress conditions induced by CdCl2 as well as after administration of salicylhydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of cyanide-insensitive respiration. Simultaneously, major changes in the abundance of both nuclear and mitochondria-encoded transcripts were observed. These results assign a principal role to PrxII F in antioxidant defense and possibly redox signaling in plants cells.

The first peroxiredoxin was isolated from yeast 16 years ago by identifying a protein fraction that protected DNA from oxidative breakage and sensitive enzymes from oxidative inactivation in vitro. In these studies, the authors (1.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Supplementation of the assay with thiol-specific antioxidant protein (now known as peroxiredoxin) suppressed damage development (1.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prx was shown to detoxify hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxide, and peroxynitrite. By cloning and site-directed mutagenesis of the yeast thiol-specific antioxidant, the catalytic cysteinyl residue (Cys-47) was identified as the primary site of peroxide turnover (2.Chae H.Z.

Peroxiredoxins are grouped into four clans according to sequence similarities, the presence of an additional resolving Cys group at variable positions, the mechanisms of catalysis, and regeneration (4.Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 5.Dietz K.-J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Human, rat, and mice genomes contain six Prx genes prdx1 to 6, i.e. four 2-Cys Prx, one type II Prx, and one 1-Cys Prx. They are cytosolic, secreted, or targeted to the mitochondrion or peroxisome, respectively. The mammalian 2-Cys Prx (PRDX3) and type II Prx (PRDX5) are localized to the mitochondrion, and the latter was also detected in other subcellular compartments, namely the cytosol, nucleus, and peroxisome (6.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In stably overexpressing thymoma cells, PRDX3 was related to the regulation of cellular H2O2 concentrations and protection from apoptosis (7.Nonn L. Berggren M. Powis G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 682-689PubMed Google Scholar); in addition, Alzheimer disease and Down's syndrome correlated with its down-regulation (8.Kim S.H. Fountoulakis M. Cairns N. Lubec G. J. Neural Trans. 2001; 61: 223-235Google Scholar). Likewise, PRDX5 inhibited p53-dependent apoptosis (9.Zhou Y. Kok K.H. Chun A.C.S. Wong C.-M. Wu H.W. Lin M.C.M. Fung P.C.W. Kung H.-F. Jin D.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Of the five peroxiredoxins identified in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, the 1-Cys Prx mTPx (Sc-mTPx) has been localized in the mitochondrion. Its expression is controlled by redox- and carbon-dependent signaling pathways (10.Monteiro G. Pereira G.A.G. Netto L.E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), being highly expressed during the stationary phase. Sc-mTPx is thought to protect yeast mitochondria from oxidative stress (11.Park S.G. Cha M.-K. Jeong W. Kim I.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Of the 10 Prx genes identified in the Arabidopsis genome, 5 are targeted to organelles, i.e. 4 to the chloroplast, and only 1 PrxII F to the mitochondrion (12.Horling F. Lamkemeyer P. Konig J. Finkemeier I. Kandlbinder A. Baier M. Dietz K.-J. Plant. Physiol. 2003; 131: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The in silico prediction of mitochondrial location of PrxII F was verified in proteomic approaches (13.Kruft V. Eubel H. Jansch L. Werhahn W. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1694-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 14.Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 32: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The function of the peroxiredoxin PrxII F in plant mitochondria is unknown. However, the general presence of a peroxiredoxin in mitochondria in all eukaryotes on the one hand and the presence of a set of peroxiredoxins in chloroplasts with their highly active photosynthetic energy metabolism on the other hand (5.Dietz K.-J. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) are suggestive of an essential role for PrxII F in organellar redox homeostasis. Mitochondria are the sites of high rate energy metabolism, conversion reactions such as glycine decarboxylation, and the provision of carbon skeletons for a number of biosynthetic pathways, including nitrogen assimilation. They link redox metabolism to ATP synthesis through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Reactive oxygen species are released when electron carriers become over-reduced (15.M⊘ller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Therefore, the primary line of defense against oxidative stress in mitochondria involves mechanisms to keep the electron transport chain oxidized, i.e. by balancing substrate oxidation with ATP requirement, as well as activation of alternative oxidase (AOX), uncoupling proteins, and rotenone-insensitive NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (15.M⊘ller I.M.

With increasing reduction of the ETC, mitochondria release ROS at rates probably exceeding those measured in animal mitochondria where 1–5% of consumed O2 was diverted into ROS production (15.M⊘ller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). In plants, ROS production decreased with activation of AOX (19.Purvis A.C. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 165-170Crossref Google Scholar), which has been shown to be activated by the reduction of their regulatory thiol groups (20.Vanlerberghe G.C. Yio J.Y.H. Parsons H.L. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Likewise, a search for mitochondrial thiol proteins interacting with thioredoxin has produced a list of 50 putative targets for redox regulation by thiol-disulfide transition, including various enzymes of the Krebs cycle and the permeability transition pore (21.Balmer Y. Vensel W.H. Tanaka C.K. Hurkman W.J. Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.-P. Manieri W. Schürmann P. Droux M. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to chloroplasts, the component activities of an intricate network of redox systems are modulated depending on the redox environment of the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial metabolism with a basic activity under conditions of oxidized ETC may undergo a phase of reductive activation with increasing electron pressure, before oxidative damage develops when excess reducing power generates ROS. Changes in the mitochondrial redox state will not only affect mitochondrial activities but also other cellular processes such as photosynthesis, stress defense, and initiation of programmed cell death (22.Dutilleul C.

Detoxification of ROS and repair of oxidative damage in the mitochondrion counteract the expression of oxidative stress. A set of antioxidant enzymes has been identified and (partially) characterized in plant mitochondria. Mn-SOD converts superoxide anion radicals to hydrogen peroxide that may be detoxified by ascorbate peroxidase; oxidized mono- and dehydroascorbate is regenerated through the ascorbate/glutathione cycle. Chew et al. (25.Chew O. Whelan J. Millar A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46869-46877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) demonstrated dual targeting of ascorbate peroxidase (At4g08390), monodehydroascorbate reductase (At1g63940), and glutathione reductase (At3g54660) to both the plastid and mitochondrion, whereas a specific dehydroascorbate reductase (At3g54660) was solely imported into the mitochondria. The work extended previous investigations that suggested dual targeting of glutathione reductase (26.Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y.B. Mullinaeux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and solved the contradiction between reported activities of the respective enzyme activities in mitochondrial preparations and the lack of corresponding genes with unequivocal information for mitochondrial targeting in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (27.Jiménez A. Hernández J.A. del Rio L. Sevilla F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Recently, PrxII F was identified as mitochondrial type II peroxiredoxin. Many peroxiredoxins have a broad activity toward peroxide substrates (12.Horling F. Lamkemeyer P. Konig J. Finkemeier I. Kandlbinder A. Baier M. Dietz K.-J. Plant. Physiol. 2003; 131: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 28.Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Corbier C. Jacquot J.-P. Physiol.

Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 31.Dietz K.-J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 228: 141-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of the study was to characterize the function of the mitochondrial PrxII F in plant cell metabolism. To this end and in addition to the determination of its basic catalytic activity, subcellular and tissue distribution, Arabidopsis lines lacking PrxII F proteins should be analyzed in order to characterize PrxII F function in mitochondrial antioxidant metabolism and redox homeostasis and evaluate its importance for plant phenotype and fitness. For growth on hydroponic cultures, Arabidopsis seedlings (ecotype Columbia) of wild type, KO-PrxII F-1, and KO-PrxII F-2 were germinated and grown on nutrient solution as described in detail (32.Kandlbinder A. Finkemeier I. Wormuth D. Hanitzsch M. Dietz K.-J. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The hydroponic medium contained 1.5 mm KNO3, 1.5 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.25 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm NH4H2PO4, 5 μm NaFe-EDTA, 0.4 μm ZnSO4, 1 μm KCl, 25 μm H3BO3, 2 μm MnSO4, 0.1 μm CuSO4, 0.1 μm (NH4)6Mo7O2, 0.5 mm MES (pH 5.25). Five-week-old plants were treated for 1 week with 10 μm CdCl2 or 25 μm SHAM, respectively. Nutrient solution was replaced every 2nd day. Growth chamber conditions were adjusted to a 10:14-h day/night cycle (22:20 °C) at light intensities of 120 μmol quanta m–2 s–1 with 50% relative humidity. Plants were harvested 3 h after the onset of illumination. Entire roots of 17 plants per experiment were pooled, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. For growth on plates, seedlings were grown for 10 days in a vertical position on 0.5% of phytagel with nutrient solution, where the macro-elements KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 were replaced with equimolar amounts of KCl and CaCl2, to enhance root elongation. The plates were supplemented with 7.5 μm CdCl2 or 25 μm SHAM. The first mutant allele KO-AtPrxII F-1 (GABI-Kat line114G01) was obtained from the GABI-Kat collection of tDNA insertion lines (33.Rosso M.G. Li Y. Strizhov N. Reiss B. Dekker K. Weisshaar B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), the second mutant allele KO-AtPrxII F-2 was obtained from the Sail collection (34.Sessions A. Burke E. Presting G. Aux G. McElver J. Patton D. Dietrich B. Ho P. Bacwaden J. Ko C. Clarke J.D. Cotton D. Bullis D. Snell J. Miguel T. Hutchison D. Kimmerly B. Mitzel T. Katagiri F. Glazebrook J. Law M. Goff S.A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Individual plants of the T3 generation were screened for tDNA insertion by PCR using gene-specific primers and primers anchored in the tDNA borders. Homozygous plants were identified by the absence of the PrxII F-PCR product obtained from gene-specific primers, which compose the tDNA insertion site. The following primers were used for the prxII F ORF: prxIIF-f, 5′-TCAAAGCTCGCGGAAGGCACT-3′; prxIIF-r, 5′-TTAGATCTGTCCTAAGA-3′; and the following primers were used for the tDNA left borders: GABI tDNA, o8409 5′-ATATTGACCATCATACTCATTGC-3′; Sail tDNA, 5′-TAGCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATCTCGATACAC-3′. Δ28-AtPrxII F was cloned as described previously (35.Rouhier, N., Villarejo, A., Srivastava, M., Gelhaye, E., Keech, O., Droux, M., Finkemeier, I., Samuelsson, G., Dietz, K.-J., Jacquot, J.-P., and Wingsle, G. (2004) Antioxid. Redox Signal., in pressGoogle Scholar). For cDNA amplification of Atgrx-CxxS10, the following primers were used to obtain a product that lacks the N-terminal 7-amino acid signal peptide: grx-cxxs10-f, 5′-gcgtcgcaaagagcggtggt-3′, and grx-cxxs10-r, 5′-taaagccacaaagcaccagcct-3′. The cDNA was cloned in-frame into the pCR® T7/NT-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which allows expression and purification of an N-terminally His6-tagged recombinant protein. Expression and purification of the recombinant proteins were performed as described (12.Horling F. Lamkemeyer P. Konig J. Finkemeier I. Kandlbinder A. Baier M. Dietz K.-J. Plant. Physiol. 2003; 131: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In vitro peroxidase activity of recombinant PrxII F was measured in two different assays. Xylenol Orange Assay—PrxII F (1–30 μm) was maintained in its reduced state by 10 mm DTT or 0.5–5 mm GSH in presence or absence of 14 μm Grx-CxxS10, respectively. The reduction of H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, phospholipid hydroperoxide, and phosphatidylcholine dilinoleoyl hydroperoxide was measured in a time course over 2 min, in 20-s intervals. The remaining peroxides were detected by ferrous-dependent oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX). 20 μl of the reaction was incubated with 1 ml of FOX reagent for 5–15 min for different substrates, respectively. The absorbance was measured and compared with standard curves established for each substrate at 560 nm. The FOX reagent contained 25 mm H2SO4, 100 mm sorbitol, 250 μm FeII(NH4)2(SO4)2, and 125 μm xylenol orange, respectively. The activity tests were repeated 5–10 times with enzymes from two different preparations. Synthesis of phosphatidylcholine dilinoleoyl hydroperoxide and linoleic acid hydroperoxide was performed as described (36.König J. Lotte K. Plessow R. Brockhinke A. Baier M. Dietz K.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24409-24420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Trx-dependent Activity Assay—The rates of H2O2 reduction were determined in a coupled assay with mitochondrial Arabidopsis thioredoxin-o (Trx-o) and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin-reductase (NTRA) by monitoring the decrease in A340 because of NADPH oxidation. The assay contained 100 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 μm PrxII F, 3 μm AtTrx-o, 0.3 μm NTRA, and 1 mm NADPH in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of H2O2 to a final concentration of 1 mm and the change in A340 followed. An antiserum against PrxII F protein heterologously expressed in E. coli was generated in rabbit (Pineda). For Western blot analysis, frozen plant material was ground to a fine powder in liquid N2, and proteins were extracted in a buffer containing 250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8). The protein contents of the aqueous extracts were quantified spectrophotometrically using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed as described (12.Horling F. Lamkemeyer P. Konig J. Finkemeier I. Kandlbinder A. Baier M. Dietz K.-J. Plant. Physiol. 2003; 131: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis was performed as described (37.König J. Baier M. Horling F. Kahmann U. Harris G. Schürmann P. Dietz K.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5738-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Sections of 1 mm2 were cut from 4-week-old Arabidopsis leaves of wild type and KO-PrxII F-1 plants and immediately fixed in 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in EM buffer (50 mm KH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0)) for 45 min. After dehydration in acetone gradients, the samples were embedded stepwise in Transmit EM resin (TAAB Laboratories Equipment). Ultrathin sections of 60–70 nm were cut with a diamond knife (DuPont) on an ultracut microtome (Reichert Ultracut E) and placed onto 400 mesh gold grids. Samples were immunolabeled with rabbit anti-PrxII F antiserum (1:100) diluted in bovine serum albumin-containing Tris-buffered saline (BSA/TBS) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) NaN3 for 1 h. Grids were rinsed five times with TBS and incubated for 1 h with gold-conjugated (15 nm) anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at a 1:30 dilution in BSA/TBS. Samples were counterstained with 0.1% (w/v) uranyl acetate (5 s) followed by 2% (w/v) lead citrate (5 s). Preparations were examined with a Hitachi H500 electron microscope at 75 kV. Mitochondria were isolated from Arabidopsis rosette leaves as follows. All procedures were done at 4 °C; all apparatus and plasticware were detergent-free. Rosette leaves (20–50 g fresh weight) were harvested from 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown under short day conditions (8-h photoperiod), washed in sterile distilled water, and blotted dry on tissue paper. Mitochondria were extracted by homogenizing leaves using a pestle and mortar containing 4 volumes of extraction medium (0.4 m mannitol, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.0), 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 1.0% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm cysteine) and a small amount of acid-washed sand. The extract was filtered through Miracloth (Merck), and unbroken cells and chloroplasts were removed by low speed centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min). Mitochondria were pelleted by high speed centrifugation (18,000 × g, 15 min) and resuspended in wash buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm TES-KOH (pH 7.5)). The rounds of low and high speed centrifugation were repeated. The resulting mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of wash buffer and layered onto a Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient consisting of 0–5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 in 28% (v/v) Percoll in wash buffer. After centrifugation at 43,000 × g for 30 min, mitochondria were visible as a white/brown band toward the lower part of the gradient. Mitochondria were collected by aspiration and washed twice in wash medium. Mitochondria were further subfractionated into outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and matrix according to Ref. 38.Sweetlove L.J. Mowday B. Hebestreit H.F. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. Measurements of mitochondrial respiration were done as described previously (14.Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 32: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Activities of aconitase, fumarase, NAD-malic enzyme, and pyruvate dehydrogenase were assayed according to Ref. 39.Jenner H.L. Winning B.M. Millar A.H. Tomlinson K.L. Leaver C.J. Hill S.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar. Apx was assayed according to Ref. 40.Mittova V. Volokita M. Guy M. Tal M. Physiol. Plant. 2000; 110: 42-51Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar. Gpx was assayed according to Ref. 41.Yoshimura K. Miyao K. Gaber A. Takeda T. Kanaboshi H. Miyasaka H. Shigeoka S. Plant J. 2004; 37: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar. Root O2 measurements were performed similar to Ref. 42.Kania A. Langlade N. Martinoia E. Neumann G. Plant Soil. 2003; 248: 117-127Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar. Total roots from hydroponically cultivated plants were excised and directly transferred onto a high grade steel net in a Clark-type O2 electrode filled with 5 ml of an air-saturated 2 mm Ca(NO3)2 solution at 20 °C. SHAM was used as a respiratory inhibitor at a final concentration of 7.5 mm. Respiratory activity from single plant roots was recorded over 10 min. For metabolite analysis 100 mg of frozen leaf and root tissue from hydroponic plants, respectively, were ground in liquid nitrogen. ATP contents were determined luminometrically according to Ref. 43.Kaiser W. Urbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 459: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. The frozen tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold 5% HClO4 and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. 10 μl of 2 m Tris was added to 500 μl of the supernatant, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 5 m K2CO3. The cleared extract was diluted in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). 10 μl of crude firefly lantern extract (Sigma) was added, and emitted light intensities were measured in a luminometer, which allowed for direct quantification of ATP when compared with authentic standards. For ascorbate and dehydroascorbate measurements, the tissue was extracted in 600 μl of ice-cold 1 m HClO4. Asc contents were determined spectrophotometrically via the oxidation of ascorbate with ascorbate oxidase as described previously in detail (12.Horling F. Lamkemeyer P. Konig J. Finkemeier I. Kandlbinder A. Baier M. Dietz K.-J. Plant. Physiol. 2003; 131: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Reduced and oxidized glutathione were quantified as monobromobimane derivatives by fluorometric analysis after separation by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (44.Finkemeier I. Kluge C. Metwally A. Georgi M. Grotjohann N. Dietz K.-J. Plant Cell Environ. 2003; 26: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The tissue was homogenized in 500 μl of 5 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in 0.1 n HCl and centrifuged for 30 min (13,000 rpm, 4 °C). 150 μl of the supernatant and 90 μl of CHES buffer (1 m) were used for derivatization with 20 μl of monobromobimane (15 mm) in the presence or absence of 40 μl of 3 mm DTT, respectively. The derivatization was stopped after 20 min with 300 μlof 10% acetic acid. Theme-specific “redoxin” and “chondriome” macroarrays were produced by spotting 143 and 165 gene-specific PCR products (100–300 bp in length, amplified from the 3′ end of the cDNA) in duplicate on Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). For the detailed array design see Kandlbinder. 2A. Kandlbinder, unpublished. Plants were grown in hydroponic culture as described above. Digitoxin-labeled cDNA of wild type, KO-PrxII F-1, KO-PrxII F-2 from control, Cd2+- and SHAM-treated roots were synthesized from 5 μg of RNA and quantified as described previously (32.Kandlbinder A. Finkemeier I. Wormuth D. Hanitzsch M. Dietz K.-J. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each cDNA from independent experiments (wild type, three experiments; KO-PrxII F-1, two experiments; KO-PrxII F-2, one experiment) was hybridized with an array filter of the redoxin and chondriome macroarrays, respectively. Array hybridization and data evaluation were performed as described previously (32.Kandlbinder A. Finkemeier I. Wormuth D. Hanitzsch M. Dietz K.-J. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The spot intensities were quantified with the AIDA array vision software (Raytest) and normalized according to whole intensity of all spots on the array. Data from KO-PrxII F-1 and KO-PrxII F-2 were pooled, and the normalized spot intensities were tested for each treatment against wild type by the use of Student's t test analysis (p < 0.05 and p < 0.1). To quantify differential expression of the KO-PrxII F lines, an induction factor was calculated by the ratio of the average normalized signal intensities of the respective treatment from the KO-PrxII F lines and wild type. Total RNA was isolated from whole roots, and DNA was removed by DNase I treatment (Promega). 3 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with 1 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (Promega) using oligo(dT) as primers for 1 h at 42 °C. The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:10, and 1–4 μl of cDNA was used in 20-μl PCRs. The PCR settings were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, and for the optimized number of cycles for each gene product 15 s 94 °C, 30 s 50–56 °C, and 45 s 72 °C. Following separation of the PCR products, the bands were quantified densitometrically. Each band was normalized against the intensity obtained with the same cDNA using the actin-specific primers. The primers and gene code numbers were as follows: actin (At5g09810) fw, 5′-GGAGCTGAGAGATTCCGTTG-3′, and rv, 5′-GGTGCAACCACCTTGATCTT-3′; aconitase (At2g05710) fw, 5′-CAAGCAAACATGGAGCTTGA-3′, and rv, 5′-A"

Despite the vast literature on mitochondrial cation transport, basically little information is available regarding the molecular identity of these transporters (1.Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 2.Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Several antiporters and uniporters selective for sodium, potassium, and calcium have been described, based on measurements of ion fluxes in suspensions of isolated mitochondria. In energized mitochondria, the potassium flux is considerable. In fact, potassium ions are required for optimal oxidative phosphorylation (3.Kimmich G.A. Rasmussen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 131: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and electrophoretic potassium uptake plays a critical role in volume regulation (4.Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The application of the patch clamp technique to mitoplasts (inner membrane vesicles) permits the control of the transmembrane voltage and ion concentrations and allows the observation of activities at single channel level (5.Zoratti M.

The calcium uniporter has been discovered recently to be a highly selective ion channel, whose molecular identity is unknown, however (7.Kirichok Y. Krapivinsky G. Clapham D.E.

Sodium-selective currents have not been recorded up to now by patch clamp, whereas an ATP-sensitive, potassium-selective channel is present in the inner membrane (8.Inoue I. Nagase H. Kishi K.

This channel seems to be activated under pathological conditions, e.g. ischemic reperfusion, and has been hypothesized to modulate ATP production under physiological conditions (16.Xu W. Liu Y.

Despite the fact that several 50–60-kDa proteins purified from mitochondria by quinine affinity column showed potassium-selective channel activity upon reconstitution in artificial membranes (18.Diwan J.J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the molecular identity of the above-mentioned channels is still unknown. Kv1.3, a member of the Shaker family of voltage-gated Kv channels, is the main potassium channel in T lymphocytes but is also expressed in other tissues, e.g. kidney (20.Yao X. Chang A.Y.

Acta. 2003; 1616: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In T lymphocytes Kv1.3 has been clearly demonstrated to represent a crucial factor for proliferation and volume regulation (24.Chandy K.G. Wulff H. Beeton C. Pennington M. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 280-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Accordingly, inhibitors of Kv1.3 potently suppress effector memory T cell proliferation, making these blockers a promising tool for the therapy of autoimmune diseases (25.Beeton C. Wulff H. Barbaria J. Clot-Faybesse O. Pennington M. Bernard D. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Beraud E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13942-13947Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Kv1.3 is functionally inhibited and tyrosine-phosphorylated during CD95/Fas and ceramide-induced apoptosis (26.Szabò I. Gulbins E. Apfel H. Zhang X. Barth P. Busch A.E.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7661-7666Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). By using a genetic model, we also demonstrated that Kv1.3 plays an important role in apoptosis induced by the cytostatic drug, actinomycin D. Most surprisingly, the lack of Kv1.3 significantly prevented cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) changes induced by actinomycin D, i.e. apoptotic events that are known to occur at the level of mitochondria (28.Bock J. Szabò I. Jekle A. Gulbins E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 295: 526-531Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of Kv1.3. In the present work we report a previously undescribed mitochondrial localization of the potassium-selective channel Kv1.3 in genetically nonmanipulated lymphocytes. The molecular identity of the channel was assessed by comparing mitochondria isolated from the T lymphocyte cell line CTLL-2, known to lack Kv1.3 (29.Deutsch C. Chen L.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10036-10040Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with those from CTLL-2 cells stably transfected with Kv1.3. All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Murine interleukin-2 (4 units/ml, Roche Applied Science) was added daily to CTLL-2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA). CTLL-2 cells were transfected with 40 μg each of pJK/Kv1.3 or pJK plasmids by electroporation and cultured with 800 μg/ml geneticin (G418) antibiotic to obtain stable transfectants. All experiments were performed with a mixed population obtained from several independent transfections of Kv1.3-positive or -negative cells, respectively, in order to exclude selections of clones with altered apoptotic machinery. In addition, all cultures were re-established from frozen stocks after 4 weeks of growth to prevent selection of certain clones. Lymphocytes—Whole-cell currents were recorded with an EPC-7 amplifier (List). Leak currents were not subtracted. The bath solution was composed of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). The intracellular solution contained 134 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Mitochondria—To purify mitochondria, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm TES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EGTA and finally Dounce-homogenized. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g and at 4 °C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed twice. The purified mitochondria were resuspended in the buffer described above. Mitoplasts were formed by osmotic shock of isolated mitochondria in 30 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) and were then equilibrated in 134 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Mitoplasts with a diameter of 2–3 μm were selected by video microscopy. Gigaohm seals were established on the membrane section opposite to the cap region. Data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 200 Hz. Currents were recorded under asymmetrical [K+] conditions with a bath solution of 134 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES/K+ (pH 7.3) and a pipette solution consisting of 50 mm KCl, 84 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES/K + (pH 7.3). The theoretical EK under these conditions, assuming permeability to K+ only, is –25 mV. As indicated, some experiments were performed under symmetrical [K+] conditions with 114 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES/K+ (pH 7.3). In the indicated patch clamp experiments, charybdotoxin was used at a concentration of 20 nm (added to the bath in whole-cell experiments), or patch pipettes were backfilled with 2 nm MgTx (in experiments on mitoplasts). The tip contained a solution without inhibitors, and the pipette was backfilled with inhibitor-containing medium. The concentration of MgTx employed in the present experiments does not inhibit other K+ channels (30.Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 31.Garcia-Calvo M. Leonard R.J. Novick J. Stevens S.P. Schmalhofer W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

Intracellular or intramitoplast voltages are reported, and outward currents are plotted upward. Cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm each of sodium fluoride, EDTA, and sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin and were centrifuged, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-Kv1.3 antiserum followed by an alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody and detection with the Tropix chemiluminescence system (TROPIX Inc., Bedford, MA). The anti-Kv1.3 antibody used in the Western blots was kindly provided by Dr. O. Pongs, University of Hamburg, Germany. To perform EM studies, we produced a polyclonal rabbit anti-Kv1.3 antibody that is specific for the extracellularly located amino acids 204–220 (LPEFRDEKDYPASTSQD), and the results were confirmed with a second polyclonal rabbit anti-Kv1.3 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. O. Pongs, University of Hamburg, Germany). Peripheral blood lymphocytes were purified by Ficoll-Paque gradient, and the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol gradients, and embedded in LR white resin (London Resin Company Limited, Berkshire, UK). Sections were cut at 85 nm for on-grid immunochemistry, blocked, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% gelatin from cold water fish skin (Sigma), 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. Sections were labeled with rabbit anti-Kv1.3 antibodies and 6 nm gold-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Aurion, Wageningen, Netherlands). Samples were stained with uranyl acetate and viewed with a JEOL 1200EX-II electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA). For the flow cytometry studies, cells were transiently transfected with pEYFP-Mito or pEYFP-ER (Clontech) and sorted after 48 h. For Western blotting experiments, mitochondria from wild type Jurkat cells, CTLL-2/pJK, or CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells were employed. Mitochondria isolated as described above for patch clamp experiments were further purified using a 10-min Percoll gradient centrifugation at 4 °C (60, 30, and 18% Percoll in the buffer above, 8,500 × g). Mitochondria at the interface between the 30 and 60% layers were collected, washed twice, and resuspended in 50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm succinate, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase (buffer 1). Equivalents to 30 μg of total protein were used for Western blotting of Kv1.3. The Western blots were developed using anti-Kv1.3 antibodies (kindly provided by Dr. O. Pongs), an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary anti-rabbit antibody, and the Tropix chemiluminescence system. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with Cy3-labeled anti-Kv1.3 antibodies against an extracellular portion of the channel from Alamone Labs on intact and 0.1% Triton X-100-permeabilized mitochondria to access the IMM. To label mitochondria, we transiently transfected CTLL-2/Kv1.3 or CTLL-2/pJK cells with the plasmids pEYFP-Mito or control pEYFP-ER (Clontech) that direct expression of the EYFP protein specifically in mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. For staining with anti-Tim23 antibodies (BD Biosciences), purified mitochondria were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice for 15 min, washed twice in buffer 1, blocked with 1% fetal calf serum, and stained consecutively for 45 min each with rabbit anti-Kv1.3 and mouse anti-Tim23 antibodies. The samples were washed extensively and finally stained consecutively for 45 min each with FITC anti-mouse and Cy3 anti-rabbit antibodies. The samples were washed twice and analyzed by FACS. To determine membrane potential of isolated mitochondria, mitochondria were isolated as above, washed, and resuspended in 5 mm succinate, 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.4 with KOH), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase. A slightly hyperosmotic medium (340 mosmol as measured by osmometer analysis) was used to protect the mitochondria from swelling. The membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was determined by incubation of purified mitochondria with 10 nm DiOC6(3) (32.Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) in DTT-free buffer for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 10 nm Shk or 20 nm MgTx. Higher concentrations of the toxins than in the patch clamp studies were employed in order to ensure their rapid diffusion across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Recombinant GST-Kv1.3 (AA1–618) was added at 400 ng/ml if indicated. Mitochondria were then pelleted, resuspended at 37 °C in pre-warmed DTT-free buffer 1 containing 10 nm DiOC6(3), and fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. The shift of the temperature from 4 to 37 °C facilitates the opening of Kv1.3 and therefore open channel block by the toxins (33.Pahapill P.A. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 445: 407-430Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A right shift of the fluorescence signal by increased binding of DiOC6(3) indicates a hyperpolarization, whereas depolarization is indicated by a left shift. Complete depolarization of mitochondria was achieved with 1 μm carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone for 10 min at room temperature. The experiments were repeated with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester showing very similar results (not shown). To determine the cellular localization of Kv1.3, we first performed transmission electron microscopy studies on freshly isolated peripheral human blood lymphocytes. These experiments surprisingly demonstrated the presence of the channel protein in mitochondria (Fig. 1A) and confirmed the previously defined localization of Kv1.3 in the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles, most likely of the endoplasmic reticulum. The typical double membrane and the presence of cristae identified mitochondria. The presence of Kv1.3 was confirmed by using two different antibodies, i.e. a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 204–220 (Fig. 1A, left panel) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of Kv1.3 (kindly provided by Dr. O. Pongs) (right panel). The specificity of this latter antibody is indicated by the fact that the same antibody, when used in Western blots on whole-cell lysates of lymphocytes, reacted exclusively with a single 65-kDa band only in Kv1.3-containing cells (see Fig. 2A). Close inspection of the transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that Kv1.3 localizes to the IMM (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Expression of plasma membrane Kv1.3 in CTLL-2 cells.A, Western blots of whole-cell lysates confirm the specific expression of Kv1.3 in CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells. The 65-kDa Kv1.3 protein was absent in whole-cell lysates of CTLL-2/pJK cells. Proteins were separated, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and developed using polyclonal rabbit anti-Kv1.3 antibodies. Shown are representative blots from three experiments. B–G, the biophysical characteristics of Kv1.3 in CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells resemble those of Kv1.3 in Jurkat cells. B, transfection of Kv1.3 into CTLL-2 cells results in a mean whole-cell peak current almost identical to that observed in Jurkat cells endogenously expressing the channel. The mean whole-cell peak currents measured at 50 mV are reported for Jurkat, CTLL-2/Kv1.3, and CTLL-2/pJK cells (n = 15). C, the distribution of whole-cell peak currents (at 50 mV) confirms a similar expression of Kv1.3 in single Jurkat and CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells. Representative whole-cell currents of CTLL-2/pJK (D) or CTLL-2/Kv1.3 (E) cells were elicited by changing the membrane potential in six distinct 20-mV steps (–70 to 50 mV). Voltage pulses were applied every 45 s. The data reveal the absence of Kv1.3 in CTLL-2/pJK cells (D) and a current typical for Kv1.3 in CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells (E). F, use-dependent inactivation of Kv1.3 in CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells was detected by stepping up the potential from –70 to 50 mV at 1-s intervals. The inactivation kinetics are identical to those measured in Jurkat T cells. G, addition of 20 nm charybdotoxin (ChTx), a Kv1.3 inhibitor, inhibited the K+ current in CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells. Finally, exchange of the bath solution containing 5 mm KCl with a medium containing 150 mm KCl resulted in a shift of the reversal potential from –70/–80 mV (theoretical reversal potential of –84 mV) to 0 ± 8 mV (n = 3), indicating potassium selectivity of Kv1.3 in CTLL-2/Kv1.3 (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To show functional expression of Kv1.3 in mitochondria, we performed patch clamp experiments on mitoplasts from Jurkat cells known to endogenously express Kv1.3 (34.Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. DeCoursey T.E. Gupta S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 197-237Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In 8 of 13 patches, the mitoplasts were endowed with a channel with biophysical characteristics very similar to those of Kv1.3 in the cell membrane. These characteristics included conductance (Fig. 1, B–D), single open channel current-voltage relationship (Fig. 1C), and potassium selectivity (Fig. 1, B and C) and sensitivity to the very specific Kv1.3 inhibitor MgTx (Fig. 1D) or the K+ channel blocker TEACl (not shown). The slope conductance was ∼25 pS, and a weak rectification was observed at negative potentials in symmetrical high K+ solution, as expected for Kv1.3 (34.Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. DeCoursey T.E. Gupta S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 197-237Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 35.Schilling T. Quandt F.N. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Heinemann U. Decoursey T.E. Eder C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1123-C1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed reversal potential (–20 ± 6 mV) was close to the theoretical EK (–25 mV) demonstrating potassium selectivity for the channel. The activity was only slightly voltage-dependent (Fig. 1B and not shown). The inactivation kinetics of Kv1.3 in mitoplasts could not be systematically studied because application of large voltage steps across the mitoplast membrane resulted in loss of the seal. In a representative case (Fig. 1E), application of depolarizing 60-mV voltage steps from 0 mV induced a rapid activation followed by modest inactivation, consistent with the typical behavior of Kv1.3 (see “Discussion”). Channel activity is characterized by flickering behavior, in accordance with the reported single channel activity of Kv1.3 in the plasma membrane (33.Pahapill P.A. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 445: 407-430Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34.Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. DeCoursey T.E. Gupta S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 197-237Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To exclude detection of another mitochondrial channel, displaying similar characteristics, we used a genetic model and transfected Kv1.3-deficient CTLL-2 cells (29.Deutsch C. Chen L.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10036-10040Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with an expression vector for Kv1.3 (pJK-Kv1.3) (cells designated CTLL-2/Kv1.3) or the control vector (pJK) (designated CTLL-2/pJK) (36.Grassmè H. Gulbins E. Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1997; 91: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Control Western blots from whole-cell lysates (Fig. 2A) and patch clamp studies in whole-cell configuration (Fig. 2, B–G) (n = 15) confirmed the expression of Kv1.3 exclusively in transfected cells and indicated a functional expression level of the channel very similar to that in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2, B and C), making overexpression artifacts very unlikely. The biophysical characteristics of Kv1.3 in the plasma membrane of CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells were identical to those of endogenous Kv1.3 in Jurkat T lymphocytes (Fig. 2, E–G). These data indicate the suitability of this genetic model to analyze Kv1.3 activity. Next, the expression and function of Kv1.3 in mitochondria were investigated by employing this genetic system. Patch clamp studies in mitoplasts from CTLL-2/Kv1.3 cells revealed in 7 out of 9 patches potassium channel activity similar to endogenous Kv1.3 in Jurkat mitoplasts (Fig. 3, A–E). This current was absent in mitoplasts from control CTLL-2/pJK cells (n = 9) (Fig. 3A). The channel in Kv1.3-transfected CTLL-2 cells was sensitive to TEACl and to the Kv1.3 inhibitor margatoxin (Fig. 3, B and C). The detection of this current exclusively in mitoplasts of Kv1.3-transfected CTLL-2 (Fig. 3A) and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1, B–D), but not in mitoplasts of control CTLL-2/pJK cells, indicates functional expression of Kv1.3 in mitochondria and excludes detection of another channel. To confirm unambiguously that Kv1.3 localizes to the IMM, we tested whether patches with Kv1.3 activity also contained other known mitochondrial ion channels (Fig. 4). The 107-pS channel and the permeability transition pore (PTP) were used in these studies as markers for the IMM (37.Sorgato M.C. Keller B.U. Stuhmer W. Nature. 1987; 330: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38.Zoratti, M., and Szabò, I. (1995) 1241, 139–176Google Scholar). Both channels were identified on the basis of their biophysical and pharmacological properties. The experiments revealed the simultaneous activity of Kv1.3 and the 107-pS channel in 5 patches of 15 obtained from CTLL-2/Kv1.3 (Fig. 4A) and Jurkat mitoplasts, whereas patches from CTLL-2/pJK contained the 107-pS channel but never showed any Kv1.3 activity (not shown). To determine whether PTP and Kv1.3 can be recorded in the same membrane, we increased the Ca2+ concentration on the matrix side of patches containing Kv1.3. The [Ca2+] increase results in activation of the PTP. The data revealed that 7/15 of all patches with Kv1.3 activity also contained the PTP (Fig. 4B). Co-localization of both channels was only observed in mitoplasts from CTLL-2/Kv1.3 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 4B), whereas mitoplasts from CTLL-2/pJK cells displayed PTP activity but lacked any Kv1.3. Moreover, two patches on mitoplasts from CTLL-2/Kv1.3 and Jurkat cells contained all three channels, i.e. Kv1.3, the 107-pS channel, and, after a Ca2+ increase, the PTP. The simultaneous presence of Kv1.3 and the 107-pS channel and/or the PTP in mitoplasts from CTLL/Kv1.3 or Jurkat cells demonstrated functional expression of Kv1.3 in the IMM. The mitochondrial localization of Kv1.3 was also confirmed by biochemical analysis, i.e. Western blots performed on purified mitochondria from CTLL-2/Kv1.3, CTLL-2/pJK, and Jurkat cells (Fig. 5A). However, Percoll-purified mitochondria employed for the Western blots might be contaminated by plasma membrane and/or endoplasmic reticulum containing Kv1.3. In order to exclude this possibility, CTLL-2/Kv1.3 and CTLL-2/pJK cells were transiently transfected with a vector encoding an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fused either to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of cytochrome c oxidase (Mito-EYFP) or a target sequence for the endoplasmic reticulum of calreticulin (ER-EYFP). Transfected cells were sorted by flow cytometry (FACS), and mitochondria were gradient-purified, stained with Cy3-labeled anti-Kv1.3 antibodies, and analyzed by FACS. The outer membrane was permeabilized in order to allow access of the antibody to the inner membrane. The mitochondrial population was identified as Mito-EYFP-positive and by its typical light scattering pattern. Co-staining of Mito-EYFP and Cy3-labeled anti-Kv1.3 was exclusively detected in mitochondria derived from CTLL-2/Kv1.3 (Fig. 5B) and Jurkat cells (not shown), but not in mitochondria derived from CTLL-2/pJK cells (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W1965207863,"Retinal input that is suppressed from visual awareness can nevertheless produce measurable aftereffects, revealing neural processes that do not directly result in a conscious percept. We here report that the face identity-specific aftereffect requires a visible face; it is effectively cancelled by binocular suppression or by inattentional blindness of the inducing face. Conversely, the same suppression does not interfere with the orientation-specific aftereffect. Thus, the competition between incompatible or interfering visual inputs to reach awareness is resolved before those aspects of information that are exploited in face identification are processed. We also found that the face aftereffect remained intact when the visual distracters in the inattention experiment were replaced with auditory distracters. Thus, cross-modal or cognitive interference that does not affect the visibility of the face does not interfere with the face aftereffect. We conclude that adaptation to face identity depends on seeing the face."
https://openalex.org/W2085826323,"We recently established the critical role of the lipid phosphatase activity of the PTEN tumor suppressor in stabilizing cell-cell contacts and suppressing invasiveness. To delineate the effector systems involved, we investigated the interaction of PTEN with E-cadherin junctional complexes in kidney and colonic epithelial cell lines. PTEN and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) co-immunoprecipitated with E-cadherin and catenins. By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that PTEN interacted indirectly with beta-catenin by binding the scaffolding protein MAGI-1b. This model was corroborated in various ways in mammalian cells. Ectopic expression of MAGI-1b potentiated the interaction of PTEN with junctional complexes, promoted E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell aggregation, and reverted the Src-induced invasiveness of kidney MDCKts-src cells. In this model, MAGI-1b slightly decreased the activity of AKT, a downstream effector of PI3K. By using dominant-negative and constitutively active AKT expression vectors, we demonstrated that this kinase was included in the pathways involved in Src-induced destabilization of junctional complexes and was necessary and sufficient to trigger invasiveness. We propose that the recruitment of PTEN at adherens junctions by MAGI-1b and the local down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate pools and downstream effector systems at the site of cell-cell contacts are focal points for restraining both disruption of junctional complexes and induction of tumor cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2040321992,"Mutations in proteins that induce misfolding and proteasomal degradation are common causes of inherited diseases. Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A activity in lysosomes resulting in an accumulation of glycosphingolipid globotriosylceramide (Gb3). Some classical Fabry hemizygotes and all cardiac variants have residual alpha-galactosidase A activity, but the mutant enzymes are unstable. Such mutant enzymes appear to be misfolded, recognized by the ER protein quality control, and degraded before sorting into lysosomes. Hence, correction of the trafficking defect of mutant but catalytically active enzyme into lysosomes would be beneficial for treatment of the disease. Here we show that a nontoxic competitive inhibitor (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin) of alpha-galactosidase A functions as a chemical chaperone by releasing ER-retained mutant enzyme from BiP. The treatment with subinhibitory doses resulted in efficient, long-term lysosomal trafficking of the ER-retained mutant alpha-galactosidase A. Successful clearance of lysosomal Gb3 storage and a near-normal lysosomal phenotype was achieved in human Fabry fibroblasts harboring different types of mutations. Small molecule chemical chaperones will be therapeutically useful for various lysosomal storage disorders as well as for other genetic metabolic disorders caused by mutant but nonetheless catalytically active enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2015279300,"SKD1/VPS4B is an AAA+ (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein involved in multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. In this study, we show that the impairment in MVB biogenesis caused by the ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutant SKD1(E235Q) is accompanied by assembly of a large detergent-insoluble protein complex that includes normally soluble endogenous components of mammalian endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) I and ESCRT-III complexes. Membrane-bound ESCRT-III complex has been proposed to be the substrate that recruits SKD1 to nascent MVBs. To explore this relationship, we studied interactions among the human ESCRT-III components hSnf7-1 and hVps24, membranes, and SKD1. We found that a significant portion of overexpressed hSnf7-1 associated with membranes where it formed a large protein complex that recruited SKD1 and perturbed normal MVB biogenesis. Overexpressed hVps24 also associated with membranes and perturbed endosome structure but only when fused to green fluorescent protein. Domain analysis revealed that the basic N-terminal half of hSnf7-1 localized to membranes and formed detergent-resistant polymers, some of which looked like filopodia extending into the lumen of swollen endosomes or out from the plasma membrane. The C-terminal acidic half of hSnf7-1 did not associate with membranes and was required for interaction of hSnf7-1 with SKD1. Together with earlier studies, our work suggests that a variety of ESCRT-III-containing polymers can assemble on membranes and recruit SKD1 during formation of the MVB.

Cells deliver endocytosed soluble and membrane-bound cargo to late endosomes en route to lysosomes. Newly synthesized lysosomal proteins also travel through the late endosome to reach the lysosome (1.Luzio J.P. Poupon V. Lindsay M.R. Mullock B.M. Piper R.C. Pryor P.R. Mol. Membr.

Membrane proteins internalized into the MVB include receptors destined for down-regulation (for example, stimulated growth factor receptors), lysosomal enzymes, and characteristic proteins such as the tetraspanin CD63 (3.Gruenberg J.

In certain specialized cells (particularly in the immune system) internal vesicles are released from the cell as exosomes following fusion of the endosome with plasma membrane (6.Thery C. Zitvogel L.

A network of proteins first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the class E subset of vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants (8.Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Dysfunction or deletion of these proteins in yeast leads to overgrowth of a prevacuolar endosome known as the “class E compartment” and causes proteins destined for the vacuolar interior to accumulate in the class E compartment and on the limiting membrane of the vacuole. There are at least 18 class E proteins known in yeast (4.Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 9.Shiflett S.L.

Interestingly all are soluble and cycle on and off the endosomal membrane. Studies of homologues of class E proteins in mammalian cells indicate that the function of these proteins is conserved from yeast to mammals (for reviews, see Refs. 11.Raiborg C. Rusten T.E.

Elegant studies carried out over the last few years have established that class E proteins assemble into functional complexes. These include the S. cerevisiae endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes I, II, and III (13.Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that these complexes act sequentially to select and move cargo into the lumen of the MVB, although the actual reactions that promote vesicle budding and release into the endosomal lumen have not been defined. The proposed MVB pathway begins when the Vps27-Hse1 complex binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins on the endosomal membrane (using FYVE and ubiquitin-interacting motif domains). Vps27 then recruits ESCRT-I (Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37) via interactions between it and Vps23 (17.Katzmann D.J. Stefan C.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This complex is next thought to engage the ESCRT-II complex (Vps22, Vps25, and Vps36) (14.Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Snyder W.B.

Equivalent functional complexes have been defined so far for the mammalian homologues of Vps27-Hse1 (Hrs-STAM) and ESCRT-I (Tsg101, hVps28, and hVps37) (20.Bache K.G. Brech A. Mehlum A. Stenmark H.

It is not a part of the ESCRT machinery, but interfering with its activity causes ESCRT components to accumulate in a large detergent-resistant complex on the class E compartment membrane (14.Babst M.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1893-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This suggests that Vps4 is a critical regulator of proteins in the MVB pathway. Its function depends on its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP (25.Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) with class E defects appearing both in yeast that lack Vps4 and in yeast that express ATP hydrolysis-deficient Vps4 mutants (23.Babst M.

Genet. 1997; 31: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mammalian homologues of Vps4, VPS4A and SKD1 (suppressor of K+ transport growth defect 1, also known as VPS4B), appear to play a comparable role to their yeast counterpart in regulating MVB biogenesis. Expressing ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutants of either isoform in cultured cells causes the mammalian equivalent of the class E phenotype: vacuolation of endosomes and impairment of late endosomal trafficking (28.Yoshimori T.

We will use VPS4 to refer generally to mammalian isoforms and VPS4A or SKD1 to refer to a specific one. Interestingly expressing ATP hydrolysis-deficient VPS4 also blocks budding of enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, suggesting that the machinery for generating vesicles inside the MVB is generally involved in budding and fission of vesicles leaving the cytosol (32.Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I.

How VPS4 and other class E proteins cooperate with each other and cargo proteins to promote this budding and fission, however, is far from clear. Based on what is known about other AAA+ ATPases (34.Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that VPS4 disassembles a stable protein complex of membrane-bound ESCRT proteins. While all class E proteins are candidate substrates, it seems unlikely that VPS4 acts directly on so many structurally diverse proteins. Instead VPS4 may modify one or a few components that hold the ESCRT machinery together. Several observations suggest that components of the ESCRT-III complex are the most likely substrates for VPS4. In yeast, inactive Vps4 fails to bind membranes in cells that lack subunits of the ESCRT-III complex (including Vps2 and Vps24) (15.Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Comprehensive yeast two-hybrid studies of interactions among all of the class E proteins in both yeast and mammalian systems revealed interactions between Vps4 and individual components of the ESCRT-III complex or structurally related coiled-coil-containing proteins, while no interactions were detected between Vps4 and other class E proteins (33.von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M.

To further define the nature of interactions between mammalian ESCRT-III proteins and VPS4 and to more generally gain insight into the role of these proteins in formation of the MVB, we characterized human homologues of two ESCRT-III components, hSnf7-1 and hVps24, and their interactions with the VPS4 isoform SKD1. We found that many of the properties attributed to a heteropolymeric ESCRT-III complex in yeast (membrane binding, polymer assembly, and interaction with VPS4) could be recapitulated in mammalian cells by simple overexpression of hSnf7-1. Domain analysis allowed us to assign membrane binding and polymerization to the N-terminal basic half of the protein and interaction with SKD1 to the acidic C-terminal half. We propose that the properties and interactions of hSnf7-1 shed light on the likely organization of ESCRT-III polymers in the MVB pathway. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—To express SKD1 in Escherichia coli, mouse SKD1 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Carol Vandenberg (University of California)) was inserted into pHO4d (41.Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) between NcoI and EcoRI sites with amino acids PNSG between the C terminus of SKD1 and the His6-Myc tag. The E235Q mutation was generated by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). To express SKD1 wild type or E235Q in mammalian cells, the corresponding cDNA was inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) between XhoI and BamHI sites. The resulting proteins have amino acids ADPPVAT between SKD1 and EGFP. To create tetracycline-regulated constructs, the entire SKD1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion was amplified and inserted into pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) using BamHI and XhoI sites. To clone human homologues of Snf7 and Vps24, we amplified proteins identified in a data base search from human melanoma cDNA (a gift from Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms, Washington University). hVps24 was amplified using primers complementary to neuroendocrine differentiation factor (GenBank™ accession number AF219226), while human Snf7 was amplified with primers complementary to HSPC134 (GenBank™ accession number AF161483). Our Snf7 clone differed by three amino acids from HSPC134 and is identical to the more recently described hSnf7-1 (GenBank™ accession number AAQ91193). DNA fragments were inserted into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, GST tag) and pET28a (Novagen (Madison, WI), His6 and T7 tags) using BamHI and XhoI sites for expression in E. coli. For expression in mammalian cells, hSnf7-1 and hVps24 were inserted into three vectors. Untagged constructs were generated by cloning into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) between BamHI and XhoI sites. Myc-tagged constructs were generated by cloning into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(–)A (Invitrogen) between XbaI and HindIII sites with a linker of KLGP between hSnf7-1/hVps24 and the Myc epitope. GFP-tagged constructs were created by cloning into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) between NheI and HindIII sites with a linker of KLRILQSTVPRARDPPVAT between hSnf7-1 or hVps24 and EGFP. To generate hSnf7-1 fragments, DNA corresponding to amino acids 1–222 (hSnf7 full length (FL)), 1–116 (hSnf7-N), or 117–222 (hSnf7-C) was amplified and inserted into pGEX4T-1 and pET28a between BamHI and XhoI sites for expression in E. coli and into FLAG-pcDNA3.1(+) (a gift from Dr. Kenneth Johnson, Washington University) between BamHI and XhoI sites for expression in mammalian cells. The cloning resulted in a linker of GS between the N-terminal FLAG epitope and the hSnf7-1 protein. Sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing using ABI big dye reagents at the Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory (Washington University). Protein Expression and Purification—SKD1 was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli grown at 30 °C. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, lysed by sonication in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 5% glycerol and centrifuged at 20,000 × g. Supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen), and bound SKD1 was eluted in buffer containing 160 mm imidazole. It was further purified over a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm ATP. His6-hSnf7-1 (full length, N, and C) was expressed in BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) E. coli grown at room temperature. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. His6-hSnf7-1 N and C fragments were purified using Ni2+-NTA resin as above. C fragment was further purified over a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). To purify full-length His6-hSnf7-1, the pellet obtained after centrifuging lysed bacteria was resuspended and sonicated in buffer containing 1.5% sarkosyl. Homogenate was then treated with 3.5% Triton X-100 and recentrifuged, and His6-hSnf7-1 was purified using Ni2+-NTA resin as above. GST-hSnf7-1 (full-length and C) and GST-hVps24 were purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Peak protein fractions were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad). RNA Blot Hybridization—DNA encoding hVps24 or hSnf7-1 was excised from pGEX4T-1 constructs with BamHI and XhoI for use as a hybridization probe. DNA fragments were labeled by random priming (RediPrime™ II kit (Amersham Biosciences)) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Human multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were hybridized with these probes in ExpressHyb solution at 68 °C for 1 h according to the manufacturer's recommendations and visualized by autoradiography. Cell Culture and Transfection—T-REx™ HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) expressing tetracycline repressor were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine, and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. All cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed 18–24 h following transfection. Tetracycline-inducible SKD1 stable cell lines were generated essentially as described previously (42.Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in T-REx HEK293 medium containing 125 μg/ml Zeocin. To induce protein expression, tetracycline (0.5 μg/ml) was added for the indicated length of time. If not otherwise specified, standard conditions for inducing SKD1 expression were 4–5 h of tetracycline. Antibodies—Anti-SKD1, anti-hSnf7-1, and anti-hVps24 antibodies were raised in rabbits (RW2, R7119, and R7122 (Bethyl Laboratory Inc.)) using recombinant SKD1-His6, GST-hSnf7-1, and His6-hVps24 purified from E. coli as antigens. All were affinity-purified using antigen immobilized on nitrocellulose strips. Mouse anti-CD63 and anti-LAMP-2 were from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa); rabbit and mouse (M2) anti-FLAG were from Sigma; mouse anti-ubiquitin FK2 specific for ubiquitin-conjugated proteins was from Affiniti Research Products (Exeter, UK); mouse anti-EEA1 was from BD Transduction Laboratories; rabbit anti-giantin was from Covance (Berkeley, CA); mouse anti-β-COP was fromSigma; mouse anti-Myc was generated using the 9E10 hybridoma cell line (43.Evan G.I.

Immunostaining and Microscopy—For imaging, cells were plated onto plain (COS-7 cells) or collagen-coated (HEK293 T-REx cells) glass coverslips. Cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 15 mm phosphate, pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. GFP fusion proteins were imaged directly. For antibody staining, fixed cells were permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% goat serum, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. Cells were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope coupled to a Radiance plus confocal laser system (Bio-Rad) with 488 and 543 nm laser lines. Images were merged and assembled using MetaMorph® Imaging System 6 (Universal Imaging Corp.) and Adobe Photoshop 7 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).

https://openalex.org/W2172077061,"The non-pathogenic, non-glycopeptide-producing actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor carries a cluster of seven genes (vanSRJKHAX) that confers inducible, high level resistance to vancomycin. The vanK gene has no counterpart in previously characterized vancomycin resistance clusters, yet vanK is required for vancomycin resistance in S. coelicolor. VanK belongs to the Fem family of enzymes, which add the branch amino acid(s) to the stem pentapeptide of peptidoglycan precursors. Upon exposure to vancomycin, the VanRS two-component system switches on expression of all seven van genes, and the VanHAX enzymes reprogram the cell wall such that precursors terminate d-Ala-d-lactate (Lac) rather than d-Ala-d-Ala, thus conferring resistance to vancomycin, which only binds d-Ala-d-Ala-containing precursors. Here we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that VanK is required for vancomycin resistance because the constitutively expressed FemX enzyme, encoded elsewhere on the chromosome, cannot recognize d-Lac-containing precursors as a substrate, whereas VanK can. Consistent with this view, d-Lac-containing precursors carrying the Gly branch are present in the wild type transiently exposed to vancomycin but are undetectable in a vanK mutant treated in the same way. Further, femX null mutants are viable in the presence of vancomycin but die in its absence. Because only VanK can recognize d-Lac-containing precursors, vancomycin-induced expression of VanHAX in a vanK mutant is lethal, and so vanK is required for vancomycin resistance.

The spread of vancomycin resistance among pathogenic bacteria is an important public health concern. Ever since vancomycin-resistant strains of pathogenic Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (VRE) first emerged in the late 1980s, the intergeneric transfer of vancomycin resistance from these strains to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a major killer in hospital-acquired infections, has been widely anticipated. This recently became a reality with the first reports of clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) 1The abbreviations used are: VRSA, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus; Lac, lactate; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-ethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: VRSA, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus; Lac, lactate; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-ethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. from hospitals in the United States (1.Pearson H.

They bind the d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) terminus of lipid-attached peptidoglycan precursors on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane (5.Barna J.C.J. Williams D.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 6.Williams D.H. Williamson M.P. Butcher D.W. Hammond S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 1332-1339Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and this interaction blocks the formation of mature peptidoglycan, principally by denying transpeptidase access to its substrate, thus preventing formation of the peptide cross-links between polysaccharide strands that give the cell wall its structural rigidity. Because of the distinctive mode of action of vancomycin, mutations in transpeptidase cannot give rise to drug resistance. For this reason, it was originally suggested that pathogens might never acquire resistance to vancomycin because it would require them to remodel the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway itself. In the late 1980s, however, the first clinical isolates of VRE appeared and were found to reprogram cell wall biosynthesis such that the pendant pentapeptide of peptidoglycan precursors terminated in d-alanyl-d-lactate (d-Ala-d-Lac), rather than in d-Ala-d-Ala (7.Bugg T.D.H.

The affinity of vancomycin for precursors terminating in d-Ala-d-Lac is ∼1000-fold lower than for precursors terminating d-Ala-d-Ala (7.Bugg T.D.H. Wright G.D. Dutka-Malen S. Arthur M. Courvalin P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10408-10415Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), rendering the modified bacteria resistant. This remodeling of cell wall precursors requires three enzymes: VanH, which converts pyruvate into d-lactate; VanA, a d-Ala-d-Lac ligase; and VanX, a d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptidase that cleaves any residual circulating d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide, ensuring that peptidoglycan precursors terminate uniformly in d-Ala-d-Lac.We have shown previously that the non-pathogen Streptomyces coelicolor carries a gene cluster conferring inducible, high-level resistance to vancomycin (13.Hong H.-J. Hutchings M.I. Neu J.M. Wright G.D. Paget M.S.B. Buttner M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). S. coelicolor is the model species of a genus of Gram-positive, mycelial soil bacteria responsible for the production of two-thirds of the commercially important antibiotics. S. coelicolor itself does not make a glycopeptide, but all of the known glycopeptide antibiotics are produced by actinomycetes, the family to which the streptomycetes belong. Because most non-pathogenic actinomycetes live in the soil, it seems likely that S. coelicolor encounters glycopeptide producers and that the van gene cluster therefore confers a selective advantage. Further, it is widely believed that all glycopeptide resistance genes are ultimately derived from actinomycete glycopeptide producers (14.Davies J. Science. 1994; 264: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), which must carry these genes to avoid autotoxicity. Consistent with this idea, the S. coelicolor resistance genes are clearly associated with a laterally acquired DNA element. 2H.-J. Hong, unpublished results.2H.-J. Hong, unpublished results.The S. coelicolor cluster consists of seven genes, vanSRJKHAX (Fig. 1) (13.Hong H.-J. Hutchings M.I. Neu J.M. Wright G.D. Paget M.S.B. Buttner M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). vanHAX are orthologous to the genes found in VRE strains. vanR and vanS encode a two-component signal transduction system that mediates transcriptional induction of the seven van genes in response to extracellular vancomycin. vanJ and vanK are particularly interesting because they are novel genes with no counterpart in previously characterized vancomycin-resistance clusters from pathogens. vanJ, which encodes a predicted membrane protein, is not required for vancomycin resistance, but vanK was found to be essential for vancomycin resistance (13.Hong H.-J. Hutchings M.I. Neu J.M. Wright G.D. Paget M.S.B. Buttner M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).VanK is a member of the Fem family of enzymes, which are non-ribosomal peptidyltransferases that add the branch amino acid(s) to the stem pentapeptide of peptidoglycan precursors. For example, S. aureus has a pentaglycine branch and three Fem proteins, FemA, -B, and -X, are involved in its synthesis (15.Hegde S.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22861-22867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16.Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that femX (also called fmhB) is an essential gene in S. aureus and that controlled depletion of its expression results in the disappearance of glycine-substituted peptidoglycan precursors. In contrast, femA, femB, and femAB mutants are viable; disruption of femB leads to shortening of the staphylococcal branch from five to three glycines, whereas loss of femA or femAB reduces the branch to a single glycine. From these results it was deduced that FemX adds the first glycine, FemA adds the second and third, and FemB adds the fourth and fifth (17.Rohrer S. Berger-Bächi B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19.Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Tschierske M. Labischinski H. Berger-Bächi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This has now been demonstrated in a purified in vitro system, and staphylococcal FemX has been shown to use lipid II exclusively as acceptor for the first glycine (18.Schneider T. Senn M.M. Berger-Bachi B. Tossi A. Sahl H.G. Wiedemann I. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Streptomyces the branch is a single glycine (23.Leyh-Bouille M. Bonaly R. Ghuysen J.-M. Tinelli R. Tipper D. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2944-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24.Ruzin A. Severin A. Ritacco F. Tabei K. Singh G. Bradford P.A. Siegel M.M. Projan S.J. Shlaes D.M. J.

Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet S. coelicolor has three fem genes: vanK, SCO3904 (here designated femX), and SCO0602 (here designated femY).The importance of the peptidoglycan remodeling enzymes VanHAX and the VanRS two-component signal transduction system was expected. However, the discovery that VanK was essential for resistance in S. coelicolor was surprising given the absence of vanK homologues in the vancomycin-resistance clusters of pathogens. Because VanK is a member of the Fem family of proteins, we proposed two alternative hypotheses to explain why vanK is required for vancomycin resistance (13.Hong H.-J. Hutchings M.I. Neu J.M. Wright G.D. Paget M.S.B. Buttner M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One was that S. coelicolor needs to change the nature of the peptidoglycan precursor branch to attain resistance. Changes in the sequence of the branch have been shown to result in increased levels of glycopeptide resistance in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (26.Billot-Klein D. Gutmann L. Bryant D. Bell D. Van Heijenoort J. Grewal J. Shlaes D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4696-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis was that the constitutive FemX activity of S. coelicolor can recognize only precursors that terminate d-Ala-d-Ala as a substrate, and VanK might therefore be required for vancomycin resistance because it is the only enzyme that can add the Gly branch to precursors terminating d-Ala-d-Lac (production of precursors lacking a branch is lethal in many bacteria because it prevents cross-linking of the peptidoglycan by transpeptidase, leading to cell lysis). Here we describe experiments that establish the second explanation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, Oligonucleotides, and Growth Conditions—Strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used are described in Table I. For cell wall precursor analysis, S. coelicolor spores were germinated by heat-shock treatment in 5 ml of TES buffer (0.05 m, pH 8) at 50 °C for 10 min and then diluted with an equal volume of double-strength germination medium (1% (w/v) Difco yeast extract, 1% (w/v) Difco casaminoacids, 0.01 m CaCl2) and incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 2–3 h (27.Kieser T.

For the preparation of vancomycin-induced peptidoglycan precursors, cultures were grown to midlog phase in NMMP and then exposed to vancomycin (50 μg/ml) for 3–4 h before harvesting. Other media and culture conditions for bacterial growth were as described previously (13.Hong H.-J. Hutchings M.I. Neu J.M. Wright G.D. Paget M.S.B. Buttner M.J. Mol.

In the case of femY, apramycin-resistant (AprR), kanamycin-sensitive (KanS) exconjugants were identified and purified; the disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis, and a representative femY mutant was designated J3131 (Table I). In the case of femX, despite extensive screening, no AprR KanS colonies were detected on medium containing apramycin alone, suggesting that disruption of SCO3904 under these conditions was lethal. However, when spores isolated from AprR KanR colonies were restreaked on medium containing vancomycin in addition to apramycin, AprR KanS colonies were readily detected, and the successful disruption of femX was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting. A representative femX mutant was designated J3130 (Table I). The vanK in-frame deletion mutant J3230 was derived from the ΔvanK::apr strain J3221 by the method of Gust et al. (29.Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar).Constitutive Expression of vanK in the femX Mutant—To drive constitutive expression of vanK, the gene was cloned under the control of the ermEp* promoter (33.Bibb M.J. White J. Ward J.M. Janssen G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A 330-bp KpnI-PstI fragment carrying ermEp*, a ribosome binding site and a multicloning site, was isolated from pIJ8723, 3M. J. Butler, personal communication. and cloned into pMS81 (34.Gregory M.A. Till R. Smith M.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5320-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) cut with KpnI-NsiI to create pIJ10257. vanK was amplified by PCR incorporating NdeI and BglII sites upstream and downstream, respectively, of the gene and cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega) to create pIJ10250. vanK was isolated from pIJ10250 as a 1.2-kb NdeI-SalI fragment and inserted into pIJ10257 digested with NdeI-XhoI to create pIJ10267. pIJ10267 was introduced into the femX mutant J3130 by conjugal transfer from E. coli strain ET12567 (pUZ8002), and exconjugants were selected with hygromycin.Liquid Chromatography-MS Analysis of Peptidoglycan Precursors— Cytoplasmic UDP-linked peptidoglycan precursors were extracted using a modification of the method of Ruzin et al. (24.Ruzin A. Severin A. Ritacco F. Tabei K. Singh G. Bradford P.A. Siegel M.M. Projan S.J. Shlaes D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2141-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mycelium was harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed in 0.9% NaCl. The centrifuged mycelial pellet was extracted with 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C, and the extract was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10 Columns, Amersham Biosciences). The desalted extract was concentrated by rotary evaporation and resuspended in a small volume of HPLC-grade deionized water. Precursors were separated by reverse-phase chromatography on a 100 × 2 mm 3 μ Luna C18 (2.Chang S. Sievert D.M. Hageman J.C. Boulton M.L. Tenover F.C. Downes F.P. Shah S. Rudrik J.T. Pupp G.R.

Therefore precursors with and without the side chain were detected by trapping ions of masses 1194.1, 1195.1, 1251.1, and 1252.1 (isolation width 4 atomic mass units) at appropriate retention times, and observing the major fragment, a loss of 404 atomic mass units (collision energy 35%). Because isotopic standards were not available, we carried out mixing experiments in which samples known to contain particular precursors were mixed prior to analysis with those that apparently did not. If the apparent absence of a precursor had been an artifact caused by the suppression of its ion by another metabolite, mixtures would also have shown a reduced signal. In fact, the mixtures gave signals within 15% of that expected, indicating that this method, which is highly specific, is also sufficient for the approximate relative quantification of the four targeted precursors.RESULTSThe Stem Peptide Branch Does Not Change in Response to Vancomycin—To test the effect of vancomycin on the stem peptide branch, peptidoglycan was isolated from S. coelicolor grown in the presence or absence of vancomycin, and the 25 most abundant muropeptides derived from each of these two samples were separated by HPLC and characterized by mass spectrometry. The branch associated with each muropepetide was a single glycine in all cases, both before and after exposure to vancomycin. 4H.-J. Hong, A. Severin, K. Tabei, and M. J. Buttner, unpublished data. Therefore VanK does not change the stem peptide branch.Precursor Analysis Suggests that VanK Is Required to Add the Gly Branch to Stem Peptides Terminating d-Ala-d-Lac— Because the ΔvanK mutant is sensitive to vancomycin, it was not possible to examine the effect of vancomycin induction on its cell wall structure. However, because cytoplasmic cell wall precursor pools change rapidly in response to vancomycin (35.Severin A. Tabei K. Tenover F. Chung M. Clarke N. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3398-3407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it was possible to examine the effect of vancomycin induction on these precursor pools in the ΔvanK mutant.Wild-type S. coelicolor and the congenic ΔvanK mutant were grown to mid-log phase in NMMP medium (27.Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). For the preparation of vancomycin-induced peptidoglycan precursors, cultures were then exposed to vancomycin (50 μg/ml) for 3–4 h before harvesting. Peptidoglycan precursors were extracted, separated by HPLC, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). The structures of the four relevant molecules are given in Fig. 3. As expected, in the absence of vancomycin, when the van genes were not expressed, no significant differences were seen between the wild-type and the ΔvanK mutant (Fig. 2A). Under the conditions used, precursors with and without the glycine branch co-eluted. Thus, peak 1, with a retention time of 13.5 min, contained two molecules: a 1194-Da species that matched the predicted mass of Molecule I, and a second species of 1251 Da that matched the predicted mass of Molecule III (Figs. 2 and 3). The identity of Molecule I was confirmed by its MS/MS fragmentation pattern (Fig. 4).Fig. 2HPLC separation of cytoplasmic peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors isolated from wild-type S. coelicolor M600 and a congenic ΔvanK mutant with (B) or without (A) exposure to vancomycin.

https://openalex.org/W1992117451,"The protein known as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth by integrating different stimuli, such as available nutrients and mitogenic factors. The lipid messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) binds and positively regulates the mitogenic response of mTOR. PA generator enzymes are consequently potential regulators of mTOR. Here we explored the contribution to this pathway of the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), which produces PA through phosphorylation of diacylglycerol. We found that overexpression of the DGKζ, but not of the α isoform, in serum-deprived HEK293 cells induced mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase (p70S6K). After serum addition, p70S6K phosphorylation was higher and more resistant to rapamycin treatment in cells overexpressing DGKζ. The effect of this DGK isoform on p70S6K hyperphosphorylation required the mTOR PA binding region. Down-regulation of endogenous DGKζ by small interfering RNA in HEK293 cells diminished serum-induced p70S6K phosphorylation, highlighting the role of this isoform in the mTOR pathway. Our results confirm a role for PA in mTOR regulation and describe a novel pathway in which DGKζ-derived PA acts as a mediator of mTOR signaling.

These enzymes contain at least two N-terminal cysteine-rich domains and a conserved catalytic domain. The DGKs have additional functional domains that were used to classify them into five subgroups (I-V; for an extended review, see Refs. 1van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 2Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Their structural diversity, as well as their distinct tissue expression and specific intracellular localization, may confer on each DGK isoform the ability to regulate distinct DAG and PA pools and thus to participate in different signaling complexes. DAG is a second messenger whose levels increase transiently in response to hormones and growth factors. DAG is an allosteric activator of protein kinase C (PKC) (3Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) as well as non-kinase proteins such as GTPase-activating proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Ras family of GTPases (4Springett G.M. Kawasaki H. Spriggs D.R. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 730-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Brose N. Betz A. Wemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Termination of the DAG-derived signal must be rapid and requires DGK activity. DGKα and ζ are the best-studied isoforms; both function as DAG signaling terminators during T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. Class I DGKα has two Ca2+ binding motifs (1van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and is expressed in spleen, thymus, skeletal muscle, lung, testis, and peripheral T cells (6Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). During TCR-induced T-cell activation, the enzyme translocates to the plasma membrane, where it down-regulates DAG levels and thus diminishes Ras protein activation (6Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DGKα membrane translocation is rapid and transient and requires both tyrosine kinase activity and an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. This isoform also diminishes the response elicited by an ectopically expressed muscarinic type I receptor (7Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). DGKζ belongs to class IV and has nearly ubiquitous expression. It has a PDZ binding motif, four ankyrin repeats, and a myristoylated alanine-rich PKC substrate (MARCKS) homology domain, which overlaps with a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (8Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 9Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Like the α isoform, DGKζ acts as a negative regulator of TCR signaling; its overexpression thus attenuates activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in both T lymphocytes after TCR binding (10Zhong X.

DGKζ-deficient T cells are hyper-responsive to TCR stimulation; accordingly, mice lacking the enzyme have a more robust immune response than wild-type mice (12Zhong X.P. Hainey E.A.

DGKζ membrane translocation is a sustained event that requires phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain by PKC (13Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and dissociation from the cytoskeleton induced by phosphorylation of the C-terminal region (14Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The DGK reaction is unique because it uses one messenger to create another. PA modulates the activity of a variety of enzymes such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (2Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K.

Immunology. 2002; 105: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DGK-derived PA is also essential for the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor HIF-1α during onset of the hypoxic response (26Aragonés J. Jones D.R. Martín S.

Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 30Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the complex formed by the immunophilin FKBP12 and the drug rapamycin induces mTOR inhibition by competing with PA to bind the FRB region (22Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which PA regulates mTOR activity has not yet been clarified, but PA might either recruit downstream effectors or remove a negative regulator (31Chen J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 245-257PubMed Google Scholar). mTOR plays a major role in regulating cell growth through the control of protein synthesis. In response to amino acids and growth factors, mTOR phosphorylates two translational regulatory proteins: eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) and the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K). Through activation of S6, S6K enhances translation of mRNA with repressive 5′-TOP tracts; many of these mRNA encode components of the translational machinery (32Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are two homologous S6K proteins, S6K1 and S6K2. S6K1 consists of the p70S6K and p85S6K isoforms; the former is localized mainly in cytoplasm, whereas the latter is found in the nucleus due to the presence of an NLS. These isoforms are generated by use of different translational start codons of the same messenger; their sequences are thus identical, with the exception of a short region in the N terminus (33Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonemberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 39. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-717Google Scholar). S6K2 comprises two isoforms; both also have an NLS and are therefore nuclear enzymes (32Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 34Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). p70S6K is the best-studied S6K; it is activated through a coordinated sequence of phosphorylations that begins at the auto-inhibitory region in the kinase C-terminal domain. The p70S6K hydrophobic domain is then phosphorylated, leading to phosphorylation of the T-loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK) 1 (35Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). mTOR is proposed to phosphorylate the auto-inhibitory and the hydrophobic motif of p70S6K (36Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Here we explored the role of DGK in the mTOR pathway. We determined DGK activity during mitogenic stimulation or hypoxic treatment in vitro and observed that this activity was down-regulated in serum-starved cells and increased after serum stimulation or hypoxia. Moreover, DGKζ overexpression induced dose-dependent phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of p70S6K, an effect that requires the PA binding motif of mTOR. Our results suggest the existence of a pathway in which DGK-derived PA can modulate mTOR activity. Cell Culture and Transfection—The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (37 °C, 5% CO2). For transfection, cells were plated in 6-well plates. When cells reached 40–50% confluence (24 h), transfection was carried out using the Jet-PEI reagent (PolyTransfection) with the following amounts of DNA: 0.2 μg of EE-p70S6K, 1.5 μg of pEF-Bos-GFP or pEF-Bos-GFP-DGKζ-CT, 0.5–1.5 μg of pEF-Bos-GFP-DGKζ or pEF-Bos-HA-DGKα, and 0.8 μg of the mTOR constructs. The following day, the still actively growing cells were serum-starved (20 h) and then stimulated with 20% fetal bovine serum for 30 min before cell lysis. Where indicated, rapamycin (1–20 nm; Calbiochem) or R5949 (30 μm, Calbiochem) was added to medium 30 min before stimulation. Jurkat cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Plasmid Constructs—The DGK constructs used have been described previously. The different versions of rat DGKζ were cloned in the pEF-Bos vector as GFP C chimeras (13Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R.

FLAG-tagged wild-type mTOR and mutant mTOR (3ATOR) encoding plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. J. Chen (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL) (22Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Western Blot—Serum-starved and stimulated HEK293 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in p70 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate) by incubation for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were quantified and separated by SDS-PAGE using high resolution acrylamide mix and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The phosphorylation state of p70S6K and expression of the different constructs were evaluated using the appropriate antibody and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, values corresponding to the phospho-Thr389 bands were quantified by analysis of the films with the ImageJ Program, and the values were normalized against that of the corresponding p70S6K bands (pThr389/p70 ratio). Relative phosphorylation ratio was normalized to that obtained in either quiescent or serum-stimulated control cells as indicated. Antibodies employed were anti-HA (Covance); mouse polyclonal anti-tubulin; mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP; rabbit phospho-antibodies against the pan-PKC site, the pan-PDK1 site, and Thr389 and Ser421/Thr424 of p70S6K (Cell Signaling); mouse monoclonal anti-histones (Chemicon); mouse anti-human transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); and mouse anti-Cdk2 and anti-p70S6K (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse monoclonal antibody mixture against DGKα was kindly provided by Dr. W. J. van Blitterswijk (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) (40Schaap D. van der Wal J. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L. Ploegh H.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-DGKζ antibody was a generous gift of Dr. M. K. Topham (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT) (14Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol Kinase Activity Assays—HEK293 cells were washed twice and scraped with cold PBS. Cells were centrifuged (3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was frozen, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), sonicated, and centrifuged (800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was assayed for total protein quantification. An aliquot of each sample was reserved to evaluate DGKζ expression levels by Western blot. A sample of 25 μg of each lysate was mixed with 5 μl of DAG-octyl-glucoside micelles and 10 μl of kinase mix (10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and [γ-32P]ATP). The phosphorylation reaction was incubated (10 min, room temperature). Radiolabeled lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), dried under a nitrogen stream, dissolved in 20 μlof chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and analyzed by TLC using a chloroform/methanol/4 m ammonia (9:7:2, v/v/v) system with DiC18PA as control. The TLC was exposed for 3 h or overnight to detect overexpressed or endogenous DGKζ activity, respectively. Fractionation Analysis—Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described previously (14Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, the HEK293 cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate), and cells were lysed by passage 30 times through a 30-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The pellet corresponded to the crude nuclear fraction. Supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C); the supernatant corresponded to the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet was resuspended thoroughly in 1% Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer to extract membrane-associated proteins. This suspension was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant corresponded to the membrane fraction. The pellet corresponding to the cytoskeletal fraction was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The purity of the fractions was assessed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against vimentin, human transferrin receptor, histones, and Cdk2 as cytoskeletal, membrane, nuclear, and nuclear/cytosolic markers, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—The day before transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. After serum stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% formaldehyde, washed three times with 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and permeabilized for 10 min with PBS and 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS, blocked with PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin, and washed three times with PBS. Rabbit anti-DGKζ or mouse anti-HA primary antibodies and appropriate Cy3-conjugated goat anti-IgG were used to stain overexpressed DGK. Preparations were examined by confocal microscopy (TCS-NT; Leica). Small Interfering RNA—The 21-nucleotide sequence for human DGKζ (nucleotides 2290–2310) was selected as the target sequence. A BLAST search showed no significant similarity to any other sequence in the database. siRNA was synthesized chemically (Ambion), and transfection was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with 100 nm siRNA. The next day, cells were divided and plated into fresh medium. Two days later, cells were starved for 24 h and then serum-stimulated. A mock siRNA transfection was performed simultaneously using GFP (nucleotides 238–268) as a target. DGKζ Activity Increased in Response to Mitogenic Stimuli and Hypoxia—We predicted that the dual action of DGK might be integrated in mTOR activity. Mitogenic agents produce DAG, which is used by DGK, thus diminishing the mitogenic stimulation of mTOR, whereas conversion of DAG to PA positively stimulates mTOR. As stated above, DGKα and ζ are the best-studied isoforms. DGKα is proposed to participate in attenuation of the TCR response and IL-2-dependent T-cell proliferation (6Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B.

Nichols K.E. Shen H. Koretzky G.A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We explored the role of these two isoforms in mTOR regulation using HEK293 cells, a cell line widely used to dissect the mTOR pathway. DGKα is highly expressed in T cells and has limited tissue distribution (1van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), whereas DGKζ displays a broad expression pattern (9Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In accordance with this observation, analysis of total extracts of HEK293 cells by immunoblot showed no DGKα expression, whereas Jurkat T cells showed high DGKα levels (Fig. 1A, top panel). In HEK293 cells and the Jurkat T cell-line, anti-DGKζ antibody revealed high protein expression (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). In addition, this antibody recognized a nonspecific band of ∼130 kDa. We evaluated endogenous DGK activity in HEK293 cells under two conditions known to modify PA levels and mTOR activity, addition of a hypoxia mimetic agent (CoCl2) and serum addition. DGK activity was measured using micelles formed with the detergent octylglucoside (41Ballou L.M. Jiang Y.P. Du G. Frohman M.A. Lin R.Z. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Activity diminished after serum deprivation and increased after serum addition to cells, and it was also elevated in response to CoCl2 addition (Fig. 1B, left panel). Cells were then transfected with a construct encoding a chimeric GFP-DGKζ protein, and activity was assayed under the same conditions. The transfected DGK activity pattern was similar to that of the endogenous enzyme; DGKζ activity was down-regulated after starvation and increased after serum addition or during hypoxia-mimetic conditions (Fig. 1B, right panels). Serum Stimulation Induced Phosphorylation of DGKζ MARCKS and C-terminal Domains—The previous experiments showed that DGKζ activity is serum-regulated; we therefore tested whether the enzyme was phosphorylated in response to serum addition. Reports from our group showed that in T lymphocytes, the DGKζ C-terminal domain has a restrictive role in membrane translocation (13Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This region contains a MAPK consensus phosphorylation site (Fig. 2A) that is phosphorylated by ERK overexpression (14Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We used an antibody raised against the p70S6K Ser421/Thr424, a region that constitutes a canonical MAPK phosphorylation motif, to study MAPK-mediated, serum-dependent phosphorylation of DGKζ. This antibody recognized GFP-DGKζ in a serum-dependent manner (Fig. 2B), but failed to recognize a DGKζ mutant in which the C-terminal region had been deleted, confirming that the serum-dependent phosphorylation takes place at the C-terminal end of the protein (Fig. 2B). DGKζ also contains a MARCKS domain with a canonical PKC-dependent phosphorylation site (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation at this site is required for plasma membrane translocation in T lymphocytes (13Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and prevents nuclear localization in COS cells (8Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We used a pan-PKC phosphorylation site antibody to detect serum-dependent DGKζ phosphorylation, but no phosphorylation was observed in total cell lysates (data not shown). We tested whether DGKζ phosphorylation correlated with a specific subcellular localization. Analysis of different subcellular fractions showed that the main phosphorylation at the C-terminal end corresponded to cytosolic GFP-DGKζ, whereas cytoskeletal and membrane fractions showed a lesser degree of phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, middle panel). These data concur with observations in muscle cells, in which this motif appears to negatively regulate DGKζ association with the cytoskeleton (14Abramovici H. Hogan A.B. Obagi C. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As for PKC-dependent phosphorylation, the antibody detected GFP-DGKζ only in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). These experiments suggest that the DGKζ pool recovered in the cytosolic fraction is phosphorylated at both the PKC and MAPK motifs after serum addition. DGKζ Overexpression Increased p70S6K Phosphorylation in the Hydrophobic Motif—Serum addition, which is known to stimulate mTOR, also modulated DGKζ; we thus studied the effect of DGKζ overexpression on mTOR activity by examining mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Thr389 in p70S6K transfected into quiescent or serum-stimulated cells.

However, the classical System IMINO, defined as the Na+-dependent proline transport activity that escapes inhibition by alanine, had not been identified at the molecular level. We report here the functional characteristics and tissue distribution of Sodium/Imino-acid Transporter 1 (SIT1), which exhibits the properties of classical System IMINO. SIT1, the product of the slc6a20 gene, is a member of the SLC6 Na+- and Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family whose function has remained unknown. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, rat SIT1 mediated the uptake of imino acids such as proline (K0.5 ∼ 0.2 mm) and pipecolate, as well as N-methylated amino acids (e.g. MeAIB, sarcosine). SIT1-mediated proline transport was pH-independent and insensitive to inhibition by alanine or lysine. Proline transport was Na+-dependent, Cl–-stimulated, and voltage-dependent. Li+, but not H+, could substitute for Na+. Human SIT1 also functioned as a Na+-dependent proline transporter. Rat SIT1 mRNA was expressed in epithelial cells of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, stomach, cecum, colon, and kidney proximal tubule S 3 segments. SIT1 mRNA was also expressed in the choroid plexus, microglia, and meninges of the brain and in the ovary. Previous reports have documented the marked urinary hyperexcretion of proline in newborn rodents and man. We found that SIT1 was dramatically up-regulated in the kidneys of 3-day-old mice, accounting for the maturation of proline reabsorption in the mouse. The human slc6a20 gene coding SIT1 is an appropriate target for investigation of hereditary forms of iminoaciduria in man.

The classically described System IMINO mediates the Na+-dependent transport of imino acids such as proline and pipecolate in a variety of intact tissue and membrane vesicle preparations, including intestine, choroid plexus, and kidney (1Ross H.J.

System IMINO does not accept cationic amino acids or non-α-amino acids. System IMINO is moderately stereospecific for l-proline and reacts with neutral amino acids at lower affinities than with their N-methylated derivatives (2Stevens B.R. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

Some features (substrate specificity and chloride dependence) show species differences (6Munck L.K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1997; 118: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). System IMINO has not thus far been identified at the molecular level. Meanwhile, the proton-coupled amino acid transporter (PAT1) 1The abbreviations used are: PAT1, proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (SLC36A1); ChoCl, choline chloride; DIG, digoxigenin; RT-PCR, real-time-PCR; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MeAIB, N-methylaminoisobutyrate; SIT1, sodium/imino acid transporter 1 (SLC6A20).

In man, defects in the intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of amino acids are known to underlie a number of inherited disorders. Mutations in the dibasic and neutral transporter subunits b0,+AT (SLC7A9) or rBAT (SLC3A1) are associated with cystinuria (8Botzenhart E. Vester U. Schmidt C. Hesse A. Halber M. Wagner C. Lang F. Hoyer P. Zerres K. Eggermann T. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1136-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations in System B0 (SLC6A19) can cause Hartnup disease (9Kleta R.

Defective System IMINO activity is believed to result in iminoglycinuria, but genetic defects have not yet been identified. Iminoglycinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased urinary excretion of proline, hydroxyproline, and glycine (McKusick catalogue number 242600/OMIM % 242600; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, data base in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/), resulting in mental retardation, neurosensory hearing loss, and ichthyosis (11Swarna M.

Sci. 1968; 256: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, many patients have only benign symptoms, despite hyperiminoaciduria, because these amino acids can be reabsorbed by various renal tubule amino acid transporters with overlapping specificities and by the oligopeptide transporters. Family studies revealed that heterozygous infants of certain probands exhibit only glycinuria, but not iminoglycinuria. Therefore, iminoglycinuria has been suggested to be caused by defects of two or more renal tubule amino acid transporters (13Lasley L. Scriver C.R. Pediatr. Res. 1979; 13: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Scriver C.R. Schafer I.A. Efron M.L. Nature. 1961; 192: 672-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The SLC6 family of membrane transporters (15Chen N.H. Reith M.E. Quick M.W. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) includes members that mediate Na+- and Cl–-dependent cellular uptake of a broad range of neurotransmitters (including γ-aminobutyric acid, glycine, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine), osmolytes (betaine and taurine), imino acids, and amino acids. The SLC6 family also contains several orphan members whose functions have not been identified. Among these, we have isolated SIT1 (the product of the slc6a20 gene, also known as rB21a). We describe here the functional characterization of rat SIT1 using voltage-clamp and radiotracer assays in cRNA-injected oocytes and its tissue distribution using in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR. We report here for the first time that SIT1 is a Na+-dependent imino acid (proline) transporter. We also determined the changes in SIT1 expression in mouse kidney during development and the functional characterization of human SIT1 using radiotracer assays in cRNA-injected oocytes. Isolation of SIT1 cDNA—To clone rat SIT1, we added 100 ng of random hexamers and 1 μl of dNTPs (10 mm) to 0.5 μg of rat brain poly(A+) RNA (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 10 μl and incubated the mixture for 10 min at 65 °C before it was chilled on ice. We then added 2 μl of dithiothreitol (0.1 m), 2 μl of 10× reverse transcriptase buffer, 4 μl of MgCl2 (25 mm), and 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) and incubated the mixture at 25 °C for 2 min. To initiate cDNA synthesis, we added 200 units of Superscript II-RT (Invitrogen) and incubated the reaction at 25 °C for 10 min and 42 °C for 1 h. The coding sequence was amplified using AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with proofreading activity. Amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C, 2 min, 10 cycles of denaturing (95 °C, 15 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 2 min 30 s), 20 cycles of denaturing (95 °C, 15 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 2 min 30 s). The PCR product was inserted into the pOX(+) vector, a Xenopus oocyte expression vector originally derived from pTLN (Dr. Thomas J. Jentsch, Zentrum für Molekulare Neurobiologie, Hamburg) and subsequently modified by Drs. Peying Fong (Yale University) and Alan Yu (University of Southern California). SIT1 (from bp –13 to 1863) was amplified using primers 5′-AAAGCGGCCGCCTCGTGCGCGTTAATGAGATTAGCA-3′ (containing a NotI restriction site) and 5′-AAAGGGCCCGGAGGTCCATTCTTAGGCCACTGG-3′ (containing an ApaI restriction site) and inserted into the polylinker of pOX(+). Sequencing was performed in both directions. We found no differences between the coding sequence of the SIT1 cDNA that we isolated and that of a clone with accession number NM_133296 in the NCBI data base. To clone human SIT1, we used human small intestinal poly(A+) RNA (Invitrogen). The coding sequence was amplified using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with proofreading activity in the presence of PCRx Enhancer solution (final ×2). The first amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 2 min) using primers 5′-ATGGAGAAAGCGCGGCCGCTGTGGGCCAACTCGCT-3′ and 5′-ACAGGCGTGAGCCACCGTGCCCAGCTGAGGTCCAC-3′. The nested PCR was performed using primers 5′-GGTGGAATTCTGCAGATCGGGGCCATGGAGAAAGCGCGGCCGCTGTGG-3′ (containing an EcoR I restriction site) and 5′-GGTCTAGATCTCAGGCCACGGGGTCTGCGT-3′ (containing a XbaI restriction site). The second amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 2 min, 30 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 2 min). The final PCR product, human SIT1 (from bp –7 to 1782), was amplified and inserted into the polylinker of pOX(+). Sequencing was performed in both directions. We found no differences between the coding sequence of human SIT1 cDNA that we isolated and that of a clone with accession number NM_020208 in the NCBI data base. Heterologous Expression of SIT1 in Xenopus Oocytes—The pOX vector containing the rat or human SIT1 cDNAs under the SP6 promoter was linearized with HpaI. cRNA was synthesized in vitro with the use of the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit with SP6 RNA polymerase. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis (under 2-aminoethylbenzoate anesthesia), treated with collagenase A (Roche Diagnostics), and stored at 18 °C in modified Barths' medium (16Mackenzie B.

Hediger M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with ∼50 ng of cRNA and incubated 2–3 days before functional assays were performed at 22–23 °C (except where noted in Fig. 5L). Media Used for Transport Assays in Oocytes—Functional assays were performed using a standard Na+ uptake medium containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with Tris base). For low pH medium, 5 mm MES was used in place of 5 mm HEPES. For Na+-free or low Na+ medium, NaCl was replaced by equimolar choline chloride (ChoCl). For low Cl– medium, Cl– was replaced by equimolar gluconate. Solutions containing niflumic acid (where specified) also contained 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Voltage-clamp Experiments—A two-microelectrode voltage clamping (Dagan CA-1B) was used to measure currents associated with rat SIT1 in oocytes. Microelectrodes (resistance 1–7 MΩ) were filled with 3 m KCl. Voltage-clamp experiments comprised two protocols: (i) continuous current recordings were made at a holding potential (Vh) of –70 mV, low-pass filtered at 20 Hz, and digitized at 20 Hz; (ii) oocytes were clamped at Vh =–70 mV, and step-changes in membrane potential (Vm) were applied (from +50 mV to –150 mV in 20-mV increments), each for a duration of 100 ms, before and after the addition of substrate. Current was low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 5 kHz. Steady-state data were obtained by averaging the points over the final 16.7 ms at each Vm step. Test solutions were always washed out with substrate-free medium (100 mm ChoCl, pH 7.5) for at least 2 min. Steady-state data from protocols i or ii were fitted to a modified Hill relationship (Equation 1) for which I is the evoked current, Imax the derived current maximum, S the concentration of substrate S (Na+, Cl–, imino or amino acid), KS0.5 the substrate concentration at which current was half-maximal, and nH the Hill coefficient for S as shown in Equation 1. I=ImaxS⋅SnH(K0.5S)nH+SnH(Eq. 1) When we superfused low chloride and chloride-free solutions, the bath (reference) electrode was placed in a 3-M KCl well connected to the main bath via a 3-M KCl/agar bridge. Proline-evoked currents measured as a function of extracellular chloride concentration were fit to Equation 2. Equation 2 is a modified form of Equation 1 in which nH is constrained at 1 and a is the y-intercept, i.e. the derived proline-evoked current in the absence of chloride.I=a+ImaxCl⋅[Cl−](K0.5Cl)+[Cl−](Eq. 2) Proline-evoked currents obtained over the range of temperatures 16–32 °C (Fig. 5L) were fit to an integrated Arrhenius function (Equation 3), for which Ea is the Arrhenius activation energy, A the y-intercept, R the universal gas constant (1.987 cal·mol–1·K), T the absolute temperature, and I the l-proline-evoked current in standard Na+ medium.ln(−I)=lnA−EaR⋅T (Eq. 3) Radiotracer Uptake—We used l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline, l-[3,4(n)-3H]valine (both from Amersham Biosciences), and l-[4,5-3H(N)]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at final specific activity 1.5–4 GBq·mmol–1. We used 2-(methylamino)[14C]isobutyrate (MeAIB; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at final specific activity 4 MBq·mmol–1 and 22Na (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at final specific activity 0.34 MBq·mg–1. At the end of the uptake period, oocytes were rinsed with ice-cold ChoCl medium and solubilized with 5% SDS before 3H, 14C, or 22Na content was assayed by liquid scintillation counting. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of SIT1 in Rat Tissues—To detect the expression of SIT1 transcripts in various rat tissues, we performed quantitative RT-PCR using total RNA from several rat tissues. We isolated several tissues from female, 8-week-old Wistar rats and used luminal scrapes to obtain intestinal epithelium-enriched samples. Total RNA was isolated from rat tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For reverse transcription, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 and 1 μl of dNTPs (10 mm) were added to 1 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 10 μl. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C and then chilled on ice. Dithiothreitol (2 μl, 0.1 m), 10× reverse transcriptase buffer (2 μl), MgCl2 (4 μl, 25 mm), and 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. For cDNA synthesis 200 units of Superscript II-reversed transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added, followed by incubation at 42 °C for 1 h. We examined developmental changes in SIT1 expression in mouse kidney, using C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory). We extracted RNA from whole kidneys of fetuses (embryonic days 16, 17, 18, and 19), neonates (days 1 and 3), and adult mice. RT-PCR analyses were performed with the LightCycler DNA master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) with 0.5 μm each of 5′ and 3′ primers, 2 μl each of cDNA sample in a 20-μl reaction volume, as described previously (48Peng J.B. Zhuang L. Berger U.V. Adam R.M. Williams B.J. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Freeman M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). MgCl2 concentration was adjusted to 3 mm. Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 20 s with a temperature transition rate of 20 °C/s. Amplification and fluorescence determination were carried out in four steps: denaturation at 95 °C for 0 s with a temperature transition rate of 20 °C/s, annealing at 60 °C for 20 s (25 s for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) with a temperature transition rate of 8 °C/s, extension at 72 °C for 5 s with a temperature transition rate of 4 °C/s, followed by detection of SYBR green fluorescence (an index of the amount of double-stranded DNA) at 82 °C for 3 s, with an amplification number of 35. The PCR product of SIT1 was amplified with the SIT1-specific primers 5′-GTCATCAACAGCTCCACCTC-3′ and 5′-ATGGCCGCTGTATTTCCAAG-3′, which were used for both rat and mouse samples. The PCR product of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers 5′-CCTCAACGACCACTTTGTCA-3′ and 5′-TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT-3′, which were used for both rat and mouse samples. In Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled sense and antisense transcripts were synthesized with the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). To make sense and/or antisense cRNA probes, we made plasmid constructs of SIT1 cDNA inserted into pSPT18 and pSPT19 (Roche). cDNAs were linearized with HindIII (for pSPT18, antisense) or EcoRI (for pSPT19, sense). cRNA probes were transcribed from a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing ∼1.9 kb of SIT1 cDNA (the same sequence as that inserted into pOX(+)), flanked by promoter sequences for T7 RNA polymerase. Sense and antisense DIG-labeled transcripts of the SIT1 probe were alkali hydrolyzed to an average length of 500 nucleotides. In situ hybridization was performed on 10-μm cryosections of fresh-frozen rat tissues. Sections were immersed in slide mailers in hybridization solution composed of 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche), 0.02% SDS, and 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine and hybridized at 70 °C for 60 min with sense or antisense probe at a concentration of ∼200 ng/ml. Sections were then washed three times in 2× SSC and twice for 30 min in 0.2× SSC at 70 °C. After washing, the hybridized probes were visualized by alkaline phosphatase histochemistry using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—The SIT1 construct in pOX(+) was used for in vitro translation with the TNT SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) and in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For those reactions to which we added microsomal membranes, we extracted the membrane fraction at the end of the reaction period as described (18Hediger M.A. Mendlein J. Lee H.S. Wright E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1064: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by adding 60 μl of microsome spinning buffer (10 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 3.5% glycerol) to the reaction mix (25 μl) and centrifuging at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. SDS-PAGE and Autoradiography—The translation products were separated on a 0.1% SDS/10% polyacrylamide gel alongside molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad). The gel was fixed in 50% methanol/10% acetic acid for 2 h, washed in distilled water for 60 min, incubated in an Autofluor (autoradiographic image enhancer; National Diagnostics) for 2 h, and dried. We used Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax film exposed to dried gels for 14–16 h at –80 °C. SIT1 Is a Membrane Glycoprotein of the SLC6 Transporter Family—We have identified a Sodium/Imino-acid Transporter 1 (SIT1) that is encoded by the slc6a20 gene in rat, human, and mouse. SIT1 was previously known as rB21a or XT3 (19Smith K.E. Fried S.G. Durkin M.M. Gustafson E.L. Borden L.A. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L.

Genomics. 2001; 73: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has only been described at the genomic level, with very limited information about its tissue distribution. Furthermore, attempts to determine the function of the gene have remained unsuccessful. The rat SIT1 cDNA contains a 1848-bp open reading frame that gives rise to a protein of 616 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 69 kDa. SIT1 has 12 putative transmembrane domains and 2 extracellular large loops, each with a predicted N-glycosylation site (Fig. 1A). SIT1 is a member of the SLC6 gene family that includes the Na+/Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters (e.g. GAT1–3, GLYT1–2, SERT). The rat SIT1 (slc6a20) belongs to a new branch of the SLC6 family, along with slc6a18 (Xtrp2/ROSIT), slc6a17 (Ntt4/Rxt1), and slc6a15 (v7–3) (Fig. 1B), with which SIT1 shares 48, 43, and 44% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. SIT1 is 21–31% identical to the other members of the SLC6 family. In vitro translation of SIT1 produced a single band at ∼62 kDa (Fig. 2), close to the predicted mass of 60 kDa. In the presence of microsomal membranes, the apparent molecular mass increased significantly indicating that SIT1 is N-glycosylated at one or both of the putative sites. Core glycosylation may be absent from the second consensus site (Asn-Cys-Ser-Leu, residues 381–384) because it contains a cysteine residue that may participate in disulfide bonding. SIT1 Is a Na+-dependent Imino Acid Transporter—We explored the characteristics of SIT1 by measuring radiotracer uptake and evoked currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing SIT1. SIT1 stimulated the uptake of l-[3H]proline in Na+, but not in choline (Fig. 3A). The Na+-dependent component of 50 μm proline transport in SIT1-expressing oocytes was 24-fold that in control oocytes. Replacing Cl– with gluconate resulted in a large decrease in proline uptake. However, a significant fraction of the transport activity remained even in the absence of Cl–. l-Proline markedly stimulated the uptake of 22Na+ in oocytes expressing SIT1 (Fig. 3B), consistent with SIT1-mediated cotransport of proline with Na+. 22Na+ uptake was also increased in SIT1-expressing oocytes in the absence of proline, consistent with a Na+ leak in the absence of imino/amino acid substrate (Fig. 3B). We observed l-proline-evoked inward currents in SIT1-expressing oocytes under voltage-clamp conditions (Fig. 3C). At –70 mV, 5 mm l-proline evoked an inward current of ∼–100 nA in the presence of Na+ in an oocyte-expressing SIT1, but a current of only ∼–2 nA in a control oocyte (Fig. 3C). The SIT1-mediated proline-evoked current was all but abolished in the absence of Na+ (when Na+ was replaced by choline), but Li+ supported a proline-evoked current that was similar to that in Na+. Even in the absence of proline, upon switching from Na+-free medium to 100 mm Na+ medium we observed a modest inward current in SIT1-expressing oocytes (whereas only a small inward current was observed in control oocytes following this maneuver). This observation is consistent with the SIT1-mediated 22Na+ uptake observed in the absence of proline (Fig. 3B) and indicates that SIT1 mediates a substrate-independent Na+ leak current. However, because these experiments were not determined at the same Na+ concentration, the Na+ leak current and 22Na+ flux (as a fraction of the proline-dependent Na+ current and 22Na+ flux) in these experiments (Fig. 3, B and C) are not directly comparable, and we have observed that KNa0.5 for the leak current exceeds that for proline-evoked currents (not shown). Li+ also stimulated the leak current (Fig. 3B), but H+ did not, because switching from pH 7.5 to pH 5.5 in choline medium did not induce a similar current (not shown). We observed no SIT1-mediated [3H]proline uptake at pH 5.5 in choline medium, suggesting further that H+ cannot drive SIT1-mediated proline transport. These data indicate that the cation leak and cation-coupled proline transport activities share the cation specificity Na+, Li+≫ H+. l-Proline also evoked an inward current in a SIT1-expressing oocyte superfused with Cl–-free medium (in which we replaced Cl– with gluconate). However, the proline-evoked current in sodium gluconate (NaGlc) medium was only ∼50% of that in NaCl medium (Fig. 3C). The Cl–-dependent fraction differed between proline uptake (Fig. 3A) and proline-evoked currents (Fig. 3C), presumably as a result of the different conditions (proline concentration and membrane potential). The current spike observed upon returning to ChoCl medium was reproducible and was not due to perturbation of the bath. Instead, this most likely reflects an acceleration of proline transport upon readdition of Cl– for the few seconds during which significant Na+ remained in the bath and reiterates our conclusion that SIT1-mediated proline transport shows a partial dependence on Cl–. Substrate Profile of SIT1—SIT1-mediated l-proline transport is saturable, with half maximal concentration (KPro0.5) ∼ 0.2 mm, based on the proline-evoked currents (Table I, Fig. 5, B and C). We examined the substrate profile of SIT1 from the currents evoked by a range of imino and amino acids and the ability of these to inhibit l-[3H]proline uptake (Fig. 4). In addition to l-proline, which SIT1 preferred over its d-stereoisomer, SIT1 accepted the imino acids pipecolate (the 6-member ring congener of proline) and N-methyl-l-proline. SIT1 also accepted the N-methylated amino acids N-methylaminoisobutyrate (MeAIB) and sarcosine (N-methylglycine) (Fig. 4A). All of these compounds (except sarcosine, which was not tested as an inhibitor) were also strong inhibitors of proline uptake (Fig. 4B).Table ISIT1 saturation kinetics for selected imino acids and amino acidsTest substrateK0.5ImaxmmnAl-Proline0.17 ± 0.05-118 ± 11MeAIB0.78 ± 0.11-250 ± 11N-Methyl-l-proline3.8 ± 0.7-181 ± 12Sarcosine3.2 ± 0.3-84 ± 4 Open table in a new tab In general, the N-methylated derivatives evoked large currents in SIT1-expressing oocytes. In fact, saturating concentrations of MeAIB and N-methyl-l-proline evoked currents that exceeded those for l-proline. However, SIT1 reacted with the N-methylated derivatives with much lower apparent affinity than with l-proline (Table I), and uptake of 100 μm l-[3H]proline exceeded that of 100 μm [14C]MeAIB (Fig. 4C). Hydroxy-l-proline also was a strong inhibitor of proline uptake but evoked only a small current (Fig. 4, A and B), which may suggest that hydroxyproline binds with relatively high affinity to SIT1 without it being efficiently transported. Several other α-amino acids, l-cysteine, l-leucine, isoleucine, N-methyl-d-aspartate, l-phenylalanine, and l-valine, evoked small currents and/or afforded modest inhibition of proline uptake in SIT1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 4, A and B). However, l-[3H]leucine and l-[3H]valine were not efficiently transported (Fig. 4C). N-acetyl-l-cysteine, l-aspartate, kainic acid, glycine, and the pyrimidine base thymine resulted in weak inhibition of proline uptake but did not evoke significant currents (Fig. 4, A and B). Notably, neither l-alanine nor l-lysine inhibited proline uptake, consistent with the inhibition profile of classical System IMINO (2Stevens B.R. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 87: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have concluded that the SIT1 transporter is specific to imino acids and N-methylated amino acid derivatives. SIT1 interacts weakly with cysteine, phenylalanine, and valine, but there is no significant reactivity with other α-amino acids such as alanine and lysine.

https://openalex.org/W2071632687,"Nitric oxide (·NO) has been proposed to play a relevant role in modulating oxidative reactions in lipophilic media like biomembranes and lipoproteins. Two factors that will regulate ·NO reactivity in the lipid milieu are its diffusion and solubility, but there is no data concerning the actual diffusion (D) and partition coefficients (KP) of ·NO in biologically relevant hydrophobic phases. Herein, a “equilibrium-shift” method was designed to directly determine the ·NO and O2 partition coefficients in liposomes and low density lipoprotein (LDL) relative to water. It was found that ·NO partitions 4.4- and 3.4-fold in liposomes and LDL, respectively, whereas O2 behaves similarly with values of 3.9 and 2.9, respectively. In addition, actual diffusion coefficients in these hydrophobic phases were determined using fluorescence quenching and found that ·NO diffuses ∼2 times slower than O2 in the core of LDL and 12 times slower than in buffer (DNOLDL=3.9×10−6 cm2 s−1,DO2LDL=7.0×10−6 cm2 s−1,DNObuffer=DO2buffer=4.5×10−5 cm2 s−1) . The influence of ·NO and O2 partitioning and diffusion in membranes and lipoproteins on ·NO reaction with lipid radicals and auto-oxidation is discussed. Particularly, the 3–4-fold increase in O2 and ·NO concentration within biological hydrophobic phases provides quantitative support for the idea of an accelerated auto-oxidation of ·NO in lipid-containing structures, turning them into sites of enhanced local production of oxidant and nitrosating species.

Two key physicochemical parameters that can influence on ·NO reactivity in membranes are its diffusion, affecting the number of effective collisions in that medium, and its partition, that determines the concentration of ·NO achieved in that hydrophobic milieu. We have previously estimated the diffusion coefficients of ·NO in liposomes, erythrocyte plasma membranes and LDL (22Denicola A. Batthyany C. Lissi E. Freeman B.A. Rubbo H. Radi R. J. Biol.

Nitric oxide is ∼6–9 times more soluble in organic solvents than in water (24Malinski T. Taha Z. Grunfeld S. Patton S. Kapturczak M. Tomboulian P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The values reported in organic solvents were used to support the concept of increased ·NO antioxidant efficacy in membranes and lipoproteins (10Rubbo H. Botti H. Batthyany C. Trostchansky A.

Therefore, the essential question to be answered concerning ·NO reactions in lipid milieu is how much ·NO actually partitions into biomembranes and lipoproteins? Membranes and lipoproteins pose constraints to solute dissolution compared with the organic solvents currently referenced in the literature (24Malinski T. Taha Z. Grunfeld S. Patton S. Kapturczak M. Tomboulian P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 25Shaw A.W. Vosper A.J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1. 1977; 8: 1239-1244Crossref Google Scholar) because of its organized structure and lateral packing (27Marqusee J.A. Dill K.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1986; 85: 434-444Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), thus the direct determination of ·NO partition coefficients (KP) between biologically relevant lipid phases and water is mandatory. We developed a new method for measuring KP (the ratio between solute concentrations in hydrophobic and aqueous phases at equilibrium), which we have called “equilibrium-shift,” that allowed us to determine KP of ·NO as well as O2 in two biologically relevant lipid systems, LDL and liposomes. In addition, these results were used to calculate actual diffusion coefficients for ·NO and O2 in these hydrophobic environments using fluorescence quenching (22Denicola A. Batthyany C. Lissi E.

Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL). The pyrene probe 1-(pyrenyl)methyl-3-(9-octadecenoyloxy)-22,23-bisnor-5-cholenate (PMChO) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma. LDL Purification and Liposome Preparation—LDL was isolated from normolipidemic donors by double ultracentrifugation using a KBr gradient (28Batthyány C. Santos C.X. Botti H. Cerveñansky C. Radi R. Augusto O. Rubbo H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and then desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham, Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 0.10 m sodium phosphate, 0.10 mm DTPA, pH 7.4. This buffer composition was used throughout all this work. The LDL was stored in the dark at 4 °C under argon and used within 48 h. The protein concentration was determined at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 1.05 mg–1 ml cm–1, Ref. 29Byun J. Mueller D.M. Fabjan J.S. Heinecke J.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Multilamellar liposomes were prepared from 2 ml of 20 mg/ml chloroformic EYPC solution as previously (7Rubbo H. Radi R.

Oxygen Partition Coefficient Determination—The samples were used at high concentrations, up to 40 mg/ml EYPC and 9 mg/ml protein LDL in buffer. The samples (300 μl) were placed in 1.8-ml septum-sealed vials and flushed with water-humidified O2 for 3 h in a temperaturecontrolled water bath. Control (distilled water) and blank samples (buffer) were included in every assay. The O2 concentration of the sample ([O2]S) was determined using a thermostatized Clark-type electrode (YSI, model 5300), injecting a sample aliquot to 1.6 ml of deoxygenated distilled water (15 min N2 bubbling). The electrode was calibrated using air-saturated water ([O2]25w = 246 μm; [O2]37w = 199 μm, Ref. 30Lide D.R. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar). Nitric Oxide Partition Coefficient Determination—The samples (100 μl in 1.8-ml septum-sealed vials) were deoxygenated by flushing water-humidified N2 for 3 h, then flushed with deoxygenated 5 m NaOH-washed ·NO for 10 min and left for 4–5 h under very gentle agitation to equilibrate. An aliquot was withdrawn from the gas phase to confirm equilibration (see below), and another aliquot was withdrawn from the buffer or lipid suspension to determine the lipid/water ·NO partitioning. The latter was measured by injecting 15 μl of the sample into 3.00 ml of deoxygenated water (15 min N2 bubbling) in a 3.5-ml thermostatized chamber, and the ·NO release was registered using a ·NO selective electrode (ISO-NO, WPI Inc. Sarasota, FL). Calibration of the electrode was done using nitrite in iodide acidic solution as indicated by the manufacturer. It is worth mentioning that the greatest dilution used (1:200) draws most of the lipid-dissolved ·NO into the aqueous phase. To confirm that ·NO in the samples had equilibrated between gas and suspensions, the gas phase [·NO] in the sample vials was measured, knowing that the ratio of [·NO] between gas and liquid water at 25 °C is 20.9 at equilibrium (25Shaw A.W. Vosper A.J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1. 1977; 8: 1239-1244Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl were withdrawn from the gas phase of the sample vials using a gas-tight syringe and injected into a septum-sealed vial with aerated 500 μl of 10 mm NaOH. Nitrite, the ·NO main oxidation product, was analyzed by the method of Griess (31Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). Rationale for Partition Coefficient Determination—The partition coefficient for O2 and ·NO between the hydrophobic and the aqueous phase was determined measuring the increase in apparent solubility in lipid phase-containing suspensions relative to buffer alone. The total O2 and ·NO concentration increase in solutions with lipid phases can be described by the following equation, derived from the mass conservation relationship (exemplified for O2, Ref. 32Lakowicz J.R. Hogen D. Omann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 471: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar),[O2]T=[O2]aq(1+(KP−1)αh)(Eq. 1) where [O2]T and [O2]aq stand for total and aqueous O2 concentrations, KP is the O2 partition coefficient between the hydrophobic and the aqueous phase, i.e. KP = [O2]h/[O2]aq, and αh is the hydrophobic fractional volume, the ratio between hydrophobic and total volumes. The O2 electrode only measures the [O2] at the aqueous phase, and hence [O2]T cannot be measured directly. To solve this problem, a dilution step into deoxygenated water is introduced where part of the O2 that is dissolved into the membrane or lipoprotein goes into aqueous solution, and the released O2 is determined electrochemically. The [O2] in both lipid and aqueous phases changes because of this dilution. It follows from Equation 1 that if the sample is diluted by a factor of “b,” the measured [O2] would be,[O2]S=[O2]T/(b+(KP−1)αh)(Eq. 2) where the measured [O2]S is not just [O2]T/b, because part of the O2 is still retained within the lipid phase after dilution (provided KP > 1, and b is low). To calculate [O2]T we assume that at saturation the solubility of O2 in the aqueous phase will be the same for all samples, and it will be mainly dependent on the buffer salts concentration and little affected by the polar groups from the lipid phase. If [O2] in the aqueous phase is constant for any αh prior to dilution, it can be calculated from [O2] measurements in buffer samples ([O2]B). Equation 1 can thus be rearranged to yield,[O2]T=[O2]B×b(1+(KP−1)αh)(Eq. 3) and then we can use this relation to replace [O2]T in Equation 2 and rearrange it to get a function that relates KP to αh and to the measured [O2],([O2]S−[O2]B)×b/([O2]B×b−[O2]S)=(KP−1)αh (Eq. 4) where [O2]S is the measured [O2] in the different samples, [O2]B is the measured [O2] in buffer, and b is the dilution factor, which was 6.9 for most assays. The left term in Equation 4 can be regarded as the corrected relative increase in O2 solubility, and a plot of the measured corrected relative increase in [O2] against αh can yield KP from the slope. The greater sensitivity of the ·NO electrode allowed the use of smaller amounts of sample, i.e. a greater dilution into the electrode chamber (b = 200). Considering [·NO]B × b » [·NO]S, Equation 4 simplifies greatly and factoring KP out,KP=1+1αh([⋅NO]S[⋅NO]B−1)(Eq. 5) as this method was derived for measuring O2 and ·NO concentrations from re-equilibration after dilution, it was called equilibrium-shift method. The partition coefficients were determined in 0.1 m phosphate and 0.1 mm DTPA buffer, because LDL aggregates in pure distilled water and to avoid salting out effects by the polar groups of the lipid particles. The corrected partition coefficients between liposomes or LDL and water were then calculated using the relative solubilities of each gas in buffer and water, KP(h/w) = KP(h/w) × [·NO]B/[·NO]w, where [·NO]B/[·NO]w = 0.90 and [O2]B/[O2]w = 0.92. Hydrophobic Fractional Volume (αh) Calculation—The αh was calculated for liposomes taking into account the EYPC concentration (in g/ml), the density (d) and the hydrophobic fraction (Fh) of the bilayer, αh = [EYPC] × Fh/d, where d = 1.00 g/ml, and Fh = 0.75 excluding the polar phosphocholine headgroups, assuming that O2 and ·NO dissolve mainly in the acyl chain region (33Lissi E.A.

For LDL, a molar lipid volume of 2.12 × 103 liter/mol was calculated considering the molar volume of the LDL (2.5 × 103 liter/mol), the mass of the apoB-100 (5.13 × 105 g/mol) and its specific volume (0.74 ml/g, Ref. 36Teerlink T.

This volume was then multiplied by the molar concentration of LDL to derive αh, αh = [apoB-100] (mol/liter) × 2.12 × 103 (liter/mol). O2 Diffusion in LDL Studied by Pyrene Probe Fluorescence Quenching—Oxygen-quenching experiments were performed as described before for ·NO (22Denicola A. Batthyany C. Lissi E. Freeman B.A. Rubbo H. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 932-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using PMChO-incorporated LDL as the fluorescent probe and O2-saturated water. O2 Partition between Lipid and Aqueous Phases—The partition coefficient of O2 between LDL and buffer was determined by the equilibrium-shift method described above, using up to 9 mg/ml (in protein) LDL. Saturation of the sample was achieved within 1.5 h at 25 °C without agitation (data not shown), but 3 h was used to assure that the lipid sample was equilibrated with O2. The O2 load was dependent on LDL concentration, and the KP between LDL and buffer was determined from the slope of the equilibrium-shift plot (Equation 4, Fig. 1A), KP = 3.2 ± 0.4 and the corrected value for water 2.9 ± 0.3. It was observed that O2 partition between dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes and water increases dramatically from the gel to the liquid crystalline state (37Smotkin E.S. Moy F.T. Plachy W.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the core lipids of LDL exhibit a broad phase transition temperature (20–40 °C, Ref. 38Hevonoja T. Pentikainen M.O. Hyvonen M.T. Kovanen P.T. AlaKorpela M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and no difference in O2 partition was observed for LDL at 37 °C (data not shown). The same assays were conducted with EYPC liposomes, using up to 40 mg/ml EYPC. The measured O2 concentration increased with higher liposome content, ∼0.33 μm O2 ml/mg egg-PC. The KP for O2 between liposomes and buffer was 4.2 ± 0.4 (Fig. 1B, Table I), and the corrected value for liposomes/water was 3.9 ± 0.4. Furthermore, the linearity observed for the equilibrium-shift plots (Fig. 1) indicates that the polar groups in the lipid particles do not yield a significant salting out of the O2, otherwise, a hyperbolic shape should have been observed. Therefore, the assumption made for proposing the equilibrium-shift method was accomplished under these experimental conditions.Table IPartition (KP) and diffusion (D) coefficients for O2 and ·NO in lipid and aqueous systems at 25 °CSystemKP(h / B)KP(h / w)DRef.cm2 s-1O2Dimiristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes4.9 ± 0.8aConsidering that no O2 dissolves at the headgroup region, as assumed in this work, in the liquid crystalline state (37).37Smotkin E.S.

Buffer salts (Fig. 2, B) lead to the salting out of ·NO, thus a lower [·NO] was measured, 6.2 ± 0.2 μm (n = 8). On the other hand, LDL in buffer (Fig. 2, C) showed a greater [·NO] than buffer alone, 6.7 ± 0.1 μm for αh = 32 ± 1 × 10–3 (n = 5), and 6.5 ± 0.1 μm for αh = 16 ± 1 × 10–3 (n = 4), indicating that the ·NO partitioning between LDL and buffer was greater than one. The differences in ·NO concentration between buffer and LDL samples were significant for both LDL concentrations and buffer (p < 0.05). The KP for ·NO between LDL and buffer was calculated using Equation 5, 3.8 ± 0.8, and the corrected value for LDL/water was 3.4 ± 0.7 (Table I). EYPC liposomes at 40 mg/ml showed an 11% increase in [·NO] relative to buffer (n = 5), to yield a KP = 4.8 ± 0.5 and a corrected value for water of 4.4 ± 0.5. To confirm that equilibration was achieved, the [·NO] at the gas phase was measured. It was highly reproducible between assays, yielding 28 ± 2 mm ·NO, and the ratio [·NO]gas/[·NO]w was 20 ± 2, in agreement with the expected result of 20.9 (25Shaw A.W. Vosper A.J. J. Chem. Soc.

Here we show that Pex5p is a stable protein that is monoubiquitinated in wild type cells. By making use of mutants defective in vacuolar or proteasomal degradation we demonstrate that monoubiquitinated Pex5p is not a breakdown intermediate of either system. Monoubiquitinated Pex5p is localized to peroxisomes, and ubiquitination requires the presence of functional docking and RING finger complexes, which suggests that it is a late event in peroxisomal matrix protein import. In pex1, pex4, pex6, pex15, and pex22 mutants, all of which are blocked in the terminal steps of peroxisomal matrix protein import, polyubiquitinated forms of Pex5p accumulate, ubiquitination being dependent on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4p. However, Ubc4p is not required for Pex5p ubiquitination in wild type cells, and cells lacking Ubc4p are not affected in peroxisome biogenesis. These results indicate that Pex5p monoubiquitination in wild type cells serves to regulate rather than to degrade Pex5p, which is supported by the observed stability of Pex5p. We propose that Pex5p monoubiquitination in wild type cells is required for the recycling of Pex5p from the peroxisome, whereas Ubc4p-mediated polyubiquitination of Pex5p in mutants blocked in the terminal steps of peroxisomal matrix protein import may function as a disposal mechanism for Pex5p when it gets stuck in the import pathway.

Peroxisomes are ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles bounded by a single membrane. Two of their well conserved functions are β-oxidation of fatty acids and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide. To date 32 genes encoding proteins involved in peroxisome biogenesis (called peroxins, see Ref. 1Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G. Fujiki Y. Goodman J.M.

The import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes is mediated by the mobile receptors Pex5p and Pex7p, which bind to proteins with a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; AAA, ATPases associated with various cellular activities; Ubc, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2); RING, really interesting new gene; E3, ubiquitin ligase.1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; AAA, ATPases associated with various cellular activities; Ubc, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2); RING, really interesting new gene; E3, ubiquitin ligase. or a type 2 (PTS2), respectively. Both receptors are predominantly soluble proteins that are thought to cycle between the cytoplasm and the peroxisome. For Pex5p the following steps in the receptor cycle have been proposed; 1) Binding to a PTS1-containing protein in the cytoplasm, 2) docking of the PTS1·Pex5p complex on the peroxisomal membrane, 3) dissociation of this complex and translocation of the PTS1 protein into the peroxisomal matrix, and 4) recycling to the cytoplasm. Recent evidence suggests that Pex5p may enter the peroxisomal matrix with its PTS1 cargo, a process referred to as the extended receptor shuttle (Ref. 3Dammai V. Subramani S.

About a dozen different peroxins present on the peroxisomal membrane have been implicated to function directly in peroxisomal matrix import. The exact roles of most of these proteins in the import process are still unclear, however. Exceptions are Pex13p and Pex14p, which interact with Pex5p and form, together with Pex17p, the membrane-associated docking complex (4Kunau W.H. Curr.

Another complex consists of the integral membrane proteins Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p, which all contain a RING (really interesting new gene) finger domain (13Albertini M. Girzalsky W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pex8p, the only known peroxin localized to the matrix side of the membrane (14Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W. Voorn-Brouwer T. Franse M.M. Distel B. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. J. Biol.

Two peroxins, Pex1p and Pex6p, are known as ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA) ATPases (16Spong A.P. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Voorn-Brouwer T. van der Leij I. Hemrika W. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae they partially associate with the membrane via the integral membrane protein Pex15p (18Birschmann I. Stoobants A.K. van den Berg M. Schafer A. Rosenkranz K. Kunau W.H. Tabak H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2226-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van den Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AAA ATPases have been suggested to function in the dissociation of protein complexes and protein unfolding (for review, see Refs. 20Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 21Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pex4p, which is attached to the membrane by the integral membrane protein Pex22p, has been identified as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc10p (22Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wiebel F.F. Kunau W.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Pex4p and Pex22p together with the AAA ATPases Pex1p and Pex6p may act late in peroxisomal matrix protein import, possibly in the recycling of the receptor to the cytoplasm (24Collins C.S. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. McCaffery J.M. Gould S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7516-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The concept of a cycling Pex5p implies sequential binding of the receptor to different proteins or protein complexes at the peroxisome. A way to regulate these interactions is by reversible posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination. Indeed, the integral membrane proteins Pex14p and Pex15p appear to be phosphorylated (19Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van den Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Johnson M.A. Snyder W.B. Cereghino J.L. Veenhuis M. Subramani S. Cregg J.M.

However, the physiological roles of phosphorylation in peroxisomal matrix protein import are unknown. Two peroxins have been demonstrated to be ubiquitinated; Pex18p, a protein involved in the PTS2 pathway, is constitutively degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (28Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47684-47689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas two groups recently reported polyubiquitination of Pex5p in cells lacking components of the AAA or Pex4p·Pex22p complexes (29Kiel J.A. Emmrich K. Meyer H.E. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1921-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Platta H.W. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Also for Pex5p, it was proposed that ubiquitination results in proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination of proteins requires the sequential action of at least three types of enzymes; they are a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3) (for review, see Ref. 31Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). In the final step of the cascade an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and the lysine residue of the substrate is formed, a reaction that is catalyzed by the E2 enzyme, usually in conjunction with the E3 ligase. The length of the ubiquitin chain conjugated to a substrate plays an important role. Polyubiquitinated proteins (i.e. with a chain of at least four ubiquitin molecules) are usually recognized and degraded by the proteasome (32Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In contrast, monoubiquitination, i.e. attachment of a single ubiquitin moiety, regulates cellular processes such as endocytosis, sorting into multivesicular bodies and virus budding in a proteasome-independent way (for review, see Ref. 33Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time that Pex5p is a monoubiquitinated and stable protein in wild type cells. Pex5p monoubiquitination takes place at the peroxisome and is blocked in cells lacking functional docking or RING finger complexes, suggesting that Pex5p monoubiquitination is a late event in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Furthermore, we show that polyubiquitinated forms of Pex5p accumulate in certain pex mutants in an Ubc4p-dependent manner, an observation that is in line with recent reports (29Kiel J.A. Emmrich K. Meyer H.E. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1921-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Platta H.W. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, monoubiquitination of Pex5p in wild type cells is not dependent on Ubc4p, and peroxisome biogenesis is not affected in cells lacking Ubc4p. On the basis of these findings we propose distinct functions for Pex5p monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination. Strains, Media, and Reagents—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Deletion strains were either obtained from the EUROSCARF consortium (www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/eroscarf/index.html) or generated by one-step PCR-mediated gene disruption using KanMX, HIS5, LEU2, or URA3 as a selectable marker (34Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were selected and grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB-WO; Difco), 2% glucose, and amino acids (20–30 μg/ml) as needed. The liquid media used for culturing of the cells for total protein isolation, subcellular fractionation, and immune precipitation contained 0.5% potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.1% (v/v) oleate, and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 40. Before shifting to this medium cells were grown on 0.67% YNB-WO containing 0.3% glucose for at least 24 h. CuSO4 (100 μm final concentration) was added to cultures for the CUP1 promoter-controlled Myc-ubiquitin expression. For pulse-chase experiments, minimal oleate was used containing 0.67% YNB-WO, 0.1% oleate (v/v), 0.5% (v/v) Tween 40, and amino acids as needed (lacking methionine and cysteine). Oleate plates contained 0.67% YNB-WO, 0.1% oleate (v/v), 0.5% (v/v) Tween 40, 2% agar, 0.1% yeast extract, and amino acids as needed. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting were Pex5p (raised in our own laboratory, rabbit polyclonal antibody) and anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., mouse monoclonal antibody).Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSource or referenceBJ1991MATa; leu2, ura3-251, trp1, prb1-1122, pep4-3, gal253Jones E.W.

Cells were allowed to grow for 1.5 h at 28 °C and subsequently concentrated in 1 ml of fresh minimal oleate medium and incubated for 30 min in at 28 °C. Next, 200 μCi of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (PRO-MIX L-(35S), Amersham Biosciences) was added, and cells were incubated at 28 °C for 10 min. The chase was started by the addition of 6 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine to the reaction mixtures followed by further incubation at 28 °C for 0, 10, 60, 300 min. Chase reactions were stopped on ice. To prepare glass bead lysates, cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After the addition of 250 μl of glass beads, cells were vortexed for 15 min at maximal speed at 4 °C. Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of Pex5p rabbit polyclonal antiserum and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitates were washed three times with buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation experiments were performed with 200 ml of rich oleate cultures as described previously (6Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) except that 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide and a protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added to the lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed on oleate-grown cells (20 A600 units) that were lysed with glass beads in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were resuspended in 200 μl of 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and after adjusting the pH, the samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Undissolved material was pelleted, and 800 μl of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1.2% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin), a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide was added to the supernatants. Lysates were precleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of Pex5p rabbit polyclonal antiserum and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitates were washed 3 times with buffer B1 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% SDS), twice with buffer B2 (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), twice with buffer B3 (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and once with buffer B4 (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations on homogenate, pellet, and supernatant fractions, obtained by subcellular fractionation, were performed in an identical way. Half of the 1-ml fractions was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated by adding an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by an hour of incubation at 4 °C. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were used for immunoprecipitation as described above. Miscellaneous/Protein Extracts—Protein extracts were prepared by breaking the cells with glass beads and acid precipitation as described (8Elgersma Y. Kwast L. Klein A. Voorn-Brouwer T. van den Berg M. Metzig B. America T. Tabak H.F. Distel B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (6Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected using ECL reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Pex5p Is Posttranslationally Modified and Stable with Time—The prevailing model for protein import into peroxisomes predicts that Pex5p can mediate multiple rounds of import and, thus, should be a relatively stable protein. To address this, we carried out pulse-chase experiments and monitored the stability of Pex5p in wild type yeast cells grown on oleate (Fig. 1). The levels of Pex5p remained constant during the chase for up to 5 h, indicating that Pex5p turnover was very slow. The estimated half-life of Pex5p of more than 5 h by far exceeds the calculated import rates of most PTS1 proteins (36.De Jonge, W. (2003) Chaperones and Peroxisomes. Ph.D. thesis, Department of Bio-Organic Chemistry, University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). Thus, Pex5p is stable with time, supporting the shuttling model in which Pex5p can mediate multiple rounds of PTS1 import. Interestingly, a slower migrating Pex5p band was detected in each immunoprecipitate, the levels of which slowly increased during the chase. This band was absent in immunoprecipitates from pex5Δ cells, indicating that it is specific for Pex5p, and we infer that it represents a posttranslationally modified form of Pex5p. Pex5p Is Monoubiquitinated on Two Lysine Residues in Wild Type Cells—The estimated size difference of about 15 kDa between the primary Pex5p species and the slower migrating form suggests a relatively large modification. We, therefore, first tested whether ubiquitin, which has a molecular mass of ∼8 kDa, was conjugated to Pex5p. Wild type cells and pex5Δ cells as a control were transformed with a plasmid expressing Myc epitope-tagged ubiquitin (Myc-Ub) or with a control vector and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Pex5p antiserum (Fig. 2A). In wild type cells transformed with vector, a slower migrating species was discernable in addition to the primary Pex5p species. The mobility of the slower migrating species shifted in cells expressing Myc-Ub, indicating conjugation of tagged ubiquitin to Pex5p. However, the interpretation of these results was not straightforward since a cross-reacting band was present in pex5Δ cells with the same apparent molecular mass as the slower migrating Pex5p species in wild type cells. To unambiguously demonstrate that Pex5p is ubiquitinated, Pex5p was immunoprecipitated with anti-Pex5p antibodies from wild type cells expressing Myc-Ub, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-Pex5p antibodies (Fig. 2B). In the blot probed with anti-Myc antibodies, a single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kDa was detected. In a control experiment with pex5Δ cells, this band was absent. The estimated molecular mass difference between the primary Pex5p species (∼70 kDa) and the Myc-Ub-conjugated Pex5p (∼90 kDa) is consistent with the presence of two Myc-ubiquitin moieties (Myc-Ub, ∼9.5 kDa). To distinguish between Pex5p monoubiquitination at two lysines and diubiquitination at one site, we overexpressed a mutant Myc-Ub (Myc-Ub-K0), in which all seven lysine residues were replaced by arginine. Myc-Ub-K0 can still be conjugated to other proteins but cannot function as an acceptor for ubiquitinchain elongation. Myc-Ub- and Myc-Ub-K0-transformed wild type cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described above (Fig. 2C). Again, a single band representing Pex5p attached to two Myc-Ub moieties was present in Myc-Ub-expressing cells. Importantly, the intensity of this band did not decrease in Myc-Ub-K0-overexpressing cells nor did we observe faster migrating bands, which would be indicative of blocked ubiquitin-chain elongation.

https://openalex.org/W1984021896,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a potent pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediator that plays an important role in several normal and disease processes. TNF-induced cell death is one of the principal mechanisms by which cells are removed. Although TNF-mediated apoptosis has been the subject of intense investigation, the transcriptional mechanisms through which it promotes apoptosis are not well understood and, paradoxically, the archetypal TNF-induced nuclear factor NFκB is anti-apoptotic. To identify a potential master transcriptional regulator of apoptosis, we examined an array of TNF-α-activated transcription factors. Fork-head box class-O 1 (FOXO1) was strongly activated, which was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The central importance of FOXO1 was established in experiments with small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) that specifically silenced FOXO1. When FOXO1 was silenced, fibroblast apoptosis was reduced 76%. Other siRNAs that partially inhibited FOXO1 expression were proportionately effective in reducing apoptosis. Transcriptional profiling was then carried out in conjunction with siRNA to establish mechanisms by which FOXO1 modulated apoptosis. In the absence of FOXO1, TNF-α failed to up-regulate a large number of pro-apoptotic gene families including ligands, receptors, adapter molecules, mitochondrial proteins, and caspases. siRNA silencing also blocked down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. These results indicate that TNF induces activation of the FOXO1 transcription factor, which acts as a master switch to control apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a potent pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediator that plays an important role in several normal and disease processes.

These results indicate that TNF induces activation of the FOXO1 transcription factor, which acts as a master switch to control apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FOXO, forkhead box class-O; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; RT, reverse transcription; TNFR, TNF receptor; TRADD, the TNFR1-associated death domain protein. is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates a large number of events in many cell types. TNF-α exerts its biological activity by activating several different signaling pathways that can affect diverse functions such as inflammation, survival, or cell death (1.Beutler B. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1999; 57: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). Most survival effects of TNF-α have been related to activation of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) (2.Beg A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 3.Wang J. Devalia J. Xia C. Sapsford R. Davies R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). NFκb is responsible for the expression of genes important for many biological processes including cell survival, growth, development, oncogenesis, and immune and inflammatory responses (4.Barnes P. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar, 5.Sha W. Liou H. Tuomanen E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 6.Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F. Li Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 7.Gaur U. Aggarwal B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Activation of NFκb is thought to occur when TNF-α binding to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) leads to the rapid assembly of the TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), the receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which culminates in activation and nuclear translocation of NFκB (8.Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 9.Wang C. Mayo M. Korneluk R. Goeddel D. Baldwin A.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). Although the survival effect of TNF-α has been related to NFκb activation, apoptotic effects of TNF-α have focused on post-translational mechanisms. After binding to TNF-α, TNFR1 can recruit, through TRADD, the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) that, in turn, recruits and activates caspase-8, which then activates caspase-3 and apoptosis (10.Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D. Cell. 1996; 2: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). In contrast to post-translational pathways, the role of transcription factors in facilitating TNF-stimulated apoptosis has not been as thoroughly investigated. One potential mechanism through which TNF-α could regulate apoptosis is via the global induction of pro-apoptotic genes. A candidate class of transcription factors that could function in this capacity comprises the forkhead box class-O (FOXO) winged helix transcription factors (11.Birkenkamp K. Coffer P. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are orthologues of the Caenorhabditis elegans forkhead factor DAF-16 and are deactivated by phosphorylation (12.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar, 13.Dijkers P. Medema R. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N. Lam E. Burgering B. Raaijmakers J. Lammers J. Koenderman L. Coffer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the forkhead transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 (formally known as FKHR, FKHR-L1, and AFX, respectively) modulate apoptosis through gene expression (14.Burgering B. Medema R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). For example, FOXO transcription factors induce a pro-apoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family and enhance expression of the TNF-related death inducing ligand (TRAIL), Fas and TRADD, which are involved in signaling apoptosis (15.Rokudai S. Fujita N. Kitahara O. Nakamura Y. Tsuruo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8695-8708Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16.Gilley J. Coffer P. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To investigate a transcriptional mechanism through which TNF could be pro-apoptotic, we investigated the role of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 in mediating TNF-induced fibroblast apoptosis. TNF-α activated FOXO1 in vitro and in vivo and increased its expression at the mRNA level. TNF-α-stimulated fibroblast apoptosis was reduced ∼76% by silencing FOXO1. FOXO1-specific siRNA also caused a dramatic decrease in the capacity of TNF-α to induce global expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Inhibition of FOXO1 also reduced activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9 in response to TNF-α, indicating that FOXO1-regulated genes played an important role in the signaling events leading to apoptosis. Taken together, these results identify activation of FOXO1 as a critical step in the capacity of TNF-α to stimulate the apoptosis of fibroblasts. Cell Culture—Primary human adult dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). Cells were propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex Company) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamicin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Experiments with TNF-α were performed in a culture medium supplemented with 0.5% serum. Assays were performed when the cultures reached 75–85% confluence. Apoptosis of fibroblasts was determined by measuring cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical difference between samples was determined by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. In Vivo Specimens—Wild type CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). For each data point there were six mice (n = 6). Recombinant murine TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems. TNF-α (200 ng) was inoculated adjacent to the periosteum at a point on the midline of the skull located between the ears as we have described previously (17.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. Raptis M. Graves D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 201: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mice were euthanized for 1 h following injection, and the scalp tissue was obtained and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear proteins were extracted from pulverized frozen tissue using a nuclear protein extraction kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of nuclear proteins were measured by using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Fibroblast cultures were incubated for 1 h in assay medium with or without 20 ng/ml TNF-α. In selected experiments cells were treated with the specific NFκB inhibitor SN50 (100 μg/ml) or the SN50M control peptide that lacks activity (100 μg/ml) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), which was added to the cell culture assay medium. Cell lysates were prepared by extraction with cell lysis buffer (Pierce), and nuclear proteins were extracted from the lysates using a nuclear protein extraction buffer (Pierce). Interactions between nuclear proteins and the FOXO1 DNA probe (5′-CAAAACAA-3′) was investigated using an EMSA kit from Panomics (Redwood City, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction and as reported previously (18.Leenders H. Whitfield S. Benoist C. Mathis D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2980-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Activation of NFκB was measured by EMSA with a DNA probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) as described (19.Lenardo M. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) using an EMSA kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Specificity was demonstrated for each reaction by adding 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (competitive probe) or 100-fold excess unlabeled nonspecific oligonucleotide (non-competitive probe). Each experiment was carried out three times with similar results. siRNA Experiments—Experiments were carried out in fibroblasts that were ∼70% confluent as described above. Cells were transfected by siRNA using the TransMessenger transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen, Valencia CA). In pilot studies, fluorescently labeled non-silencing siRNA (Qiagen) was used to optimize the transfection efficiency. Six different siRNAs specific for human FOXO1 were designed by Qiagen to be non-homologous with other genes and are designated siRNA-663, siRNA-755, siRNA-800, siRNA-890, siRNA-1059, and siRNA-1674. Of these, siRNA-890 (5′-r(GCCCUGGCUCUCACAGCAA)d(TT)-3′) was most effective and was used in all of the experiments. Two of these siRNAs, namely siRNA-1059 (5′-r(GATGGCCTCTACTTTACCC)d(TT)-3′) and siRNA-1674 (5′-r(GACACCUGUACAAGUGCCU)d(TT)-3′), did not have any silencing effect (less than 5%) and were used as negative controls. The sequence and effectiveness of each siRNA in silencing FOXO1 is shown in Table I.Table ISilencing effect of different siRNA design on FOXO1 expressionSiRNASequencePercent silencing%siRNA-6635′-AAGTTCATTCGTGTGCAGAAT-3′41 ± 3siRNA-7555′-AAGAGCTGCATCCATGGACAA-3′38 ± 4siRNA-8005′-AAGCCGAGCTGCCAAGAAGAA-3′23 ± 6siRNA-8905′-AAGCCCTGGCTCTCACAGCAA-3′83 ± 3siRNA-10595′-AAGATGGCCTCTACTTTACCC-3′3 ± 1siRNA-16745′-AAGACACCTGTACAAGTGCCT-3′4 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Caspases Activity—Fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA-890 or siRNA-1059 for 24 h followed by TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or vehicle treatment for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer (R&D Systems), and equal amounts of protein were tested. Caspase -3, -8, and -9 activities were assayed with a fluorimetric kit purchased from R&D Systems as we have described previously (20.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. He H. Liu R. Popek I. Graves D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52901-52908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Buffers without cell lysate and cell lysate without substrate were used as negative controls. Experiments were carried out three times with similar results. Statistical difference between samples was determined by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. RNA Profiling—Fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA-890 or siRNA-1059 for 48 h followed by TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or vehicle alone for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and QIAshredder spin column (Qiagen). After RNA sample labeling, gene expression was examined by using GeneChip human genome U133 plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Apoptosis-related genes were selected from the array data and analyzed using Data Mining Tool (DMT) software (Affymetrix). Each array was carried out twice with similar results. Each value reported represents the mean of two separate arrays. RT-PCR—Fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA-890 or siRNA-1059 for 48 h followed by stimulation with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or vehicle alone for 6 h, and total RNA was isolated as described above. RNA was converted to cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Genes of interest were amplified using a PCR kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, Bethesda, MD) that has been optimized so that the internal standard, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is amplified for the same number of cycles as the gene of interest. For each experiment the reaction was performed in duplicate and stopped after 23 or 28 cycles. When the PCR was complete, samples were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels. The optical density of each band was normalized by the value of internal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control in the same lane, and the results were analyzed at both 23 and 28 cycles. Each experiment was carried out three times with similar results. Statistical difference between cells that were transfected with siRNA 890 or siRNA 1059 was determined by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Real-time PCR was used to monitor FOXO1 mRNA levels. After reverse transcription of RNA from siRNA-transfected cells, amplification was performed using reagents from Applied Biosystems. Primers (forward, 5′-AAGGATAAGGGTGACAGCAACAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGCTGTGTAGGGACAGATTATGAC-3′) and TaqMan MGB probe (FAMAATTGAATTCTTCCAGCCCGCCMGBNFQ) sequences were chosen using Primer Express software to select at least one intron-spanning primer for each. TNF-α Activates FOXO1 in Vitro—A transcription factor array was carried out twice in which fibroblasts were stimulated by TNF (20 ng/ml) for 1 h using a kit developed by Panomics. FOXO1 was the most strongly induced and was identified as a candidate for additional studies (data not shown). Activation of FOXO1 was confirmed by measuring FOXO1 DNA binding activity through EMSA (Fig. 1). Nuclear extracts were prepared from human adult primary fibroblasts 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after TNF stimulation. Previously, we established that an optimal TNF-α concentration for stimulating apoptosis of fibroblasts is 20 ng/ml (20.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. He H. Liu R. Popek I. Graves D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52901-52908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, TNF-α stimulated a marked increase in FOXO1 DNA binding activity in comparison with that of nuclear extracts from untreated cells. Activation of FOXO1 was higher at 1 h in comparison with its activation at 3 and 6 h. Specificity of the binding activity was demonstrated by competitive inhibition with excess unlabeled oligonucleotide. In contrast, an oligonucleotide with a nonspecific sequence did not interfere with the binding of nuclear extract to a labeled DNA probe. To investigate whether NFκB was activated under the same conditions, EMSA was performed using a probe specific for NFκB (Fig. 1B). Nuclear extracts were prepared from human adult primary fibroblasts stimulated for 0, 1, 3, and 6 h with TNF-α. TNF-α stimulated activation of NFκB DNA binding activity, whereas nuclear extracts from untreated cells showed little binding activity. Similar to the FOXO1 results, activation of NFκB was higher at 1 h compared with its activation at 3 and 6 h. The specificity of the reaction was verified by competitive probe (excess unlabeled probe) and lack of competition with excess non-competitive probe. These results indicate that TNF-α is able to simultaneously activate both FOXO1 and NFκB in fibroblasts in vitro. TNF-α Activates FOXO1 in Vivo—To verify that TNF stimulation activates FOXO1 in vivo, TNF-α was inoculated subcutaneously into the connective tissue of the scalp in the mouse. Previously, we showed that injection of 200 ng of TNF-α at this location induces a moderate level of fibroblast apoptosis, whereas an equivalent injection of vehicle alone (50 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline) does not (17.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. Raptis M. Graves D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 201: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One hour after injection, the tissue was obtained and analyzed by EMSA. TNF-α in comparison with vehicle alone significantly increased FOXO1 binding to DNA (Fig. 2). These results indicate that TNF-α is able to activate FOXO1 transcription factor in vivo. Identification of siRNA That Inhibits FOXO1 Expression— Human adult dermal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA for 24 h. After RNA isolation, expression of FOXO1 was examined by real time PCR. Several different siRNA constructs were tested (Table I). siRNA-890 decreased FOXO1 mRNA by 83%, whereas siRNA-1059 and -1674 had virtually no effect and were used as negative controls in further experiments. siRNA-663, -755, and -800 reduced FOXO1 mRNA levels by 23–41%, considerably less than siRNA-890. As an additional control, siRNA-890 was shown not to affect the mRNA level of a related FOXO family member, FOXO3 (data not shown). The above experiments were carried out in the absence of TNF stimulation. The effect of siRNA-890, -1059, or -1674 on FOXO1 mRNA levels was also measured after cells had been incubated with TNF-α. siRNA-890 but not siRNA-1059 and -1674 blocked TNF induction of FOXO1 mRNA levels (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). To investigate the effect of siRNA on the activation of FOXO1, cells were transfected with siRNA for 48 h followed by stimulation with TNF-α for 1 h and analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 3B). siRNA-890 blocked EMSA detection of FOXO1 activation in response to TNF-α, whereas siRNA-1059 and -1674 did not. These results demonstrate that TNF increases the expression of FOXO1 mRNA and establishes that siRNA-890 is able to inhibit FOXO1 expression at the mRNA level and block detection by EMSA at the protein level. FOXO1 Activation Is Necessary for TNF-induced Apoptosis— The role of FOXO1 in promoting TNF-induced apoptosis was examined in fibroblasts transfected with different siRNA without or with TNF stimulation (Table II). Without TNF there was little apoptosis detected, and siRNA alone had virtually no effect. In cells stimulated with TNF-α there was a 7.5-fold increase in fibroblast apoptosis (p < 0.05). In cells transfected with siRNA-890 there was a 76% reduction in TNF-stimulated apoptosis. Cells transfected with siRNA-663, -755, and -800 inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis 38, 32, and 21% respectively consistent with their reduced capacity to silence FOXO1 compared with siRNA-890. siRNA-1059 and -1674 did not affect TNF-stimulated apoptosis.Table IIEffect of different siRNA on apoptosissiRNAApoptosis without TNF (OD)Apoptosis with TNF (OD)Percent inhibition of TNF-induced Apoptosis%Control0.197 ± 0.061.701 ± 0.19siRNA 6630.221 ± 0.051.046 ± 0.2138SiRNA 7550.239 ± 0.061.127 ± 0.1733SiRNA 8000.207 ± 0.081.358 ± 0.2220SiRNA 8900.233 ± 0.080.391 ± 0.1276SiRNA10590.226 ± 0.071.677 ± 0.192SiRNA16740.203 ± 0.091.585 ± 0.176 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of NFκB Does Not Reduce Apoptosis in Vitro—As noted above, TNF activated both FOXO1 and NFκB in the same time frame. The impact of inhibiting NFκB with SN50, a specific NFκB inhibitor, was tested (21.Xu J. Zutter M. Santaro S. Clark R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Jin G. Klika A. Callahan M. Faga B. Danzing J. Jiang Z. Li X. Stark G. Harrington J. Sherf B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by EMSA, and the extent of apoptotic activity was determined by ELISA. SN50, but not the matched control SN50M, prevented NFκB activation in response to TNF-α (Fig. 4A). However, the inhibition of NFκB did not suppress fibroblast apoptosis. In fact, the level of apoptosis was 52% higher in the presence of the SN50 inhibitor (Fig. 4B) (p < 0.05). In control experiments it was determined that the NFκB inhibitor SN50 did not affect TNF-induced FOXO1 activation and that FOXO1 siRNA-890 did not enhance TNF-stimulated NFκB activity (data not shown). Silencing of FOXO1 by siRNA Inhibits TNF-induced Caspase Activity—We have recently demonstrated that TNF induces fibroblast apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 by both caspase-8- and caspase-9-dependent pathways (17.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. Raptis M. Graves D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 201: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. He H. Liu R. Popek I. Graves D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52901-52908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We further investigated the impact of FOXO1 in mediating TNF-induced apoptosis by examining its effect on caspase activity in fibroblasts (Fig. 5). As expected, TNF strongly induced an increase in caspase-3 (790%), caspase-8 (609%), and, to a lesser extent, capase-9 activity (184%). siRNA-890 reduced TNF-enhanced caspase-3 activity by 79%, caspase-8 activity by 81%, and caspase-9 activity 86% (p <0.05). In contrast the control siRNA-1059 had little effect on TNF-α induced caspase activity. FOXO1 Controls Expression of Many Apoptotic Genes in Response to TNF Stimulation in Vitro—Experiments with microarrays were carried out to study the impact of FOXO1 on the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA-890 or siRNA-1059 followed by stimulation with TNF-α treatment. To determine which genes were dependent upon FOXO1, the effect of TNF stimulation on cells transfected with siRNA-890 was compared with cells transfected with siRNA-1059. Of 59 pro-apoptotic genes that we reported previously to be induced by TNF-α (20.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. He H. Liu R. Popek I. Graves D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52901-52908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), siRNA-890 blocked the induction of 26 genes (Table III) using a 2-fold difference as a threshold. These represent genes from several different functional families, including apoptotic ligands (5.Sha W. Liou H. Tuomanen E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), receptors (5.Sha W. Liou H. Tuomanen E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), adaptor molecules (4.Barnes P. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar), mitochondrial proteins (5.Sha W. Liou H. Tuomanen E. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), caspases (4.Barnes P. Karin M. N. Engl. J.

In addition, we reported previously that TNF inhibited the induction of nine anti-apoptotic genes. siRNA-890 reduced TNF-associated inhibition of five of these genes, which are denoted in boldfaced type in Table III.

Open table in a new tab To confirm the results obtained in RNA profiling experiments, the expression of selected apoptotic genes was measured by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was carried out using primer pairs in which an internal standard, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was run for the same number of cycles as the gene of interest. Expression of each gene was studied at both 23 and 28 cycles (Fig. 6 and Table IV). This assay demonstrates that in response to TNF stimulation, the expressions of interleukin-18, the 4-IBB ligand, the CD27 ligand, the Fas ligand, and BAX was 8.2–3.6-fold higher in the control group (transfected with siRNA-1059) than in experimental group (transfected with siRNA-890).

It has been demonstrated previously that decreased apoptosis of cells may result from enhanced expression of survival factors induced by activation of the transcription factor NFκB (9.Wang C. Mayo M.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). Considerably less is known about the role of pro-apoptotic transcription factors in mediating apoptosis induced by mediators such as TNF-α. TNF stimulates apoptosis by engagement with TNFR1, which stimulates the recruitment and assembly of adaptor proteins such as TRADD and the Fas-associated protein with death domain that eventually activate initiator caspases-8 or -9 and, finally, caspase-3, an executioner caspase (24.Yamashita K.

The accuracy of this model has been proven by caspase inhibitor studies, which clearly demonstrate that deletion of TNFR1 or inhibition of caspase-8 or caspase-3 prevents the apoptotic effect of TNF (27.Piguet P. Vesin C. Donati Y. Barazzone C. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 495-500PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Faraco P. Ledgerwood E. Vandenabeele P. Prins J. Bradley J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although this model identifies pathways though which TNF induces apoptosis, it does not explain why cells that have activation of TNFR1 do not necessarily undergo cell death, particularly because most cells have already expressed the machinery for cell death (32.Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 33.Chen G. Goeddel D. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Thus, apoptosis clearly reflects the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, which suggests a potential role for transcription factors in modulating the progression of apoptotic events. Clues to the importance of transcriptional regulation in apoptosis can also be found in temporal patterns. Although apoptosis is a very rapid cellular event taking place within 2 h, the majority of cells stimulated by TNF in vivo or in vitro do not go through apoptosis until several hours after TNF stimulation (17.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. Raptis M. Graves D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 201: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34.Sugarman B. Aggarwal B. Hass P. Figari I. Palladino M. Shepard H.

Galand P. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 447-453PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is an unexplained time lag that cannot be accounted for simply by the post-translational modifications that occur between the period of TNF signaling and caspase-mediated cell death. A possibility is that TNF must first activate a transcription factor leading to the wholesale regulation of genes that promote apoptosis. Thus, TNF-stimulated apoptosis may require two steps, one being transcriptional and the other post-translational. The requirement for a transcriptional event would explain the time lag between TNF stimulation and apoptosis. We undertook experiments to determine whether there was a central pro-apoptotic regulator analogous to the anti-apoptotic factor, NFκB. Based upon the results of a transcription factor array which was confirmed by EMSA, we identified FOXO1 as a potential regulator of TNF-stimulated, pro-apoptotic gene expression. Studies in mammalian cells have shown that the overproduction of members of the FOXO family of transcription factors induces either apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (13.Dijkers P. Medema R. Pals C.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To functionally establish the role of FOXO1 in mediating TNF-induced apoptosis, siRNA experiments were carried out. When FOXO1 was silenced by siRNA-890, the capacity of TNF-α to stimulate apoptosis was decreased by 76%. When FOXO1 was partially silenced by less effective siRNA, TNF-stimulated apoptosis was also partially inhibited. Thus, the degree to which a given siRNA decreased FOXO1 mRNA levels was proportional to its capacity to inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis. Moreover, decreased apoptosis by siRNA-890 was accompanied by a decrease in caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities. These results demonstrate that silencing FOXO1 can interrupt the post-translational pathways through which TNF stimulates apoptosis. Previously, we demonstrated that TNF acts in a global way to enhance the expression of genes that promote apoptosis and diminish the expression of several that inhibit apoptosis (20.Alikhani M. Alikhani Z. He H. Liu R. Popek I. Graves D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52901-52908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Silencing FOXO1 dramatically reduced the capacity of TNF to alter the expression of genes that promote or inhibit apoptosis. Whereas inhibition of FOXO1 prevented apoptosis, inhibition of NFκB had the opposite effect and increased apoptosis. This is in agreement with previous findings that NFκB plays an important role in survival (2.Beg A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 3.Wang J. Devalia J. Xia C. Sapsford R. Davies R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FOXO1 siRNA-890 did not reduce apoptosis by enhancing NFκB activity, and the NFκB inhibitor SN50 did not modulate FOXO1 activation. Based on the above findings, TNF stimulation of fibroblasts leads to activation of both NFκB and FOXO1 transcription factors. Under the experimental conditions tested, FOXO1 predominated because apoptosis proceeded in the presence of NFκB as long as FOXO1 expression was not blocked. FOXO1, like other FOXO family members, modulates apoptosis through regulating the expression of apoptotic genes (14.Burgering B. Medema R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 15.Rokudai S. Fujita N. Kitahara O. Nakamura Y. Tsuruo T. Mol. Cell.

This is in agreement with findings that the capacity of TNF to induce 26 of 59 pro-apoptotic genes or inhibit 5 of 9 anti-apoptotic genes was dependent upon FOXO1. Thus, FOXO1 serves as a “master regulator” of genes modulated by TNF that promote apoptosis. Expression of this master regulator is a virtual requirement for TNF-induced apoptosis.

These proteins are translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon treatment with a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus the calcium ionophore A23187. Subsequent to translocation to the nucleus, NFATc1 and NFATc2 were able to bind to a NFAT response element in the DNA, regulating transcriptional activation of genes containing a NFAT-responsive element such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production were induced upon pharmacological stimuli leading to NFAT activation and blunted by inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase with cyclosporin A or tacrolimus (FK506). Expression of NFAT wild type protein or the active catalytic subunit of calcineurin transactivates COX-2 promoter activity, whereas a dominant negative mutant of NFAT inhibited COX-2 induction in colon carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, mutation or deletion of NFAT binding sites in the human COX-2 promoter greatly diminished its induction by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/calcium ionophore A23187.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence has confirmed that NFAT is expressed in cell types other than immune cells, regulating processes as diverse as cardiac valve formation, fiber-type specification in skeletal muscle, osteoclast differentiation, neuronal development, and angiogenesis, among others (3Crabtree G.R.

The NFAT family is composed of four classical calcium-responsive members named NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4 (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar) and the recently identified calcium insensitive NFAT5 (7Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). NFAT proteins are located in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells in a highly phosphorylated form. After an increase in intracellular calcium levels, NFAT proteins are dephosphorylated by calcineurin (Cn), a serine-threonine phosphatase, and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, they bind to specific sequences in the DNA, therefore activating transcription of NFAT-dependent genes (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

One of the genes that has been reported to be regulated by NFAT in non-lymphoid tissues is cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (9Hernandez G.L. Volpert O.V. Iniguez M.A. Lorenzo E. Martinez-Martinez S. Grau R.

Kikkawa R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase enzyme have been described, COX-1 and COX-2. Both isoforms catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, the common precursor of prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes. Whereas COX-1 is expressed constitutively in the majority of tissues, COX-2 basal level expression is low in most cells but is induced by a wide variety of mitogens, hormones, and other ligands (for review, see Ref. 12Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). The COX-2 gene contains numerous regulatory regions that bind transcription factors responsible of the inducible expression of this gene in a variety of tissues in response to several stimuli (13Tanabe T. Tohnai N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Regarding the regulation of COX-2 expression by NFAT, two cis-acting elements have been identified in the COX-2 promoter region, named distal and proximal NFAT response elements. These sites are required for induction of COX-2 expression upon T cell receptor triggering in T lymphocytes (10Iñiguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol.

There is a growing body of evidence showing a close relationship among expression of COX-2 and tumor growth and angiogenesis, making this enzyme an important therapeutic target for cancer prevention (for review, see Refs. 14Subbaramaiah K.

Many human cancers display elevated COX-2 expression, and studies in COX-2 null mice have demonstrated the role of this enzyme in tumor progression and metastasis (14Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J.

Moreover, epidemiological studies have revealed a role of selective COX-2 inhibitors in decreasing the risk of developing colon cancer and in suppressing tumor growth in animal models (18Huls G.

Recent evidence supports a role of NFAT signaling in cell growth and development (4Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5Graef I.A. Chen F. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), although little information is available on NFAT expression and function in tumor cells. These observations prompted us to examine the potential role of the NFAT signaling pathway in human colon carcinoma cells. In the present study we have analyzed the expression and function of NFAT proteins in colon carcinoma cell lines, showing that these cells express NFATc1 and NFATc2. Moreover, these proteins are efficiently translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon stimulation, where they bind to NFAT response elements in the DNA, regulating transcription of target genes. We have found that NFAT plays an essential role in the regulation of COX-2 in these cells through binding to the distal and proximal NFAT elements in the promoter region of the COX-2 gene. Inhibition of the Cn/NFAT signaling pathway with CsA or FK506 severely diminished COX-2 expression and prostaglandin production. These findings demonstrate the involvement of NFAT on gene regulation in human colon carcinoma cells, with important implications in the regulation of genes involved in the tumoral phenotype such as COX-2.

Plasmid Constructs—Human COX-2 promoter constructs in pXP2LUC promoter plasmid have been described previously (10Iñiguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol.

The hemagglutinin-tagged pEF-BOS-NFATc2 expression plasmid was a generous gift of Dr. J. M. Redondo. pGFP-VIVIT contains the sequence coding for VIVIT, a specific peptide inhibitor of Cn-mediated NFAT activation (27Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) fused to the green fluorescent protein in the pEGFP.N1 plasmid (Clontech). mRNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from colon carcinoma cell lines by the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA and used for PCR amplification with human COX-2, COX-1, or GAPDH-specific primers by the RNA PCR core kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (28Iniguez M.A. Punzon C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR reaction was amplified by 20–35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified cDNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands are visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The data shown correspond to a number of cycles where the amount of amplified product is proportional to the abundance of starting material. For Northern blot analysis, RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were separated on formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nylon filters. The blots were hybridized with COX-2 and GAPDH cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) with a random primer extension kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After hybridization and washes by conventional protocols, the blots were subjected to autoradiography. Immunoblot Analysis—For whole cell extracts, cells were lysed for 30 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride). Nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts were obtained essentially as described previously (29Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1381-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 EGTA, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v), and cells were vortexed and centrifuged for 20 min at 650 × g. The supernatant was used as cytosolic extract, and the nuclear pellet was extracted with 50 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min on a rocking platform and further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Both clarified whole cell and fractionated lysates were denatured and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The anti-NFAT antisera used were anti-NFATc2 (672) and anti-NFATc1 (676). These antisera recognize both the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of NFAT (23Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L.

Signal. 2004; 16: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Monoclonal mouse anti-COX-2 (Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI)) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. β-Actin levels were determined as a control of loading in each lane with a specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—For the gel retardation assay, nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA carrier in DNA binding buffer (2% (w/v) polyvinyl ethanol, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 13 μl for 30 min on ice. Then, 50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. In competition experiments, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction mixture before the probe. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used (distal NFAT site of the human IL-2 gene, distal NFAT and proximal NFAT sites of the human COX-2 gene) have been described in Iñiguez et al. (10Iñiguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Supershift assays were performed by incubating nuclear extracts with either preimmune serum or the correspondent anti-NFAT antisera before the addition of the probe. DNA•protein complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing gel. Prostaglandin Measurement—Caco-2 cells were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, then pretreated with or without 500 ng/ml CsA for 1 h and further stimulated with PMA plus Io for a 1–24-h period. Levels of PGE2 in the culture supernatants were determined using a commercial PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, exponentially growing cells (1.5 × 105) were incubated in complete medium for 24 h at 37 °C in 24-well plates. Then a mixture of 0.5–1 μg of the correspondent reporter plasmid and 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 50 μl of Opti-MEM was added to the cells. In cotransfection experiments, 0.15–1.5 μg of the correspondent expression plasmid was included. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by using the corresponding empty expression vectors. After3hof incubation, complete medium was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 16 h. Transfected cells were exposed to different stimuli as indicated. Cells were harvested and lysed, and luciferase activity was determined by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) in a luminometer Monolight 2010 (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate. The data presented are expressed as the mean of the determinations in relative luciferase units (RLU) ± S.D. or as fold induction (observed experimental RLU/basal RLU in absence of any stimulus). A representative experiment from the several performed is shown in all cases. Activation of NFAT Transcription Factor in Caco-2 Colon Carcinoma Cells—The presence of NFATc1 or NFATc2 isoforms in the cytosol of unstimulated Caco-2 cells was shown by Western blot analysis with specific antisera against these proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). Treatment with Io and the phorbol ester PMA, pharmacological agents that activate NFAT in other cell types (31Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), promoted a rapid NFAT dephosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus. Furthermore, inhibition of the calcium-induced Cn phosphatase activity by CsA prevented NFATc1 and NFATc2 dephosphorylation and entry into the nucleus. Once NFAT is activated and translocated into the nucleus, it binds to specific sequences in the promoter region of target genes (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 32Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). To test this we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts obtained from Caco-2 cells treated for 30 min with PMA, Io, or PMA/Io using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the distal NFAT site in the IL-2 gene as the probe. As shown in Fig. 1C, although a DNA-protein complex was present in the absence of stimulus, a strong increase in the binding was observed after Io or PMA/Io treatment. As expected, the formation of this complex was abolished in extracts from cells pretreated with CsA. The specificity of the complex was determined using a 30-molar excess of unlabeled IL-2 probe as a competitor. The presence of NFAT proteins in the retarded complexes was confirmed by EMSA with nuclear extracts from Caco-2 cells and NFAT probes in the presence of a polyclonal antiserum directed against a common epitope located in the DNA binding domain of NFAT-c1, -c2, -c3, and -c4 isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1D, whereas the preimmune serum did not substantially alter the retarded complexes in samples with nuclear extracts from PMA plus Io-treated cells, incubation with the anti-all NFATs 674 antisera efficiently prevented the binding. These results along with similar data obtained in SW620 and HT-29 cell lines (data not shown) demonstrate the presence of functional NFAT proteins in colon carcinoma cells that could be activated by stimuli leading calcium mobilization and Cn activation. To address whether NFAT activation in these cells was able to mediate NFAT-dependent transcription, Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with a reporter vector containing the luciferase gene under the control of three tandem copies of the distal NFAT site of the IL-2 gene (NFAT-LUC). The behavior of this reporter upon stimulation of Caco-2 cells resembled that described in T cells (33Jain J. Lom C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas single treatment with PMA or Io led a 2–3-fold induction, combined treatment with PMA plus Io was required to get the maximal induction. On the other hand, blockade of NFAT activation by inhibition of Cn phosphatase activity with CsA attenuated the induction of the transcriptional activation of this reporter by PMA/Io (Fig. 2A). The role of Cn in the activation of NFAT proteins in carcinoma cells was further confirmed by cotransfection of the NFAT reporter construct along with an expression plasmid encoding a deletion mutant of a murine constitutively active Cn catalytic subunit (▵CAM-AI). This mutant has been described previously to efficiently substitute the calcium signal for activation of NFAT-driven transcription (25O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, cotransfection of ▵CAM-AI slightly induced NFAT-LUC reporter activity but strongly cooperated with PMA/Io to activate NFAT-dependent transcription. Both PMA/Io- and ▵CAM-AI-mediated induction of the NFAT-driven transcription was inhibited by CsA. Further analysis of the role of endogenous NFAT proteins in Caco-2 cells was performed with cotransfection of these cells with a dominant negative version of NFAT, described previously to abolish NFAT-driven promoter activity (26Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant negative form of NFAT resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the induced activity of the NFAT-LUC reporter (Fig. 2C). Additional evidence of the role of NFAT and Cn in the transcriptional activation of genes in these cells came from the fact that PMA/Io induction was blunted by cotransfection with a green fluorescent protein fused to the VIVIT peptide (GFP-VIVIT) (Fig. 2D). This peptide is based on the sequence of the highly conserved Cn binding site in the regulatory domain of NFATs and competes for binding to Cn phosphatase, inhibiting Cn-sensitive NFAT-dependent inducible expression of target genes (27Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). CsA Inhibits Induction of COX-2 Expression by PMA/Io in Caco-2 Cells—Once the role of NFAT activation in the regulation of NFAT-dependent transcription in colon carcinoma cells was established, we next evaluated its functional relevance in the expression of target genes. We examined the expression of COX-2, a gene with important implications in colon carcinoma progression (14Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 17Marnett L.J. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 55-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), which has been reported to be regulated by NFAT in several cell types (9Hernandez G.L. Volpert O.V. Iniguez M.A. Lorenzo E.

Kikkawa R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of COX-2 expression showed low levels of COX-2 mRNA in serum-starved Caco-2 cells. Both PMA or Io treatments were able to induce COX-2 mRNA, although maximal induction was observed with the combined treatment PMA/Io (Fig. 3A). Kinetics experiments showed that COX-2 mRNA induction by PMA/Io was already evident at 2 h after PMA/Io treatment (Fig. 3B). Indeed, COX-2 has been identified as an inducible early gene in response to several stimuli in different cell types (34Maier J.A. Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10805-10808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Herschman H.R. Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 89-99PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, induction of COX-2 expression by PMA/Io was completely suppressed by actinomycin D (ActD), an inhibitor of transcription, indicating that the increase in mRNA levels occurs mainly at the transcriptional level, requiring new RNA synthesis (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, inhibition of translation by cycloheximide (CHX), although stimulating the steady state levels of COX-2 mRNA, did not affect the stimulation of COX-2 transcription. These results support the hypothesis that COX-2 behaves as an early gen"

The long form (IP3R2 SIm2+) was dominant, but the short form (IP3R2 SIm2–) was detected in all tissues examined. IP3R2 SIm2– has neither IP3 binding activity nor Ca2+ releasing activity. In addition to its reticular distribution, IP3R2 SIm2+ is present in the form of clusters in the endoplasmic reticulum of resting COS-7 cells, and after ATP or Ca2+ ionophore stimulation, most of the IP3R2 SIm2+ is in clusters.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar) and causes Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by binding to the IP3 receptor (IP3R), which is an IP3-gated intracellular Ca2+ release channel. Ca2+ release in the cytoplasm occurs in complex spatial and temporal patterns, such as Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ oscillations, and regulates many cellular responses, including fertilization, muscle contraction, secretion, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity (1Berridge M.J.

Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) IP3R1. These findings suggest that the channels composed of different isoforms possess distinctive functions, but little is known about the physiological significance and exact functional differences arising from the heterotetrameric assembly of IP3R. In many cells, the Ca2+ increase triggered by IP3 is propagated throughout the cytoplasm; however, the diffusion of free Ca2+ is spatially restricted because many immobile or slowly diffusing Ca2+-binding proteins are present in the cytoplasm (27Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Propagation of Ca2+ is thought to be mediated by regenerative Ca2+ release through IP3Rs, which are regulated by cytoplasmic Ca2+ (28Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Positive feedback regulation of IP3R by Ca2+ enables the Ca2+ released by one receptor to excite its neighbors, thereby igniting a regenerative Ca2+ wave. Confocal imaging has shown that Ca2+ waves are generated by elementary release events, such as Ca2+ puffs, that remain tightly localized within a few micrometers (29Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 30Parker I. Choi J. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because localized groups of IP3R within the range of diffusion of the Ca2+ released are likely to be linked together as functional units to generate Ca2+ puffs, the spatial arrangement of IP3Rs may be a critical component in controlling the spatiotemporal patterns of intracellular Ca2+. IP3R is mainly localized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (31Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1990; 15: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ER is normally contiguous throughout the cell and forms a membranous network that is the site for Ca2+ storage, lipid biosynthesis, and the processing and quality control of newly synthesized proteins. All three types of recombinant IP3R expressed in cultured cells are distributed uniformly within the cell (5Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Ramos-Franco J. Bare D. Caenepeel S. Nani A. Fill M. Mignery G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1388-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that the spatial distribution of IP3Rs in ER membranes is not primarily restricted. However, there is evidence that IP3R is unevenly distributed in specific cell types or in specific states of the cell. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, IP3R is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, including the dendritic spines (31Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1990; 15: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but is not present in the ER in the spines of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (34Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In subconfluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, IP3R1 is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm, whereas in the polarized confluent state its distribution is restricted to the basolateral membrane domains (35Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Wilson et al. (36Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Smith A.J. Oliver J.M. Oberdorf J.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that the distribution of IP3R2 expressed in RBL-2H3 cells and AR4-2J cells, and the IP3R3 expressed in E36M3R cells, dramatically changes upon stimulation of cell surface receptors linked to IP3 production. The IP3Rs in these cells rapidly aggregate in the form of clusters in ER membranes after cell stimulation. Exposure to ionomycin or thapsigargin also induced IP3R clustering, indicating that the process is Ca2+-dependent. Despite these lines of evidence, little is known about the fundamental mechanism that controls the intracellular distribution of IP3Rs. Receptor-mediated generation of IP3 initiates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of Ca2+ entry from outside the cells (37Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). The nature of the Ca2+ entry channels has yet to be characterized (38Penner R. Fleig A. Science's STKE. 2004; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;2004/pe38)PubMed Google Scholar), but they appear to function to maintain a relatively constant concentration of Ca2+ in the intracellular Ca2+ stores and to provide sustained Ca2+ signal phase. The mechanism of activation of the Ca2+ entry channels remains elusive, but there is experimental evidence that an IP3-dependent conformational change in the IP3R, but not the Ca2+ channel activity of the IP3Rs, is coupled with the activation of the Ca2+ entry pathway (39van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Kiselyov K. Boehning D. Barrow R.K. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated the cDNAs of IP3R2 and IP3R3 from mouse lung, and we determined their complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences. We also identified a novel alternative splicing variant of IP3R2 in which 33 amino acids are deleted. Visualization of the intracellular distribution of these receptors before and after cell stimulation revealed a type-specific difference in receptor localization, and that the alternative splicing variant of IP3R2 possesses the specific function of controlling the distribution of other types of IP3R. We also found that the expression of the splice variant of IP3R2 influences the agonist-induced Ca2+ entry. These results provide us with a novel insight into the molecular mechanism that controls the intracellular distribution of IP3Rs and the functional significance of the newly identified type 2 receptor splice variant. Molecular Cloning of Mouse IP3R2 and IP3R3 cDNAs—Total RNA was isolated from the lungs of C57BL/6J mice by a guanidinium/acid phenol method (40Futatsugi A. Kuwajima G. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was obtained from 2 μg of mouse lung total RNA with reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) and a random hexamer. After RNase H (Invitrogen) treatment, an aliquot of the transcript was subjected to PCR amplification with LA Taq polymerase (Takara). To clone IP3R2 cDNA, PCR was performed with three pairs of primers (Table I), and the design was based on the nucleotide sequence of rat IP3R2: 2P-1 and 2P-2 for fragment 2N, 2P-3 and 2P-4 for fragment 2M, and 2P-5 and 2P-6 for fragment 2C. The following three pairs of primers were used for IP3R3: 3P-1 and 3P-2 for fragment 3N, 3P-3 and 3P-4 for fragment 3M, and 3P-5 and 3P-6 for fragment 3C. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and appropriate DNA fragments were recovered. The fragments were subcloned into pT7Blue-T-Vector (Novagen) and sequenced with an ALF sequencer (Amersham Biosciences) and an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). At least 10 independent clones were sequenced for each fragment. An oligo(dT) primer and type-specific primers, 2P-7 and 3P-7, were used for the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system (Invitrogen). The PCR products were subcloned and were sequenced as described above.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the Genomic Structure of Mouse IP3R2—Genomic DNA was prepared from C57BL/6J mouse lung. Subdivided lung (0.5 g) was incubated at 55 °C for 12–18 h in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. After treatment with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, genomic DNA was prepared by ethanol precipitation. After RNase A treatment, genomic DNA was subjected to PCR with a pair of primers, 2P-8 and 2P-9, that cover the SIm2 segment. The PCR product was subcloned into pT7Blue-T-Vector for DNA sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of the genomic DNA was aligned with that of IP3R2 cDNA with DNASIS software (Hitachi). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed as described elsewhere (41Nakayama H. Yokoi H. Fujita J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Total RNAs isolated from various mouse tissues were used as templates for the reverse transcription reaction. The products (0.2 μg each) were amplified by PCR with the primers 2P-8 and 2P-9. PCR was performed in 10 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) containing 200 μm dNTPs, 150 μm of each primer, and 0.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were applied to 6% acrylamide gels and stained with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes). The fluorescence intensity of the products corresponding to IP3 R2 SIm2+ (404 bp) and IP3 R2 SIm2– (305 bp), both of whose products were produced in the same tube, was measured with FluoroImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with an Image-Quant software (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence intensity was plotted against the number of amplification cycles, and the data in the linear portion of semi-logarithmic graphs were fitted with Equation 1, y=A0ekn(Eq. 1) where y is fluorescence intensity; A0 is the initial amount of template; k is a constant that depends on the experimental conditions and primers used, and n is the number of amplification cycles. The relative amounts of splicing variants were calculated from the values of A0. The values of the constant k for IP3R2 SIm2+ and IP3R2 SIm2– were indistinguishable. Construction of Recombinant Baculovirus Transfer Vectors Carrying IP3R cDNAs—The full-length cDNA of mouse IP3R1 was isolated from pBactS-C1 (15Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) by using XbaI sites and was subcloned into the XbaI site of baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen) to generate pBlueBac4.5-C1. To construct the full-length cDNAs of mouse IP3R2 SIm2+, the 2.3-kbp HindIII-KpnI fragment from pT7Blue-2N, the 2.7-kbp KpnI-BamHI fragment from pT7Blue-2M, and the 3.3-kbp BamHI-SalI fragment from pT7Blue-2C were ligated with the 2.9-kbp HindIII-SalI fragment of pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) to generate pBluescriptII-C2. The plasmid that contains the full-length cDNA of IP3R2 SIm2–, pBluescriptII-C2[SIm2–], was constructed essentially in the same manner except for the use of pT7Blue-2N′ in which 99 nucleotides were deleted. The full-length cDNAs of IP3R2 SIm2+ and SIm2– were subcloned into pBlueBac4.5 using SalI sites to generate pBlue-Bac4.5-C2 and pBlueBac4.5-C2[SIm2–], respectively. The full-length cDNA of mouse IP3R3 was constructed as follows. The 6.2-kbp BssHII-SalI fragment from pT7Blue-3M and the 2.7-kbp BssHII-SalI fragment from pT7Blue-3C were ligated to create pT7Blue-3MC. The 2.6-kbp EcoRI-MluI fragment from pT7Blue-3N and the 5.6-kbp MluI-SalI fragment from pT7Blue-3MC were ligated with the 2.9-kbp EcoRI-SalI fragment from pBluescript II KS(+) to construct pBluescriptII-C3. The full-length cDNA of mouse IP3R3 isolated from pBluescriptII-C3 was inserted into pBlueBac4.5 by using SalI sites, and pBlueBac4.5-C3 was constructed. Transient Expression of Mouse IP3Rs in Sf9 Cells—Each recombinant baculovirus transfer vector (pBlueBac4.5-C1, pBlueBac4.5-C2, pBlueBac4.5-C2[SIm2–], and pBlueBac4.5-C3) was cotransfected into Sf9 cells with linearized Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (Bac-N-Blue Transfection kit, Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses were amplified and used for expression of mouse IP3Rs in Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (42Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Generation of Stable Cell Lines from R23-11 Cells—The full-length cDNA of IP3R2 SIm2+ or IP3R2 SIm2– was subcloned into the SalI site of pAneo Vector II (43Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to generate pAneo-C2 and pAneo-C2[SIm2–], respectively. These plasmids were then linearized by NotI digestion and introduced into R23-11 cells as described previously (43Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to obtain stable cell lines. Transient Expression of Mouse IP3Rs in COS-7 Cells—The full-length cDNA of IP3R2 SIm2+ and IP3R2 SIm2– was subcloned into the SalI site of pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3-C2 and pcDNA3-C2[SIm2–], respectively. The plasmids pAneo-C2 and pAneo-C2[SIm2–] were also used for transient expression. The full-length cDNA of mouse IP3R3 was subcloned into the SalI site of pBact-STneoB (32Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to generate pBact-STneoB-C3. To express green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged IP3R3, the following plasmids were constructed. The 4-kbp XbaI fragment from pBluescriptII-C3 was inserted into the XbaI site of pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ containing cDNA of GFP-IP3R1-N (44Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The 5′-part of mouse IP3R3 was amplified with primers 3P-8 and 3P-9 by using pBluescriptII-C3 as a PCR template. The 1.5-kbp BfrI fragment of the PCR product was replaced with the 12-kbp BfrI fragment, which contains cDNA of mouse IP3R1 and part of mouse IP3R3, in the above chimeric plasmid. Then the 6.9-kbp SacII fragment from pBluescrip-tII-C3 was replaced with the 0.9-kbp SacII fragment of the plasmid to generate GFP-tagged mouse IP3R3 expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo+-EC3. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection of COS-7 cells with the recombinant plasmids (pcDNA3-C2, pAneo-C2[SIm2–], pcDNA3.1/Zeo+-EC3, and pBact-STneoB-C3) was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT-LT1 regent (Mirus Corp.). Cells were fixed 48 h after transfection. Transient Expression of Mouse IP3R2 SIm2+ and IP3R2 SIm2– in CHO-K1 Cells—To construct pEF-C2-IRES-GFP and pEF-C2[SIm2–]-IRES-GFP, the 8.2-kbp XbaI fragments from pAneo-C2 and pAneo-C2[SIm2–], respectively, were inserted into the XbaI site of pEF-GSTm30-IRES-GFP, 2T. Morimura, unpublished data. which was derived from a mammalian expression vector, pEF-BOS (45Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were cultured in the same manner as described above for COS-7 cells, and they were transfected with these expression vectors with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Corp.). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To substitute alanine for both lysine 507 and arginine 510 in IP3R2 SIm2+ and IP3R3, mutagenesis was performed with a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers containing the appropriate substitutions. Primers 2P-10 (sense) and 2P-11 (antisense) were used for IP3R2 SIm2+. The 6-kbp KpnI fragment was deleted from pBluescriptII-C2, and the shortened plasmid was used as a template for the mutagenesis. After mutagenesis, the 2.3-kbp HindIII-KpnI fragment was replaced with the 2.3-kbp HindIII-KpnI fragment of pcDNA3-C2. Primers 3P-10 (sense) and 3P-11 (antisense) were used for IP3R3. The 6.4-kbp SpeI fragment was deleted from pBlueBac4.5-C3, and the shortened plasmid was used as a template. After mutagenesis, the 6.4-kbp SpeI fragment from pBlue-Bac4.5-C3 was replaced in the plasmid. The 6.9-kbp SacII fragment, into which mutations had been introduced, was replaced with the 6.9-kbp SacII fragment of pcDNA3.1/Zeo+-EC3. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Microsome Fractions—Microsome fractions were prepared from Sf9 and R23-11 cells as described previously (42Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were suspended in cytosol-like medium (CLM) (110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Membrane fractions of liver and testis were prepared from C57BL/6J mice as described previously (32Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged IP3Rs expressed in COS-7 cells with an anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed as described previously (46Ando H. Mizutani A. Matsu-ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10602-10612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). IP3 Binding Assay—Equilibrium IP3 binding analysis was performed as described previously (42Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions (20 or 50 μg) in CLM containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mm EGTA were incubated with 2.2–8.7 nm [3H]IP3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and various concentrations of unlabeled IP3 (Dojindo). To avoid tracer depletion, the amount of the membrane fraction and the concentration of [3H] IP3 were adjusted for each experiment. Nonspecific binding was determined on the basis of the linear relationship between total IP3 concentration and the amount of IP3 binding to nonreceptor sites. Nonspecific IP3 binding was measured by using membrane fractions prepared from uninfected Sf9 cells. Nonlinear regression of IP3 binding data were performed with Igor Pro (version 4.04, WaveMetrics) software. Ca2+Release Studies in Permeabilized Cells—Stable cell lines that express mouse IP3R2 SIm2+ or SIm2– (5 × 107 cells) established from R23-11 cells were permeabilized in CLM containing 40 μm β-escin at 30 °C for 10 min. After washing with CLM, cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of CLM, which was pretreated with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad), containing 25 mm creatine phosphate, 50–100 units/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, and 2 μm Fura-2. Fluorescence of Fura-2 was recorded at 510 nm with alternate excitation of 340 and 380 nm by using the spectrofluorometer CAF-110 (Japan Spectroscopic Co.). When the fluorescent intensity reached a steady state level, 5 μm"
https://openalex.org/W2160561007,"Exposure to agricultural insecticides, together with yet incompletely understood predisposing genotype/phenotype elements, notably increase the risk of Parkinson's disease. Here, we report findings attributing the increased risk in an insecticide-exposed rural area in Israel to interacting debilitating polymorphisms in the ACHE/PON1 locus and corresponding expression variations. Polymorphisms that debilitate PON1 activity and cause impaired AChE overproduction under anticholinesterase exposure were strongly overrepresented in patients from agriculturally exposed areas, indicating that they confer risk of Parkinson's disease. Supporting this notion, serum AChE and PON1 activities were both selectively and significantly lower in patients than in healthy individuals and in carriers of the risky polymorphisms as compared with other Parkinsonian patients. Our findings suggest that inherited interactive weakness of AChE and PON1 expression increases the insecticide-induced occurrence of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2121617717,"Recent work has shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β (PPARβ) attenuates cell proliferation and skin carcinogenesis, and this is due in part to regulation of ubiquitin C expression. In these studies, the role of PPARβ in modulating ubiquitin-dependent protein kinase Cα (PKCα) levels and phosphorylation signaling pathways was evaluated. Intracellular phosphorylation analysis showed that phosphorylated PKCα and other kinases were lower in wild-type mouse skin treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as compared with PPARβ-null mouse skin. No differences in expression levels of other PKC isoforms present in skin were observed. Lower ubiquitination of PKCα was found in TPA-treated PPARβ-null skin as compared with wild-type, and inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation prevented TPA-induced down-regulation of PKCα. The activity of PKCα and downstream signaling kinases is enhanced, and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is significantly greater, in PPARβ-null mouse skin in response to TPA compared with wild-type mouse skin. Inhibition of PKCα or COX-2 reduced cell proliferation in TPA-treated PPARβ-null keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it only slightly influenced cell proliferation in wild-type keratinocytes. Combined, these studies provide strong evidence that PPARβ attenuates cell proliferation by modulating PKCα/Raf1/MEK/ERK activity that may be due in part to reduced ubiquitin-dependent turnover of PKCα.

Intracellular communication with the external environment, including xenobiotic exposure, can be mediated by receptor/ligand-binding activity of a number of soluble receptors. Receptor activation in response to ligand binding leads to changes in target gene expression that ultimately modulate cellular processes but can also be influenced by intracellular communication facilitated by various signaling networks. Among the pathways that can influence receptor-mediated signaling are protein phosphorylation events that are central to the mechanisms that modulate various signaling pathways leading to changes in cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase/ERK kinase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HBDDE, 2,2′,3,3′,4,4′-hexahydroxy-1,1′-biphenyl-6,6′-dimethanol dimethyl ether; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; ANOVA, analysis of variance. are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and are ligand-activated transcription factors (1Shearer B.G.

PPARs modulate target gene expression in response to ligand activation after heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor α and binding to peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements of target genes. There are three different PPAR isoforms, designated PPARα, PPARβ (also referred to as PPARδ), and PPARγ, each with distinct physiological functions (1Shearer B.G. Hoekstra W.J. Curr. Med.

For example, PPARα mediates the pleiotropic effects of peroxisome proliferators, in particular the regulation of lipid homeostasis and rodent hepatocarcinogenesis (4Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J.

In contrast to the lipid catabolic function of PPARα, PPARγ mediates adipocyte differentiation and is particularly important for the regulation of glucose homeostasis (8Akiyama T.E. Sakai S.

The hyperplastic response to TPA in the epidermis is enhanced in PPARβ-null mice, suggesting that this receptor is critical for attenuating epidermal cell proliferation (24Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T.

The exacerbated TPA-induced hyperplasia observed in PPARβ-null mice is likely the result of the lack of increased apoptosis and enhanced replicative DNA synthesis (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S.

Results from a two-stage carcinogen bioassay show that skin tumor formation, tumor size, and tumor multiplicity are significantly enhanced in PPARβ-null mice compared with wild-type mice (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S. Burns A.M. Shan W. Ward J.M. Kennett M.J. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23719-23727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), demonstrating that PPARβ-dependent attenuation of cell proliferation is functionally significant. However, the mechanisms by which PPARβ mediates attenuation of cell proliferation remain to be fully elucidated. Evidence exists demonstrating that TPA-induced expression of ubiquitin C and the resulting intracellular free ubiquitin pool is transcriptionally regulated by PPARβ and that ubiquitination of proteins induced by TPA is reduced in the absence of PPARβ expression (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S. Burns A.M. Shan W. Ward J.M. Kennett M.J. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23719-23727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). That PPARβ-dependent regulation of ubiquitin C expression contributes to the mechanisms leading to attenuation of cell proliferation is supported by the observation that inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated protein turnover leads to exacerbated hyperplasia in wild-type mouse skin (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S. Burns A.M. Shan W. Ward J.M. Kennett M.J. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23719-23727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A number of cell signaling components, including kinases such as protein kinase C, are involved in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Further, the presence of these kinases can be modulated by protein turnover that is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (29Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Vinitsky A. Smith J.B. J. Biol.

For these reasons, in these studies, the role of PPARβ in the regulation of kinases known to stimulate signaling cascade(s) associated with epithelial cell proliferation was examined. Mouse Treatments—To examine the role of PPARβ on early events mediated by tumor promotion, skin samples were isolated within 8 h post-TPA application (5 μg/mouse) from both wild-type or PPARβ-null mice (24Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) and used for isolation of either protein or total RNA as described below. To examine the role of PPARβ after repeated exposure to tumor promotion, wild-type or PPARβ-null mice were treated topically with TPA (5 μg/mouse), followed 48 h later by an additional topical treatment with TPA. Twenty-four hours after the second treatment with TPA, skin samples were obtained from mice and used for isolation of either protein or total RNA as described below. Protein Isolation—Skin samples from wild-type or PPARβ-null (control and TPA-treated) mice were used to prepare cytosolic proteins. Skin samples were placed in liquid nitrogen and then ground to a fine powder before evaporation of the liquid nitrogen. Ground skin was then homogenized further in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was used for the microsome fraction. The protein concentration of each sample was quantified using the BCA detection system (Pierce). Phosphoprotein Analysis—Detection of phosphorylated proteins that regulate signaling cascade(s) associated with epithelial cell proliferation was performed by Kinexus using the Kinetworks™ KPSS-1.0 Screen (Kinexus Inc., Cary, Canada) using cytosolic protein samples from wild-type or PPARβ-null (control and TPA treated) mouse skin isolated 8 h post-TPA treatment (5 μg/mouse/application). Proteins of interest were further examined using Western blot analysis to confirm differences detected with the Kinetworks™ KPSS-1.0 Screen. 25–50 μg of cytosol protein from wild-type or PPARβ-null (control and TPA treated) skin samples or keratinocytes was resolved using SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using an electroblotting method. After blocking in 5% milk in TBST, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, followed by incubation with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected after incubation in 125I-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) using phosphorimaging analysis. Hybridization signals for specific proteins of interest were normalized to the hybridization signal of the housekeeping protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-phospho-PKCα (S657, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-PKCα (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-phospho-PKCδ (S643, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-PKCδ (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-phospho-PKCϵ (S729, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-PKCϵ (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-phospho-PKCμ (S744/748, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-PKCμ (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-PKCη (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (S217/221, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-MEK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-ERK1/2 (Promega, Madison, WI), anti-COX-2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), and anti-LDH (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA). Immunoprecipitation of PKCα—Cytosolic fractions isolated from wild-type or PPARβ-null skin 1–8 h post-TPA treatment (see above) were prepared as described above. PKCα was immunoprecipitated from 400 μg of skin cytosol using a monoclonal anti-mouse PKCα antibody (BD Biosciences) pre-bound to Protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound resin was used for control immunoprecipitations. Binding of antibody to resin was performed in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C with rocking. After washing, skin cytosol was immunoprecipitated in the presence of buffer for 1.5 h with rocking. After immunoprecipitation, samples were washed five times in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was washed with TBST, blocked with 5% milk in TBST, and probed with either a polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Sigma) or a polyclonal anti-PKCα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive protein was detected after incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the immunoreactive proteins was determined with Image J software (Version 1.30, National Institutes of Health). Co-treatment of TPA and MG-132—Wild-type or PPARβ-null mice were treated topically with MG-132 twice as described previously (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S. Burns A.M. Shan W. Ward J.M. Kennett M.J. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23719-23727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to inhibit ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation, followed by 5 μg of TPA dissolved in 200 μl of acetone 15 min after the last MG-132 application. Skin samples were collected 8 h post-TPA application for Western blot analysis of PKCα as described above. Protein Kinase C, Raf1, and ERK Activities—PKC activity was determined by measuring the ability of activated PKC to phosphorylate a substrate in vitro (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Raf1 activity and ERK1/2 activity were determined by measuring the ability of immunoprecipitated Raf1 or ERK1/2 to phosphorylate a substrate in vitro (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Cytosol from mice treated topically twice with TPA as described above was used for these assays, following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Keratinocyte Culture—A described previously method (31Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was used to culture primary keratinocytes obtained from 2-day-old neonates from wild-type or PPARβ-null mice. Briefly, equivalent numbers of keratinocytes were seeded and cultured in low calcium medium (0.05 mm). After 48 h of culture, culture medium was changed to either control low calcium medium, or low calcium medium containing 25 ng TPA/ml for 1 h. After this 1-h pulse treatment, culture medium was replaced with low calcium medium for the remainder of the culture period. To determine the effect of PKCα or COX-2 inhibition on keratinocyte proliferation, culture medium was replaced with either control low calcium medium, or low calcium medium containing selective inhibitors of PKCα (HBDDE, 0.4–25.0 μm, or chelerythrine chloride, 0.02–1.0 μm) or COX-2 (NS-398, 5–10 μm), after the 1-h pulse treatment with TPA. After 24, 48, or 96 h of culture, cell proliferation was measured using a Z1 coulter particle counter® (Beckman Counter, Inc., Hialeah, FL). RNA Isolation—Samples of cultured keratinocytes from wild-type or PPARβ-null mice were obtained either 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 9 h after a 1-h pulse treatment of TPA (25 ng/ml). Isolation of RNA was performed using TRIzol extraction and the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Total RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by spectrophotometry. Northern Blot Analysis—To examine expression of markers of cell proliferation, cyclin B, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in cells that were treated with TPA, 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.22 m formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and cross-linked with ultraviolet to fix the RNA. Membranes were hybridized in ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) with described previously random primed probes (24Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), following the manufacturer's protocol, and washed with salt/detergent solutions using standard procedures. PPARβ-dependent Regulation of PKCα—To determine if PPARβ influences kinase signaling associated with epidermal cell proliferation and skin carcinogenesis, a Kinetworks™ KPSS-1.0 Screen was performed. Of the proteins examined, significantly higher levels of phosphorylated PKCα, MEK1/2, and p42MAPK/ERK-2 were found in the skin of PPARβ-null mouse treated with TPA as compared with TPA-treated wild-type mice (data not shown). Western blot analysis confirmed the changes in phosphoproteins detected with the Kinetworks™ KPSS-1.0 Screen (Fig. 1A and 2B). Notably, a lower level of phospho-PKCα was detected in wild-type mouse skin 8 h post-TPA treatment, whereas the level of phospho-PKCα was greater in similarly treated samples from PPARβ-null mice (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Elevated PKC activity stimulates downstream targets in PPARβ-null mouse skin.A, Enhanced Raf1 activity is associated with increased PKC activity in PPARβ-null mouse skin, in response to TPA.

Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Vinitsky A. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20973-20976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine if down-regulation of PKCα by TPA treatment in skin is a consequence of reduced ubiquitination, PKCα was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKCα antibody and probed with either an anti-ubiquitin or anti-PKCα antibody. There was a time-dependent increase in the level of PKCα ubiquitination between 1 and 8 h post-TPA in wild-type mouse skin, and this effect was not found in TPA-treated PPARβ-null mouse skin (Fig. 1B). This suggests that PPARβ-null mice are refractory to TPA-induced ubiquitination of PKCα. This is consistent with the previously reported decrease in ubiquitination of proteins observed in TPA-treated PPARβ-null mouse skin (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S. Burns A.M. Shan W. Ward J.M. Kennett M.J. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23719-23727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The elevated level of PKCα associated with a diminished rate of ubiquitination in PPARβ-null mice suggests that the increased level of PKCα could be the result of reduced ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated turnover. To examine this hypothesis, the effect of proteasomal inhibition by MG-132 on PKCα expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis. As shown previously (Fig. 1A), TPA treatment caused a reduction in phospho-PKCα in wild-type mice (Fig. 1C). Co-treatment with MG-132, a potent inhibitor of proteasome-mediated protein turnover (using the same protocol that results in exacerbated TPA-induced hyperplasia in wild-type mouse skin (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S. Burns A.M. Shan W. Ward J.M. Kennett M.J. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23719-23727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), prevented the effect of TPA alone, resulting in a 30% increase in phospho-pKCα, whereas MG-132 alone had no effect of PKCα levels (Fig. 1C). Combined, these results suggest that the lack of TPA-induced expression of ubiquitin C in the absence of PPARβ that is known to lead to lower levels of free ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins (25Kim D.J. Akiyama T.E. Harman F.S. Burns A.M. Shan W. Ward J.M. Kennett M.J. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23719-23727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), contributes to reduced turnover of PKCα and subsequent ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation. To determine the role of PPARβ in mediating alterations in PKCα levels and activity in a system that more closely models that which occurs during a two-stage chemical carcinogen bioassay (e.g. repeated treatment with TPA), the effect of TPA after two topical doses was examined. The level of phospho-PKCα was lower than control in wild-type mice after two repeated treatments with TPA (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the level of phospho-PKCα in PPARβ-null mice was significantly higher than similarly treated wild-type mice, but lower as compared with control PPARβ-null mice (Fig. 1D). To determine if the difference in PKCα levels detected was specific for PKCα, analysis of the other PKC isoforms found in skin (32Cataisson C. Joseloff E. Murillas R. Wang A. Atwell C. Torgerson S. Gerdes M. Subleski J. Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. Wiltrout R.H. Vinson C. Yuspa S.H. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2703-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was performed. Although the level of phosphorylated PKCδ was unchanged in response to TPA treatment in either genotype, the level of phosphorylated PKCϵ and PKCμ was decreased and increased, respectively, after TPA treatment (Fig. 1D). No difference in the level of phosphorylated PKCϵ or PKCμ was detected between genotypes. The non-phosphorylated form of PKCη was also increased in response to TPA in both genotypes (Fig. 1D). Combined, these results show that the change in PKCα levels in TPA-treated wild-type and PPARβ-null mouse skin are specific for this PKC isoform. PKC activity was measured with an in vitro kinase assay to determine if the differences detected by Western blot analysis reflected functional differences in enzyme activity. The data revealed a strong correlation between the protein level of PKCα and total PKC activity in both wild-type and PPARβ-null skin cytosol. In wild-type samples, PKC activity decreased after TPA treatment (Fig. 1E), consistent with differences detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). In contrast, PKC activity was markedly higher in PPARβ-null skin samples (Fig. 1E) as compared with controls, and this was also similar to the level of protein detected. Downstream Targets of PKCα Are Elevated in TPA-treated PPARβ-null Mouse Skin—PKCα can activate a wide range of downstream targets, including the Raf1 and MAPK/ERK pathways (33Kolch W. Heidecker G.

Most notably, CS/DS hybrid chains (E-CS/DS) purified from embryonic pig brains bind growth factors and promote neurite outgrowth toward embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons in culture. However, the neuritogenic mechanism is not well understood. Here we showed that pleiotrophin (PTN), a heparin-binding growth factor, produced mainly by glia cells, was the predominant binding partner for E-CS/DS in the membrane-associated protein fraction of neonatal rat brain. The CS/DS chains were separated on a PTN column into unbound, low affinity, and high affinity fractions. The latter two fractions promoted outgrowth of dendrite- and axon-like neurites, respectively, whereas the unbound fraction showed no such activity. The activity of the low affinity fraction was abolished by an anti-PTN antibody or when glia cells were removed from the culture. In contrast, the high affinity fraction displayed activity under both these conditions. Hence, PTN mainly from glia cells mediated the activity of the low affinity but not the high affinity fraction. The anti-CS antibody 473HD neutralized the neuritogenic activities of both fractions. Interaction analysis indicated that the 473HD epitope and PTN-binding domains in the E-CS/DS chains largely overlap. The three affinity subfractions differed in disaccharide composition and the distribution of l-iduronic acid-containing disaccharides along the chains. Oversulfated disaccharides and nonconsecutive iduronic acid-containing units were the requirements for the E-CS/DS chains to bind PTN and to exhibit the neuritogenic activities. Thus, CS subpopulations with distinct structures in the mammalian brain play different roles in neuritogenesis through distinct molecular mechanisms, at least in part by regulating the functions of growth factors.

CS and DS are synthesized as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains of PGs and consist of repeating disaccharide units of -GlcUA-GalNAc- and -IdoUA-GalNAc-, respectively, and also exist as CS/DS hybrid chains composed of both units in varying proportions. Recent studies have demonstrated that the disaccharide composition and the GlcUA/IdoUA ratio of brain CS/DS chains change during development (4Oohira A. Matsui F. Matsuda M. Shoji R. J.

The effects of CS/DS chains on neurite formation are controversial. During development, strong immunostaining for CS is often localized at the boundaries of brain subregions such as the roof plate and midline dorsal tectum acting as barriers to migrating neurons or extending axons (9Snow D.M. Steindler D.A. Silver J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 10Oakley R.A. Tosney K.W. Dev.

In vitro, CS chains inhibit the migration of neurons and outgrowth of neurites on defined growth-promoting substrata (13Dou C.L. Levine J.M. J.

Tuszynski M.H. J.

However, tissues expressing CS do not always exclude the entry of axons, and in some cases immunostained CS coincides with developing axon pathways (19Bicknese A.R. Sheppard A.M. O'Leary D.D. Pearlman A.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3500-3510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20McAdams B.D. McLoon S.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 352: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that some CS-PGs and CS/DS chains promote rather than inhibit neurite outgrowth under certain conditions (21Lafont F. Rouget M. Triller A. Prochiantz A. Rousselet A. Development (Camb.). 1992; 114: 17-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DSD-1-PG (22Garwood J. Schnadelbach O. Clement A. Schutte K. Bach A. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3888-3899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mouse homologue of rat phosphacan, promotes neurite outgrowth toward embryonic rat hippocampal neurons, and this effect is neutralized by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 473HD, which recognizes the DSD-1 epitope embedded in the CS side chains (23Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Further investigations (6Clement M.A. Nadanaka S. Masayama K.

Recent studies suggest a contribution of IdoUA-containing disaccharides to the neuritogenic activity of CS/DS hybrid chains derived from DSD-1-PG/phosphacan of neonatal mouse brain (25Hikino M.

However, the mechanism underlying the neuritogenic activity of CS/DS chains is not well understood. Most interestingly, CS/DS chains (E-CS/DS) purified from embryonic pig brains promoted the outgrowth of dendrite-like neurites toward embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons and bound various growth factors, which have been implicated in neuronal regulation including neuronal adhesion (28Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37407-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Muramatsu T. Trends Glycosci.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). On the other hand, brain CS/DS chains bind various extracellular matrix molecules and cell adhesion molecules such as neuronglia cell adhesion molecules, neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule-related molecules, F3/contactin, tenascin-C, etc. (1Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 30Maeda N. Connect. Tissue. 2003; 35: 19-23Google Scholar). Here we identified a specific ligand, which regulates the neuritogenic activity of E-CS/DS chains using affinity chromatography on an E-CS/DS-coupled matrix, as pleiotrophin (PTN). The structural characteristics of the functional E-CS/DS chains for the binding of PTN and the recognition by mAb 473HD were also clarified. CS/DS subpopulations of the embryonic pig brain with distinct structures were shown to play different roles in neuritogenesis through distinct molecular mechanisms at least in part by regulating the functions of a heparin-binding growth factor PTN. Materials—Embryonic pigs (body weight 570–620 g) were purchased from a local pig-raising company, and neonatal Wistar rats and pregnant ddY mice were obtained from SLC Inc (Shizuoka, Japan). CS-A from whale cartilage, CS-B from porcine skin, CS-C and CS-D from shark cartilage, CS-E from squid cartilage, mouse mAb CS-56 and MO-225, amino-cellulofine gel, chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase AC-I, chondroitinase B and Streptomyces hyaluronidase were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Actinase E was purchased from Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Sep-Pak Plus Accell™ anion-exchange cartridges were supplied by Waters (Milford, MA), and a Superdex 75HR column (10 × 300 mm), a Superdex Peptide HR column (10 × 300 mm), prepacked disposable PD-10 columns, a silver staining kit, a HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated affinity column (1 ml), and protein G-Sepharose 4FF were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates were purchased from Nalge Nunc International (Roskilde, Denmark). Recombinant human (rh) PTN for interaction assays was purchased from RELIA Tech GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). rh-PTN for preparing an affinity column was produced by the yeast and purified to homogeneity as in the case of recombinant midkine (31Ikematsu S. Yano A. Aridome K. Kikuchi M. Kumai H. Nagano H. Okamoto K. Oda M. Sakuma S. Aikou T. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and was a gift from Dr. Sakuma (Cell Signal Inc., Yokohama, Japan). Polyclonal goat anti-rh-PTN IgG and polyclonal goat anti-rh-midkine IgG were obtained from Genzyme/Techne (Cambridge, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG and goat anti-mouse Ig(G + M) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rat mAb 473HD (IgM) was raised against mouse brain DSD-1-PG/phosphacan as described (23Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and goat anti-rat IgM was from StressGen Biotechnology Corp. (San Diego, CA). HS and heparin from bovine intestinal mucosa, a protease inhibitor mixture, poly-dl-ornithine (P-ORN), and anti-neurofilaments were purchased from Sigma, and anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) was from Leico Technologies Inc. (St. Louis, MO). A Vectastain ABC kit was obtained from Vector Laboratories, and a BCA kit was from Pierce. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available. Preparation of E-CS/DS Chains—The E-CS/DS chains were purified from a brain homogenate from 28 embryonic pigs and were prepared with detergent-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously with some modifications (7Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PBS-soluble PG fraction was digested with actinase E to degrade proteins, and the resulting GAG chains were recovered by ethanol precipitation and then desalted by gel filtration on a PD-10 column. The GAG mixture was treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 at room temperature for 45 min to remove HS followed by dialysis. The dialysate was subjected to an anion-exchange chromatography on an Accell QMA Plus cartridge using a stepwise elution with 0.3 m phosphate buffers, pH 6.0, containing 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 m NaCl. The 1.5 m NaCl-eluted fraction, which contains >90% of all the CS/DS chains recovered, was further used for purification. To remove hyaluronate, this fraction was digested with hyaluronidase, and the hyaluronidase-resistant polysaccharides were recovered by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column as described (7Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Trace amounts of free peptides were removed by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. E-CS/DS could be completely digested with chondroitinase ABC (data not shown), confirming the purity. Preparation of a Membrane-bound Protein Fraction—Neonatal (P1) Wistar rats were anesthetized, and the whole brain was dissected. Tissues (15.1 g) were mixed with 25 mm HEPES buffer (2.5 ml/g tissue), pH 7.2, containing 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture and homogenized in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the precipitate was homogenized and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The combined supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting residue was mixed with a 2% CHAPS containing 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors and agitated at 4 °C overnight. After extraction, the concentrations of CHAPS and CaCl2 were adjusted to 0.5% and 5 mm, respectively, by addition of the Tris-HCl buffer and a 1 m CaCl2 solution. The mixture was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography using the CS/DS-coupled column. Affinity Chromatography of Membrane-bound Proteins—The coupling of CS/DS chains to amino-cellulofine gel was carried out as described by Funahashi et al. (32Funahashi M. Matsumoto I. Seno N. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amino-cellulofine gel (1 ml) was suspended in an aqueous E-CS/DS solution (6 mg/800 μl), and the pH value was then adjusted to ∼4.5 with 1 m HCl. The reaction was initiated by addition of 200 μl of an 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride solution (6.9 mg/200 μl, pH ∼4.5), and the pH was kept between 4.5 and 5.5 by intermittent addition of 2 m HCl over a 1-h period. The incubation was allowed to continue for 24 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation and then stopped by addition of 3 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5. The mixture was centrifuged to recover the supernatant. An aliquot was used to quantify the uronic acid content by the carbazole reaction (33Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar), which showed that ∼1.9 mg of E-CS/DS chains was coupled onto the gel. The gel was washed, and the remaining free amino groups on the beads were acetylated with anhydrous acetic acid as reported (32Funahashi M. Matsumoto I. Seno N. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Likewise, chondroitin, CS-A and CS-B were coupled to the gel to prepare control columns. An equivalent aliquot of a CHAPS extract was mixed with the E-CS/DS-coupling gel or each control gel. After rotation of the gel overnight at 4 °C, the treated gel was poured into a small open column and washed with 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (buffer A), pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.2 m NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted stepwise with 10 ml each of 10 mm EDTA- or 1 m NaCl-containing buffer A and 4 m urea. Likewise, an affinity chromatography was carried out using each control column. All steps were done at 4 °C. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Fractions obtained by affinity chromatography were treated with 80% acetone to precipitate proteins, which were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the method of Towbin et al. (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Resolved proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 5 min and then destained with 50% methanol for 15 min. Protein bands were excised, and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined in an Applied Biosystems Sequencer 492. Affinity Fractionation of E-CS/DS—Bovine serum albumin-free rh-PTN (0.5 mg) was coupled to a HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (1 ml) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To protect the GAG-binding sites of PTN from possible inactivation by the coupling, CS-D (0.5 mg) was incubated with PTN at room temperature for 30 min prior to the coupling. The efficiency of coupling was about 70%, as estimated by the quantification of uncoupled proteins using a BCA kit. The affinity column was equilibrated with 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (buffer B), pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl after a wash with buffer B containing 2.0 m NaCl. E-CS/DS (250 μg) was dissolved in 500 μl of buffer B containing 0.15 m NaCl and loaded onto the column. To maximize the absorbance, loading was repeated six times by recycling each unbound fraction. Subsequently, the column was washed stepwise with 3 ml of buffer B containing 0.15, 0.4, or 1.0 m NaCl. To obtain enough bound material, multiple affinity fractionations were performed at 4 °C. All fractions were desalted on a PD-10 column. Cell Culture—Hippocampal cells were cultured using embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse brains as described previously (23Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 24Nadanaka S. Clement A.M. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi were obtained by microdissection and dissociated with trypsin treatment. Dissociated cells were suspended in Eagle's modified essential medium (EMEM) containing N2 supplement and then seeded on coverslips as described below. For the culture of purified hippocampal neurons, the dissociated cells were precultured in EMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 h at 37 °C to remove more adherent non-neuronal cells (35Barres B.A. Silverstein B.E. Corey D.P. Chon L.L. Neuron. 1988; 1: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 36Condic M.L. Snow D.M. Letourneau P.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10036-10043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 h, the non-adherent cells (neurons) were harvested, rinsed with PBS, seeded on coverslips, and cultured in serum-free EMEM as described above. Neurite Outgrowth Assays—Neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons from E16.5 mouse brains was assayed as reported (23Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 24Nadanaka S. Clement A.M. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, plastic coverslips (10 × 10 mm) were treated with 1.5 μg/ml of P-ORN in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.2, for 2 h at room temperature, then further coated with CS/DS chains at a dose of 1.0–3.0 μg/cm2 per coverslip in PBS at 4 °C overnight, and washed with PBS three times before cells were plated on these coverslips at 10,000 cell/cm2. Blocking with mAb 473HD was carried out by adding the antibody (diluted 100-fold in PBS) onto the coverslips 2 h before the seeding of the cells. When either polyclonal anti-PTN antibody (10 and 100 μg/ml) or rh-PTN (0.1 and 1.0 μg/ml) was used, it was added to the medium 2 h after the seeding. Rat IgM or goat IgG was run as a control depending on the primary antibody used. After a 24-h culture, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and then immunostained with anti-MAP2 and anti-neurofilament as described (25Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The antibodies were detected using a Vectastain ABC kit with 3′,3-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Neurite outgrowth was evaluated by determining total neurite length and the number of primary neurites per cell, where primary neurites represent the neurites longer than the cell body. One hundred clearly isolated cells with at least one neurite longer than the cell body were chosen at random per coverslip. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.E., and the significance of differences between means was evaluated with the Student's t test. Western Blotting—Hippocampal cells or neurons (4 × 106 cells) in N2-supplemented EMEM were plated on 6-cm culture plates coated with P-ORN and then E-CS/DS or with P-ORN alone as described above. After 24 h of culture under 5% CO2 at 37 °C, the cells were solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (buffer C), pH 7.5, containing 1% CHAPS, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was combined with the conditioned medium and then absorbed for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads (a 50% slurry) to remove nonspecific endogenous proteins. After a brief centrifugation, 1 μg of anti-PTN antibody was added to the supernatants and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads was added to the solution to capture the antibody-antigen complex, and the tubes were gently rotated at 4 °C overnight. The gels were washed with buffer C three times and mixed with a 3-fold concentrated sample buffer for SDS-PAGE containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting according to the manufacturer's directions. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—E-CS/DS was biotinylated as described (37Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All steps of ELISA were performed at room temperature. Biotinylated E-CS/DS in 50 μl of PBS was added to the streptavidin-coated 96-well plate (2 μg/well) and incubated for 1 h. After a wash with 200 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) three times, each well was blocked with 100 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Subsequently, 50-fold diluted antibody, 473HD, CS-56, or MO-225, in PBS (50 μl) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Wells were washed with 200 μl of 0.05% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (TBS-T), three times and incubated with 50 μl of alkaline phosphase-linked anti-rat IgM (diluted 1,000-fold for 473HD) or anti-mouse IgM (diluted 5,000-fold for CS-56 and MO-225) for 1 h. After the washing of plates with TBS-T, color was developed by adding 50 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.8, and the absorbance at 415 nm was recorded 1 h after the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. As a negative control, the primary antibody was omitted. For the inhibition ELISA, 473HD (diluted 50-fold) was incubated with different concentrations of CS/DS preparations in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, and the mixture was applied to a 96-well plate. The inhibition efficiency was calculated from the reduced absorbance compared with that obtained from an incubation without GAGs. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Inhibition assays against the interaction of PTN or 473HD with immobilized E-CS/DS was performed using a BIAcore system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's directions. Biotinylated E-CS/DS was immobilized onto a streptavidin-derivatized sensor chip as described previously (7Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To investigate the relation between the 473HD epitope and the PTN-binding domains in E-CS/DS, the E-CS/DS-immobilized sensor chip was first saturated with repeated injections of 473HD antibody or PTN, followed immediately by an injection of PTN (100 ng) or 473HD antibody (diluted 50-fold) in 10 mm HEPES containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (w/v) Tween 20 (running buffer) onto the surface of the sensor chip. Response curves were recorded, and maximal values were used for calculation. To investigate the structural characteristics of the PTN-binding domains in E-CS/DS, PTN (100 ng) was incubated with a wide range of concentrations of various GAGs at room temperature for 15 min in a total volume of 130 μl before being applied to the sensor chip. Response curves were recorded, and the inhibition efficiency was calculated from the reduced values of the maximal response to that of no incubation with GAGs. Disaccharide Composition Analysis—Aliquots of E-CS/DS affinity fractions corresponding to 100–500 pmol of disaccharide were exhaustively digested with chondroitinases ABC (5 mIU) or AC-I (2 mIU) in appropriate buffers at 37 °C for 2 h (38Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Ful"
https://openalex.org/W2119907205,"We have identified factors that control precise motor timing by studying learning in smooth pursuit eye movements. Monkeys tracked a target that moved horizontally for a fixed time interval before changing direction through the addition of a vertical component of motion. After repeated presentations of the same target trajectory, infrequent probe trials of purely horizontal target motion evoked a vertical eye movement around the time when the change in target direction would have occurred. The pursuit system timed the vertical eye movement by keeping track of the duration of horizontal target motion and by measuring the distance the target traveled before changing direction, but not by learning the position in space where the target changed direction. We conclude that high temporal precision in motor output relies on multiple signals whose contributions to timing vary according to task requirements."

In response to various extracellular stimuli, such as numerous hormones, neurotransmitters, metabolic products, and growth factors, PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thereby generating messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (1.Rhee S.G.

PLC-β1 is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, while PLC-β4 is enriched in the cerebellum. PLC-β3 is expressed throughout the brain (7.Ross C.A. MacCumber M.W. Glatt C.E.

Amino acid sequence analysis has shown that PLC-β isotypes share a consensus sequence (X(S/T)X(V/L)-COOH) known as the postsynaptic density (PSD)-95/disc large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain binding motif. PDZ domains exist in a large number of multifunctional proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions at highly specialized submembranous sites, such as the postsynaptic density and cellular junctions (9.Kornau H.C.

The postsynaptic density is a macroscopic submembranous multi-protein complex within the dendritic spines and contains a variety of scaffolding and signaling proteins. Shank/ProSAP, a core component of the PSD, is a multimodular protein (∼200 kDa) that contains various domains for protein interactions including ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a PDZ domain, a long proline-rich region, and a SAM domain (12.Boeckers T.M.

This demonstrates that the Shank family of multidomain proteins (Shank1/2/3) plays an important role in the organization and maintenance of the PSD (16.Kreienkamp H.J. Zitzer H. Gundelfinger E.D.

The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) triggers intracellular signaling events by activating PLC-β through the Gαq family (17.Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S.

In addition, the Homer proteins, a family of adaptor proteins found at excitatory synapses, interact with mGluR and functionally link to the receptor for IP3 generated by PLC (21.Brakeman P.R.

This finding led us to postulate that the Homer protein may take part in the signal pathway between membrane mGluR and PLC. In this study, we identified Shank2 as a PLC-β3-interacting protein. Shank2 specifically interacts with the C terminus of PLC-β3 but not with other isotypes. Furthermore, Homer 1b clusters the complexes of PLC-β3 and Shank2. Importantly, disrupting the PLC-β3-Shank2 interaction by injection with synthetic C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-β3 reduced the mGluR-induced intracellular calcium signal. These results suggest that the complex of PLC-β3, Shank2 and Homer 1b may participate in organizing the molecules involved in PLC-β3-mediated signaling in the PSD. Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (24.Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Cellular Interactions in Development; A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). pBHA (LexA fusion vector) carrying DNA oligomers encoding C-terminal heptapeptides of PLC-β3 were used as the bait in the screening of a rat brain cDNA library in which the cDNAs were inserted into the activation domain of GAL4 in pGAD10 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). We screened ∼1.5 × 106 primary transformants for interacting proteins. Clones specifically interacting with the bait were identified by His growth and X-gal activity assays. The plasmids of positive clones were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with sequences in the data bank using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST system. Plasmid Constructs—To express the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion form of the C-terminal region of PLC-β3 in Escherichia coli, the cDNA of C-terminal 337 amino acids was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GCGAATTCCAGCAAGGCTCACAGCTC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGAGTCAAAGCTGGGTGTTTTCC-3′. The resultant PCR product was inserted as an EcoRI/XhoI fragment into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). To express green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PLC-β3 in mammalian cells, PCR products using appropriate primers were digested with EcoRI/SmaI and then ligated into pEGFP-C1. The cDNA of Shank2 was kindly provided by M. Sheng from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (25.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). To express Myc-tagged Shank2 in mammalian cells, the cDNAs of whole Shank2 and PDZ domain-deleted Shank2 amplified by PCR were digested with SmaI/SalI, and then inserted into EcoRV/XhoI-digested pCDNA3.1/Myc-HisA. The GST-fused PDZ domain of Shank2 was generated by subcloning the SmaI/XhoI insert of amino acids 37–140 into pGEX4T-3. The cDNA of Homer 1b was isolated from the rat brain cDNA library by PCR using the sense primers 5′-GCGAATTCATGGGGGAACAACCTATC-3′ and the anti-sense primers of 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCATTTAATCATGATTGCTG-3′. The GST-fused Homer 1b was generated by subcloning the EcoRI/SalI inserts into pGEX4T-1. We also constructed the HA-tagged Homer 1b gene by subcloning the inserts into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pCDNA3-HA, a HA epitope gene-containing plasmid. Expression in COS7 Cells and Coimmunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 international units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. The cDNAs for one of the PLC-β isotypes carrying an N-terminal FLAG-epitope tag, and either the wild-type or PDZ-deleted form of Shank2 with a C-terminal Myc epitope tag, were co-expressed in the cells by transient transfection using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). After 36 h, the transfected cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm pepstatin). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 500 μg of the clarified lysate were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody precoupled to protein A-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C for immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation (3 min at 3000 × g), washed four times with lysis buffer, and denaturated by heating in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience, Keene, NH). Membrane blocking to prevent nonspecific binding was done with TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk powder. The blocked membranes were then incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 4 h at room temperature, after which they were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed four times in TTBS buffer, and developed using horseradish peroxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). For the coimmunoprecipitation assay with synaptosome, the synaptosomal fraction (P2) was extracted in 1% deoxycholic acid and dialyzed overnight into 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Concurrently, 2 μg of each antibody was preincubated overnight with 10-μl bed volume of protein A-agarose. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, 100 μg of extract was incubated with antibody-protein A in 100 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of incubation buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as indicated antibodies, including IP3 receptor (26.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Recombinant proteins were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 containing the appropriate cDNA constructs. Expression was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) for 4 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, the cells were pelleted and sonicated in lysis buffer. The soluble fraction, after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C and washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Pull-down Assay—COS7 cells transiently expressing the PLC-β isotypes or Shank2 were lysed with lysis buffer and centrifuged. The lysates (500 μg) were then incubated with 5 μg of the GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at a final lysis buffer volume of 1 ml for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer, followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted. Transfection and Clustering in COS7 Cells—COS7 cells were transfected with a combination of appropriate plasmids, using the Lipofectamine method (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) on poly-l-lysinecoated coverslips. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (1% goat serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with anti-Shank2 antibody (1 μg/ml) or anti-HA antibody (2 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (10 min each), the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies: either rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, the slides were mounted and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY). Immunocytochemistry on Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—Primary cultured rat hippocampal neuron prepared as described previously (28.Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In brief, hippocampus was isolated from rat embryo (20-day gestation), dissociated, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and then cultured in MEM with 10% horse serum. After 4 days in culture, the medium was replaced with MEM supplemented with N2 supplement, 1 mg/ml of ovalbumin, 1 μm pyruvate, and 5 μm cytosine arabinoside, cultured for 1 week. For immunofluorescence microscopy, the cultured cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, washed with solution A (20 μm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and 0.45 m NaCl), and then treated with solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% skimmed milk for 30 min. The samples were incubated with rabbit anti-PLC-β 3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Inc), mouse anti-Shank2 (25.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) and rat anti-Homer 1b antibodies (29.Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) for 2 h. The samples were then washed with solution A, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit, Texas red-conjugated anti-mouse, and Cy5-conjugated anti-rat antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. After incubation, the samples were washed with solution A, embedded, and then viewed using a confocal imaging system (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta, Oberkochen, Germany). Microinjection of Synthetic C-terminal Heptapeptide of PLC-β Isozymes and Intracellular Calcium Response to mGluR Agonist—Established hippocampal cells, HN33 were chosen for microinjection. A solution was injected into the cells via a glass micropipette attached to a Microinjector (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Micropipettes had tip diameters of less than 1 micrometer. The microinjection buffer solution consists of 27 mm K2HPO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 26 mm KH2PO4. Dextran-conjugated with TRITC was dissolved with microinjection buffer and used as a microinjection marker. In preparation for an injection, a micropipette was lowered to ensure the micropipette had impaled the cell. Then, by using a semi-automatic button, peptides were injected into the cell. The responsiveness of the intracellular calcium level was monitored after mGluR agonist treatment under a confocal microscope. For the intracellular calcium image, Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes) was dissolved (1 mg/ml) in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at –20 °C until use. Cells were loaded with 2 μl Fluo-3 AM for 40 min at room temperature. After washing with HBSS buffer, the cells were further incubated for 15 min in the absence of Fluo-3 AM to completely de-esterify the dye. To exclude the possible effects of dye loading, we normalized with saponin at the end of the experiments. To normalize, we measured the residual fluorescence (Fo) at the end of the experiment, and subtracted from the fluorescence of experiment conditions (F). To rule out the effect of extracellular calcium, all injection procedures were done in calcium-free solution. Excitation of Fluo-3 AM was provided by the 488-nm line of an argon laser, and the emission range was 515 nm. The confocal pinhole was set to the minimum opening compatible with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The intracellular calcium image was detected on an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta, Oberkochen, Germany) with an objective (×20). The concentration of the peptides used in our experiment ranged from 10 to 30 mm. Injection pressure and time were adjusted to 100–120 kPa and 0.5 s, respectively. Estimated intracellular concentration of peptides after injection came to ∼100 to ∼300 nm. Competition of PLC-β3 Binding with Shank by Adding Synthetic C-terminal Peptide of PLC-β3 in Vitro—Subcellular fractions of hippocampal neuron in the rat brain (600 μg protein) in 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer were prepared. For immunoprecipitation, Shank antibody was incubated with hippocampal homogenate. In addition, various concentrations of the synthetic C-terminal heptapeptide of each PLC-β isozymes were co-incubated to compete with endogenous PLC-β3 and Shank binding. After incubation for 4 h at 4 °C, immunocomplexes were separated by incubation with protein-A/G Sepharose. Western blotting was performed with the PLC-β3 antibody by standard procedures and detected by ECL chemiluminescence. Data Analysis—The calcium imaging data are expressed as a means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS 8.01(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A difference was taken as significant if p < 0.05. Comparisons between cells were analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA (analysis of variance). Identification of the PLC-β3-interacting Protein—The C-terminal heptapeptide (QEENTQL-COOH) of PLC-β3 was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid assay screening for proteins interacting with PLC-β3. One positive clone from a rat brain cDNA library was obtained and sequenced and found to contain the N-terminal 360 amino acids of Shank2, which harbors a PDZ domain. The specificity of the interaction between the C-terminal motif of PLC-β3 and the various PDZ domains, including Shank2 PDZ, was examined using the yeast two-hybrid assay (Table I). His activity and the β-galactosidase responses of the yeast cells transformed with the PLC-β3 motif and the PDZ of Shank2 were similar to those of the PLC-β3 motif and the PDZ2 of NHERF2, a positive control. No responses were exhibited by transformants of the PDZ domain of PSD-95 or NHERF1. These results demonstrate that the PLC-β3 specifically interacts with Shank2.Table IShank2 interacts specifically with the PDZ domain binding motif of PLC-β3pBHA clonespGAD10 clonesHIS3β-GalC-terminal of PLC-β3 (NTQL)pGAD10 alone--NHERF1 PDZ1--PSD95 PDZ1--NHERF2 PDZ2+++++Shank2 PDZ+++++ Open table in a new tab Interaction Domains between PLC-β3 and Shank2 in Vitro—To confirm the interaction between PLC-β3 and Shank2, GST-Shank2 protein was used in a pull-down assay of COS7 cell lysates transfected with FLAG-PLC-β3 or FLAG-PLC-β3ΔC (deleted C-terminal four amino acids, PDZ binding motif). Full-length PLC-β3, but not the deleted mutant, was pulled down by GST-Shank2 (Fig. 1A). Conversely, Shank2 expressed in COS7 cells was precipitated by the GST-PLC-β3 C-terminal 337 amino acids, but not GST alone (Fig. 1B). Specific Interaction of PLC-β Isotypes and Shank2 in Vivo— All PLC-β isotypes contain the PDZ binding motif at their C termini that may enable the PLC-βs to associate with the PDZ domain-containing proteins. To investigate the interaction between Shank2 and each PLC-β isotype, immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody was performed with extracts of COS7 cells expressing Shank2 and each of the FLAG-tagged PLC-β isotypes. Shank2 was detected in the immunoprecipitates only with FLAG-PLC-β3, but not with any of the other isotypes (Fig. 2A), implying that Shank2 specifically interacts with PLC-β3. To characterize this interaction, the lysates of COS7 cells co-expressing FLAG-PLC-β3 and Myc-Shank2 were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, PLC-β3 was co-precipitated with Shank2, whereas the C-terminally deleted PLC-β3 and the PDZ domain-deleted form of Shank2 were not co-precipitated with Shank2 and PLC-β3, respectively. These results suggest that PLC-β3 interacts with the PDZ domain of Shank2 via the C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Several reports demonstrate that PDZ domains bind to the C-terminal four amino acids of the target proteins (11.Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). To identify critical residues of the PLC-β3 C terminus that are required for the Shank2 interaction, each of the last four amino acid residues of PLC-β3 (NTQL-COOH) were mutated to Ala. The extracts of COS7 cells co-expressing each FLAG-tagged PLC-β3 mutant and Shank2 were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipitates were then probed with an anti-Shank antibody. Substitution of Thr to Ala at the secondary amino acid or Leu to Ala at the last position resulted in a complete loss of Shank2 binding to PLC-β3. In contrast, the substitution of the other residues to Ala had no effect (Fig. 2D). These results thus indicate that the Thr and Leu residues of PLC-β3 are essential for the interaction with Shank2. PLC-β3 Associates with Homer 1b Through Shank2—Recently, it was reported that Shank1 and Shank3 associate with the EVH domain of the Homer family (23.Tu J.C. Xiao B. Naisbitt S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Brakeman P. Doan A. Aakalu V.K. Lanahan A.A. Sheng M. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1999; 23: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), and sequence analysis indicates that Shank2 possesses two similar prolinerich Homer binding regions. To verify that Shank2 can also associate with Homer and that Shank2 can link PLC-β3 to Homer 1b, COS7 cells extracts expressing Shank2 and PLC-β3 were used in pull-down assays with GST-Homer 1b. Extracts of COS7 cells co-expressing Shank2 and Homer 1b were used for precipitation with the GST-PLC-β3 C-terminal motif. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, GST-Homer 1b pulled-down PLC-β3 only in the presence of Shank2. Conversely, the GST-PLC-β3 C terminus pulled down Homer 1b only in the presence of Shank2, suggesting that these three proteins form a ternary complex. To further explore the ternary complex of PLC-β3, Shank2, and Homer 1b, immunocytochemistry was performed on COS7 cells expressing these proteins. In triply expressed cells, PLC-β3, Shank2, and Homer 1b were distributed in plaque-like clusters (Fig. 4A, panels A1 and B1). In a control experiment, PLC-β1 did not colocalize with Shank2 and Homer 1b (Fig. 4A, panel C1). These results are consistent with the lack of interaction between PLC-β1 and Shank2 in coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2A). When C-terminal-deleted PLC-β3 (Fig. 4A, panel D1) or PDZ-domain-deleted Shank2 (Fig. 4A, panel E1) were co-expressed with the other proteins, PLC-β3 did not exhibit any clustering with Shank2. On the other hand, both the wild-type and the PDZ-deleted form of Shank2 were clustered with Homer 1b, consistent with the previous finding that the Homer binding region resides in the proline-rich region of Shank2 (29.Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We further verified the ternary complex of PLC-β3, Shank2, and Homer1 b using freshly isolated hippocampal cells. Similar with the result of COS7, PLC-β3, Shank2, and Homer 1b were existed as a plaque-like cluster form in these cells also (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that Shank2 mediates the formation of a ternary complex containing Homer 1b and PLC-β3. Coimmunoprecipitation of Shank2-interacting Proteins in Brain—Next we determined the in vivo association of Shank2, PLC-β3, Homer 1b, and IP3 receptor. When the P2 fraction of adult rat brain was immunoprecipitated with Shank2 antibody, PLC-β3, Homer 1b, and IP3 receptor were coimmunoprecipitated, but not with IgG (Fig. 5A). In addition, to determine whether C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-β3 can compete with the endogenous PLC-β3-Shank2 interaction, we added the synthetic C-terminal peptide of PLC-β3 during the immunoprecipitation reaction. For immunoprecipitation, we incubated Shank2 antibody with P2 fraction of adult rat brain. The amount of coimmunoprecipitated PLC-β3 with Shank2 decreased by synthetic PLC-β3 peptide addition in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the association was unaffected by addition of C-terminal peptides of other isozymes (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PLC-β3 and Shank2 may be distributed to synaptic sites and form a complex in brain. Effect of Microinjection of Synthetic PLC-β3 C-terminal Heptapeptide on mGluR Agonist-induced Intracellular Calcium Release—To gain physiological insights into PLC-β3 binding with Shank2, we investigated the effect of this binding on mGluR agonist-induced intracellular calcium signal. To accomplish this, we used HN33 hippocampal cells, because these cells showed an intracellular calcium increase in response to a mGluR agonist, N-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD, 20 μm). It has been suggested that Shank may cross-link Homer with the PSD-95 complex in the postsynaptic density and play a role in the mGluR signaling. Such a linkage has important implication in the coupling of mGluR receptors to intracellular calcium pools. Therefore, we hypothesized that the calcium release responding to the mGluR agonist might be changed by disrupting Shank2-PLC-β3 binding. To test this hypothesis, we microinjected a synthetic C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-β3 into the cytoplasm of the HN33 cells and monitored the calcium signal. As a control, we injected C-terminal heptapeptides of other PLC-β isozymes. Cells injected with PLC-β3 peptide showed a markedly decreased calcium signal (Fig. 6). Injection with peptides of other PLC-β isozymes (PLC-β1, PLC-β2, and PLC-β4) did not cause any detectable changes in the calcium signaling. Altogether, we injected 10 cells at a time and performed three independent experiments. These results were reproduced in every experiment. To rule out the involvement of an extracellular calcium effect, we performed the microinjection procedure under calcium-free buffer condition. These results demonstrate that microinjection of the C-terminal peptide of PLC-β3 suppresses the mGluR agonist induced calcium release in a dose dependent manner, but C-terminal peptides of other isozymes have no significant effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the PLC-β3-Shank2 interaction may play an important role in mGluR-mediated intracellular calcium release. In this report, we identified a modular interaction between the C terminus of PLC-β3 and the PDZ domain of Shank2. In support of this conclusion, the C-terminal four amino acids of PLC-β3 are required for the interaction with Shank2 (Fig. 1), and point mutations at the PLC-β3 C terminus eliminate the Shank2 interaction (Fig. 2D). In addition, our data indicate that Shank2 forms a specific complex with PLC-β3, but not with other PLC-β isoforms (Fig. 2A), despite the fact that other PLC-β isoforms also contain the PDZ domain binding motif at their C termini. These results suggest that PLC-β isoforms may act in different signaling pathways by interacting with distinct PDZ-containing proteins. Previously, we had found that NHERF2 specifically interacts with and enhances the activation of PLC-β3 by the muscarinic receptor (30.Hwang J.I. Heo K. Shin K.J. Kim E. Yun C. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16632-16637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, other isotypes of PLC-β barely interact with NHERF2. With respect to Shank2, the immunoprecipitation analyses performed in the present study demonstrated that Shank2 specifically interacted with PLC-β3, but not with the other isotypes. In immunoblot analysis, Shank2 was detected in brain tissues, but NHERF2 was not detected, implying that each of two PDZ proteins may play a role in PLC-β3-mediated signaling in different tissues. It has been known that PDZ-containing proteins mediate the clustering of receptors and signaling molecules and thereby regulate agonist-induced signal transduction (31.Suh P.G. Hwang J.I. Ryu S.H. Donowitz M. Kim J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling through PLC-β3 may be spatially regulated in cells via the interaction with PDZ-containing proteins. Proline-rich motifs of Shank2 have been shown to interact with the Homer family, EVH domain-containing proteins (23.Tu J.C. Xiao B. Naisbitt S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Brakeman P. Doan A. Aakalu V.K. Lanahan A.A. Sheng M. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1999; 23: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that Homer 1 operates in a negative feedback loop that regulates the structure and function of the synapse (32.Sala C. Futai K. Yamamoto K. Worley P.F. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6327-6337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homer proteins normally exist in oligomeric forms and are known to interact with group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and therefore may be involved in the cytosolic calcium release by IP3, a product of PLC activation (22.Xiao B. Tu J.C. Petralia R.S. Yuan J.P. Doan A. Breder C.D. Ruggiero A. Lanahan A.A. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F.

Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Given these findings, we propose that Shank2 may serve as a scaffold for G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades in the PSD by forming bridges between the Homer family and PLC-β3. Shank2, and PLC-β3 undergo a dramatic re-localization to form plaque-like clusters when they are coexpressed with Homer 1b. The experiment using deletion mutants of Shank2 or PLC-β3 indicates that PLC-β3 is recruited into Shank2/Homer 1b complexes through PDZ domain-mediated interaction. As previously reported, Shank2 is enriched in the PSD fractions (33.Lim S. Naisbitt S. Yoon J. Hwang J.-I. Suh P.-G. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29510-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Considering PSD signaling events in neuronal cells harboring mGluR signaling networks (34.Tadokoro S. Tachibana T. Imanaka T. Nishida W. Sobue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13801-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it is believed that PLC-β3 may be involved in mGluR-mediated signaling, and Homer 1b actually increases mGluR-evoked calcium mobilization (29.Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Up to now, the role of scaffolding proteins in mediating tyrosine kinase receptors is well characterized (35.Hering H. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the scaffolding protein's role in calcium signaling. In synapses, PSD-95, Shank, GRIP, and probably other scaffolds, participate in the assembly of signaling complexes, including the role for calcium signaling. In the present study, we provided the evidence for the role of the binding between Shank2 and PLC-β3 in mGluR-mediated calcium mobilization. We did not check the direct effect of Shank2 on PLC-β activity. Thus, whether mGluR-evoked calcium response occurs through recruiting signal molecules to the mGluR receptor or directly affecting PLC-β activity is yet to be determined. In conclusion, PLC-β3 interacts with Shank2 via the PDZ binding motif. The isotype-specific interaction of PLC-β3 with Shank2 shows that PDZ-containing proteins allow signaling molecules to be involved in a specific signaling cascade by recruiting them to specific compartments. Homer 1b, a type I mGluR-interacting protein, forms clusters with PLC-β3, which is mediated by Shank2. Upon clustering of the ternary complex consisting of Homer 1b-Shank2-PLC-β3, the spatially restricted signaling complexes in the PSD are made possible. This finding may lead us to a better understanding of the activation mechanism of PLC-β3 by GPCRs in the PSD of neuronal cells."

RGS7 and RGS11 present in this neural structure showed no association with MOR. In vivo intracerebroventricular injection of morphine did not alter MOR immunoreactivity, but 30 min and 3 h after administration, the coprecipitation of Gα subunits with MORs was reduced by up to 50%. Furthermore, the association between Gα subunits and RGS9-2 proteins was increased. Twenty-four hours after receiving intracerebroventricular morphine, the Gα subunits left the RGS9-2 proteins and re-associated with the MORs. However, doses of the opioid able to induce tolerance promoted the stable transfer of Gα subunits to the RGS9-2 control. This was accompanied by Ser phosphorylation of RGS9-2 proteins, which increased their co-precipitation with 14-3-3 proteins. In the PAG membranes of morphine-desensitized mice, the capacity of the opioid to stimulate G-protein-related guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate) binding as well as low Km GTPase activity was attenuated. The in vivo knockdown of RGS9-2 expression prevented morphine from altering the association between MORs and G-proteins, and tolerance did not develop. In PAG membranes from RGS9-2 knockdown mice, morphine showed full capacity to activate G-proteins. Thus, the tolerance that develops following an adequate dose of morphine is caused by the stabilization and retention of MOR-activated Gα subunits by RGS9-2 proteins. This multistep process is initiated by the morphine-induced transfer of MOR-associated Gα subunits to the RGS9-2 proteins, followed by Ser phosphorylation of the latter and their binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This regulatory mechanism probably precedes the loss of MORs from the cell membrane, which has been observed with other opioid agonists. In mouse periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) membranes, the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) coprecipitated the α-subunits of the Gi/o/z/q/11 proteins, the Gβ1/2 subunits, and the regulator of G-protein signaling RGS9-2 and its partner protein Gβ5.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1068-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, MORs play an important role in the antinociceptive action of opioids, but they become desensitized after repeated administration. Such tolerance is observed even after a single dose of an opioid agonist and can persist for ∼3 days (6Huidobro F. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Way E.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976; 198: 318-326PubMed Google Scholar, 7Garzón J. Rodríguez-Díaz M. López-Fando A. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 801-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This common characteristic of opioids that act via MORs is a serious drawback with respect to their long-term use as analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain. The phosphorylation of intracellular residues, followed by internalization, is the most widely accepted mechanism involved in GPCR desensitization. Thus, upon agonist challenge and the release of activated Gα-GTP subunits, GPCRs undergo phosphorylation by Gβ-bound G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), followed by arrestin binding (8Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). This has been amply documented for the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors in in vitro cell expression systems (for example, see Ref. 9Chavkin C. McLaughlin J.P. Celver J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The desensitization and internalization of MOR are agonist-dependent processes. In contrast to what has been observed for opioids such as etorphine and [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin, a number of reports describe the ability of morphine to activate the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway and to desensitize the MORs without causing receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent internalization (10Arden J.R. Segredo V. Wang Z. Lameh J. Sadée W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 11Capeyrou R. Riond J. Corbani M. Lepage J.F. Bertin B. Emorine L.J.

Brain Res. 2000; 76: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that receptor down-regulation is promoted only by agonists with high binding affinity for these receptors (16Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, tightly bound agonists increase the probability that GRKs will inactivate the GPCRs since these kinases act only on agonist-occupied receptors (for example, see Ref. 17Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The in vivo attained desensitization of MORs can be influenced by agents targeted to the specific RGS (regulator of G-protein signaling) proteins belonging to the R7 subfamily. The mammalian RGS proteins that act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) for Gα-GTP subunits are grouped into five subfamilies according to structural and genetic similarities: Rz, R4, R7, R12, and RA (18Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The members of the RGS-R7 subfamily in the central nervous system (RGS6, RGS7, RGS9-2, and RGS11) associate mostly with cell membranes. Their sequences contain the GGL (G-protein γ-subunit-like) domain that binds to the Gβ5 protein, but not to the other Gβ subunits (19Zhang J.-H. Simonds W.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In nervous tissues, the RGS-R7 and Gβ5 proteins are always found as dimers, indicating that this association is required for their GAP function on the corresponding Gα-GTP subunits. The RGS-R7 proteins show negative regulatory activity on the intensity of signals originating at MORs; thus, they participate in the development of tolerance to agonist effects (21Garzón J. López-Fando A. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2003; 28: 1983-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Sánchez-Blázquez P. Rodríguez-Díaz M. López-Fando A. Rodríguez-Muñoz M. Garzón J. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 85-98Google Scholar). RGS9-2 is particularly important with respect to this function because its impairment provokes an increase in the potency of μ-opioid agonists and prevents (or at least delays) the appearance of MOR desensitization (7Garzón J. Rodríguez-Díaz M. López-Fando A. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 801-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Garzón J. López-Fando A. Sánchez-Blázquez P.

Gold S.J. Nestler E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The RGS-R7 proteins display stronger affinity for the Gαi/o/z subunits in their transition state, when the Gα subunit initiates the spontaneous metabolism of GTP into the effector-inactive GDP form, than for the Gα-GTP form (24Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because RGS-R7 proteins can efficiently activate only the GTPase in Gαo subunits (25Lan K.L. Zhong H. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that, upon receptor activation, the subsequent binding of Gαi/z subunits to RGS9-2 proteins serves to control the intensity of agonist signaling by reducing the pool of receptor-regulated G-proteins (22Sánchez-Blázquez P. Rodríguez-Díaz M. López-Fando A. Rodríguez-Muñoz M. Garzón J. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 85-98Google Scholar). In this scenario, a fraction of the morphine-activated Gαi/z subunits is retained by the RGS9-2 proteins, leading to MOR desensitization. To determine whether this is the case, we analyzed the influence of RGS9-2 proteins on the changes that morphine induces in MOR regulation of G-proteins. The study was performed using membranes isolated from periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), a neural structure that plays a major role in mediating the effects of opioids when administered by the intracerebroventricular route (26Yaksh T.L. Yeung J.C. Rudy T.A. Brain Res. 1976; 114: 83-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Morphine was found to induce a dose-dependent transfer of Gα subunits from the MORs to the RGS9-2 proteins that correlates with the attenuation of the morphine-induced activation of Gα subunits and its antinociceptive effects. Preparation of Membranes from Mouse PAG—Male albino CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories España, S. A., Barcelona, Spain) weighing 22–25 g were killed by cervical dislocation, and the PAG was removed. About 1 mm of tissue around the aqueduct was taken from 2-mm-thick coronal sections (MP-600 micropunch, Activational Systems Inc.). The structures from 20 mice (for direct analysis) or from six mice (for immunoprecipitation studies) were washed and pooled in ice-cold 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 1 mm EGTA, and 0.32 m sucrose supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no. P8340, Sigma), a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (catalog no. P2850, Sigma), and H-89 (catalog no. B1427, Sigma). The PAG membranes were then obtained. The tissue was homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer (Model PT 10/35) for 15 s at setting 3. The homogenate was centrifuged (Sorvall RC5C centrifuge, SS-34 rotor) at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove the nuclear fraction. After the pellet was discarded, the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the crude synaptosomal pellet (P2). After two cycles of washing, followed by resuspension in buffer and centrifugation, the final pellet was diluted in Tris buffer and analyzed as described below. Co-immunoprecipitation of Signaling Proteins—Affinity-purified IgGs raised against MORs (2Garzón J. Juarros J.L. Castro M.A. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 738-744PubMed Google Scholar, 3Garzón J. De Antonio I. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 314: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and RGS9-2 proteins (catalog nos. sc-8142 and sc-8143, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were labeled with biotin (catalog no. B1022, Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. MORs and RGS9-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the solubilized P2 fraction of mouse PAG as described (22Sánchez-Blázquez P. Rodríguez-Díaz M. López-Fando A. Rodríguez-Muñoz M. Garzón J. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 85-98Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Negative controls were performed with IgGs heated for 10 min at 100 °C or pre-absorbed with 0.1 mg of antigenic peptide for 1 h at room temperature. Pilot assays were performed to adjust the amount of IgGs and sample protein and to determine the incubation period required to precipitate the desired protein in a single run. Thus, in any second precipitation, only a remnant of the immunosignal would be observed. The procedure required ∼0.8 mg of protein from sonicated (two cycles of 5 s each) PAG membranes in a volume of 400 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μl of protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures, and H-89. Membranes were solubilized overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then cleared with 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose (catalog no. S1638, Sigma) pre-equilibrated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. The solubilized material was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl (3 μg) of affinity-purified biotinylated IgGs raised against either MORs or RGS9-2 proteins. Fifty microliters of streptavidin-agarose were added, and incubation was continued for an additional 90 min at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The agarose pellets were subjected to five cycles of washing, followed by centrifugation and resuspension in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer. At the end of this process, the agarose pellets were heated in 300 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl and 1% SDS for 10 min at 100 °C to detach and denature the proteins contained in the immunocomplexes. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature, and the streptavidin-agarose was separated in centrifugal filter devices with a 0.45-μm pore (Ultrafree-MC, catalog no. UFC30GV, Millipore Iberica S. A.). To prevent interference in the visualization of Western blots, the biotinylated IgGs detached during the initial heating were selectively removed by the addition of octyl thioglucoside at a final percentage of 0.65% in 400 μl plus 30 μl of fresh streptavidin-agarose. After 2 h at 4°C, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and the streptavidin-agarose with the attached biotinylated IgGs was discarded. The proteins in the soluble fraction were concentrated in centrifugal filter devices (10,000-Da nominal molecular mass limit; Amicon Microcon YM-10, catalog no. 42407, Millipore Iberica S. A.). The proteins were solubilized in 2× Laemmli buffer with mercaptoethanol by heating at 100 °C for 3 min and then left to cool to room temperature before resolving by SDS-PAGE (10–16% total acrylamide concentration, 2.6% bisacrylamide cross-linker concentration). The above procedure supplied enough protein to load four to six gel lanes. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis and incubated with the antibodies in Hoefer™ Deca-Probe chambers (catalog no. PR150, Amersham Biosciences, Barcelona). Detection of Signaling Proteins in Mouse PAG Membranes by Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The proteins from P2 membranes were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8 × 11 × 1.5-cm gel slabs (10–20%). For immunodetection, 40–60 μg of PAG protein/lane were typically used. The separated proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with the following, previously characterized antibodies: affinity-purified IgGs to MOR (2Garzón J.

The phosphoserine detection kit (catalog no. 525282, Calbiochem) recognizes phosphoserine in different amino acid environments. The mouse monoclonal antibodies (clones 1C8, 4A3, 4A9, and 16B4) were used at 0.1 μg/ml to study Ser phosphorylation of RGS9-2 proteins. The antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the transfer membranes at 6 °C for 24 h. Primary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L; catalog no. 170-6515, Bio-Rad), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (catalog no. sc-2020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (H+L; catalog no. 401225, Calbiochem), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L; catalog no. 170-6515, Bio-Rad). Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, incubated for 3 h, and revealed with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (catalog no. RPN2132, Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was visualized with a Peltier cooled CCD camera (–35 °C, high signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range up to 3.400) using a ChemiImager IS-5500 system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, California). This system provides a real-time (30 frames/s) readout that can be analyzed by densitometry (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation assays were performed on solubilized proteins typically obtained by pooling the PAG structures of six mice that had received identical morphine treatment and that were killed at the same post-opioid interval. These assays were repeated at least three times with PAG samples obtained from independent groups of mice. Equal loading was verified; and if necessary, the signal was adjusted using that obtained when probing the directly immunoprecipitated protein (MOR or RGS9-2). This was performed in re-blotting assays. However, if signal interference was observed, parallel blots generated with the same immunoprecipitated samples were used to make the necessary adjustment. Densitometries are expressed as the means ± S.E. of the integrated volume (average optical density of the pixels within the object area/mm2). All calculations were made using the Quantity One software. The statistical analysis of the results included analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test (SigmaStat, SPSS Science Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Significance was set at p < 0.05. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—The binding of [35S]GTPγS (specific activity of 1250 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was studied in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm GDP, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 pm [35S]GTPγS, and 4 μg of synaptosomal membranes from mouse PAG in a final volume of 50 μl. The assays were conducted in the presence of increasing concentrations of morphine. Samples were incubated in triplicate at 25 °C for 2 h (steady-state). Nonspecific binding was determined by subtracting the binding that remained in the presence of 40 μm unlabeled GTPγS. Membrane-bound [35S]GTPγS and free [35S]GTPγS were separated by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/B glass-fiber disks. Radioactivity was counted using a Beckman LS-6500 scintillation counter. GTPase Assays—The PAG membranes were analyzed for GTPase activity by measuring [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol; catalog no. NEG004Z; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) hydrolysis at 37 °C for 20 min as described previously (29Garzón J. Martínez-Peña Y. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assay medium contained (final concentrations) 0.4 nm [γ-32P]GTP (4 × 105 cpm), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.25 mm App(NH)p, 1 mm ouabain, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); and 3 μg of protein in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. Unlabeled GTP was added at 0.3 or 1 μm. A preliminary incubation in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C equilibrated the opioid agonist with MORs in the PAG membranes. The reaction was started by the addition of 20 μl of the membranes plus morphine to 80 μl of the prewarmed reaction mixture. This was allowed to continue for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 900 μl of an ice-cold suspension of 5% (w/v) activated charcoal (Norit A) in 20 mm H3PO4 (pH 2.3). After 15 min of centrifugation at 11,000 × g, 500 μl of the supernatant were removed, and 32Pi that was released by the GTP hydrolysis was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Ecolume, ICN) in a Beckman LS-6500 scintillation counter. Blanks (without membranes) accounted for 1–2% of the total radioactivity added. Data were corrected for the background and are expressed as percentage increase over the basal GTPase activity. High affinity GTPase activity was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity (32Pi) liberated from [γ-32P]GTP in the presence of 100 μm GTP (low affinity GTPase activity) from that measured at lower concentrations, typically 0.3 or 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP. The experiments were repeated three times and performed in triplicate. Animals, Intracerebroventricular Injection, and Evaluation of Antinociception—Male albino CD-1 mice weighing 22–25 g were housed at 22 °C under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.). Food and water were provided ad libitum. Animals were lightly anesthetized with ether, and morphine sulfate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a volume of 4 μl was injected into the lateral ventricle. The response of the animals to nociceptive stimuli was determined by the warm water (52 °C) tail-flick test. Antinociception is expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible effect: maximum possible effect = 100 × (test latency – base-line latency)/(cutoff time (10 s) – base-line latency). Production of Acute Morphine Tolerance—Tolerance to morphine can arise after the administration of a single dose (7Garzón J. Rodríguez-Díaz M. López-Fando A. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 801-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To promote this effect, the animals lightly anesthetized with ether received a single intracerebroventricular injection of either 3 or 10 nmol of morphine (priming dose). Controls were administered saline in the same manner. To determine whether the opioid produced the sought-after tolerance, a test dose of morphine identical to the priming dose was intracerebroventricularly injected 24 h later into all morphine-primed and control mice. Analgesia was then determined by the tail-flick test at the postmorphine interval corresponding to the peak effect of the opioid, i.e. at 30 min. The development of acute tolerance was determined by reduction in antinociceptive potency. Each treatment was performed on a different group of 10 or 15 mice. The data collected were examined by ANOVA, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test (SigmaStat). Significance was set at p < 0.05. For immunodetection analysis, the mice were injected with saline or the morphine priming dose and killed by decapitation at intervals of 30 min, 3 h, and 24 h to obtain the PAG synaptosomal membranes. Down-regulation of RGS9-2 Expression—The 16-base end-capped phosphorothioate (indicated by *) antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) 5′-C*T*CGAATCAGTTCG*C*T-3′ directed to nucleotides 1044–1059 of the murine RGS9 mRNA expressed in the central nervous system (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF125046) (21Garzón J. López-Fando A. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2003; 28: 1983-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used to down-regulate RGS9-2 expression. As a control, an antisense ODN containing 5 mismatched bases (shown in boldface) was used: ODN-RGS9-2M, 5′-C*T*GCAATGAGTTGC*T*C-3′. These ODNs were injected into the lateral ventricles of animals lightly anesthetized with ether. Each series of injections was performed on a distinct group of mice according to the following 5-day schedule: 1 nmol on days 1 and 2, 2 nmol on days 3 and 4, and 3 nmol on day 5. The mice were killed on day 6, and PAG was obtained. MOR-selective Linkage of RGS Proteins—In synaptosomal preparations of mouse PAG, the antibodies against MORs precipitated glycosylated proteins of 55–65, 70–80, and 100–110 kDa. These proteins were recognized by antibodies directed against different epitopes of the receptor proteins. N-Glycosidase F increased the electrophoretic mobility of all these bands to the size of the protein predicted from the MOR amino acid sequence (2Garzón J. Juarros J.L. Castro M.A. Sánchez-Blázquez P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 738-744PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the different sized moieties corresponded to degrees of glycosylation of MOR. No immunoprecipitation was seen when the anti-MOR IgGs were pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptides or when heat-inactivated IgGs were used (Fig. 1A). The MORs coprecipitated various signaling elements: Gαi/o/z/q/11 subunits, Gβ1/2 subunits, and RGS9-2 and its associated Gβ5 protein (Fig. 1B). Notably, other members of the RGS-R7 subfamily present in PAG synaptosomal fractions (RGS7 and RGS11) showed no association with this receptor (Fig. 1C). Although, in the mouse, the 77-kDa RGS9-2 protein is found in large amounts in striatal membranes, it is also present in other neural structures such as the cerebral cortex and PAG (7Garzón J.

https://openalex.org/W2025248134,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has been previously shown to promote survival of oligodendrocyte progenitors; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), MEK1, and Src family tyrosine kinases in IGF-I-mediated oligodendrocyte progenitor survival. In agreement with previous studies, IGF-I promoted cell survival. We show that IGF-I prevented apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation in a PI3K-dependent and MEK/ERK-independent manner. In addition, IGF-I activated Akt while inhibiting caspase-3 activation, and these effects were reversed by the PI3K inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin, but not by the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059. Interestingly, PP2, a specific Src-like kinase inhibitor, blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, Fyn, and Lyn and IGF-I-stimulated Akt activation, yet had no significant effects on caspase-3 activation or progenitor survival. To further determine whether Akt is required for IGF-I-mediated survival, oligodendrocyte progenitors were transduced with defective Akt mutants or treated with an Akt inhibitor. Although the Akt mutants and inhibitor decreased Akt activity and reduced basal cell survival, IGF-I could partially rescue oligodendrocyte progenitors by decreasing caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that 1) PI3K is essential for IGF-I-promoted cell survival, 2) downstream activation of Akt-dependent and -independent pathways is involved, and 3) Src-like tyrosine kinases participate in IGF-I-induced Akt activation. Therefore, an unidentified effector(s) of PI3K appears to be involved in conferring complete IGF-I-mediated protection of oligodendrocyte progenitors.

Early in vitro experiments demonstrated that IGF-I is required for proliferation and survival of oligodendrocyte progenitors (1Barres B.A. Hart I.K. Coles H.S. Burne J.F. Voyvodic J.T.

Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 283-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as evidenced by increased numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitors in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum of transgenic mice overexpressing IGF-I (3Mason J.L.

IGF-I has also been found to protect white matter in fetal sheep from ischemic injury by decreasing apoptosis and by promoting regeneration of oligodendrocytes (5Guan J. Bennet L. George S. Wu D.

Similarly, IGF-I reduces lesion severity and promotes myelin regeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis (7Webster H.D. Mult. Scler. 1997; 3: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is a significant reduction in central nervous system myelination as well as in the number of oligodendrocyte progenitors in the anterior commissure and corpus callosum of IGF-I-null mutant mice (8Beck K.D. Powell-Braxton L. Widmer H.R. Valverde J. Hefti F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 717-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). However, despite the extensive literature on IGF-I-stimulated oligodendrocyte progenitor survival, the signaling pathways that mediate this effect remain to be fully elucidated. IGF-I interacts with the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) to initiate downstream responses, including proliferation and differentiation. IGF-IR is a heterotetramer with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2. Together with insulin receptor substrate-1/2, IGF-IR activates two main downstream signaling pathways, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascades (9Blakesley V.A. Scrimgeour A. Esposito D. Le Roith D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).

Activated PI3K increases phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the cytoplasmic membrane. One of the crucial downstream targets of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which is recruited to the membrane by direct binding of its pleckstrin homology domain to the PI3K-produced phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Upstream kinases such as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK)-1 and PDK2 activate Akt by phosphorylation of Thr308 (21Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Sale G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10351-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, Src family tyrosine kinases can directly regulate the activity of Akt by phosphorylating Tyr315 and Tyr326 in its activation loop (23Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M.

Activated Akt can phosphorylate a number of proteins, including glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, the apoptosis-inducing protein Bad, and the forkhead-related transcription factor FKHR-L1 to regulate glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and cell survival (25Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4621) Google Scholar). The MEK/ERK pathway activated by IGF-I was shown to promote survival in renal epithelial cells following oxidative injury (26di Mari J.F. Davis R. Safirstein R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F195-F203PubMed Google Scholar). Activated ERK phosphorylates ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which can, in turn, phosphorylate and inactivate Bad, an effector of apoptosis. RSK also phosphorylates and activates the cAMP response element-binding protein, a transcription factor that mediates cell survival (27Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R.

We therefore endeavored to determine whether 1) the PI3K pathway is the only mechanism involved in IGF-I-mediated survival of oligodendrocyte progenitors and 2) whether Akt is the downstream effector of PI3K that mediates this effect. Our results show that IGF-I-promoted oligodendrocyte progenitor survival upon growth factor deprivation is independent of the MEK/ERK pathway, but does require activation of PI3K, as demonstrated using selective inhibitors of MEK (PD 98059) and PI3K (LY 294002 and wortmannin). The specific Src-like tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 abolished Akt activation by IGF-I, but had no significant effects on the blockade of caspase-3 activation or progenitor survival. Furthermore, use of both a selective inhibitor and dominant-negative forms of Akt showed that this enzyme is not the only critical component mediating IGF-I-promoted survival in oligodendrocyte progenitors. An unidentified effector of PI3K, in addition to Akt, thus appears to be required to confer full protection of oligodendrocyte progenitors by IGF-I.

Secondary antibodies used for immunostaining or immunoblotting were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL), Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA), and Cedarlane (Hornby, Ontario). LY 294002, wortmannin, PD 98059, PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), and 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate were obtained from Calbiochem. All other reagents were obtained from VWR International Ltd. (Mont-Royal, Quebec) or Fisher (Montreal, Quebec). Primary Cultures—Primary cultures of oligodendrocyte progenitors were prepared from brains of newborn Sprague-Dawley rats as described (31Cohen R.I. Almazan G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The meninges and blood vessels were removed from the cerebral hemispheres in Ham's F-12 medium. Briefly, the tissues were gently forced through a 230-μm nylon mesh. The dissociated cells were gravity-filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh. This second filtrate was centrifuged for 7 min at 1000 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 12.5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated on poly-l-ornithine-precoated 80-cm2 flasks and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air. The culture medium was changed after 3 days and every 2 days thereafter. The initial mixed glial cultures (grown for 9–11 days) were placed on a rotary shaker at 225 rpm for 3 h at 37 °C to remove loosely attached macrophages. Oligodendrocyte progenitors were detached following shaking for 18 h at 260 rpm. The cells were filtered through a 30-μm nylon mesh and plated on bacterial grade Petri dishes for 3 h. Under these conditions, astrocytes and microglia attached to the plastic surface, and oligodendrocyte progenitors remained in suspension. The final cell suspension was plated on multiwell dishes precoated with poly-d-lysine at a density of ∼15 × 103/cm2. Cultures were maintained in serum-free medium (SFM) containing 2.5 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor AA and 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor to stimulate proliferation, and the medium was changed every 2 days. Ninety-five percent of the cells reacted positively to monoclonal antibody A2B5, a marker for oligodendrocyte progenitors, and <5% were galactocerebro-side-positive oligodendrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes, or C3-positive microglia. All experiments were conducted in DMEM alone or in SFM in the absence or presence of the indicated pharmacological agents. SFM consisted of a 1:1 DMEM/Ham's F-12 mixture, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 25 μg/ml human transferrin, 30 nm triiodothyronine, 20 nm hydrocortisone, 20 nm progesterone, 10 nm biotin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 16 μg/ml putrescine, 30 nm selenium, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Western Blot Analysis—Cells grown in 6-well culture plates were harvested, after treatment, in 50 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 mm NaF. The protein content of cell lysates was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and the samples were adjusted with loading buffer containing 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots containing 25 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as described previously (32Khorchid A. Larocca J.N. Almazan G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked and probed with an appropriate primary antibody. Bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody used in conjunction with an ECL Western blot detection kit. Blots were scanned and quantified using M4 software. To normalize for sample loading and protein transfer, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with an antibody for β-actin, total Akt, or ERK2 as indicated. MTT Assay of Cell Viability—Oligodendrocyte progenitors were treated with IGF-I in the presence or absence of PD 98059, LY 294002, wortmannin, or PP2 in DMEM for 18 h. Because wortmannin is unstable in aqueous solutions (33Jones S.M. Klinghoffer R. Prestwich G.D. Toker A. Kazlauskas A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 512-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it was added every 6 h prior to harvest. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity assayed by cleavage of MTT was used to determine cell viability as described previously (34Liu H.N. Almazan G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2355-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reaction detects only living cells and is based on cleavage of the tetrazolium ring by active mitochondria, producing a visible dark blue formazan product. Oligodendrocyte cultures were incubated with 125 μg/ml MTT at 37 °C for 3 h. The medium was then aspirated, and the precipitated formazan crystals were solubilized in an acid/isopropyl alcohol mixture. Samples were read on a micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay spectrophotometer at 600 nm. Absolute MTT values were normalized by scaling to the mean of progenitor culture grown in DMEM alone (defined as 100%). Visualization of Apoptotic Nuclei (TUNEL Labeling)—Oligodendrocyte progenitors (growing in 24-well tissue culture plates with poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips) were transferred to DMEM with IGF-I in the absence or presence of an inhibitor of PI3K, Src-like kinase, or MEK1 for 18 h at 37 °C. For immunocytochemical detection of apoptotic cells, cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Fragmented DNA (high molecular mass or internucleosomal) was detected by incorporating fluorescein-12-dUTP at the 3′-OH ends using the TUNEL assay as described (35Khorchid A. Fragoso G. Shore G. Almazan G. Glia. 2002; 40: 283-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-fluorescein Fab fragments detected incorporated fluorescein. A 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to detect peroxidase activity. Stained cells were visualized by light microscopy. Transfection of Oligodendrocyte Progenitors with Akt cDNA Constructs—Plasmids CMV6, CMV6-Akt-HA (wild-type Akt), and CMV6-K179M-Akt-HA (kinase-dead Akt (kdAkt)) were purified with the QIAGEN plasmid midi-kit (36Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). Oligodendrocyte progenitors were transfected with the wild-type Akt and kdAkt plasmids using the Effectene transfection reagent kit (QIAGEN Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Dominant-negative Akt (dnAkt; Akt-T308A/ S473A) with an HA tag at the N terminus (37Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and green fluorescent protein (38Larocque D. Pilotte J. Chen T. Cloutier F. Massie B. Pedraza L. Couture R. Lasko P. Almazan G. Richard S. Neuron. 2002; 36: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in adenoviral vectors were used at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The infection efficiency was 75–95% as determined by counting green fluorescent protein-positive cells or immunofluorescence with anti-HA antibody. The progenitors were infected with an adenoviral vector containing dnAkt or green fluorescent protein 48 h before IGF-I treatment. Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—Complementary p59fyn double-strand siRNAs labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 were synthesized by QIAGEN Inc. The siRNA sequences for fyn-1 and fyn-2 covered nucleotides 482–502 and 1307–1327, respectively (NCBI accession number U35365). The siRNAs were transfected into oligodendrocyte progenitors using RNAiFect™ reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Knockdown of fyn was assessed 48 h post-transfection by Western blotting with anti-Fyn and anti-Src antibodies or by fluorescence microscopy of individual Alexa 488-labeled siRNA-positive cells, immunostained with anti-Fyn antibody, followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. On the basis of this screen, the concentration of siRNA that suppressed fyn expression most efficiently (70%) was selected for further experiments. A nonspecific siRNA labeled with Alexa 488 (AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT; QIAGEN Inc.) was used as a negative control. Cell nuclei were stained for 15 min with 500 ng/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride to determine whether the various treatments caused DNA condensation or fragmentation, characteristic of apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation—Oligodendrocyte progenitors were pretreated with PP2 or wortmannin 30 min prior to IGF-I for the indicated times. Cells were harvested in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and insoluble remnants. Immunoprecipitations were carried out in the same buffer using 0.2 mg of protein, 2 μg of antibodies, and 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose at 4 °C for 18 h. The immunocomplexes were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and two times with phosphate-buffered saline and then finally resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, with 50 mm dithiothreitol added freshly). Western blotting was performed as describe above with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Fyn, anti-Src, and anti-Lyn antibodies. Data Analysis—Unless indicated otherwise, results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. Statistical significance was determined by one-way or two-way analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey test; p values <0.05 were considered significant. IGF-I Promotes Survival of Oligodendrocyte Progenitors— Oligodendrocyte progenitors were deprived of growth factors to induce apoptosis. Cells were maintained in DMEM with or without IGF-I for 24 h or in chemically defined SFM, which contained 5 μg/ml insulin. The protective effect of IGF-I on progenitors was determined using the MTT assay. In cells grown in DMEM alone, the viability was only 54% of that of the cells grown in SFM, whereas 100 ng/ml IGF-I increased MTT values to the same levels as those found in SFM (Table I). The survival effect of IGF-I was concentration-dependent, with maximal protection occurring at 50 ng/ml IGF-I (Fig. 1). TUNEL staining was subsequently used to assess the number of apoptotic cells. Twenty percent of the progenitors were TUNEL-positive when grown in DMEM alone. The addition of IGF-I at 100 ng/ml caused a significant reduction in the frequency of apoptosis, reducing the number of TUNEL-positive cells to 6.8%, which is similar to the value obtained for cells grown in SFM (Table I).Table IIGF-I prevents oligodendrocyte progenitor death after growth factor deprivationTreatmentMTT% DMEMTUNELA units% + cellsSFM685 ± 22.8185ap < 0.001, statistical differences compared with DMEM alone.7.14 ± 1.4ap < 0.001, statistical differences compared with DMEM alone.DMEM370 ± 3.1910020.8 ± 1.1DMEM + IGF-I692 ± 40.5187ap < 0.001, statistical differences compared with DMEM alone.6.80 ± 2.3ap < 0.001, statistical differences compared with DMEM alone.a p < 0.001, statistical differences compared with DMEM alone. Open table in a new tab IGF-I Activates the PI3K/Akt Pathway—Most of the biological effects mediated by IGF-I involve activation of two downstream signaling pathways: the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt cascades (9Blakesley V.A. Scrimgeour A. Esposito D. Le Roith D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To investigate whether these pathways are involved in IGF-I signaling in oligodendrocyte progenitors, we assessed the activation levels of ERK1/2 and Akt by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. Akt was phosphorylated at both Ser473 and Thr308 (data not shown) when cultures were treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. This activation was maintained for 48 h (Fig. 2). In addition, GSK3β, a downstream target of Akt, was phosphorylated at Ser9 after IGF-I treatment in a pattern that paralleled Akt activation. In contrast to the effect of IGF-I on Akt, ERK1/2 was transiently phosphorylated at 5 min and decreased to control levels or below at 1 and 4 h, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. S1). IGF-I Inhibits Activation of Caspase-3 Induced by Growth Factor Withdrawal—Growth factor deprivation triggers the activation of caspase-3, a potent effector of apoptosis in oligodendrocyte progenitors (39Soane L. Cho H.J. Niculescu F. Rus H. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2305-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the 32-kDa procaspase-3 into active 17- and 12-kDa fragments. Progenitors were incubated in DMEM with or without 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 1–48 h, and the activation of caspase-3 was determined by Western blotting with an antibody directed against the 17-kDa fragment. In DMEM alone, caspase-3 activation was time-dependent, with a significant increase detected at 4 h and maximal activation at 48 h. Treatment with IGF-I was able to suppress caspase-3 activation for as long as 48 h (Fig. 2). These results indicate that growth factor withdrawal-induced caspase-3 activation is involved in progenitor apoptosis and that this activation is prevented by IGF-I. PI3K Inhibitors Reverse the IGF-I-mediated Rescue of Oligodendrocyte Progenitors from Cell Death, in Contrast to MEK and Src Inhibitors—Cells were pretreated with selected kinase inhibitors for 30 min prior to addition of 100 ng/ml IGF-I, and MTT reduction was assayed 18 h later. At the highest concentrations, these drugs can reduce cell survival on their own. The MTT results are therefore expressed as a percentage of the survival effect calculated from the following formula: (TIGF-I+I – TI)/(TIGF-I – Tcontrol). TIGF-I, TIGF-I+I, TI, and Tcontrol represent the MTT reading for IGF-I alone, IGF-I plus inhibitor, inhibitor alone, and control cells in DMEM alone, respectively. To assess the involvement of PI3K in IGF-I-mediated cell survival, progenitors were treated with the inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin. LY 294002, a selective PI3K inhibitor that acts on the ATP-binding site of the enzyme, caused a concentration-dependent decrease in IGF-I-mediated cell survival (Fig. 3). A significant decrease in MTT reduction was obtained with 10 μm LY 294002, whereas 50 μm LY 294002 almost completely abrogat"
https://openalex.org/W2037065510,"In the post-genomic era, functional prediction of genes is largely based on sequence similarity searches, but sometimes the homologues bear different roles because of evolutionary adaptations. For instance, the existence of enzyme and non-enzyme homologues poses a difficult case for function prediction and the extent of this phenomenon is just starting to be surveyed. Different evolutionary paths are theoretically possible for the loss or acquisition of enzyme function. Here we studied the ancestral role of a model non-catalytic modulatory subunit. With a rational approach, we “resurrected” enzymatic activity from that subunit to experimentally prove that it derived from a catalytic ancestor. We show that this protein (L subunit ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) evolved to have a regulatory role, losing catalytic residues more than 130 million years ago, but preserving, possibly as a by-product, the substrate site architecture.

An attractive model to study the evolution of allosteric control is ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-Glc PPase), 1The abbreviations used are: ADP-Glc, ADP-glucose; PPase, pyrophosphorylase; Glc1P, glucose 1-phosphate; 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; S, small; L, large.1The abbreviations used are: ADP-Glc, ADP-glucose; PPase, pyrophosphorylase; Glc1P, glucose 1-phosphate; 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; S, small; L, large. a regulatory enzyme for the synthesis of bacterial glycogen and starch in plants. It has evolved to be regulated by different key metabolites depending on the main carbon assimilation pathway of the organism (1Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure plays an important role in its allosteric regulation. Most of the bacterial ADP-Glc PPases are homotetramers (1Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), whereas the plant enzymes comprise two types of homologous but distinct subunits (2Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3Morell M.K. Bloom M. Knowles V. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 182-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Okita T.

Evol. 1992; 34: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the small (S subunit, 50–54 kDa), and the large (L subunit, 51–60 kDa). They form a heterotetrameric structure S2L2 where the S subunit is catalytic, but L subunit is modulatory without catalytic function (2Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The L subunit modifies the sensitivity of the S subunit toward allosteric effectors, possibly by protein-protein interactions. This is of remarkable physiological importance because expression of different L subunits in different plants tissues confers distinct allosteric properties to the tetramer according to the necessities for starch synthesis (7Crevillén P. Ballicora M.A. Mérida A. Preiss J. Romero J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The similarity between S and L subunits (∼50% identity) suggests a common ancestry (5Smith-White B.J. Preiss J. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, gene duplication, divergence leading to new roles (catalytic and modulatory), additional divergence of modulatory genes, and further establishment of differential tissue expression seems to be the strategy used by nature to control and regulate the synthesis of starch, one of the most important storage compounds on earth. To understand the evolutionary path that led to this divergence, it is fundamental to know the ancestral role of these subunits. The ancestor of S and L subunits could have been 1) catalytic as the S subunit or 2) non-catalytic as the L subunit. The first scenario is supported by the similarity between plant subunits with many active bacterial ADP-Glc PPases (1Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, we cannot simply rule out the second possibility because of the existence of non-catalytic homologues such as the products of the glgD genes from Gram-positive bacteria (8Takata H. Takaha T. Okada S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4689-4698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that the L subunit from the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber ADP-Glc PPase binds substrates. The heterotetramer (S2L2), as well as bacterial homotetramers (α4), binds four ADP-[14C]glucose molecules (9Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Haugen T.H. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the L subunit maintained the structure of the substrate site needed for binding, whereas the catalytic ability was severely reduced by mutations of essential residues. To test this hypothesis, we sought to design an L subunit with significant catalytic activity mutating as few residues as possible. α-d-[U-14C]Glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [32P]PPi was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Glc1P, ATP, ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), and inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). Ampligase®, a thermostable DNA ligase, was purchased from Epicenter (Madison, WI). All other reagents were purchased at the highest quality available. The Macromolecular Structure, Sequencing, and Synthesis Facility (MS3F) at Michigan State University performed the synthesis of oligonucleotides and automated DNA sequencing. Mutant D145N on the S subunit was obtained as described previously (6Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Combined chain reaction (CCR) was used to introduce other mutations (11Bi W. Stambrook P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding the wild-type S subunit (pML10), the S subunit mutant D145N (pML10-D145N), or the wild-type L subunit (pMON17336) were used as templates for the mutagenesis (12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Iglesias A.A. Barry G.F. Meyer C. Bloksberg L. Nakata P.A. Greene T.

In the S subunit, the residues were changed with the following oligonucleotides: R33K, 5′-GGA GCT GGG ACC AAA CTT TAT CCT CTA-3′; K43T, 5′-AAA AAA AGA GCA ACC CCA GCT GTT CCA-3′; K198R, 5′ T GAA TTT GCA GAG CGC CCG CAA GGA GAG C-3′. In the L subunit, the oligonucleotides used were: K44R, 5′-GGA GAA GGG ACC CGC TTA TTC CCA CTT A-3′; T54K, 5′-AGT AGA ACT GCA AAG CCT GCT GTT CCG-3′; K213R, 5′-AG TTT GCT GAA CGT CCA AAA GGT TT-3′. L subunit mutants on the residue 160 were obtained as described previously (6Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mutated fragments were exchanged to the double mutant plasmid pMON17336-K44R/T54K using the restriction sites SspI and SacI to obtain the triple mutants LK44R/T54K/D160N and LK44R/T54K/D160E. The coding regions of the mutant plasmids were sequenced to confirm that only the intended mutations were introduced. Protein concentration during enzyme purification was measured by using bicinchoninic acid reagent (14Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18335) Google Scholar) from Pierce, with bovine serum albumin as standard. Interfering substances were previously removed precipitating with 12% trichloroacetic acid and 0.025% sodium deoxycholate and dissolving in 5% SDS, 0.1 n NaOH. Protein concentration of the purified enzymes was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.0 (6Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting of the protein samples were performed as described previously (6Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Samples were desalted with Bio-Rad 10 DG chromatography columns. Centricon-30 devices (Amicon Inc.) were used to concentrate the enzymes. Pyrophosphorolysis Direction—The formation of [32P]ATP from [32P]PPi and ADP-Glc was measured as follows. The standard aqueous reaction mixture contained 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 8.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm [32P]PPi (300–1500 cpm/nmol), 2 mm ADP-Glc, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm 3-PGA, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, plus enzyme in a total volume of 0.25 ml. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The [32P]ATP formed was measured as described previously (3Morell M.K. Bloom M. Knowles V. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 182-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis Direction—The synthesis of ADP-[14C]Glc from [14C]Glc1P and ATP was measured by the method of Yep et al. (15Yep A. Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The standard aqueous reaction mixture contained 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 8.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm [14C]Glc1P (800–1000 cpm/nmol), 1.5 mm ATP, 2 mm 3-PGA, 1.5 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, plus enzyme in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 1 min. ADP-[14C]Glc was assayed as described previously (15Yep A. Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unit Definition—In the above assays, one unit of enzyme activity is equal to 1 μmol of product, either [32P]ATP or [14C]ADP-glucose, formed per minute. The Escherichia coli AC70R1-504 cells, which lack endogenous ADP-Glc PPase activity (12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), were co-transformed with compatible plasmid pML10 (S subunit) and pMON17336 (L subunit) or their respective mutated derivatives for co-expression of the subunits. Transformed cells were grown in 2 liter of LB medium, induced, harvested, and sonicated in buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose) as described previously (16Ballicora M.A. Fu Y. Nesbitt N.M. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purification was performed at 0–4 °C. The crude extract was applied onto a 12-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (10 column volumes, 0–0.5 m). Purest fractions were pooled, desalted, concentrated, and applied onto a Mono Q HR 16/10 (FPLC, Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (16 bed volumes, 0.1–0.5 m). The post-Mono Q fractions were pooled, concentrated, resuspended in buffer B (buffer A plus 1.3 m ammonium sulfate), and applied onto a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 (FPLC, Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with buffer B. The sample was eluted with a decreasing linear gradient (20 bed volumes) of ammonium sulfate (1.3 to 0 m ammonium sulfate). The purest fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted. After this procedure, enzymes were >95% pure. The enzymes were followed by pyrophosphorolysis activity, except SD145NLWT, SD145NLK44R, and SK43TLWT, which were followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Curves were performed varying the concentration of the effector studied while keeping a constant saturated concentration of the other components of the standard reaction mixture. The kinetic data were plotted as initial velocity in nmol min–1 (v) versus effector concentration in μm ([S]). This plot was used to fit the parameters of a modified Hill equation (17Hill A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1910; 40: 4-7Google Scholar), v = Vmax[S]n/(S0.5n + [S]n), by the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares algorithm provided by the computer program Origin® 5.0 (18Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, New York1988: 656-706Google Scholar). The parameter S0.5 is the concentration of substrate needed to obtain 50% of the maximum activity (Vmax). The activation curves were fitted with the similar equation, v = v0 + (Vmax – v0) [S]n/(S0.5n + [S]n). The parameter v0 is the activity in absence of activator, and A0.5, is the concentration of activator needed to obtain 50% of the maximal activation (Vmax – v0). The standard deviations were obtained by the Levenberg-Marquardt method (18Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, New York1988: 656-706Google Scholar). Specific activity was determined at saturating concentrations of effectors and different dilutions of the enzyme to plot activity versus protein concentration. The specific activity was determined from the slope in the linear range. From this value, kcat was calculated as number of molecules of ADP-Glc synthesized (consumed in the reverse direction) per molecule of enzyme per second. For this calculation, we used 202 kDa as molecular mass of the S2L2 enzyme (12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The set of invariants from an alignment of catalytic ADP-Glc PPase subunits should contain most of, if not all, the essential residues for catalysis. Among those, the ones that are absent in the L subunits were candidates to be responsible for the lack of catalytic activity. In the comparison, to avoid missing important residues, we excluded sequences of modulatory or potentially inactive ADP-Glc PPase subunits. A first conservative alignment was performed with ADP-Glc PPases with experimentally proven catalytic activity (Fig. 1A). Those enzymes were from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (19Igarashi R.Y. Meyer C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (20Uttaro A.D. Ugalde R.A. Preiss J. Iglesias A.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28508-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and S. tuberosum, tuber S subunit (12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In that alignment, 64 residues were invariant in the putative catalytic domain of the potato tuber S subunit (residues 21–290 (2Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 25Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46319-46325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). From those, the only four absent in the potato tuber L subunit were Arg33, Lys43, Gln126, and Ile232 (S subunit numeration). A second comparison with a broader and less strict selection of enzymes strongly suggested that Gln126 and Ile232 are not essential. The criteria to select enzymes with high probability of being catalytic in this second round were: 1) from bacterial genome projects that detected only one ADP-Glc PPase gene per organism and 2) genes identified as glgC (active) and not as glgD, known to produce non-catalytic polypeptides in Bacillus (8Takata H. Takaha T. Okada S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4689-4698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arg33 and Lys43 were still invariant in this second alignment, but Gln126 and Ile232 were replaced in 7 and 12 out of 58 cases, respectively. Among S subunits from plants, Arg33 and Lys43 were conserved except sequence 20 (homologous of Lys43 to Asn) and sequence 21 (homologous of Arg33 to Lys) (supplemental Table I). The existence of duplicated genes (paralogs) and pseudo-genes in plants raised the question whether these exceptions actually generate active enzymes. Homology modeling of the putative pyrophosphorylase domain (residues 31–310) of the wild-type L subunit of the ADP-Glc PPase from potato tuber and the double mutant LK44R/T54K was performed with the program Modeller 6v2 (26Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10277) Google Scholar). The structure was modeled using two simultaneous templates; the known atomic coordinates of the E. coli dTDP-Glc PPase (RffH) complexed with dTTP and Mg2+ (Protein Data Bank code 1MC3), and human Agx2 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase; Protein Data Bank code 1JVG) (27Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Sivaraman J. Sauve V. Matte A. Cygler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44214-44219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this way, we took advantage of the features of the program Modeller to use the best part of each template (29Sanchez R. Sali A. Webster D.M. Protein Structure Prediction, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 97-129Google Scholar). We guided the initial alignment for the homology modeling with the secondary structure prediction performed with the PSI-PRED method (30Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar) available on the PSI-PRED server (bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) (31McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). Alignment with the templates was based on homology, secondary structure, and hydrophobicity. There were strong indications that ADP-Glc PPases share with the templates a pyrophosphorylase domain with the same fold despite the identity was ∼20% (2Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In addition, threading and fold recognition analysis with the program GenTHREADER (32Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) predicted a common fold with a very high confidence. Running the region from residues 31–320 from the L subunit from potato tuber, gave E values (expected number of false hits per sequence query) of 2 × 10–5, and 4 × 10–5 for 1G0R (dTDP-Glc PPase) and 1JV1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase), respectively. In the active site, we modeled a deoxyribose triphosphate ligand extracted from the coordinates of the dTTP bound to RffH. That is the shared moiety between the ATP and dTTP bound to the ADP-Glc PPase and dTTP-Glc PPase, respectively. The model was checked with the programs Verify3D (33Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar) and PRO-CHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Minor adjustments in the alignments with the templates were checked and modified iteratively to improve the three-dimensional-one-dimensional scores provided by Verify3D along the sequence. There was no structural change, in any of the iterations, in the area of the residues analyzed in this work. The region between residues 217–232, which corresponds to an insertion, was the only one with low 3D-1D score. This is expected from insertions of more than eight residues (35Krieger E. Nabuurs S.B. Vriend G. Bourne P.E. Weissig H. Structural bioinformatics. Wiley-Liss, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2003: 509-523Google Scholar). However, this area is very far from the region analyzed in the paper, in the other lobe of the catalytic domain, exposed, and not facing the active site. Recently, the crystal structure of the tetrameric form (S4) of the S subunit from potato tuber was solved (36Jin X. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Geiger J.H. EMBO J. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). This structure was in an inhibited conformation, which made it unsuitable as a template for modeling an active L subunit. However, it confirmed that the templates selected in this study (RffH and Agx2) were appropriate, because they share the same fold in the catalytic domain as previously predicted (2Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). RffH and Agx2 are not allosterically regulated and are better templates to model the active conformation of the substrate site of the L subunit. ADP-Glc PPase sequences from Supplemental Table I were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The expression data were taken from the literature. Multiple sequence alignment was performed by the Clustal program (37Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar) available on-line (clustalw.genome.jp), and afterward, it was manually refined with the BioEdit v6.0.7 program (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). For the phylogenetic analysis, the N terminus of all the sequences was discarded. That region is not homologous and corresponds to the leading peptide for subcellular targeting, which has been shown in the S subunits that belongs to an exon with a different evolutionary history (38Hannah L.C. Shaw J.R. Giroux M.J. Reyss A. Prioul J.-L. Bae J.-M. Lee J.-Y. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alignment started in residue 2 of the mature recombinant S subunit from potato tuber (A2VSDSQNSQT...) and residue 13 of the mature recombinant L subunit from potato tuber (Q13TVFVDMPR...). The unrooted tree was built by the neighbor-joining method (39Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) as implemented in the PHYLIP package (evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html), version 3.6. The tree was drawn with the program Phylodraw (40Choi J.H. Jung H.Y. Kim H.S. Cho H.G. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The outgroup chosen was the ADP-Glc PPase from Anabaena because cyanobacterial enzymes are the closest to plant enzymes (2Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The topology of the tree of the L subunit gene family from plants was further investigated using the Maximum-likelihood method as implemented in the program TREE-PUZZLE (41Schmidt H.A. Strimmer K. Vingron M. von Haeseler A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). The tree was rooted with the sequence of the L subunit from the unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and plotted with the program TREEVIEW (42Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of critical missing residues was the first important step to design an active L subunit. A sequence alignment of ADP-Glc PPases with reported activity (experimentally assayed) allowed us to focus on few candidates. The set of invariants should contain most of, if not all, the essential residues. The subset of the ones absent in the L subunit was of special interest. We chose Lys44 and Thr54 in the L subunit from potato tuber as the best candidates to study because the homologous residues (Arg33 and Lys43 in the S subunit, Fig. 1A) were differentially conserved in the active bacterial and S subunits (see a detailed analysis under “Experimental Procedures”). In addition, Lys44 and Thr54 are in a highly conserved region of ADP-Glc PPases (Fig. 1A). Resurrection of ADP-Glc PPase Catalysis—To convert the modulatory L subunit into a catalytic one, we substituted Lys44 and Thr54 by Arg44 and Lys54, respectively. The mutant LK44R/T54K was expressed alone, but no activity was detected, most probably because the L subunit is unable to form a stable tetramer in absence of the S subunit (43Wang S.-M. Lue W.-L. Yu T.-S. Long J.-H. Wang C.-N. Eimert K. Chen J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activity of L subunit mutants cannot be readily tested with a co-expressed wild-type S subunit because of the intrinsic activity of the latter. We co-expressed the L subunit mutants with SD145N, an inactive S subunit in which the catalytic Asp145 was mutated (6Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant J. 2003; 33: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this way, the activity deriving from the S subunit was reduced more than three orders of magnitude (Table I). Co-expression of the L subunit double mutant LK44R/T54K with SD145N generated an enzyme with considerable activity, 10 and 18% of the wild-type enzyme (SWTLWT) in the forward and reverse direction, respectively (Table I). Single mutation K44R generated an enzyme (SD145NLK44R) with no significant activity over the control (SD145NLWT). Mutation T54K (SD145NLT54K) was more effective, but the combination of both mutations in the L subunit (SD145NLK44R/T54K) had the most dramatic effect (Table I). Therefore, we concluded that the two residues Arg44 and Lys54 are needed for restoring catalytic activity to the L subunit.Table IActivity of ADP-Glc PPase mutantsSubunitskcatSLForward (synthesis)aActivator (4 mm 3-PGA) and substrates (2 mm ATP and 0.5 mm Glc1P) were saturating.Reverse (pyrophosphorolysis)bActivator (4 mm 3-PGA) and substrate ADP-Glc (2 mm) were saturating.

Open table in a new tab The resurrection of catalytic activity in the L subunit by incorporation of Arg44 and Lys54 predicted that the homologous residues in the S subunit are also critical. Replacement of those two residues by the homologous in the L subunits (mutations R33K and K43T) decreased the activity one and two orders of magnitude, respectively, in both directions, confirming the hypothesis (Table I).

Multiple alignment analyses on the cDNA and the translated protein sequences showed that T. durum MT (dMT) can be classified as a type 1 MT. dMT has three Cys-X-Cys motifs in each of the N- and C-terminal domains and a 42-residue-long hinge region devoid of cysteines. dMT was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein (GSTdMT), and bacteria expressing the fusion protein showed increased tolerance to cadmium in the growth medium compared with controls. Purified GSTdMT was characterized by SDS- and native-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. It was shown that the recombinant protein binds 4 ± 1 mol of cadmium/mol of protein and has a high tendency to form stable oligomeric structures. The structure of GSTdMT and dMT was investigated by synchrotron x-ray solution scattering and computational methods. X-ray scattering measurements indicated a strong tendency for GSTdMT to form dimers and trimers in solution and yielded structural models that were compatible with a stable dimeric form in which dMT had an extended conformation. Results of homology modeling and ab initio solution scattering approaches produced an elongated dMT structure with a long central hinge region. The predicted model and those obtained from x-ray scattering are in agreement and suggest that dMT may be involved in functions other than metal detoxification.

The predicted model and those obtained from x-ray scattering are in agreement and suggest that dMT may be involved in functions other than metal detoxification.

Philcox J.C. Carey L.C. Rofe A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). After first being identified as a cadmium-binding protein in horse kidney (2.Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), MTs were found in a wide range of organisms from plants to fungi, and their high capacity to bind metals (e.g. copper, cadmium, zinc, mercury, and silver) in metal-thiolate clusters was demonstrated (3.Vasak M. Hasler D.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 4.Kagi J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Several functional roles have been attributed to MTs, including heavy metal detoxification, zinc and copper homeostasis (5.Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 6.Brouwer M. Syring R. Hoexum B.T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 88: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), scavenging of reactive oxygen species (7.Ebadi M. Leuschen M.P. el Refaey H. Hamada F.M. Rojas P. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), regulation of metalloenzymes and transcription factors (5.Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), involvement in metabolism of metallo-drugs and alkylating agents, response to stress conditions, and the potential involvement at inflammatory sites and in apoptosis (8.Vallee B.L. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Historically, MTs have been classified in three groups according to their sequence similarities. Class I consists of those with high sequence homology to mammalian MTs; class II includes all that do not display significant similarity to class I, and class III consists of phytochelatins, enzymatically synthesized peptides with a poly(γ-glutamylcysteinyl)glycine structure found in plants (9.Klaassen C.D. Metallothionein IV, Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1999Crossref Google Scholar). In recent years computational analyses resulted in a more detailed classification, where the MT superfamily was divided into families, classes, and subclasses based on the location and distribution of the cysteine residues (10.Binz P.A. Kagi H.R. Klaassen C.D. Metallothionein IV. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1997: 7-21Google Scholar). Mammalian MTs (class I) contain 20 highly conserved cysteines that are arranged in the form CXC (where C is a cysteine residue and X indicates any other amino acid) clustered in the N- and C-terminal regions. A total of seven divalent metals are bound in these two clusters ((Me(II))3Cys9 and (Me(II))4Cys11), and the metal binding domains are connected by a variable length hinge region devoid of cysteines (3.Vasak M. Hasler D.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In contrast, a typical class II representative, yeast MT, contains 12 cysteines distributed throughout the sequence with about eight Cu(I) ions bound in a single cluster (11.Wright C.F. McKenney K. Hamer D.H. Byrd J. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12912-12919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Sayers Z. Brouillon P. Svergun D.I. Zielenkiewicz P. Koch M.H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The first MT identified in plants was the zinc-binding Ec protein from wheat embryos (13.Lane B. Kajioka R. Kennedy T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 1001-1005Crossref Google Scholar), and since then more than 50 MT-like sequences have been reported from a variety of species (14.Rauser W.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 31: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence analysis has led to the identification of an entire suite of MT genes in a higher plant suggesting gene amplification during evolution (15.Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). Plant (class II) MTs have been classified into four types based on the amino acid sequences (15.Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). Type 1 includes sequences with CXC clusters at the N and C termini. Type 2 MTs have CC, CXC, and CXXC motifs in the N-terminal and CXC motif in the C-terminal domain, and type 3 proteins are small with cysteine clusters at their N and C termini. Type 4 includes the wheat Ec protein as well as maize and rice MTs, where CXC motifs are distributed throughout the entire sequence. In general, plant MTs are similar to their mammalian counterparts in displaying the CXC patterns but contain unusually long hinge regions. The diversity of conditions inducing expression as well as variations in the sites of expression suggest that plant MTs may be involved in stress responses, programmed cell death, developmental regulation, and heavy metal metabolism (14.Rauser W.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 31: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 15.Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev.

In contrast to identification of several mt-like genes in plants, there are few studies on purified proteins. Apart from Ec and Arabidopsis thaliana MTs (23.Robinson N.J. Wilson J.R. Turner J.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), only the pea type 1 MT (PsMTA) was expressed in Escherichia coli to characterize the protein and determine its metal-binding properties (24.Tommey A.M. Shi J. Lindsay W.P. Urwin P.E. Robinson N.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25.Evans K.M. Gatehouse J.A. Lindsay W.P. Shi J. Tommey A.M. Robinson N.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Soil contamination with cadmium is observed in many agricultural areas because of the increased use of cadmium-containing fertilizers, application of contaminated sewage sludge, and atmospheric deposition of cadmium on crop and soil surfaces. These factors result in accumulation of the toxic heavy metal in crops and its transfer to humans via the food chain. Studies on different wheat cultivars indicated that cadmium accumulation is higher in grains of Triticum durum when compared with Triticum aestivum (26.Meyers M.W. Fricke F.L. Holmgren G.G. Kubota S.J. Chaney R.L. Agronomy Abstracts. The American Society of Agronomy, Madison, WI1982Google Scholar). Furthermore, transport of cadmium taken up through the roots to different parts of the plant is different in durum and bread wheat (27.Cakmak I. Welch R.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28.Hart J.J. Welch R.M. Norvell W.A. Kochian L.V. Physiol. Plant. 2002; 116: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In the present study, the MT gene from T. durum cv. Balcali85 was characterized and compared with that of T. aestivum cv. Bezostaja. Cadmium-binding properties of T. durum MT and its possible role in detoxification of cadmium was investigated by overexpressing the wheat MT in E. coli as a GST fusion. Structural models of the recombinant protein were obtained from x-ray solution scattering patterns and compared with three-dimensional models developed using computational tools. Structural models suggest alternative functional roles for dMT. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—Seeds of both T. durum (T. durum cv. Balcali85 and T. durum cv. C-1252) and T. aestivum (T. aestivum cv. Bezostaja) were surface-sterilized for 20 min in 10% (w/v) H2O2, rinsed with distilled H2O, and germinated in perlite moistened with saturated CaSO4. After 4 days, seedlings were transferred to continuously aerated nutrient solutions, which were changed every 3 days, containing 0.88 mm K2SO4, 2.0 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.25 mm KH2PO4, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm KCl, 100 μm FeEDTA, 1 μm H3BO3, 0.5 μm MnSO4, 0.2 μm CuSO4 and grown with a 16:8-h light/dark regimen at 25.0 °C. Before total RNA isolation, 10 μm CdSO4 was added to the seedlings grown in nutrient solution for 48 h. PCR and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Plant genomic DNA was isolated from 100 mg of 12-day-old frozen tissue of both T. aestivum and T. durum using the Qiagen, DNeasy® plant mini kit. Amplification was carried out using PCR Core System II (Promega) with the following cycle conditions: 1-min wait at all temperatures (95.0, 55.0, and 72.0 °C) for 39 cycles followed by an additional final extension of 1 min. Primers were 5′-ATG TCT TGC AAC TGT GGA-3′ (F1) for upstream and 5′-ACA GTT GCA GGG GTT GCA-3′ (R1) for downstream, including a stop codon. Products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, purified using QIAquick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen), inserted into pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega), and propagated in E. coli grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LBA). Isolated constructs were sequenced at Seqlab GmbH (Goettingen, Germany). Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy® plant mini kit (Qiagen), and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using the Oligotex® mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). Results were monitored by electrophoresis in formaldehyde (2.2 m)-agarose (1.2%) gels in MOPS buffer (0.02 m MOPS, 2 mm CH3COONa, 1 mm EDTA), pH 7.0 (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out using the One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen®) with reverse transcription at 50.0 °C for 30 min, followed by heat inactivation of enzymes for 15 min at 95.0 °C. cDNA was amplified using primers F1 and R1 during 40 cycles: with a 1-min wait at 94.0, 53.5, and 72 °C, followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72.0 °C. mt cDNAs were inserted into pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) and propagated in E. coli grown in LBA. Isolated constructs were sequenced at Seqlab GmbH (Goettingen, Germany). Protein Expression in E. coli and Purification of Recombinant GST-dMT and dMT—The GST fusion protein vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for recombinant wheat MT expression in E. coli BL21(DE3). Two primers (F2, 5′-CTATGGAATTCCCATGTCTTGCAAC-3′, and R2, 5′-CTATGCTCGAGTTAACAGTTGCAGG-3′, containing the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively) were designed to facilitate in-frame ligation with the vector. The construct pGEXdMT was initially propagated in E. coli XL1-Blue and grown in LBA for sequence analysis; later, protein expression was carried out in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Optimum induction was obtained with 0.75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37.0 °C with continuous shaking at 250 rpm for 5 h. Expression was monitored by analysis of cellular extracts by 12% SDS-PAGE (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar). Large scale purification of recombinant protein was carried out from 1.5-liter cultures grown up to A600 = 1.2 before induction in LBA containing 0.05 mm CdSO4. Cells were pelleted 4 h after induction and lysed in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4), pH 7.3. About 80 ml of extract was loaded on a 5-ml GSTrap FF affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The GSTrap column was connected to an ΔKTA™-FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences), and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 20 mm reduced glutathione was used for elution of GSTdMT at 1 ml/min collecting 1-ml fractions. The purified protein was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, 4–20% native PAGE, and Western blot analysis (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and its absorption spectrum was determined between 200 and 800 nm (Shimadzu UV 3150 UV-Visible Optic Spectrophotometer). The concentration of the GSTdMT fusion product was determined using an extinction coefficient of A1%280 = 20 for GST. The metal content, amino acid sequence, and molecular mass of purified protein was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS (TOPLAB Munich, Germany). Oligomeric states of GSTdMT and dMT were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. GSTdMT and dMT were dialyzed against several changes of PBS, pH 7.3, or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl, and about 6–7 ml of protein at 2.5 mg/ml were loaded on HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) size exclusion column run with the same buffers. Proteins were eluted at 2.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Metal Tolerance of Transformed E. coli—Tolerance of transformed and control E. coli to metals in the growth medium was tested in the concentration range 0.05 to 0.9 mm CdCl2. Briefly, starter cultures (5 ml) of bacteria (transformed with pGEXdMT and untransformed controls) were grown overnight and used at 1:100 dilution for induction cultures. dMT expression was induced at A600 = 1.0 by addition of 0.75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside with simultaneous addition of metals to the cultures. Bacterial growth was monitored up to 12 h by A600 measurements. Molecular Modeling of dMT—The N-terminal (residues 1–18) and C-terminal (residues 61–75) metal binding domains were reconstructed by homology modeling. dMT metal binding α- and β-domains were aligned with MT sequences obtained from the protein data bank (31.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26931) Google Scholar). Candidate structures for homology modeling were selected according to pairwise alignment scores and their similarities in cysteine distribution patterns relative to the target sequences. Sea urchin MT β-domain (Protein Data Bank code 1QJL) and rat liver MT β-domain (Protein Data Bank code 2MRT) were used as template structures for homology modeling of dMT α- and β-domains, respectively. Target structures were reconstructed using the DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer version 3.7 (32.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9502) Google Scholar). During modeling, cysteine-metal distances in the template structures were kept constant, and other amino acids were placed in the structure accordingly for both domains. As the protein data bank did not contain any structure with a sequence that would be sufficiently similar to the complete hinge region (residues 19–60), the “3D-PSSM” fold recognition technique (33.Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) and the “ROSETTA/I-site Server” (34.Simons K.T. Kooperberg C. Huang E. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) for ab initio protein structure determination were used to predict the structure of the hinge region. The folds, with low E values obtained from the 3D-PSSM server, were aligned with the dMT hinge region to predict nine structures that were checked for overall stereochemical quality using ERRAT (35.Colovos C. Yeates T.O. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). Five more predicted structures were obtained from the ROSETTA/I-site server. Solution X-ray Scattering and Data Processing—The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected on the X33 camera (36.Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods A. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 37.Boulin C.J. Kempf R. Gabriel A. Koch M.H.J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods A. 1988; 269: 312-320Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) on the storage ring DORIS III of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) using multiwire proportional chambers with delay line readout (38.Gabriel A. Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods A. 1982; 201: 203-204Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The scattering patterns were recorded at a sample detector distance of 2.4 m covering the range of momentum transfer 0.15 < s < 3.5 nm–1 (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 0.15 nm the x-ray wavelength). Solutions of GSTdMT fusion protein in PBS buffer were measured at several concentrations between 1.6 and 9 mg/ml. Because of aggregation at higher concentrations, only the scattering curves measured at concentrations below 3 mg/ml without reduced glutathione were taken for further structure analysis. Bovine serum albumin was also measured as a molecular mass standard at 7 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. To monitor radiation damage during the scattering experiments, data were collected in 15 successive 1-min frames. No radiation damage could be detected either in the x-ray data or in the SDS-PAGE analyses carried out before and after irradiation. Data reduction, background subtraction, and correction for detector response followed standard procedures using the program PRIMUS (39.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). The maximum particle dimension Dmax was estimated using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (40.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration Rg were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (41.Guinier A. Ann. Physique. 1939; 12: 161-237Crossref Google Scholar), assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg) the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0) exp(–(sRg)2/3). These parameters were also computed from the entire scattering pattern using the indirect transform package GNOM (42.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2922) Google Scholar), which also provides the distance distribution function p(r) of the particle. The molecular mass of the solute was evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). The accuracy of this method was limited by the uncertainty in the measured protein concentration used for data normalization. The excluded volume of the hydrated particle (Porod volume) was computed without model assumptions and independently of normalization from the shape scattering curve by using Equation 1 (43.Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar), V=2π2I(0)/∫0∞s2I(s)ds (Eq. 1) This parameter yielded an independent estimate of the molecular mass because for globular proteins its value in nm3 corresponded to about twice the molecular mass in kDa. Low resolution models of the GSTdMT fusion protein were generated ab initio by the programs DAMMIN (44.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) and GASBOR (45.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The program DAMMIN represented the particle as a collection of densely packed beads inside a sphere with diameter Dmax where M ≫ 1. Each bead belongs either to the particle or to the solvent, and the shape is represented by a binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, simulated annealing is employed to search for a compact model that fits the experimental data Iexp(s) to minimize discrepancy as shown in Equation 2, χ2=1N−1∑j[Iexp(sj)−cIcalc(sj)σ(sj)]2 (Eq. 2) where N is the number of experimental points; c is a scaling factor and Icalc(s) and σ(sj) are the calculated intensity and the experimental error at the momentum transfer sj, respectively. Prior to shape analysis by DAMMIN, a constant is subtracted from each data point to force the s–4 decay of the intensity at higher angles following the Porod's law (43.Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) for homogeneous particles. The program GASBOR represents a protein by an assembly of dummy residues and uses simulated annealing to build a locally “chain-compatible” dummy residue model inside the same search volume (45.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Dummy residue modeling is able to fit higher resolution data without subtraction of a constant and generally provides more detailed models than those given by the other shape determination algorithms. The reconstructions were performed without symmetry restrictions and also assuming a point symmetry group P2 as the results suggested that the GSTdMT fusion protein is a dimer in solution. The crystallographic model of dimeric Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) was taken from the protein data bank (31.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26931) Google Scholar), code 1GTA (46.McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), for molecular modeling. A simulated annealing protocol was employed to construct dMT strands as interconnected chains of dummy residues (47.Petoukhov M.V. Eady N.A.J. Brown K.A. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3113-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) attached to the C termini of a GST dimer minimizing discrepancy between the scattering curve calculated from the entire fusion protein and the experimental scattering data. The procedure was constrained by imposing P2 symmetry. An additional attempt at rigid body modeling was performed based on the tentative model of dMT connected to C termini of GST dimer via 12-amino acid long dummy residues linkers. The theoretical scattering pattern I(s) was calculated from the available high resolution coordinates of the portion with known structure and from the portion with unknown structure represented as dummy residues using spherical harmonics as shown in Equation 3, I(s)=2π2N2{∑l=0∞∑m=−ll|∑nlAlmn(s)+∑kBlmk(s)|2} (Eq. 3) Here the complex functions Anlm(s) are the partial scattering amplitudes of the subunits in the given positions and orientations that depend on the scattering amplitudes in the reference positions calculated using the program CRYSOL (48.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2742) Google Scholar) and on three rotational and three translational parameters. Bklm(s) values are the partial amplitudes of dummy residues comprising the unknown parts, calculated using the form factor of a dummy residue (45.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 47.Petoukhov M.V. Eady N.A.J. Brown K.A. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3113-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The summations run only over symmetry-independent subunits and dummy residues and over m and l values permitted by the selection rules for the spherical harmonics; n is the number of symmetry mates (for P2, m is even, n = 2). The algorithm is a particular application of the program BUNCH, which allows quaternary structure modeling of multisubunit proteins and deletion mutants against the SAXS data when only a limited part of high resolution structure of subunits is available. 2M. V. Petoukhov and D. I. Svergun, manuscript in preparation. The program searches the optimal positions and orientations of available high resolution models of subunits and the most probable conformations of interconnected chains composed of dummy residues representing the missing fragments, which are attached to the appropriate residues in high resolution structures, to fit the experimental scattering data of the entire construct. Sequence data from this article have been deposited with the GenBank™ data library under accession numbers AY688468 (T. aestivum cv. Bezostaja MT mRNA), AY688469 (T. durum cv. Balcali85 MT mRNA), AY688470 (T. durum cv. C1252 MT mRNA), AY688471 (T. aestivum cv. Bezostaja mt gene), and AY688472 (T. durum cv. Balcali85 mt gene).

https://openalex.org/W2017774316,"Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have reduced gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, leading to gonadotropin deficiencies, hypogonadism, and anovulation, which are completely reversed following leptin administration. To determine whether the role of leptin in ovulation is mediated exclusively through GnRH, we studied leptin's action in GnRH-deficient (hpg) mice, as well as ob/ob mice and normal, prepubertal mice in which the GnRH axis was blocked with antide. Following pretreatment with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, leptin induced ovulation in all three mouse models. Unlike mature normal mice, these ovulations were not triggered by a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, as demonstrated by lack of increase in its surrogate marker progesterone. Rather, leptin induced hyperemia and leakage in the follicle, as well as the proteinase ADAMTS-1 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin-like motif), which facilitates extrusion of the follicular content. These data show that on top of its role as an inducer of GnRH secretion, leptin may elicit an LH-independent ovulation."
https://openalex.org/W2028533666,"There are several isoforms of interleukin (IL) -15 generated by alternating splicing. We reported previously that alternative IL-15 transgenic (Tg) mice expressing an IL-15 cDNA isoform encoding nonsecretable IL-15 protein had an impaired ability to produce IL-15. In this study, we found that expression of endogenous IL-15 mRNA but not tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA was severely impaired in response to lipopolysaccharide, not only in macrophages from alternative IL-15 Tg mice but also in RAW264.7 cells that had been transfected with alternative IL-15 together with IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ralpha). IL-15 promoter activity was suppressed in the transfected cells. Although nuclear factor-kappaB activation was not impaired, the binding activity of nuclear extracts to the interferon-stimulated response element of the IL-15 promoter region was reduced in RAW264.7 cells, which had been cotransfected with alternative IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha. IL-15 was mainly colocalized with IL-15Ralpha at the cytoplasmic membrane of RAW264.7 cells, which had been cotransfected with normal IL-15, whereas nonsecretable IL-15 was colocalized with IL-15Ralpha in nucleus after cotransfection with alternative IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha. These results suggest that nonsecretable IL-15 generated by alternative splicing suppresses further IL-15 gene transcription, implying a novel autocrine regulatory mechanism for cytokine gene expression by alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2065659402,"We deduced that Agkistrodon actus venom serine proteinases I and II, previously isolated from the venom of A. acutus (Zhu, Z., Gong, P., Teng, M., and Niu, L.

Most biochemical properties, biological roles, and structure of SV-SPs are mainly characterized by using TSV-PA, a plasminogen activator from Trimeresurus stejnegeri venom, with the structure of SV-SPs as the only available model (2Parry M.A. Jacob U.

Wide variance of the sequences and enzymatic properties of these proteinases, which is the feature of SV-SPs (8Braud S. Bon C. Wisner A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Matsui T. Fujimura Y. Titani K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), requires more structural models to annotate the detailed relationship. In particular, although the carbohydrates in native TSV-PA were documented to have little influence on its amidolytic activity and plasminogen activation property (3Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4Zhang Y. Wisner A. Maroun R.C. Choumet V. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20531-20537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), most of SV-SPs contain carbohydrates at variant glycosylation sites, which tempts us to explore whether all of these proteinases match TSV-PA. We have reported previously the purification, partial characterization, and crystallization of two glycosylated SV-SPs, AaV-SP-I and AaV-SP-II from the venom of Agkistrodon acutus (1Zhu Z. Gong P. Teng M. Niu L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Both proteinases have the activity of esterolysis and fibrin-(ogen)olysis and share the same N-terminal amino acid sequence. The proteolytic and esterolytic activities of the proteinases could not be inhibited by some natural serine proteinase inhibitors (e.g. soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI)). Both proteinases have a postulated glycosylated site at Asn35, but the proportions of the carbohydrates within the two proteinases are different (i.e. ∼9% for AaV-SP-I and ∼4% for AaV-SP-II, respectively). In this study, we analyzed the entire amino acid sequences of the two proteinases and determined their three-dimensional structures and the linked oligosaccharide components. Structural comparison revealed that oligosaccharides in the two proteinases provide spatial hindrance toward the binding of some natural inhibitors and might be involved in the enzyme-inhibitor interactions as well as the alteration of their catalytic activities. Sequencing N-terminal Amino Acid Residues—Sequencing N-terminal amino acids was preformed as reported previously (1Zhu Z. Gong P. Teng M. Niu L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—Venom glands were obtained from snakes living in the southern mountains in Anhui province of China and stored in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted according to the protocol by using a total RNA isolating kit (Promega). Two primers for RT-PCR were designed based on the conserved sequence in various SV-SPs cDNAs, especially those of DAV-PA, acutobin, and tler7 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF159058, AF159057, and AF362127). The sense primer 5′-AACTGGTCATTGGAGGTA/GA-3′ corresponds to the conserved propeptide and the N-terminal residues 16VIGGD/E20 (the amino acid residue numbering is according to sequence of chymotrypsinogen). The antisense primer 5′-CGGGGGGCAAGTC/TGCATC-3′ corresponds to the C-terminal residues (245bDATCPP245g) of DAV-PA and DFA1 (GenBank™ accession number AF089847). RT-PCR was carried out for 30 cycles programmed for 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C. Trypsin Digestion and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry Assay—Both proteinases (0.2 mg) were dissolved in a 50-μl solution of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, and incubated with 1.5 μl of trypsin (4.3 mg/ml; treated with l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone) at 37 °C for 20 h. The digested mixtures were treated with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min and then subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay in a Bruker Biflex III mass spectrometer. The reflector-positive mode was calibrated by standard peptide mixture. All mass values were reported as monoisotopic mass [M+H]+. The amidolytic activity was measured using chromogenic substrates containing modified oligopeptide with p-nitroanilide (p-NA) group. 50 μl of proteinases (20 μg/ml) were added into 450-μl solutions of various concentrations of substrates in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The releasing of p-NA was then monitored continuously at 405 nm. The amount of substrates hydrolyzed was calculated from the increased absorbance at 405 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 10,000 m-1·cm-1 for free p-NA (3Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the kinetic parameters Km and kcat was performed using double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots (initial velocity versus substrate concentration). Protein crystallization, data collection, and reduction are described elsewhere (1Zhu Z. Gong P. Teng M. Niu L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (10Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). The structure of TSV-PA (Protein Data Bank code 1BQY) was used as a model for calculating the cross-rotation and translation function against the data set of AaV-SP-I. A unique solution was obtained. Initial model of AaV-SP-II was then determined using the refined structure of AaV-SP-I as a search model. All refinement steps were performed using the software package CNS (11Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gross P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Both of the refined models consist of all 234 amino acid residues of mature proteins. Three saccharide residues and two sulfate ions were identified in AaV-SP-I, and one saccharide residue and one sulfate ion in AaV-SP-II. The crystallographic R-factor and Rfree were 18.1% and 20.8% for AaV-SP-I and 16.5% and 21.1% for AaV-SP-II, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table I.

Gong P. Teng M. Niu L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here, the complete amino acid sequences of the two proteinases were identified by RT-PCR and mass spectra of the tryptic peptides (Fig. 1). Sequencing four RT-PCR clones rendered two kinds of nucleotide sequences with only a difference of one nucleotide, corresponding to the 62nd amino acid. The codon GAT (encoding Asp62) in two sequences was substituted for AAT (encoding Asn62) in the other two. Based on the difference between the pI values of the two proteinases (i.e. 5.3 and 5.7 for AaV-SP-I and AaV-SP-II, respectively (data not shown)), it was deduced that the nucleotide sequences encoding Asp62 and Asn62 correspond to those of AaV-SP-I and -II, respectively (Fig. 1A). This deduction was consistent with the result of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Both spectra of the tryptic digestions matched the deduced mass values very well, within a tolerance of ±0.5 Da. The fragments with specific tryptic cleavage sites and the corresponding values of monoisotopic masses are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. AaV-SPs display ∼40% sequence identity with non-snake venom serine proteinases, such as porcine trypsin and chymotrypsin. They share 72% sequence identity with TSV-PA (major variance of the sequences located in residues 169∼179) and ∼60% sequence identity with other SV-SPs (Fig. 2A). Residue 35 in AaV-SPs is asparagine, constituting a potential glycosylation site. The amino acid sequence of AaV-SP-II is found to be the same as that of DAV-PA from the venom of the same species Deinagkistrodon acutus (or Agkistrodon acutus; Ref. 15Wang Y.M. Wang S.R. Tsai I.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 161-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the cDNA sequences of AaV-SP-I and -II differ by only two and one nucleotides with that of DAV-PA (GenBank accession number AAF76378), respectively. The variance among the sequences of DAV-PA and AaV-SPs may result from the different living regions of the snakes (i.e. the former case is in Fujian province and the latter is in Anhui province of China). Because the publication on DAV-PA reported only sequence and species, no properties of the protein encoded by gene DAV-PA were provided. For consistency of presentation, we keep the names of the two proteinases as AaV-SP-I and -II here. Amidolytic Activity—Both AaV-SP-I and -II possess amidolytic activity against several chromogenic substrates. The kinetic parameters Km, kcat and kcat/Km for those substrates are summarized in Table II. They both have significant preference for arginine at P1 site. The enzymatic activities for substrate N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-NA are nearly 100-fold lower than those for substrate N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-NA. Moreover, among the assayed substrates, N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-NA is the most efficient substrate for both proteinases. The similarity of substrate preference between them is in agreement with their high sequence identity and their nearly identical three-dimensional structures (see below). However, we also found that AaV-SP-I seemed to have higher values of kcat/Km than AaV-SP-II, for all of the four assayed substrates. The difference of the kcat/Km values of the two proteinases is caused mainly by the variance of kcat (Table II), which implied the structural variation between the two proteins at active site.Table IIKinetic parameters: comparison of AaV-SP-I and -II Data have deviations of ∼5% according to the mean of three assays.SubstratesKmkcatkcat/KmAaV-SP-IAaV-SP-IIAaV-SP-IAaV-SP-IIAaV-SP-IAaV-SP-IIμmmin-1μm-1·min-1d-Phe-l-Pip-Arg-p-NA (S-2238)19726558.529.40.2960.11d-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-NA (S-2302)19811383.618.00.4250.16N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-NA2728311.6118.411.544.23N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-NA32920231.711.20.0960.055 Open table in a new tab Overall Crystal Structure—The overall structures of the two proteinases display a typical fold of trypsin-like serine proteinases. Both structures contain a C-terminal extension of seven residues, a common feature among SV-SPs, and have the same backbone as TSV-PA (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar to the structure of TSV-PA, a salt bridge between the C-terminal Pro245g and the amino group of Lys101 and a disulfide bridge between Cys245e and Cys91 result in a defined conformation of C-terminal extension. An internal salt bridge between the α-amino group of N-terminal Val and the carboxyl group of Asp194 is involved in the formation of active site. With a common cis Pro219 at this site, the S1 pockets of both proteinases are similar to that of TSV-PA and glandular kallikrein (Ref. 16Bode W. Chen Z. Bartels K. Kutzbach C. Schmidt-Kastner G. Bartunik H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 164: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 2PKA). As expected from the 72% sequence identity with TSV-PA, superimposing optimal 228 of all 234 Cα atoms of AaV-SP-I and -II on those of TSV-PA rendered low root-mean-square deviations of 0.81 Å and 0.73 Å, respectively. Consistent with the sequence variance, the structural variances mainly localize at the 37 loop, the 174 loop, and the 99 loop (Fig. 2, A and B). One significant feature of AaV-SPs is the N-glycosylated 37 loop, which contains an Asn35-X-Ser37 sequence, a typical motif for glycosylation. The Asn35-linked carbohydrates were identified in both structures. One monosaccharide NAG301 molecule in AaV-SP-II and one trisaccharide NAG301-FUC302-NAG303 molecule in AaV-SP-I were clearly displayed in the 2Fo-Fc maps (Fig. 3, A and B), which confirmed our previous proposition (1Zhu Z. Gong P. Teng M. Niu L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The existence of a core-fucosylated at C6 of NAG301 as proved by the electron density map of AaV-SP-I was also in good agreement with the fact that most N-linked oligosaccharides of SV-SPs possess fucose (17Lochnit G. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Pfeiffer G. Dabrowski U. Dabrowski J. Stirm S. Strube K.H. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sidechains of Asn35 of both AaV-SPs and the linked carbohydrates protrude into the space between the 60 loop and the 37 loop. However, orientation of the carbohydrates is different. NAG301 of AaV-SP-II is nearer the 60 loop than that of AaV-SP-I, and the bond angle of the glycosidic bond between Asn35 and NAG301 of AaV-SP-I has a shift of about 20° compared with that of AaV-SP-II (Fig. 3C). The distinct orientation of carbohydrates in AaV-SP-I is also concomitant with the additional interactions between FUC302 and other residues. As shown in Fig. 3C, there are two hydrogen bonds, one between the O3 atom of FUC302 and the O atom of His57, and the other between the O4 atom of FUC302 and the O atom of Asp59. In addition, FUC302 even partially occupies the S1′ site, implying that it might have an influence on the macromolecular substrate-enzyme interaction. Furthermore, because the 60 loop and the 37 loop are involved in the formation of the binding site toward some natural inhibitors, such as SBTI, it is possible that the protruded carbohydrates have an ability to influence the inhibitor binding. In fact, when the structures of the two AaV-SPs were superimposed on the structure of trypsin-SBTI complex (Ref. 19Song H.K. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1AVW), the NAG301 of AaV-SP-II collided with the side-chain of Phe502 of SBTI (Fig. 4A) and the trisaccharide NAG301-FUC302-NAG303 of AaV-SP-I occupied even the space encompassed by the residues 502–503, 564–566, and 510–511 of SBTI (Fig. 4B), resulting in broadly steric hindrance to bind SBTI. These hindrances of the carbohydrates of AaV-SPs for inhibitor binding agree with our previous experimental results that the proteolytic and esterolytic activities of AaV-SPs could not be inhibited by SBTI (1Zhu Z. Gong P. Teng M. Niu L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Superimposition of AaV-SP-II (A) and AaV-SP-I (B) with trypsin-SBTI complex for showing the collision between the side-chains of some residues of SBTI and carbohydrates of AaV-SPs. Both AaV-SPs are shown in cyan, trypsin in yellow, and SBTI in magenta.

Huber R. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1MTS), chymotrypsin (Ref. 21Fujinaga M. Sielecki A.R. Read R.J. Ardelt W. Laskowski Jr., M. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 397-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1CHO), and human thrombin (Ref. 22Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 1DX5). First, the segments of residues 175–178 in AaV-SPs protrude to the surface and get closer to the 99 loop compared with TSV-PA (Fig. 5). As the 174 loop and 99 loop participate in the formation of the substrate binding sites S2–S4, the different architectures and relative positions between the two loops influence the substrate specificity. Second, AaV-SPs have a hydrogen bond between the side chains of Glu173 and Tyr215 (Fig. 5), which is substituted by a residue Trp in TSV-PA. This hydrogen bond pulls the side chain of Tyr215 into the substrate-binding site S3 (Fig. 5), and makes the S3 site shallower than that of TSV-PA. It is consistent with their amidolytic activities. Both AaV-SPs show the highest efficiency for the substrate with P3 site occupied by small residue (i.e. N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-NA), whereas TSV-PA has a preference for bulky residue at P3 site (i.e. d-Phe-l-Pip-Arg-p-NA (Ref. 3Zhang Y. Wisner A. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10246-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar; Table II)). Finally, because AaV-SPs possess the non-charged residue Leu at site 174, they lack the corresponding salt bridge between the side chains of Asp97 and Arg174 in TSV-PA. Despite having almost the same sequence, AaV-SP-I and -II show a largely conformational variance in 99 loop with a maximal displacement of ∼1.3 Å (Fig. 5). In TSV-PA, it has been suggested that Asp97 might alter its conformation to bind the substrate, because the salt bridge between the side-chains of Arg174 and Asp97 observed in the crystal structure would occlude the S4 site (2Parry M.A. Jacob U. Huber R. Wisner A. Bon C. Bode W. Structure. 1998; 6: 1195-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found that Glu97 consistently forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Tyr178 in AaV-SP-I, whereas the side chain of Glu97 was parallel to the phenyl ring of Tyr178 in AaV-SP-II (Fig. 5), indicating high flexibility of the residue 97. In addition, S2 site of AaV-SPs is different from that of TSV-PA. The S2 site in TSV-PA is defined by residues Val99 and Glu98. However, in AaV-SPs, it is mainly limited by residue Val98, because the Leu99 of AaV-SPs is oriented away from the site. Comparison between AaV-SP-I and AaV-SP-II—The structures of AaV-SP-I and -II display high similarity, with a 0.34-Å root-mean-square deviation of superimposed Cα atoms, which is consistent with their similar enzymatic properties. Besides the 99 loop, another significant difference between the two proteinases is located in the glycosylated 37 loop, which possibly correlates with their different carbohydrate constitutions. Although the base (residue 189–195) and the back (residue 225–228) of the S1 pocket in the two AaV-SPs exhibit apparent similarity, the entrances (residue 213–220) of S1 pocket in them are of some difference, which is possibly caused by the flexibility of side chains of the His218 and Pro219. Side-chain of His218 in TSV-PA was also considered flexible for its ill defined density. In addition, as a main component of the S2 site, side chains of Val98 have different conformation between the AaV-SPs (Fig. 5). Finally, the architectures of the catalytic triads vary a little in the two proteinases. The distance of the hydrogen bond between O atom of Ser195 and N ϵ2 atom of His is 2.9 Å, whereas the corresponding distance between Ser195 and His57 in AaV-SP-II is 3.2 Å. All of these variances between the two proteinases in the active site perhaps correlate with the variant enzymatic properties more or less, as shown in Table II. Most SV-SPs are insensitive to some natural serine proteinase inhibitors, such as SBTI, hirudin, and heparin, although they show thrombin- or trypsin-like activities (9Matsui T. Fujimura Y. Titani K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Our previous experiments indicated that some natural inhibitors, such as SBTI and heparin, could not inhibit the esterolytic activities of AaV-SPs (1Zhu Z. Gong P. Teng M. Niu L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In TSV-PA, the side chain of Phe193 was documented to play a crucial role for its insensitivity toward bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (5Braud S. Parry M.A. Maroun R. Bon C. Wisner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1823-1828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, most SV-SPs have a distinct Gly193 and retain the resistance against inhibitors. Recent research showed that the 37 loop of TSV-PA could also influence the inactivation by some inhibitors (e.g.plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), indicating a key role of the 37 loop in the interaction between enzyme and inhibitors (7Henriques E.S. Fonseca N. Ramos M.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2355-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is interesting that structural superimposition of the AaV-SPs and the trypsin-SBTI complex indicates that the bulky residues of saccharide in the glycosylated 37 loop would hinder AaV-SPs from binding the inhibitor. The bulky ring of NAG301 of AaV-SP-II clashes with the residue Phe502 of SBTI, and the NAG301 and FUC302 of AaV-SP-I collide extensively with residues 503, 564, and 566 of SBTI (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, the glycosylation of the 37 loop in AaV-SPs is at least one reason for their resistance against the inhibition of SBTI. It is the first structural evidence for the function of the carbohydrates in SV-SPs and may help us to understand the biological roles of the Asn35-linked carbohydrates in other SV-SPs. Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix venom protein C, a SV-SP possessing a glycosylated 37 loop and used in clinical assays (23McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Gempeler-Messina P.M. Volz K. Buhler B. Muller C. Haemostasis. 2001; 31: 266-272PubMed Google Scholar), is sensitive to anti-thrombin III/heparin complex but not to SBTI (25Kisiel W. Kondo S. Smith K.J. McMullen B.A. Smith L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12607-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the carbohydrates may not influence the heparin-mediated inhibition. The recombinant AaV-SPs would help further delineate the role of the glycosylated 37 loop. However, the Phe193 in TSV-PA and the glycosylated 37 loop in AaV-SPs are not common features for SV-SPs. It would be interesting to investigate the relationship between the distinct glycosylation forms and the resistance against inhibitors in other SV-SPs. The substrate binding sites S3 of AaV-SPs are shallower than that of TSV-PA, which mainly results from a substitution at residue 215. Most non-snake-venom serine proteinases, such as bovine trypsin (20Stubbs M.T. Huber R. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), chymotrypsin (21Fujinaga M. Sielecki A.R. Read R.J. Ardelt W. Laskowski Jr., M. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 397-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and human thrombin (22Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), possess a Trp at residue 215. However, SV-SPs have a variance at this site. Two of the most frequent residues in SV-SPs are Trp and Tyr, as presented in TSV-PA and AaV-SPs, respectively. The distinct architecture of site S3 of AaV-SPs could explain the relatively high efficiency for the substrate with small residue at P3 site. Because tyrosine is the major residue at 215 in SV-SPs from venom of Agkistrodon acutus (15Wang Y.M. Wang S.R. Tsai I.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 161-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it could also help us to understand the structural features of site S3 in other SV-SPs. Our assays showed that the two AaV-SPs had different enzymatic properties, although they differ only at residue 62 at the 60 loop and the component of carbohydrates. Site-directed mutagenesis of TSV-PA showed that substitution of 60SNNFQ64 of TSV-PA by a segment 60RRFMR64 of batroxobin, another SV-SP from Bothrops atrox (26Itoh N. Tanaka N. Mihashi S. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3132-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not significantly alter the catalytic parameters of TSV-PA (4Zhang Y. Wisner A. Maroun R.C. Choumet V. Xiong Y. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20531-20537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), so the variance of amidolytic activity between AaV-SPs, perhaps, is not caused only by the single substitution of residue 62. On the other hand, the carbohydrates in the two AaV-SPs, NAG301-FUC302-NAG303 in AaV-SP-I and NAG301 in AaV-SP-II, are close to the active site (Fig. 3C). The distinct saccharides would have different influence on the structure of active site and consequently result in the alteration of amidolytic activity. We thank Min Guo for editing the manuscript."

GPI is synthesized from phosphatidylinositol by stepwise reactions and attached en bloc to nascent proteins. In mammalian cells, the major GPI species transferred to proteins is termed H7. By attachment of an additional ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) to the second mannose, H7 can be converted to H8, which acts as a minor type of protein-linked GPI and also exists as a free GPI on the cell surface. Yeast GPI7 is involved in the transfer of EtNP to the second mannose, but the corresponding mammalian enzyme has not yet been clarified. Here, we report that the human homolog of Gpi7p (hGPI7) forms a protein complex with PIG-F and is involved in the H7-to-H8 conversion.

Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that hGPI7 was associated with and stabilized by PIG-F, which is known to bind to and stabilize PIG-O, a protein homologous to hGPI7. PIG-O is a transferase that adds EtNP to the third mannose, rendering GPI capable of attaching to proteins. We further found that the overexpression of hGPI7 decreased the level of PIG-O and, therefore, decreased the level of EtNP transferred to the third mannose.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells, the first α1–4-linked mannose (Man1) is usually, if not always, modified by EtNP at the 2-position, and the second mannose (Man2) can also be modified by EtNP at the 6-position (9Benachour A.

GPI7 was isolated from yeast and shown to be involved in the addition of an EtNP side chain to Man2. MCD4 and GPI13 are essential for growth of S. cerevisiae, whereas GPI7 is not (9Benachour A.

Therefore, they are very likely to be catalytic during the transfer of EtNPs to mannoses, although their enzyme activities have not yet been directly demonstrated. In this report, we show that the human homolog of Gpi7p, termed hGPI7, binds to and is stabilized by PIG-F and that hGPI7 competes with PIG-O for binding to PIG-F. We further show by means of RNA interference that hGPI7 is involved in the side-chain modification of Man2. Cell Lines—HeLa and K562 class K cells (19Chen R. Udenfriend S. Prince G.M. Maxwell S.E.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cloning of Human GPI7 cDNA—We searched the GenBank™ data base using the BLAST software (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71340) Google Scholar) for sequences homologous to S. cerevisiae Gpi7p (YJL062w) and found a human cDNA containing a 3′ region and a genomic sequence (accession numbers AK000272 and AC015776, respectively). We designed two primers, 5′-CGGTTCCGCATCCAGCCTAGCGTGTCCG (forward) and 5′-TGCCTGTGGGACGCTGAGCAGGAGCAGGG (reverse), on the basis of the genomic sequence and amplified the 5′ region of hGPI7 cDNA from a human placenta cDNA library. The sequence coincided with the corresponding genomic sequence. The 5′ fragment was ligated to the 3′ fragment at the NdeI site to generate the full-length cDNA. The cDNA of the 3′ region was a gift from Dr. S. Sugano (University of Tokyo). RNAi—The expression plasmids for the short hairpin RNAs used were based on the pH1 vector, a gift from Dr. H. Hasuwa (Osaka University) (21Hasuwa H. Kaseda K. Einarsdottir T. Okabe M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3969) Google Scholar). The target sequence specifies a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1041–1059 downstream of the start codon of hGPI7 (tgagagagcagttgagatt). The oligonucleotide was designed to form a hairpin loop, which had a double-stranded target sequence linked by a 9-nucleotide non-complementary spacer (ttcaagaga) (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3969) Google Scholar). We annealed the complementary oligonucleotides and inserted the product into the pH1 vector between the PstI and XbaI sites, resulting in pH1-sihGPI7 (21Hasuwa H. Kaseda K. Einarsdottir T. Okabe M.

Okabe M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To obtain stably knocked down cells, we inserted a phosphoglycerokinase promoter-driven puromycin resistance gene (23Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) into the unique HindIII site of the pH1 plasmid. We electroporated HeLa cells (1 × 107) with 10 μg of pH1-sihGPI7 or pH1-siEGFP in 0.8 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (17Inoue N. Kinoshita T. Orii T. Takeda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6882-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 975 microfarads and 300 V. Transfectants were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks. To check the expression levels of hGPI7 in transfectants, we analyzed the mRNA levels by Northern blotting of 40 μg of total RNA. Plasmids—Protein expression plasmids were constructed on the basis of the pME18Sf vector, a gift from Dr. K. Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). To express GST-tagged hGPI7, we replaced the stop codon of hGPI7 cDNA with an MluI site by PCR. We replaced hDPM1 of pME-Py-hDPM1 (24Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with an EcoRI-MluI fragment containing hGPI7 to generate pME-Py-hGPI7-GST. The plasmids for FLAG-PIG-F, FLAG-mPig-o (mouse PIG-O), FLAG-msALDH (microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase), GST-mPig-n (mouse PIG-N), GST-mPig-o, and GST-msALDH were described previously (16Hong Y.

The plasmids for HA-mPig-o and HA-msALDH were obtained by replacing the FLAG sequence in FLAG-mPig-o and -msALDH with an HA sequence derived from pME-HA-PIG-S (26Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of hGPI7—CHO cells (6.0 × 107) transfected with 45 μg of pME-Py-hGPI7-GST and 20 μg of pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-F were used for subcellular fractionation (24Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Membranes fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40/150 mm NaCl, and the GST-tagged proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (Organon Pharmaceuticals) followed by detection with chemiluminescence (Renaissance, Dupont). The subfractions were characterized by assaying organelle-specific enzymes, namely alkaline phosphodiesterase I for the plasma membrane and α-mannosidase II for the Golgi, and by Western blot analysis for the ER protein ribophorin II (27Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In Vivo Mannose Labeling—HeLa cells or their transfectants (2 × 106) were seeded into a new plate on the day before the assay. Class K cells (5 × 106) or HeLa cells were washed twice with glucose-free medium and then incubated for 1 h in 1 ml of medium containing 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml glucose, 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and 10 μg/ml tunicamycin. Subsequently, 40 μCi/ml [3H]man-nose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cell culture and incubated for 45 min. After five washes with phosphate-buffered saline and cell peeling, the lipids were extracted from the cells with chloroform: methanol:water (10:10:3, v/v), and the mannolipids were purified with butanol-1 and water as described previously (28Hirose S.

The mannolipids were separated by TLC using Kieselgel 60 (Merck) with a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3, v/v) and detected using BAS1500 Fuji Image Analyzer software (Fuji Film Co.). Analysis of Protein Complexes—CHO cells (8 × 106) were co-transfected with 4 μg of pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-F and 8 μg of pMEEB-GST-mPig-n, pMEEB-GST-mPig-o, or pME-Py-hGPI7-GST. After culturing for 2 days, the transfected cells were lysed in 1% digitonin, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the GST-tagged proteins were precipitated from the supernatants with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The GST-tagged and co-precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with anti-GST or anti-FLAG antibodies (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CHO cells (4 × 106) were also co-transfected with 4 μg of pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-F, 20 μg of pME-Py-hGPI7-GST, 2 μg of pMEEB-FLAG-mPig-o, and 2 μg of pME-Py-FLAG-msALDH. hGPI7-GST was precipitated from cell lysate, with anti-GST antibodies or goat serum as a control, and analyzed by Western blotting. Competition between PIG-O and hGPI7—CHO cells (4 × 106) were co-transfected with 1 μg of pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-F, 3 μg of pMEEB-HA-mPig-o, 2 μg of pMEEB-HA-msALDH, and 0, 10, or 20 μg of pME-hGPI7. The total amounts of the plasmids were kept constant by adding the pME18Sf vector. Two days later, the transfectants were lysed in 1% digitonin and divided into two aliquots. FLAG-PIG-F was precipitated with anti-FLAG M2-conjugated beads (Sigma) from one aliquot, and HA-tagged proteins were precipitated with anti-HA HA7 (Sigma) plus protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) from the other aliquot. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Stability of hGPI7 in PIG-F-defective Cells—CHO30.5 cells defective in the PIG-F gene were co-transfected with 8 μg of pME-Py-hGPI7-GST, 2 μg of pME-Py-GST-msALDH, 2 μg of pMEEB-hPIG-l-GST (29Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Kinoshita T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of either pMEEB-FLAG-PIG-F or pME18Sf vector. Two days later, the transfectants were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl and a proteinase inhibitor mixture. The GST-tagged proteins were precipitated with anti-GST antibodies and protein G beads (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol.

Cloning of hGPI7—We cloned the human homolog of yeast GPI7, which is involved in transferring EtNP to Man2 (9Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and termed the gene hGPI7 (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number NM_017733). The hGPI7 gene encodes 983 amino acids, consists of 13 exons, and is located on chromosome 4p16.3 (30Schuler G.D. Boguski M.S. Stewart E.A. Stein L.D. Gyapay G. Rice K. White R.E. Rodriguez-Tom P. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Bentolila S. Birren B.B. Butler A. Castle A.B. Chiannilkulchai N. et al.Science. 1996; 274: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The hGPI7 protein shows 26 and 28% amino acid identity to S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Gpi7p, respectively. The hGPI7 protein has conserved type I phosphodiesterase/nucleotide pyrophosphatase regions in its N-terminal hydrophilic domains (Fig. 2A). The first 27 amino acids of hGPI7 appear to constitute a signal sequence for translocation across the ER membrane. hGPI7 has a hydrophilic domain of ∼400 amino acids in the N terminus followed by multiple putative transmembrane domains in the C-terminal region (Fig. 2B). hGPI7 shows homology to two other EtNP transferases, PIG-O and PIG-N, with 26 and 20% identity, respectively (15Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that hGPI7 is one of the EtNP transferases in the GPI biosynthetic pathway. hGPI7 RNAi Causes HeLa Cells to Accumulate GPI Biosynthetic Intermediates—We expected that hGPI7 would be involved in transferring EtNP to Man2. To test this possibility, we created knockdown (KD) HeLa cells in which hGPI7 expression was repressed by RNAi and analyzed their GPI. If our expectation was correct, hGPI7 KD cells would be deficient in generating H8 from H7. As shown in Fig. 1, H7 and H8 were characterized as GPIs containing EtNPs on Man1 and Man3 or on all three mannoses, respectively (31Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ueda E. Sevlever D. Prince G.M. Rosenberry T.L. Hirose S. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9998-10002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We stably transfected HeLa cells with pH1-sihGPI7 to generate hGPI7 KD cells and with pH1-siEGFP to generate control cells. The level of hGPI7 mRNA in hGPI7 KD cells was 27% that in control cells, indicating that the expression of hGPI7 was knocked down (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the control cells showed a similar glycolipid pattern to that of HeLa cells (lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, hGPI7 KD cells had a different pattern, showing more than 5-fold accumulation of H7 and a decrease in H8 (Fig. 3B, lane 2 and line in the histogram). Because H7 and probably also H8 are used for GPI-anchoring to proteins (5Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Anand R. Williams A.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Taguchi R. Hamakawa N. Harada Nishida M. Fukui T. Nojima K. Ikezawa H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Vainauskas S. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6540-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and as this may have an effect on the GPI profile, we knocked down hGPI7 expression in class K mutant cells, in which GPI is not transferred to proteins because of defective GPI transamidase (19Chen R. Udenfriend S. Prince G.M. Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Knez J. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2280-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar to the case with HeLa hGPI7 KD cells, hGPI7 KD caused strong accumulation of H7 in the class K mutant cells (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that hGPI7 is indeed involved in transferring EtNP to Man2, thereby converting H7 to H8. hGPI7 Is Localized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum—The enzymes involved in GPI biosynthesis are localized in the ER (1Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the subcellular localization of hGPI7. CHO cells expressing GST-tagged hGPI7 (hGPI7-GST) were homogenized and separated into five fractions by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. hGPI7-GST was mostly present in fractions 3–5, which contained the ER, but not in other fractions containing the plasma membrane and Golgi (Fig. 4). Although it has been reported that S. cerevisiae Gpi7p is mainly localized in the plasma membrane (9Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the current results indicate that hGPI7 is localized in the ER rather than the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. PIG-F Binds to and Stabilizes hGPI7 and PIG-O Independently—As shown in Fig. 3B, the catalytic activity of PIG-O was apparently enhanced as evidenced by the decrease in H6 and concomitant increase in H7 in hGPI7 KD cells. We therefore investigated the possibility that hGPI7 is somehow involved in regulating the PIG-O catalytic activity. hGPI7 is highly homologous to PIG-O and PIG-N. We previously reported that PIG-F binds to and stabilizes PIG-O, but not PIG-N (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From these observations, we examined the association between PIG-F and hGPI7. We transfected CHO cells with FLAG-tagged PIG-F and GST-tagged mPig-n, mPig-o, or hGPI7. From their digitonin extracts, we affinity-precipitated GST-tagged proteins and analyzed the co-precipitated FLAG-PIG-F by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). FLAG-tagged PIG-F was co-precipitated with GST-tagged hGPI7 and mPig-o but not with mPig-n. These results indicate that PIG-F associates not only with PIG-O but also with hGPI7. We next examined whether PIG-F, PIG-O, and hGPI7 form a triple complex. We transfected CHO cells with hGPI7-GST and FLAG-tagged mPig-o, PIG-F, and msALDH and immunoprecipitated hGPI7-GST from digitonin extracts. As shown in Fig. 5B, FLAG-mPig-o was not precipitated with hGPI7-GST, whereas nearly one-half of the expressed FLAG-PIG-F was precipitated with hGPI7-GST. These results suggest that hGPI7 binds to PIG-F but not to PIG-O and that therefore complexes of PIG-F/PIG-O and PIG-F/hGPI7 exist independently. To test whether PIG-F, similar to PIG-O, stabilizes hGPI7 (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we prepared PIG-F mutant CHO30.5 cells that expressed hGPI7-GST, hPIG-L-GST (29Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Kinoshita T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and GST-msALDH and compared the expression levels of the GST-tagged proteins in the presence or absence of PIG-F expression (Fig. 5C). The expression level of hGPI7-GST in the absence of PIG-F was one-half that in the presence of PIG-F, whereas the expression levels of hPIG-L-GST and GST-msALDH remained unchanged. These results indicate that hGPI7, like PIG-O, is bound and stabilized by PIG-F. hGPI7 Competes with PIG-O for Binding to PIG-F—Next, we considered the possibility that PIG-O and hGPI7 compete for binding to PIG-F. We transfected CHO cells with FLAG-PIG-F, HA-mPig-o, and HA-msALDH plasmids, and increasing amounts of hGPI7 plasmid. FLAG-PIG-F was immunoprecipitated, and the co-precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. The levels of HA-mPig-o co-precipitated with FLAG-PIG-F decreased with increasing amounts of the hGPI7 plasmid (Fig. 6A, top panel, left), whereas the expression levels of FLAG-PIG-F and HA-msALDH remained unaffected (bottom panel and top panel, right). Similar to the level of co-precipitated HA-mPig-o, the total expression levels of HA-mPig-o decreased with increasing amount of hGPI7 (top panel, right), suggesting that HA-mPig-o detached from PIG-F was unstable and degraded rapidly. We obtained similar results by changing the amount of mPig-o plasmids (data not shown). These results demonstrate that hGPI7 competes with PIG-O for binding to PIG-F and imply that the expression levels of hGPI7 are capable of limiting the expression levels of PIG-O. To determine the effect of the competition between hGPI7 and PIG-O on GPI biosynthesis, we analyzed the effect of hGPI7 overexpression in HeLa cells. The hGPI7-overexpressing cells accumulated more H6 than the mock transfectants (Fig. 6, B and C), implying inefficient conversion of H6 to H7. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that overexpression of hGPI7 decreases the biosynthetic activity of PIG-O by decreasing the available PIG-F, thereby destabilizing PIG-O. In the late phase of GPI biosynthesis in mammalian cells, GPI species H7 bearing EtNP linked to Man3 is generated from H6 by the action of an enzyme complex consisting of PIG-O and PIG-F (Fig. 1). H7 can be converted to H8 by further addition of a side chain, most likely EtNP, to Man2 (32Ueda E. Sevlever D. Prince G.M. Rosenberry T.L. Hirose S. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9998-10002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, Gpi7p is involved in the EtNP side-chain modification of Man2 (9Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The major finding in the present study is that an enzyme complex consisting of hGPI7 and PIG-F is involved in the conversion of H7 to H8. H7 and the major protein-linked GPI-anchors have the same glycan structure (5Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Anand R. Williams A.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Taguchi R. Hamakawa N. Harada Nishida M. Fukui T. Nojima K. Ikezawa H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that H7 is the major substrate of GPI transamidase, which transfers GPI to proteins. A glycan structure corresponding to that of H8 was found in a small fraction of GPI-anchored proteins (33Taguchi R. Hamakawa N. Harada Nishida M. Fukui T. Nojima K. Ikezawa H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Non-protein-linked free H8 is expressed on the cell surface (35Baumann N.A. Vidugiriene J. Machamer C.E. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7378-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The biological roles of the side chain on Man2 and free H8 remain to be determined. Our present finding clarified the enzyme that generates H8. First, we cloned hGPI7 and knocked it down by means of RNAi. When the hGPI7 mRNA level was reduced to 27% in HeLa cells by RNAi, H7 increased 5-fold, whereas H8 decreased (Fig. 3). Increased accumulation of H7 was also seen when hGPI7 knockdown was performed in class K K562 cells. Based on these results, we conclude that hGPI7 is involved in H7-to-H8 conversion. Yeast Gpi7p, Gpi13p, and Mcd4p and their respective homologs hGPI7, PIG-O, and PIG-N form a family of EtNP-transferases. hGPI7 is closer to PIG-O (26% amino acid identity) than to PIG-N (20% identity), whereas PIG-O is closer to hGPI7 than to PIG-N (20% identity) (15Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similar relationships are true among the yeast members, because the amino acid identities between Gpi7p and Gpi13p, Gpi7p and Mcd4p, and Gpi13p and Mcd4p are 24, 21, and 21%, respectively (13Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These structural relationships are consistent with their functional characteristics, namely their substrate specificities; hGPI7/Gpi7p and PIG-O/Gpi13p are involved in EtNP additions to the 6-position in mannose, whereas PIG-N/Mcd4p transfers EtNP to the 2-position (5Homans S.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We previously reported that PIG-O is associated with PIG-F (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PIG-F is also involved in transferring EtNP to Man3 because PIG-F-defective mutant cells do not generate H7 and accumulate H6 (17Inoue N. Kinoshita T. Orii T. Takeda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6882-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the immediate precursor of H7 (Fig. 1). PIG-F is a highly hydrophobic ER membrane protein of 20 kDa (17Inoue N. Kinoshita T. Orii T. Takeda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6882-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with no significant homology to any other proteins with known functions. In the absence of PIG-F, PIG-O is unstable and its expression level is only 20–25% of that in the presence of PIG-F (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The PIG-F expression level is not dependent upon PIG-O. Therefore, PIG-F stabilizes PIG-O. PIG-F, however, does not bind to PIG-N (16Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that PIG-F binds to hGPI7 (Fig. 5, A and B). The observation that PIG-F binds to hGPI7 and PIG-O but not to PIG-N parallels the higher sequence identity of hGPI7 to PIG-O compared with PIG-N. We also found that PIG-F stabilizes hGPI7 (Fig. 5C) similarly to its stabilization of PIG-O. The expression level of hGPI7 in the absence of PIG-F was one-half that in the presence of PIG-F. The complexes of PIG-O and PIG-F and hGPI7 and PIG-F are formed separately. Moreover, PIG-O and hGPI7 compete for binding with PIG-F (Fig. 6A). Therefore, when the amount of PIG-F is limited, the level of PIG-O is influenced by hGPI7. A higher level of hGPI7 results in a lower level of PIG-O and hence in lower generation of H7. It is not known whether Gpi7p and/or Gpi13p are associated with Gpi11p, an S. cerevisiae homolog of PIG-F (13Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The profile of accumulated GPI mannolipids in Gpi11p-defective cells is similar to that in Gpi7p-defective cells, but not to that in Gpi13p-defective cells. It is therefore possible that Gpi7p, but not Gpi13p, is dependent upon Gpi11p in S. cerevisiae. The biological significance of GPI7 in yeast has been well studied. Most of the genes involved in GPI biosynthesis are essential for growth of S. cerevisiae. In contrast, GPI7 is not essential for growth, and deletion of gpi7 primarily causes phenotypes in the cell wall. The gpi7-null mutant is hypersensitive to Calcofluor White (36Benghezal M. Lipke P.N. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), has an increased chitin content, and has a decreased protein content (37Richard M. De Groot P. Courtin O. Poulain D. Klis F. Gaillardin C. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with these abnormalities, among the two forms of yeast GPI-anchored proteins, the expressions of cell wall proteins with the ceramide-type GPI are severely affected, whereas the expressions of plasma membrane proteins with the diacylglycerol-type GPI, such as Gas1p, are not affected (37Richard M. De Groot P. Courtin O. Poulain D. Klis F. Gaillardin C. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The basis for this selective effect on proteins with the ceramide-type GPI is most likely because of a defect in diacylglycerol-to-ceramide remodeling of GPI in the gpi7-null mutant (9Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that Gpi7p is essential for separation of the daughter cells after cytokinesis. The GPI-anchored protein Egt2p, which is normally concentrated in the septum, was mislocalized in the gpi7 mutant. The EtNP side chain on Man2 is therefore important for correct targeting of GPI-anchored proteins in the daughter cells (38Fujita M. Yoko-o T. Okamoto M. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51869-51879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whether defective diacylglycerol-to-ceramide remodeling is related to defective targeting to the septum remains to be determined. In contrast to these advancements in studies on yeast GPI7, the biological significance of mammalian GPI7 has not yet been clarified. Because mammalian cells do not have a cell wall, mammalian GPI7 cannot have the same role as yeast Gpi7p but may be involved in processes such as remodeling of GPI or targeted transport of GPI-anchored proteins.

MoeA was also shown to facilitate the addition of molybdenum in an assay using crude extracts from E. coli moeA– cells. The experiments detailed in this report utilized an in vitro assay for MoeA-mediated molybdenum ligation to de novo synthesized molybdopterin using only purified components and monitoring the reconstitution of human aposulfite oxidase. In this assay, maximum activation was achieved by delaying the addition of aposulfite oxidase to allow for adequate molybdenum coordination to occur. Tungsten, which substitutes for molybdenum in hyperthermophilic organisms, could also be ligated to molybdopterin using this system, though not as efficiently as molybdenum. Addition of thiol compounds to the assay inhibited activity. Addition of MogA also inhibited the reaction. However, in the presence of ATP and magnesium, addition of MogA to the assay increased the level of aposulfite oxidase reconstitution beyond that observed with MoeA alone. This effect was not observed in the absence of MoeA. The results presented here demonstrate that MoeA is responsible for mediating molybdenum ligation to molybdopterin, whereas MogA stimulates this activity in an ATP-dependent manner.

In all molybdenum-containing enzymes, with the exception of nitrogenase, the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) 1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MPT, molybdopterin; SO, sulfite oxidase; apoSO, His-tagged MPT-free sulfite oxidase; MoaD-SH, thiocarboxylated MoaD; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma emisssion mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MPT, molybdopterin; SO, sulfite oxidase; apoSO, His-tagged MPT-free sulfite oxidase; MoaD-SH, thiocarboxylated MoaD; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma emisssion mass spectrometry. consists of a mononuclear Mo atom coordinated to the cis-dithiolene moiety of molybdopterin (MPT). In Escherichia coli, biosynthesis of Moco begins with the conversion of GTP to a pterin intermediate termed precursor Z, catalyzed by the MoaA and MoaC proteins (1Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J.

MPT is synthesized from precursor Z by the MoaD and MoaE proteins, which together compose the MPT synthase complex (5Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J.

Ligation of the Mo atom to MPT requires the MoeA and MogA proteins along with the ModABC molybdate transporter system (9Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

In E. coli, the cofactor is further modified by the covalent addition of GMP to the MPT phosphate, a reaction catalyzed by the MobA protein (11Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous results from our laboratory verified that E. coli MoeA and MogA are both required for in vivo Mo ligation to the MPT dithiolene. Analysis of crude extracts produced from E. coli moeA– and mogA– cells showed the presence of MPT but the absence of MPT-guanine dinucleotide, the biosynthesis of which was found to require prior attachment of Mo to MPT. Recombinantly expressed human sulfite oxidase (SO) purified from both strains contained MPT but was devoid of Mo. In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of MoeA to activate the recombinant Mo-free, MPT-containing human SO in moeA– crude extract. MogA was incapable of supporting the same type of activity in mogA– crude extract. Thus, MoeA appeared to be the protein directly responsible for Mo ligation, whereas MogA had an alternative, unknown function in metal ligation (9Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the moeA– crude extract assay demonstrated that MoeA can facilitate Mo incorporation into MPT-containing SO, it did not define the mechanism of Mo ligation to de novo formed MPT. Therefore, the development of an assay for Mo ligation that utilized only purified components was undertaken. Our laboratory has previously developed fully defined systems for assaying both MPT and MPT-guanine dinucleotide biosynthesis. The in vitro synthesis of MPT-guanine dinucleotide using only MobA, Mg2+, GTP, and Moco from denatured SO is quantitated by monitoring the activation of Rhodobacter sphaeroides apo-DMSO reductase (12Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas de novo synthesized MPT is quantitated by the reconstitution of aposulfite oxidase (apoSO) or by conversion to the stable, fluorescent derivative Form A (6Leimku ̈hler S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in this report delineate the development and optimization of a fully defined in vitro assay for MoeA-mediated Mo ligation to de novo synthesized MPT. The assay contains only purified components (activated MPT synthase, precursor Z, molybdate, MoeA, and apoSO) and monitors the activation of MPT-free human apoSO. Efficient apoSO activation required preincubation of the nascent MPT with MoeA and molybdate prior to apoSO addition, and metal ligation was not as efficient if MoeA were not present during this first step. As tungsten is just below Mo on the periodic table and many Moco-containing enzymes utilize tungsten in place of Mo (14Johnson M. Rees D. Adams M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2817-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Hille R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), experiments were performed to determine whether tungsten could be ligated to MPT in this system. Contrary to previous reports (16Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sandu C. Brandsch R. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the presence of thiol compounds was not necessary for activation and actually inhibited the assay. Initial studies with MogA in the defined assay found that its presence inhibited apoSO reconstitution. However, because recent reports indicated the possible requirement for ATP in MogA function (18Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar), further studies in the presence of ATP were performed. Here we have shown that, in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, MogA augments the level of apoSO reconstitution obtained with MoeA alone. MoeA was required for this stimulatory effect as apoSO reconstitution was not observed in its absence. Protein Expression and Purification—E. coli MoeA (20Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), MoaE, and active (thiocarboxylated) MoaD (MoaD-SH) (22Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified from BL21(DE3) cells as described previously. His-tagged, MPT-free human apoSO was expressed and purified from E. coli moaA– cells in the absence of supplemental Na2MoO4 as described previously (9Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Following purification, MoaE, MoaD-SH, and apoSO were exchanged into 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, using a PD-10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and stored in aliquots at –80 °C until needed. Purified Component Assay—Precursor Z was purified as described previously (23Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays using purified components were performed aerobically in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at room temperature, and the concentrations below represent those in the final reaction volume after apoSO addition. Unless otherwise indicated, precursor Z (2 μm) was added to a mixture of MPT synthase (2 μm MoaE and 6 μm MoaD-SH), MoeA (20 μm), and Na2MoO4 (50 μm). After a specified time (t1) of generally 15 min, apoSO (2 μm) was added. Reactions were incubated for a further specified time (t2) of generally 20 min and then assayed for SO activity by quantitating the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm as described previously (24Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of MPT synthesis during the prereaction step, MPT was converted to the fluorescent Form A (dephospho) derivative at various t1. For this conversion, 50 μl of 1% I2/2% KI and 38 μl of 10% HCl were added to 400 μl of the prereaction mixture, and the samples were boiled for 20 min (25Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6856-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The samples were brought to pH ∼8.3 by the addition of 17 μl of 10% NaOH and incubated overnight in the presence of 15 mm MgCl2 and 1 μl (1 unit) of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science). Samples were passed through a 0.45-μm Spin X microcentrifuge filter (Corning) before being injected onto a C-18 HPLC column. Dephospho-Form A was quantitated using an Agilent 1100 Series fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission of 448 nm. When assay components included MogA, ATP-Mg2+, tungstate, Na2S, glutathione, or cysteine, these were added prior to precursor Z unless indicated. To determine the extent of MPT synthesis in the presence of cysteine, 400-μl reactions containing various concentrations of cysteine and final concentrations of 2 μm MoaE, 4 μm MoaD-SH, and 2 μm precursor Z in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, were incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of 200 μl of 1% I2/2% KI and 38 μl of 10% HCl. MPT conversion to Form A was accomplished as described above. To determine the extent of W incorporation, SO was purified from assays containing 20 μm MoeA and 5 mm tungstate (without molybdate). At t2 = 20, these reactions were applied to 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) columns equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm imidazole. Columns were washed with 2 ml of equilibration buffer. Following elution with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm imidazole, samples were exchanged into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using a PD-10 gel filtration column and concentrated to less than 500 μl with a Centricon 30 filtration device (Amicon). Proteins were analyzed for W content using inductively coupled plasma emission mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) performed by Dr. Mark Rudnicki at the Nicholas School of Environment and Earth Sciences, Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Duke University. SO purified from similar reactions devoid of precursor Z was used for background subtraction. Moco Transfer to ApoSO—The transfer of Moco to apoSO was monitored using a modification of the method described by Leimkühler et al. (6Leimku ̈hler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Treatment of MPT or Moco with iodoacetamide produces a non-fluorescent derivative termed carboxamidomethyl MPT (camMPT). However, under non-denaturing conditions, SO-bound Moco is inaccessible to iodoacetamide (6Leimku ̈hler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and can be quantitated by conversion to Form A following iodoacetamide treatment of the sample. For this set of experiments, activation assays with a final volume of 100 μl were used. After t2, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 250 mm in 200 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The volume was increased to 800 μl by the addition of 600 μl of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the remaining underivatized Moco and MPT were converted to dephospho-Form A as described above. In Vitro Mo Ligation Using Purified Components—We have previously demonstrated that purified E. coli MoeA is able to reconstitute SO activity in a moeA– cell lysate in the presence of Na2MoO4 (9Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To better examine the process of Mo ligation, a fully defined assay for this step of Moco biosynthesis was developed utilizing purified E. coli proteins and precursor Z to make Moco, the formation of which was monitored by the activation of MPT-free recombinant human SO. In this assay, MPT was synthesized de novo from precursor Z by E. coli MoaE and MoaD-SH (the active, thiocarboxylated form of MoaD), which together constitute active MPT synthase (6Leimku ̈hler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this two-stage assay, the first step was initiated by the addition of precursor Z to reaction mixtures containing MoaE, MoaD-SH, MoeA, and MoO42–. After a specified incubation time (designated t1), apoSO was added to begin the second step, with the incubation time between this addition and the determination of SO activity being designated as t2. As seen in Fig. 1A, low levels of nonspecific apoSO activation were observed in this defined assay system in the absence of MoeA. However, a much greater level of activation was achieved in the presence of 20 μm MoeA with ∼10-fold higher activity at 50 μm MoO42– and 5-fold higher activity at 500 μm MoO42–. SO activity continued to increase with increasing molybdate concentrations above 500 μm both in the presence and absence of MoeA (data not shown). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, when varying amounts of MoeA were added to the assay in the presence of 50 μm molybdate, maximal activation was typically achieved at a concentration of ∼20 μm. Reconstitution of SO activity in the defined assay was maximized using final concentrations of 2 μm precursor Z, 2 μm MoaE, 6 μm MoaD-SH, and 2 μm apoSO (Fig. 2A). Theoretically, because the conversion of one molecule of precursor Z to MPT requires two molecules of MoaD-SH to donate one sulfur each to form the MPT dithiolene, 2 μm precursor Z would only require 4 μm 100% active MoaD-SH for complete conversion to MPT. However, an excess of MoaD-SH was used to assure complete MPT production. In the previously published examination of MoeA-mediated Mo ligation in moeA– crude extracts, an optimal reaction temperature of 37 °C was identified (9Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, Fig. 2B shows that despite an initial burst at 37 °C, Mo ligation in this fully defined assay system is more efficient at room temperature than at 37 °C when t1 was greater than 5 min. Efficiency of in Vitro Mo Ligation—Under standard conditions, when t2 = 20 min, maximum SO reconstitution was achieved at a t1 of ∼15 min as seen in Fig. 3A. To determine whether this lag time represented the time required for MPT synthesis, the time frame for MPT production in the preincubation reactions was examined by conversion of MPT to the stable, fluorescent derivative Form A at various t1 times. As seen in Fig. 3A, MPT synthesis was complete in ∼2 min. Therefore, the 15-min t1 prereaction time must represent another aspect of Moco production, such as ligation of the Mo atom to MPT. To explore whether t1 does indeed represent the time required for MoeA-mediated Mo ligation to the newly formed MPT, apoSO activation was quantitated at various concentrations of molybdate with MoeA either present during the prereaction or added with apoSO. Fig. 3B shows that activation was less efficient if MoeA were absent during the prereaction, even when t2 = 40 min. Further, the incubation time for the prereaction (t1) greatly affected the maximum level of SO activity achievable. As seen in Fig. 3C, the extent of SO activation observed with t1 = 0 in the presence of MoeA was only slightly higher than that observed with t1 = 15 min in the absence of MoeA. In contrast, the rate (as opposed to the maximum level) of apoSO reconstitution was only mildly affected by t1. When the half time for t2 (or the time required to reach 50% of maximal activity following apoSO addition) was calculated for the data in Fig. 3C, a decrease of only 17.6–12.5 min was observed as t1 increased from 0 to 15 min. These data indicate that for maximal reconstitution of apoSO, incubation of MoeA with MPT and MoO42– is required for sufficient MoeA-mediated Mo ligation to occur prior to apoSO addition. As the prereaction step of the assay appeared to be required for adequate Mo ligation, it was thought that the incubation period following apoSO addition was primarily the time required for insertion of Moco after apoSO was added to the assay. To explore this possibility, experiments were designed to monitor the fate of Moco following apoSO addition. A previous report from this laboratory demonstrated that SO-bound MPT was protected from iodoacetamide inactivation (6Leimku ̈hler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the experiments described here, iodoacetamide was added at various times subsequent to apoSO addition to convert any accessible MPT/Moco to the nonfluorescent derivative carboxamidomethyl MPT. SO-bound MPT/Moco in the sample was then assayed by conversion to Form A. As seen in Fig. 4, with a t½ of ∼3 min, the rate for pterin insertion appears to be much faster than the observed rate for apoSO reconstitution (t½ = 12.5 min). These data indicate that the observed rate for apoSO activation reflects more than just the rate for Moco insertion into apoSO. Activation in the Presence of Tungsten and Sulfur Compounds—Organisms that thrive in extreme environments typically utilize W in place of Mo (27Pilato R. Stiefel E. Reedijk J. Bouwman E. Bioinorganic Catalysis. 2nd Ed. Dekker, New York1999: 81-152Crossref Google Scholar), and there are multiple reports detailing the purification and analysis of W-substituted molybdoenzymes, including SO (14Johnson M. Rees D. Adams M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2817-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 28Hagedoorn P.L. Hagen W.R. Stewart L.J. Docrat A. Bailey S. Garner C.D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Jones H.P. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4988-4993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Schmitz R.A. Albracht S.P. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Buc J. Santini C.L. Giordani R. Czjzek M. Wu L.F. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to examine whether W would be ligated to MPT under the conditions described here. The results from these experiments, shown in Fig. 5A, indicate that Mo ligation was strongly inhibited when tungstate was present during the prereaction. This is compared with only mild inhibition when tungstate was added with the apoSO and with a lack of significant inhibition when tungstate was added at t2 = 20 min (followed by a further 20-min incubation prior to determination of SO activity). In the presence of 50 μm molybdate, inhibition of 50% of activation required ∼75 times more tungstate (3.8 mm), demonstrating a higher specificity for molybdate. ICP-MS analysis of SO purified from assays containing 5 mm tungstate (in the absence of molybdate) showed that W was incorporated into ∼23% of the total SO. These data provide further evidence that the majority of Mo ligation occurs during the prereaction, as inhibition was much more severe if tungstate were present during this step. Once ligated to MPT, significant replacement of Mo with W did not appear to occur. The observations by Hasona et al. (16Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the moeA– phenotype could be suppressed in the presence of sulfide led to the hypothesis that MoeA might catalyze the formation of a thiomolybdate compound. A later report indicated that MoeA-mediated Mo ligation might require the presence of either cysteine or glutathione (17Sandu C. Brandsch R. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Based upon these observations, experiments to analyze the effects of thiol reagents on the defined assay were performed. Fig. 5B shows the effects of various concentrations of Na2S, cysteine, or glutathione on apoSO activation. All three thiol reagents were found to inhibit apoSO activation, though at different concentrations. In the presence of 20 μm MoeA and 50 μm molybdate, 50% inhibition of activation was achieved at ∼1.3 mm Na2S (650-fold excess versus [precursor Z], 26-fold versus [MoO42–]) or 0.4 mm glutathione (200-fold excess versus [precursor Z], 8-fold versus [MoO42–]). Cysteine was found to be inhibitory at much lower concentrations, beginning at ∼1 μm. Because it inhibited at such low concentrations compared with sulfide and glutathione, further experiments were performed with cysteine. Interestingly, the presence of cysteine also inhibited nonspecific apoSO reconstitution (Fig. 5B), indicating that the observed inhibition is not a direct inhibition of MoeA. Additional experiments showed that MPT synthesis, assayed by conversion to dephospho-Form A, was unaffected by the presence of cysteine (data not shown). These data indicate that the presence of these sulfur compounds nonspecifically inhibits either Mo ligation to MPT or Moco insertion into apoSO. The results from these experiments indicate that thiomolybdate formation is not part of MoeA function. Effects of MogA on in Vitro Mo Ligation—Previous studies from our laboratory found that although MogA was required for in vivo Mo ligation in E. coli, it was not required for similar activity in vitro. Thus, the role of this protein in Moco formation remained unclear (9Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To address this, the effect of MogA on the purified component assay was examined. Our initial studies, shown in Fig. 6A, found that the addition of MogA had no enhancing effect and, in fact, strongly inhibited activation of apoSO. In the presence of 20 μm MoeA and 50 μm molybdate, apoSO activation was reduced 50% at ∼1.2 μm MogA, a concentration comparable to half of the theoretical maximum concentration of MPT produced in the reactions (2 μm from 2 μm precursor Z). MogA demonstrated similar inhibition of the nonspecific (MoeA-independent) activation. It is likely that these results reflect an ability of MogA to tightly bind and sequester the cofactor as described previously for its eukaryotic homologues (33Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 34Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, experiments with iodoacetamide treatment showed a significant drop in the amount of cofactor incorporated into apoSO with increasing concentrations of MogA (Fig. 6A). Recent reports have suggested that ATP may be involved in the as yet undetermined in vivo activity of MogA (18Kuper J. Llamas A. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Nature. 2004; 430: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, the effect of the presence of ATP on the MogA inhibition of apoSO reconstitution in the defined assay was examined. Although the presence of ATP-Mg2+ alone had no significant effect on activity in the absence of MogA, the addition of MogA along with 1 mm ATP and 1 mm Mg2+ greatly increased the level of SO activity beyond that observed with the standard assay (Fig. 6B). This effect reached its maximum at 2 μm MogA, where the level of apoSO activation was nearly twice that obtained in the absence of MogA. The increase in apoSO reconstitution was only observed in the presence of MoeA because ATP-Mg2+ had no effect on MogA inhibition of nonspecific apoSO reconstitution (Fig. 6B). The stimulatory effect of MogA and ATP on apoSO reconstitution was also dependent upon the presence of Mg2+ as seen in Fig. 6C. Further experiments showed that the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog γ-S-ATP could not substitute for ATP (data not shown), indicating that MogA function involves ATP hydrolysis. Despite the absolute increase in SO activity generated by the addition of MogA with ATP and Mg2+, their presence had no discernable effect upon the rate of increase in apoSO activation observed with increasing concentrations of MoeA (Fig. 6D). Our laboratory previously demonstrated that de novo synthesized MPT could be converted to active Moco in the presence of high concentrations of molybdate. Formation of Moco was much less efficient, however, at lower Mo concentrations likely to be present under physiological conditions (6Leimku ̈hler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Though there are no available estimates of intracellular Mo concentrations, the association of molybdate with the ModE repressor protein has a reported Kd of 0.8 μm, indicating that under normal conditions intracellular Mo concentrations are likely to be in the low μm range (35Anderson L.A.

The results presented in this report describe the development of a fully defined in vitro assay for monitoring the MoeA-mediated ligation of Mo to de novo synthesized MPT and demonstrate that MoeA enhances the rate and extent of Moco formation at low molybdate levels. Tungsten ligation to MPT appeared to be much less efficient than ligation of Mo. As tungsten-dependent organisms are anaerobic and usually hyperthermophilic (15Hille R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that W is utilized in nature to catalyze reactions under extreme conditions (14Johnson M. Rees D. Adams M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2817-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It is possible that anaerobic, and potentially higher temperature, conditions favor W rather than Mo attachment to MPT. It would be interesting to explore whether W would be incorporated more efficiently than Mo in in vitro metal ligation assays using the Moco biosynthesis homologues from some of the extremophiles that utilize W. Additionally, in all tungstoenzymes studied to date, W is bound by either a bis-MPT or bis(MPT-dinucleotide) form of the cofactor where the metal is coordinated by the dithiolenes of two MPT molecules (14Johnson M. Rees D. Adams M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2817-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Hille R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is entirely possible that the single MPT-W form of Moco assayed here may not be as stable as MPT-Mo. Based upon the results presented here, it seems highly unlikely that in vivo Mo ligation involves a thiomolybdate species as has been previously proposed (16Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thiol reagents examined here were all either inhibitory or relatively ineffectual at concentrations up to 10-fold the concentration of molybdate (50 μm) in the assays, and none was required for activity. Additionally, thiomolybdate formation would likely require the utilization of a cysteine desulfurase (36Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and there is no evidence indicating the involvement of such a protein in Mo ligation or Moco insertion. The observed inhibition implies that thiols compete with the MPT dithiolene for binding molybdate. It is unclear why cysteine inhibits at such low concentrations compared with sulfide and glutathione. Because cysteine is the side chain ligand to Mo in the SO family of Moco enzymes (15Hille R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), supplemental cysteine may interfere with this ligation. With both cysteine and glutathione, lower concentrations inhibited SO reconstitution, whereas SO activity began to increase at higher concentrations (>1 mm) (data not shown). This observation helps explain why Sandu et al. (17Sandu C. Brandsch R. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) saw a stimulatory effect in assays containing 5 mm cysteine or glutathione as this is well past the concentration where the above effect was observed. Higher concentrations of cysteine or glutathione may stabilize Moco or nonspecifically (as MoeA was not required for this effect) aid in Moco formation. Though previous work was unsuccessful in elucidating a function for MogA, it was determined that its function is required prior to that of MoeA in vivo (9Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented here, the fact that the ATP-dependent stimulatory effect of MogA was only observed when MoeA was present, coupled with the ability of MogA to tightly bind the cofactor, indicates that the function of MogA is likely to prepare the nascent MPT (in an ATP-dependent manner) for MoeA-mediated Mo ligation. This would further increase the yield of active Moco at the low molybdate concentrations one would expect in vivo. The high concentration of ATP necessary to increase apoSO activation beyond the level obtained in the absence of MogA suggests a high Km of MogA for ATP and/or a slow rate for the MogA reaction. The exact mechanism of the MogA reaction is still uncertain. Experiments by Llamas et al. (19Llamas A. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar) with the Cnx1 G domain from Arabidopsis thaliana (a homologue of E. coli MogA) indicated that this protein forms an MPT-AMP adduct. Thus, a possible mechanism for in vivo Mo ligation could start with transfer of the nascent MPT from MPT synthase to the MogA protein. MogA would then “activate” the MPT, possibly by forming an MPT-AMP adduct, and MoeA would then facilitate Mo ligation to the activated MPT. There arises the question of whether MoeA performs this task by first binding the activated MPT or by simply ligating the metal to MPT that is still bound to MogA. MoeA mediation of Mo ligation in the absence of MogA, the requirement for a molar excess of MoeA in this reaction, and the demonstration that MoeA can bind MPT (17Sandu C. Brandsch R. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) all lend support to the idea that MoeA first binds MPT before ligating the metal. As MogA, in the absence of ATP, will tightly bind the cofactor and inhibit apoSO reconstitution, it may be that the activated form of MPT has a lower affinity for MogA and is more readily transferred to MoeA. Although Mo ligation to MPT can occur in the absence of either MoeA or MogA, this nonspecific reaction requires molybdate concentrations so high as to be physiologically irrelevant. Therefore, the most probable function of the MoeA and MogA proteins is to collectively facilitate efficient metal ligation to the newly formed MPT at the low molybdate concentrations likely encountered in the cell. The results presented here demonstrate that the MoeA protein facilitates the ligation of the Mo atom to MPT in the absence of ATP or MogA and that the presence of MogA enhances this reaction in an ATP-dependent manner. Future experiments are directed at utilizing this assay system for the functional analysis of mutations in MoeA in order to gain a better understanding of its role in mediating metal ligation to MPT.

However, with the exception of TNFα-induced apoptosis, a role for Hsp72 in modulating the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis has not been clearly established. In this study, it was demonstrated that Hsp72 could inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis of type II CCRF-CEM cells, but not type I SW480 or CH1 cells. Similar results were obtained when Fas ligand or an agonistic Fas antibody initiated the Fas apoptosis pathway. In CCRF-CEM cells, Hsp72 inhibited mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release but did not alter surface Fas expression or processing of caspase-8 and Bid, indicating that Hsp72 acts upstream of the mitochondria to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis. Thus, the ability of Hsp72 to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis is limited to type II cells where involvement of the intrinsic pathway is required for efficient effector caspase activation.

Apoptosis is a tightly regulated, genetically controlled event crucial to normal development and tissue homeostasis (1Krammer P.H. Adv.

Aberrations in the control of apoptosis can lead to a number of physiological disorders including cancer, where disruption of apoptosis confers a survival advantage to the tumorigenic cells. Deregulation of apoptosis is now viewed as a crucial step in tumorigenesis (3Green D.R. Evan G.I.

Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22065) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be divided into two distinct but interconnecting pathways: the extrinsic pathway that is activated upon ligation of death receptors of the TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethylketone; Ab, antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethylketone; Ab, antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. receptor superfamily and the intrinsic pathway that is initiated by cellular stresses that activate pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family to target the mitochondria. Central to both pathways are the caspases, which cleave a specific set of target substrates leading to the classic hallmarks of apoptosis (5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). Activation of caspases in the extrinsic pathway is mediated by formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) at the cytoplasmic death domains of ligated death receptor oligomers (6Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Formation of the DISC occurs via recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD and caspase-8 zymogens, upon which caspase-8 is activated to cleave downstream effector caspases (8Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). In the intrinsic pathway, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins cause permeabilization of the mitochondria resulting in release of apoptogenic factors including cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (9Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cytosolic cytochrome c triggers the formation of a multimeric complex called the apoptosome, which includes the cytosolic proteins Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 is activated on the apoptosome in a dATP-dependent manner and subsequently activates downstream effector caspases. Cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways exists through the cleavage of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bid, by caspase-8 (12Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3067) Google Scholar). The truncated form of Bid (tBid) activates the pro-apoptotic molecules Bax and Bak, which permeabilize the mitochondria and initiate the intrinsic pathway (14Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 15Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

In some cells (type II) but not others (type I) recruitment of the intrinsic pathway is required for efficient apoptosis (17Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar), although this concept is controversial (18Huang D.C. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K.

Apoptotic pathways are regulated by inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins that directly target the caspases (21Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). In addition, the extrinsic pathway can be regulated by the relative expression of death and decoy receptors (26Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Another class of apoptosis regulators, although poorly acknowledged, are the heat shock proteins (Hsps). While acting as molecular chaperones in unstressed cells, Hsps promote cell survival during periods of both acute and chronic stress (27Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of cells to develop thermotolerance, a state of transient resistance to severe stress, after a mild heat shock, is thought to be largely the responsibility of Hsp72 (28Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Johnson R.J. Br. J. Radiol. 1982; 55: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of Hsp72 alone has been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of stresses including TNFα, heat, UV radiation, ceramide, and a number of cytotoxic drugs (29Jaattela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 30Samali A. Cotter T.G. Exp.

The significance of these findings is highlighted by studies that correlate high expression of Hsp72 in tumors with resistance to standard cancer therapies, increased metastasis to lymph nodes and a poor prognosis for disease free status and overall survival (34Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 35Jaattela M. Exp.

With the exception of TNFα-induced apoptosis, a role for Hsp72 in modulating apoptosis mediated through death receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily has not been clearly established. In this study we investigated the ability of Hsp72 to modulate Fas-induced apoptosis using the type II cell line CCRF-CEM and the type I cell lines SW480 and CH1. We found that Hsp72 inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis in the type II cells, acting downstream of Bid, but upstream of the mitochondria. In contrast, Hsp72 could not inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in the type I cells indicating that Hsp72 acts only in the intrinsic pathway.

Cell Lines and Stable Transfections—The human leukemic T-cell line CCRF-CEM, mouse B-cell lymphoma line CH1 and the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere and were routinely monitored for mycoplasma contamination. CCRF-CEM and CH1 cells were transfected by electroporation with the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo containing the coding region of human Hsp72 derived from pH2.3 (a kind gift from Dr. Clayton Hunt, Washington University, MO). Stable Hsp72 expressing cells were selected using 700 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were single cell cloned and expression of Hsp72 in clones, parental cells, and vector control cells was analyzed by Western blotting. CEM cells expressing Bcl-2 (CEM Bcl-2) and matching control cells (CEM) were a kind gift from Dr. David Huang (WEHI, Melbourne, Australia) and are described elsewhere (18Huang D.C. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). SW480 cells were transfected with the retroviral plasmid MSCV-IRES-GFP containing human Hsp72 (derived from pH2.3) or the mammalian expression vector pMPZenSVNeo containing a human Bcl-2 construct (a kind gift from Dr. Andreas Strasser, WEHI, Melbourne, Australia) using Lipofectamine™2000 (Invitrogen). A population of cells expressing Hsp72 was isolated by FACS sorting (Becton Dickinson FACSStar) for GFP expression. GFP expression of vector control cells was matched with that of Hsp72-transfected cells. Stable cells expressing Bcl-2 were selected using 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression of Hsp72 and Bcl-2 were confirmed by Western blotting. Treatment of Cells—All experiments using SW480 cells were performed on ∼50–70% confluent cell cultures while all experiments using CCRF-CEM and CH1 cells were performed on cultures at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Immediately prior to each experiment, the medium was replaced with fresh, pH- and temperature-equilibrated medium. Fas-mediated apoptosis was induced by either anti-Fas antibody (FasAb) or Fas ligand (FasL) cross-linked with 100 ng/ml of protein A or 100 ng/ml of anti-FLAG antibody, respectively, to ensure formation of multimeric receptor complexes. Reagents were added at the indicated doses and cells incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 18 h unless otherwise indicated. For some experiments, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 50 μm z-VAD-fmk dissolved in Me2SO. An equivalent volume of Me2SO (final concentration 0.2%) was added to control samples. For heat shock of SW480, flasks of cells were fully immersed in a circulating water bath calibrated to 44 ± 0.1 °C for 15 to 60 min. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis was assessed either by labeling with Annexin-V-FLUOS or by scoring nuclear morphology. Annexin-V-FLUOS labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics) and cells analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Ten thousand cells were counted for each sample. Nuclear morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy following propidium iodide (PI) staining as described previously (33Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A cell was scored as apoptotic if it displayed one or more of the following: nuclear margination, chromatin condensation, or formation of apoptotic bodies. At least 200 cells were counted in each experiment. Long Term Survival Assay—Long term survival was assessed by clonogenic assay. For the suspension cell line, CCRF-CEM, a series of dilutions containing known concentrations of cells (5000 to 0.5 cells/ml) were prepared, placed into 96-well U-bottom plates and incubated at 37 °C for 10–12 days. Wells were scored as positive or negative for colony growth as described (37Furth E.E. Thilly W.G. Penman B.W. Liber H.L. Rand W.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For the adherent cell line SW480, dilutions containing known numbers of cells (1 to 10 000) were placed in Petri dishes at 37 °C for 10–12 days. Colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 50% methanol and counted. The fraction of surviving cells was calculated by comparison with untreated control plates. Immunoblotting—Samples containing equal amounts of protein were separated by 13% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary and secondary antibodies were added in 1% milk powder in PBS and incubated for 2 to 6 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. HRP-conjugated and AP-conjugated secondary antibodies were detected by ECL (Lumilight, Roche Diagnostics), or colorimetric staining with naphthol phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and fast red TK (Bio-Rad), respectively. Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization—Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was assessed by uptake of the selective dye, TMRE. Cells were harvested, incubated with TMRE (final concentration 0.1 μm) for 5 min at room temperature and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur. Ten thousand cells were counted for each sample. Cytochrome c Release—Release of cytochrome c from cells was assessed by the method of Waterhouse and Trapani (38Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 × 105 SW480 cells or 5 × 105 CCRF-CEM cells were harvested and incubated for 5 min on ice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25 μg/ml digitonin and 100 mm KCl before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were immunostained with an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody, followed by ALEXA Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Ten thousand cells in each experiment were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur. Immunofluorescence Detection of Fas—Cells were immunostained with 1 μg of anti-Fas antibody or isotype control immunoglobulins per 1 × 106 cells followed by 0.5 μg of FITC-conjugated antimouse antibody. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur. Ten thousand cells were counted for each sample. Hsp72 Inhibits Fas-mediated Apoptosis of Type II CCRF-CEM Cells—The effect of Hsp72 on Fas-mediated apoptosis was first examined in the type II cell line, CCRF-CEM. These cells have been shown previously to be dependent on the engagement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to undergo efficient apoptosis (17Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). Expression of Hsp72 was assessed in parental cells, vector control cells and Hsp72-transfected clonal populations (Fig. 1a). Clones 7 and 16 expressed high levels of Hsp72, while clone 18 had similar levels of Hsp72 to parental and vector only transfected cells. The functionality of Hsp72 in CCRF-CEM cells was demonstrated by its ability to inhibit apoptosis induced by exposure to heat (Fig. 1b) and UV radiation (data not shown). Cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (FasAb) cross-linked with protein A (Fig. 1c). Apoptosis was induced in CCRF-CEM cells in a dose-dependent manner, but was reduced by ∼50% at all doses in the Hsp72-expressing clones compared with parental cells or vector control cells. In contrast, clone 18, which did not show appreciably increased expression of Hsp72, was not protected from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Similar results were obtained when apoptosis was evaluated by scoring apoptotic nuclear morphology (data not shown). Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis was also reduced in cells expressing Hsp72 compared with vector control cells (data not shown), confirming that Hsp72 can inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells. Preincubation of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis in vector only transfected cells and clone 16 cells (Fig. 1d), indicating that FasAb-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent in these cells. Hsp72 can provide long term protection, not just a delay in apoptosis, after initiation of Fas signaling in CCRF-CEM cells (Fig. 1e). Fas signaling was initiated by incubating cells with FasAb cross-linked with protein A for 16 h, prior to assessment of survival by clonogenic assay. Both Hsp72 expressing clones exhibited significantly enhanced clonogenic survival compared with parental or vector control cells. Approximately 60% of Hsp72 expressing cells survived long term after incubation with 15 ng/ml FasAb compared with 20% of parental or vector control cells. Hsp72 Cannot Inhibit Fas-mediated Apoptosis of the Type I Cell Lines SW480 and CH1—We next assessed the ability of Hsp72 to inhibit apoptosis in the cell lines SW480 and CH1, which have type I characteristics (18Huang D.C. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 39Ozoren N. El-Deiry W. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Type I cells demonstrate efficient direct cleavage of caspase-3 by caspase-8 through the extrinsic pathway and are able undergo apoptosis independent of the intrinsic pathway (17Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). A population of Hsp72-expressing SW480 cells was generated and Hsp72 expression confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2a). Initially, to ensure that the transfected Hsp72 was functional in these cells, we assessed long term survival of SW480 cells following heat stress by clonogenic assay (Fig. 2b). Hsp72-expressing cells exhibited a 10-fold increase in survival compared with vector only transfected cells after 90 min at 44 °C, indicating that the transfected Hsp72 was functional in these cells. Fas-mediated apoptosis was induced in SW480 cells using both FasAb cross-linked with 100 ng/ml of protein A (Fig. 2c) and FasL cross-linked with 100 ng/ml anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2d). In contrast to the type II CCRF-CEM cells, increased expression of Hsp72 did not protect SW480 cells from either FasL- or FasAb-induced apoptosis. Similar to CCRF-CEM cells, preincubation of SW480 cells with 50 μm z-VAD-fmk completely inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). Despite showing good expression of Fas on the cell surface (data not shown), SW480 cells required approximately ten times as much FasAb or three times as much FasL compared with CCRF-CEM cells to induce similar levels of apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the effect of Hsp72 expression on Fas-mediated apoptosis in another type I cell line, CH1, which is more sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. A single cell clone of CH1 (CH1.14) and Hsp72-expressing clones derived from CH1.14 (clone D1 and clone H5) were generated and expression of Hsp72 confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2e). Approximately 50% of CH1.14 cells underwent apoptosis when incubated with only 10 ng/ml of anti-mouse Fas antibody (mFasAb), demonstrating that this cell line is highly sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2f). Expression of Hsp72 in these cells had no effect on Fas-mediated apoptosis, confirming that Hsp72 cannot inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in type I cells. Bcl-2 Inhibits Fas-mediated Apoptosis in Type II CEM Cells but Not Type I SW480 Cells—To confirm the characteristics of these cells as being either type I or type II, we examined the effect of Bcl-2 expression on Fas-mediated apoptosis in CEM and SW480 cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in CEM (Fig. 3a) and SW480 (Fig. 3c) compared with vector control cells was confirmed by Western blotting. Expression of Bcl-2 in CEM cells strongly inhibited both FasAb- and FasL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3b). In contrast, expression of Bcl-2 in SW480 cells had no effect on FasAb-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3d). These results indicate that CEM cells require the intrinsic pathway for Fas-mediated apoptosis, and thus apoptosis is inhibited by the expression of Bcl-2. In contrast, Fas-mediated apoptosis of SW480 cells is unaltered by inhibition of the intrinsic pathway by Bcl-2. The expression of Hsp72 mirrors the ability of Bcl-2 to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis of type II but not type I cells, indicating that Hsp72 also acts in the intrinsic pathway to inhibit apoptosis. Thus, we next assessed the effect of Hsp72 expression on components of the intrinsic pathway during Fas-mediated apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells. Hsp72 Inhibits Fas-mediated Cleavage of Caspase-9 and Downstream Effector Caspases in CCRF-CEM Cells—The ability of Hsp72 to inhibit Fas-mediated cleavage of caspase-9 as well as the downstream effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, was assessed in CCRF-CEM cells by Western blotting (Fig. 4). The 35-kDa and 37-kDa cleavage products of caspase-9 were detected in vector control cells 6 h after the addition of anti-Fas antibody. The large (22 kDa) subunit and the small, fully active (17 kDa) subunit of caspase-3 were also detected at this time, while the active 21 kDa of caspase-7 was not detected until 12 h after addition of the antibody. In contrast, cleavage products of caspase-9 were not detected in clone 7 or clone 16 lysates until 12 h or later after the addition of anti-Fas antibody and the levels of the 35- and 37-kDa fragments were substantially reduced compared with vector control cells. In addition, both caspase-7 and caspase-3 processing was inhibited in Hsp72-expressing clones. Even after 18 h, the fully active 17-kDa fragment of caspase-3 and the 21-kDa caspase-7 cleavage product were not detected in clone 16 cells. Cleavage products of caspase-3 and caspase-7 were detected at later time points in clone 7 cells, but again at lower levels compared with vector control cells. This is consistent with the findings that inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis was greater in clone 16 than clone 7. Thus, Hsp72 effectively inhibits Fas-mediated cleavage of caspase-9 and the effector caspases, caspase-7 and caspase-3. Hsp72 Inhibits Fas-mediated Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization and Cytochrome c Release in CCRF-CEM Cells— Recent data from our laboratory suggest that Hsp72 acts upstream of the mitochondria to inhibit apoptosis after certain stresses (40Steel R. Doherty J.P. Buzzard K. Clemons N. Hawkins C.J. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51490-51499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Hsp72 upstream of the mitochondria in Fas-mediated apoptosis, we examined mitochondrial membrane depolarization by using the fluorescent compound TMRE. Cells were incubated with the indicated doses of anti-Fas antibody (FasAb) or Fas ligand (FasL) for 18 h, prior to harvest and addition of TMRE. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5a). Activation of the Fas pathway effectively caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization of CCRF-CEM cells. Live cells with functional mitochondria selectively take up TMRE, but with increasing doses of FasAb, a second population of cells that does not take up TMRE appears, which represents cells with loss of Δψm. The proportion of cells that had lost Δψm was reduced in both clones overexpressing Hsp72 compared with vector control cells. Approximately 70% fewer clone 16 cells had lost Δψm compared with vector control cells after incubation with FasAb (Fig. 5b). Similar results were obtained when FasL was used instead of the antibody (Fig. 5c). Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was also significantly inhibited in clone 7, but to a lesser extent than in clone 16. The percentage of cells that had lost Δψm correlated closely with the percentage of cells that had undergone apoptosis as determined from earlier experiments (Fig. 1b). Clone 18 cells responded in a similar manner to parental and vector control cells. The kinetics of Fas-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization in vector control cells versus Hsp72 expressing cells were also examined (Fig. 5d). Membrane depolarization became apparent between 4 and 8 h and significant inhibition of Δψm loss was observed in both Hsp72-expressing clones at times after 4 h. Because Hsp72 could inhibit Fas-mediated Δψm loss in CCRF-CEM cells, we next examined the effect of Hsp72 expression on the release of cytochrome c. Cells were incubated for 18 h with 10 ng/ml or 15 ng/ml of FasAb, or 100 ng/ml of Fas ligand prior to harvest and assessment of residual mitochondrial cytochrome c as describ"

Improved treatment strategies have increased overall survival, but the response of approximately one-third of the patients is still poor. To increase the knowledge of RMS pathogenesis, we performed the first full transcriptome analysis of RMS using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). With a G-test for the simultaneous comparison of subsets of SAGE libraries of normal skeletal muscle, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS) RMS, we identified 251 differentially expressed genes. A literature-mining procedure demonstrated that 158 of these genes have not previously been associated with RMS or normal muscle. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis assigned 198 of the 251 genes to muscle-specific classes, including those involved in normal myogenic development, as well as tumor-related classes. Prominent GO classes were those associated with proliferation and actin reorganization, which are processes that play roles during early muscle development, muscle function, and tumor progression. Using custom microarrays, we confirmed the (up- or down-) regulation of 80% of 98 differentially expressed genes. Another SAGE library of 19- to 22-week-old fetal skeletal muscle was compared with the RMS and normal muscle transcriptomes. Cluster analysis showed that the RMS and fetal muscle SAGE libraries formed one cluster distinct from normal muscle samples. Moreover, the expression profile of 86% of the differentially expressed genes between normal muscle and RMS was highly similar in fetal muscle and RMS. In conclusion, the G-test is a robust tool for analyzing groups of SAGE libraries and correctly identifies genes marking the difference between fully differentiated skeletal muscle and RMS. This study not only substantiates the close association between embryonic myogenesis and RMS development but also provides a rich source of candidate genes to further elucidate the etiology of RMS or to identify diagnostic and/or prognostic markers."
https://openalex.org/W2100292587,"Trigger factor (TF) is the first chaperone encountered by the nascent chain in bacteria and forms a stoichiometric complex with the ribosome. However, the functional significance of the high cytosolic concentration of uncomplexed TF, the majority of which is dimeric, is unknown. To gain insight into TF function, we investigated the TF concentration dependence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) reactivation yield in the presence and absence of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system <i>in vitro</i>. Cross-linking results indicate that the observed decrease in the reactivation yield of GAPDH at high concentrations of TF is due to the formation of a stable complex between TF dimer and GAPDH intermediates. In the absence of TF, or at low TF concentrations, the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system had negligible effect on the GAPDH refolding yield. However, GAPDH intermediates bound and held by dimeric TF could be specifically rescued by the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system in an ATP-dependent manner. This indicates the potential of TF, in its dimeric form, to act as a binding chaperone, maintaining non-native proteins in a refolding competent conformation and cooperating with downstream molecular chaperones to facilitate post-translational or post-stress protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W2066287434,"Large changes in the activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, AANAT) in the pineal gland control the rhythmic production of the time-keeping hormone melatonin. The activity of AANAT reflects changes in the amount and activation state of the AANAT protein, both of which increase at night. The molecular basis of this regulation is now becoming known, and recent data indicate that this involves phosphorylation-dependent binding to the 14-3-3 protein at two sites, one of which, Ser-205, is located several residues from the C terminus. In this study, we determined whether substitution of this residue with a non-hydrolyzable the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine mimetic would promote binding to the 14-3-3 protein and enhance cellular stability. To accomplish this, a C-terminal AANAT peptide containing the phosphonodifluoromethylene alanine at Ser-205 was synthesized and fused to bacterially expressed AANAT30–199 using expressed protein ligation. The resulting semisynthetic protein has enhanced affinity for the expressed 14-3-3 protein and exhibits greater cellular stability in microinjection experiments, as compared with the unmodified AANAT. Enhanced 14-3-3 binding was also observed using humanized ovine AANAT, which has a different C-terminal sequence (Gly-Cys) than the ovine enzyme (Asp-Arg), indicating that that characteristic is not unique to the ovine enzyme. These studies provide the first evidence that substitution of Ser-205 with the stable phosphomimetic amino acid phosphonodifluoromethylene alanine enhances binding to 14-3-3 and the cellular stability of AANAT and are consistent with the view that Ser-205 phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of AANAT activity and melatonin production."

A soluble TF variant with a mutated substrate binding site also exhibited strong anticoagulant activity in rabbit and guinea pig thrombosis models without appreciably interfering with hemostasis (16Kelley R.F.

Haemost. 2001; 85: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whereas such peptidic and protein inhibitors of TF·FVIIa display strong specificity and potency, they lack oral bioavailability and are not suitable for long term prophylaxis or treatment. Therefore, we chose to develop small organic active site inhibitors of FVIIa with potential for oral administration. As a first important step toward attaining this objective, the potent and highly specific inhibitor G17905 was produced. Other small organic active site inhibitors of FVIIa with varying selectivity and potency have been reported and were reviewed recently (40Lazarus R.A. Olivero A.G. Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 2275-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for understanding the high selectivity of G17905 is discussed within the context of the crystal structure of FVIIa·G17905 complex. Enzyme kinetic studies, which were prompted by the discovery that G17905 bound to an unusual, “flipped” active site conformation of FVIIa, showed that G17905 is a slow binding inhibitor. Its ability to inhibit baboon FVIIa allowed us to study the antithrombotic activity and effects on normal hemostasis in baboon models. Reagents—Except for bovine trypsin (Sigma), all enzymes used were of human origin. FX, FXa, factor XIa, thrombin, activated protein C (APC), and plasmin were from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa were from American Diagnostica (Stamford, CT), urokinase type plasminogen activator and chymotrypsin were from Sigma, complement factor C1s was from Calbiochem, and tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (Activase®) was from Genentech, Inc. Soluble tissue factor (sTF) (residues 1–219), relipidated recombinant tissue factor (residues 1–243) (rTF) and human recombinant factor VIIa were produced as described (33Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C.

The expression and purification of recombinant hepatocyte growth factor activator and matriptase was carried out as described previously (43Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C.

All other reagents were of the highest quality available. The following synthetic substrates were used to measure enzyme activities: Spectrozyme® fVIIa (American Diagnostica) for hepatocyte growth factor activator and Chromozym tPA (Roche Applied Science) for sTF·FVIIa. The following substrates were from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH): S2765 for matriptase; S2222 and S2675 for FXa; S2302 for plasma kallikrein; S2366 for activated protein C, thrombin, and plasmin; S2444 for urokinase type plasminogen activator; S2288 for factor XIa, factor XIIa, and t-PA; S2314 for complement factor C1s; S2586 for chymotrypsin; and S2251 for trypsin. Serine Protease Inhibition Assay—The synthetic substrates used for different enzymes are listed under “Reagents.” G17905 was incubated with enzyme in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80, 5 mm CaCl2 for 40 min at room temperature. Substrate was added, and the linear rates of the increase in absorbance at 405 nm were measured on a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The inhibitor concentration that gave a 50% inhibition of enzymatic activity (IC50) was determined by fitting the data to a four-parameter equation (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The Ki values were calculated according to the equation, Ki = IC50/(1 + [S]/Km) (44Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar) using the experimentally determined IC50 and Km values for each enzyme-substrate pair. Kinetics of TF·FVIIa Inhibition—A complex of sTF and FVIIa was preformed in 96-well Costar® plates (Corning Glass) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm CaCl2 (HBSA buffer) and incubated with increasing concentrations of G17905. After 45 min, various concentrations (0.125–4 mm) of the chromogenic substrate Chromozym t-PA were added to start the reaction. The concentrations of sTF and FVIIa in the reaction mixture were 100 and 1 nm, respectively. The rates of substrate hydrolysis were measured on a kinetic microplate reader at 405 nm (Molecular Devices). A plot of the IC50 value as a function of substrate concentration yielded a linear relationship, indicating competitive inhibition mode (45Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. Wiley-VCH, Inc., New York1996: 230-236Google Scholar). In addition, the Kappi value was determined by fitting the data to Equation 1 (46Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), vivo=1−([E]+[I]+Kiapp)−([E]+[I]+Kiapp)2−(4[E][I])2[E] (Eq. 1) where vi/vo is the fractional activity, [E] is the enzyme concentration, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration. The Ki was then calculated using the relationship for competitive inhibitors Kappi = Ki/(1 + [S]/Km). For FX activation experiments, a complex of rTF and FVIIa in HBSA buffer was incubated with increasing concentrations of G17905. After 40 min at room temperature, FX was added to start the reaction. The mixture contained 0.005 nm FVIIa, 0.4 nm rTF, 0.25–1.0 nm G17905, and increasing concentrations of FX. Aliquots taken at different time points were quenched in 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm, upon the addition of S2765 (0.3 mm), was measured on a kinetic microplate reader. For each sample, the concentration of formed FXa was calculated from standard curves with purified FXa, and the background activities, determined in experiments without the addition of FVIIa, were subtracted from each value. The linear rates of FXa formation were determined and are shown in the double-reciprocal plot format (1/v as a function of 1/[FX]), where v is the linear rate of FXa formation (nm FXa/min). To investigate slow binding inhibition, rTF·FVIIa complex was preformed by incubating FVIIa with rTF in HBSA buffer for 15 min in 96-well Costar® plates (Corning Glass). A pre-equilibrated mixture of G17905 and FX was added to start the reaction. The concentrations of the reactants were as follows: 0.004 nm FVIIa, 0.4 nm rTF, 400 nm FX, and increasing concentrations (0.25–8 nm) of G17905. At various time points during the 20-min reaction period, aliquots were removed and quenched in 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm, upon the addition of S2765 (0.3 mm), was measured on a kinetic microplate reader. The concentration of newly formed FXa was calculated for each time point using a standard curve with purified FXa. For each experiment, the background activities in the absence of added FVIIa were determined and subtracted from each value. The data obtained were best described by a time-dependent inhibitory mechanism (45Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis.

[P]=(vst)+vi−vskobs(1−e−kobst) (Eq. 2) P is the product (equal to FXa), vi and vs are the initial and steady-state velocity, respectively, and kobs is the apparent first-order rate constant. By use of this equation, the values for vi, vs, and kobs were obtained. Molecular Dynamics Simulations—A protocol for molecular dynamics simulations was used for all compounds, using Amber 4.1 (49Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. Fergusonm D.M. Seibel G.L. Sing U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Simulations were run using the catalytic domain from either a reference protein structure (26Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) or one similar to that for the complex with G17905. Parameters for the ligand were developed using standard RESP protocols as described (50Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5357) Google Scholar), using grids calculated at the 6–31-G level carried out using Gaussian 94 (Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Simulations were run with explicit solvent, using a solvent cap of ∼21 Å. The initial water structure was equilibrated through a multistep process as follows. The starting configuration for the simulation was minimized and then subjected to 25-ps dynamics at 200 K, with heavy atom constraints (3–4 kcal/mol Å2) on the protein and ligand. The system was then reminimized in two steps with decreasing protein and ligand constraints (1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 kcal/mol Å2 in step 1 and 1.0, 0.5, and 0.0 kcal/mol Å2 in step 2 for protein backbone, side chains, and ligand, respectively). Subsequent dynamics of the processed system were carried out using constraints only on the protein backbone α-carbons (1.0 kcal/mol Å2) and a 250-ps equilibration phase with a 50-ps ramp to 300 K followed by a 500-ps production phase. Synthesis of G17905—Synthesis of substituted amidine component G17905 from the commercially available 2-methoxy-4-nitrobenzonitrile 2 (Fig. 1A) was as follows. The demethylation of 2 was done by reaction of 2 with lithium chloride at 150 °C. The resulting phenol was then protected with a benzyl group by treatment with benzyl chloride to produce compound 3. Reduction of the nitro group with hydrogen and palladium on carbon resulted in compound 4. The fluorodiethoxybenzene portion of the molecule could be obtained from aldehyde 8. This aldehyde was prepared in four steps from the commercially available 4-fluorophenol 5. Protection of the phenol with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, lithiation, and reaction with B(OMe)3 resulted in the borate, which was oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to introduce the second OH group (compound 6). Dialkylation of the bis-phenol with iodoethane produced 7, and subsequent lithiation/formylation provided the aldehyde 8 (Fig. 1A). The key step in the synthesis of G17905 was the reaction of the aldehyde 8 and the aniline 4 with tosylmethylisocyanide. Hydrolysis of the resulting imidate using 5 eq of water, yielded the ester 9 (Fig. 1B). Hydrolysis of the ester followed by coupling with 3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide furnished the acylsulfonamide 10 (Fig. 1B). Hydrogenation over Pd/C reduced the nitro group to the aniline and removed the benzyl protecting group. The nitrile was converted to the racemic amidine 11 under standard Pinner conditions. The active enantiomer 1 (Fig. 1B) was separated from the inactive enantiomer by chiral chromatography using an (S,S)-Whelk-O (Regis Technologies, Morton Grove, IL) chiral high pressure liquid chromatography column and eluting with isopropyl alcohol/water buffered at pH 5.5. (MS: (M + 1) = 546). Coagulation Assays—G17905 was diluted in citrated human plasma (Stanford Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA) or in pooled citrated baboon plasma. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and Russell viper venom time (RVVT) were determined using standard techniques for an ACL 300 coagulometer (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA). Plasma containing G17905 was mixed with appropriate volumes of human TF reagent Innovin® (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) for PT, actin FS (Dade Behring) for APTT, human thrombin (10 units/ml) (Sigma) for TT, or rabbit brain cephalin plus Russell viper venom (Sigma) for RVVT. Clotting times were expressed as -fold prolongation of each test sample versus that of a plasma-containing buffer (control). Clot Lysis Assay—Pooled citrated human plasma containing t-PA (0.4 μg/ml) and G17905 (0–500 μm) were added by the sampling arm of an ACL 300 coagulometer to one well of a coagulometer rotor. Human thrombin (10 units/ml in 120 mm CaCl2) (Sigma) was added to the companion well. After sample loading, clot formation and subsequent dissolution were initiated when the reaction components were mixed by centrifugation. Clot lysis was measured as the time-dependent change in light scatter, and the lysis time (i.e. the time for 50% decrease of maximal light scatter signal) was calculated. Without inhibitor the clot lysis time (with 0.4 μg/ml t-PA) was about 500 s (equal to normal clot lysis time). The concentration of G17905 to prolong the normal clot lysis time by 2-fold was determined. APC Resistance Assay—G17905 at various concentrations (0–500 μm) was added to freshly thawed citrated human plasma. The plasma was mixed with the reagents of a Coatest APC resistance kit (DiaPharma Group Inc., West Chester, OH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. APTTs (with or without exogenous APC) were determined in an ACL 300 coagulometer, and the APC ratio was calculated. When screening human samples, a ratio of ≤0.75 is considered the threshold for further evaluation. We found that the APC ratio could be converted to percentage of normal APC activity by determining the APC ratios of standards generated by mixing normal human plasma with APC-depleted plasma. This standard curve was linear over the ratio range 1 to 0.75, with a ratio of 0.75 equivalent to 50% normal plasma activity. Therefore, the IC50 of G17905 in this assay was defined as the concentration that resulted in a 25% reduction of the APC ratio. Baboon Arterio-venous Shunt Thrombosis Model—The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University in accordance with United States federal guidelines. The ability of G17905 to inhibit thrombus formation following acute tissue factor exposure in vivo was assessed in a baboon arterio-venous shunt model that used a TF-coated graft instead of denuded baboon aorta (51Krupski W.C. Bass A. Kelly A.B. Hanson S.R. Harker L.A. Circulation. 1991; 84: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Baboons were fitted with an exteriorized silicone rubber shunt surgically placed between the femoral artery and vein. A TF-coated Gore-Tex vascular graft (2-cm length, 4-mm inner diameter) was inserted into the shunt. The graft had been coated with TF by infusing the pores of the graft with undiluted human TF reagent (Innovin®) for 5 min followed by drying overnight. The blood flow of 100 ml/min, controlled by a clamp placed distal to the graft, was monitored continuously by use of an ultrasonic flow meter (Transonic Systems Inc.). The compound G17905 dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline or phosphate-buffered saline alone (control) was delivered via a venous catheter (t = 0). Before initiation of the study, blood was withdrawn, and the platelets were labeled with 111In oxine. The labeled platelets were injected at least 1 h before graft insertion. The accumulation of 111In-labeled platelets onto the graft was measured using a γ"

Dab1 interacts with NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of the lipoprotein receptors ApoER2 and very low density lipoprotein receptor through an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Binding of Reelin to these receptors leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 and the initiation of a signaling cascade that results in remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Structural and biochemical studies of the Dab1 PTB domain have demonstrated that this domain binds to both the NPXY peptide motif in the lipoprotein receptor tails as well as to the head group of phosphoinositide 4,5-P2 through energetically independent mechanisms. Here we have investigated how phosphoinositide binding by the Dab1 PTB domain influences Reelin signal transduction. Our findings in cultured primary neurons that have been transduced with lentiviral constructs expressing mutant Dab1 forms reveal that phosphoinositide binding by the Dab1 PTB domain is necessary for proper membrane localization of Dab1 and for effective transduction of a Reelin signal.

In the developing mammalian brain, neurons that make up the cerebral cortex must form discrete layers that align in an inverted, “inside-out” manner. This is a complex process in which newly born neurons migrate from the ventricular zone to their correct positions in the neocortex. This critical migration event, as well as those in other regions of the developing brain, is regulated in part by the Reelin signaling pathway (1Ogawa M. Miyata T. Nakajima K. Yagyu K. Seike M.

Murine Dab1 is a 555-amino acid protein whose expression is limited to the brain (9Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Dab1 features an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, followed by a tyrosine-rich region, and an acidic carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A) (10Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The association between Dab1 and the lipoprotein receptors occurs via binding of the Dab1 PTB domain to the NPXY motif in the receptor tails (11Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Reelin-induced phosphorylation then takes place within the tyrosine-rich region, with the most important sites believed to be on Tyr198, Tyr220, and possibly Tyr232 (12Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Keshvara L. Benhayon D. Magdaleno S. Curran T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16008-16014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is carried out by Src family kinases, with Fyn tyrosine kinase as the most likely candidate (14Bock H.H. Herz J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 18-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Arnaud L. Ballif B.A. Forster E. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 8: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Dab1 is critical for transduction of a Reelin signal, as mutation of the 5 tyrosines in this region to phenylalanine results in a phenotype identical to the Dab1 knockout (12Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, loss of phosphorylation on Tyr198 and Tyr232 results in specific defects in migration of developing neurons along radial glial fibers (16Sanada K. Gupta R. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2004; 42: 197-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whereas the tyrosine-rich region of Dab1 is the actual site of phosphorylation, it is the NH2-terminal PTB domain that mediates interaction with the lipoprotein tails and facilitates activation. Thus, the PTB domain is essential for proper Dab1 function. The PTB domain is a member of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfamily, which includes PTB, PH, and Ena-Vasp homology (EVH1) domains, and Ran-binding domains (17Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). These domains are all structurally related but differ in their ligand binding specificities. Recent structural work on the Dab1 PTB domain has shown that this domain is able to bind to the NPXY peptide motif and to a phosphoinositide head group simultaneously through separate binding sites on opposite faces of the domain (Fig. 1B) (18Yun M. Keshvara L. Park C.-G. Zhang Y.-M. Dickerson J.B. Zheng J. Rock C.O. Curran T. Park H.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36572-36581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Stolt P.C. Jeon H. Song H.K. Herz J. Eck M.J. Blacklow S.C. Structure. 2003; 11: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, Dab1 shares characteristics both with PTB domains that typically recognize NPXY motifs and with PH domains that bind to phosphoinositides (PIs). Subsequent in vitro binding experiments and mutational analysis have revealed that these two ligand-binding sites are non-cooperative and energetically independent (20Stolt P.C. Vardar D. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10979-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the lipoprotein receptors themselves have no associated kinase activity, the interaction between the Dab1 PTB domain and these receptors most likely functions to recruit Dab1 to a complex containing membrane-associated Src family kinases and other components of Reelin signaling in addition to the lipoprotein receptors. As Dab1 is constitutively associated with the membrane in primary neurons (7Bock H.H. Jossin Y. Liu P. Forster E. May P. Goffinet A. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), PI binding by the Dab1 PTB domain may be responsible for driving membrane localization and thereby facilitating association with the lipoprotein receptor tails. Nevertheless, the functional role of PI binding by the Dab1 PTB domain and its effect on Reelin signal transduction have not yet been examined. The mutants described in our previous work (20Stolt P.C. Vardar D. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10979-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which have selective deficiencies in either NPXY or PI binding, but not both, constitute powerful reagents for resolving the distinct in vivo role of PI binding from that of binding to the receptor cytoplasmic tails. To examine the functional importance of the two binding sites, we therefore introduced either native or mutant Dab1 proteins deficient in either PI or peptide binding into primary neuronal cultures by lentiviral transduction. The effect of mutations that eliminated either PI or NPXY binding was assessed by: (i) examining the membrane localization of these mutants, and (ii) evaluating the ability of these mutants to become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Reelin stimulation. These studies show that PI binding by the Dab1 PTB domain is necessary and sufficient for membrane localization. Lentiviral Constructs—The LL3.7 vector (21Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar) was modified by cutting at the XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites to excise the U6 RNA interference promoter and the CMV-EGFP fragment. A fragment from the pIRES-EGFP vector (Invitrogen) encoding the CMV promoter and a multicloning site, followed by an internal ribosome entry site and EGFP was cut out using the AseI and AflIII sites. This fragment was then blunt ligated into the cut LL3.7 vector to make a modified lentiviral vector containing a CMV promoter, an multicloning site for insertion of the Dab1 gene, and an internal ribosome entry site to express EGFP on a separate mRNA. The K45E (20Stolt P.C. Vardar D. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10979-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and S114T/F158V mutations were introduced into the native Dab1 sequence in a pcDNA3.1 vector with a COOH-terminal 5-Myc tag by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The native and mutant Myc-tagged Dab1 sequences were then subcloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites in the multicloning site of the modified lentiviral vector. The 5F mutant, with mutations Y185F, Y198F, Y200F, Y220F, and Y232F (12Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Brian Howell, and was first subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-Myc vector and then into the modified lentiviral vector in the same manner. Mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The murine Disabled-1 PTB domain containing the S114T/F158V mutation and encompassing amino acids 20–175 was PCR amplified from the pcDNA3.1-myc plasmid mentioned above. The PCR product was introduced into the pDEST15 Gateway vector (Invitrogen) downstream of glutathione S-transferase, and the protein was produced and purified as described (19Stolt P.C. Jeon H. Song H.K. Herz J. Eck M.J. Blacklow S.C. Structure. 2003; 11: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were carried out at 25 °C with the S114T/F158V Dab1 PTB domain protein at a concentration of 20 μm in 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. A 14-residue synthetic peptide from the ApoER2 cytoplasmic tail (Invitrogen, acetyl-TKSMNFDNPVYRKT-amide) was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and dissolved in the identical buffer for this titration. The inositol head group of PI 4,5-P2 (Sigma) was also dissolved in the identical buffer. To perform the titrations, a stock solution of either 2 mm ApoER2 peptide or 140 μm PI 4,5-P2 was added in 7.5-μl increments to the solution containing the S114T/F158V mutant Dab1 PTB domain. To extract the dissociation constant, enthalpy of binding, and calculated entropy, data were plotted and analyzed with the software program Origin 5.0. Transient Transfections—HEK-293 (CRL-1573, ATCC) cells were grown in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the lentiviral constructs described above, or co-transfected with the lentiviral constructs and a pRc-CMV plasmid expressing human Fyn (obtained from Gottfried Baier, Innsbruck) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were harvested 24 h after transfection and analyzed by Western blot. Preparation of Lentiviral Particles—293FT cells were transfected with the pRSV, pRRE, and pVSV-G plasmids of a 3-vector lentiviral system (22Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4039) Google Scholar, 23Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together with the modified lentiviral vector expressing native or mutant Dab1, or an empty vector control. Forty-eight to 72 h after transfection the cell media were collected and centrifuged at 800 × g for 7 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatants were dialyzed against serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) using 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off dialysis membranes (Spectrum Labs). The viral supernatants were then supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen) and were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. For the experiment in Fig. 5D, the viral media was concentrated 4–5-fold by spinning at 800 × g in Amicon centrifugal filter units with a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Millipore) to achieve a higher titer. To titer the virus, primary neurons were grown on coverslips, transduced, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 2–3 days after transduction. The percentage of cells expressing GFP was counted under a fluorescence microscope, and the titer was calculated to be 2 × 104-1 × 105 infectious units/ml. This titer proved to be sufficient for the assays used in this study at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.2–0.5. Preparation of Primary Neurons—All animal experiments were conducted according to the procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Primary forebrain neurons were prepared from E15.5–17.5 embryos from timed pregnant wild-type and Dab1 heterozygous mice, or E18–20 rat embryos from timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) as described (7Bock H.H.

Cellular Fractionation of Primary Neurons—On days 4–6 after culturing, the forebrain neurons were tranduced with the lentiviral particles at m.o.i. of 0.2–0.5. Twenty-four hours after infection the viral supernatant was removed and replaced with conditioned Neurobasal media. Two to 3 days after infection, cellular fractionation was carried out as described (7Bock H.H. Jossin Y. Liu P. Forster E. May P. Goffinet A. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In brief, neurons were harvested and lysed by being subjected to a pressure of 500 p.s.i. for 15 min, and forced through a small hole by slowly releasing the pressure. Nuclei were removed by low-speed centrifugation, and the postnuclear supernatants were separated into soluble and particulate fractions by ultracentrifugation. Particulate fractions were re-solubilized, and the protein concentrations of the particulate and soluble fractions were estimated using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible assay. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were then analyzed by Western blot with a polyclonal α-Dab1 antibody (7Bock H.H. Jossin Y. Liu P. Forster E. May P. Goffinet A. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or monoclonal α-Myc antibody (9E10), a polyclonal α-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology/New England Biolabs), and a polyclonal α-LRP1 (24May P. Rohlmann A. Bock H.H. Zurhove K. Marth J.D. Schomburg E.D. Noebels J.L. Beffert U. Sweatt J.D. Weeber E.J. Herz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8872-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or monoclonal α-Synaptophysin antibody (SY38, Synaptic Systems). Immunoprecipitation—On days 4–6 after culturing of the forebrain neurons, the cultures were transduced with the lentiviral particles at m.o.i. of 0.2–0.5. Twenty-four hours after infection the viral supernatant was removed and replaced with conditioned Neurobasal media. Two to 3 days after infection, the neurons were stimulated with partially purified Reelin-conditioned or mock-conditioned media for 15 min at 37 °C and lysed as described (7Bock H.H. Jossin Y. Liu P. Forster E. May P. Goffinet A. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The cleared lysates were incubated with 5 μg of a polyclonal rabbit α-Myc antibody (Bethyl Labs) at 4 °C overnight. This mixture was subsequently incubated with Protein A beads (Sigma) for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times, once with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and twice with the same buffer containing only 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot using a monoclonal α-Myc antibody (9E10) as well as a monoclonal α-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate). In a previous study (20Stolt P.C. Vardar D. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10979-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) we determined the binding affinities of various Dab1 PTB domain mutants for an NPXY-containing peptide from ApoER2, as well as for the phosphoinositide head group from PI 4,5-P2 (20Stolt P.C. Vardar D. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10979-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutations that led to loss of binding to one ligand but not the other were introduced into a full-length Dab1 clone to be further characterized in cell-based assays. As we have shown earlier (20Stolt P.C. Vardar D. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10979-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), point mutations at either the NPXY or PI binding site (Fig. 1, C and D) selectively eliminate binding at one site but not the other. Mutation of lysine 45 to glutamate (K45E) reduces PI 4,5-P2 binding by at least 300-fold (20Stolt P.C. Vardar D. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10979-10987Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas a double mutant of serine 114 to threonine and phenylalanine 158 to valine (S114T/F158V) reduces binding of the NPXY peptide by at least 150-fold (Fig. 2). The K45E mutant (Fig. 1D) retains native affinity for the NPXY peptide ligand but shows negligible binding to PI ligands, and was therefore chosen as a mutant lacking the PI binding ability. To eliminate binding to the NPXY motif, mutations in two important NPXY-interacting residues, serine 114 and phenylalanine 158, were combined to ensure complete loss of binding (Fig. 1C) (19Stolt P.C. Jeon H. Song H.K. Herz J. Eck M.J. Blacklow S.C. Structure. 2003; 11: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The S114T/F158V double mutant retains native affinity for PIs (KD = 0.7 ± 0.1 μm), but shows negligible binding to the NPXY-peptide (KD reduced by at least 150–200-fold), as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 2). In addition, the 5F mutant (6Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), in which tyrosines 185, 198, 200, 220, and 232 are mutated to phenylalanine and that therefore cannot undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, was used as a negative control (Fig. 1A). Testing of Lentiviral Constructs—Full-length native Dab1 as well as the 5F, K45E, and S114T/F158V mutants containing a carboxyl-terminal 5-Myc tag were subcloned into a lentiviral expression vector derived from LL3.7 (21Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). To test for Dab1 expression and to show that the mutant Dab1 forms have the potential to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Reelin, we transiently transfected the different constructs into HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3), either with (+, even numbered lanes) or without (-, odd-numbered lanes) co-transfection with an expression vector containing a Fyn cDNA. This non-receptor tyrosine kinase is the major tyrosine kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate Dab1 in vivo (14Bock H.H. Herz J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 18-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Arnaud L. Ballif B.A. Forster E. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 8: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (245) Google Scholar). All of the mutants are properly expressed in this heterologous cell system, as shown by detection with a polyclonal α-Dab1 antibody in HEK-293 cell lysates (upper panel), and all but the 5F mutant (lanes 5 and 6) are phosphorylated, as assessed by Western blotting of the same samples with an α-phosphotyrosine antibody (lower panel). Native Dab1, 5F, K45E, and S114T/F158V constructs were then incorporated into lentiviral particles for transduction of primary neuronal cultures. Viral expression was tested by transducing wild-type primary neuronal cultures with each of the different lentiviruses at m.o.i. of 0.2–0.5. Viral expression of Dab1 was detected by blotting with an α-Myc antibody (Fig. 4, upper panel). All of the viruses expressed comparable amounts of Dab1. Cdk5 (lower panel) served as a loading control. Effect of PTB Mutants on Membrane Localization—We then examined the membrane localization of native and mutant forms of Dab1 using a cell fractionation approach (7Bock H.H. Jossin Y. Liu P. Forster E. May P. Goffinet A. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Primary neurons were prepared from either Dab1 knockout mouse embryos or from wild-type rat embryos and transduced with the indicated lentiviral constructs at m.o.i. of 0.2–0.5. Forty-eight to 72 h after transduction, the neurons were harvested, homogenized, and separated into soluble (S, cytosolic) and particulate (P, membrane containing) fractions. Membrane fractionations of non-transduced wild-type neurons and knockout neurons transduced with vector alone served as positive and negative controls, respectively. In wild-type neurons, native Dab1 was detected with a polyclonal α-Dab1 antibody. This same antibody was used to detect virally expressed Dab1 in experiments performed with knockout neurons, whereas an α-Myc antibody was used for virally expressed Dab1 in wild-type neurons. Detection of Akt was used as a control for a cytoplasmic protein that is present predominantly in the soluble protein fraction (7Bock H.H. Jossin Y. Liu P. Forster E. May P. Goffinet A. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas LRP1 or Synaptophysin was used as a marker for the membrane containing fraction (7Bock H.H. Jossin Y. Liu P. Forster E. May P. Goffinet A. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Wiedenmann B. Franke W.W. Cell. 1985; 41: 1017-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Native Dab1 was found exclusively in the particulate fraction of wild-type neurons (7) (Fig. 5A, lane 2). As shown in Fig. 5B myc-tagged wild type (lane 2), K45E (lane 3), and S114T/F158V (lane 4) Dab1 constructs were efficiently expressed by lentivirus-transduced wild-type neurons. Virally expressed wild-type (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4) and S114T/F158V mutant (lanes 7 and 8) Dab1, which both retain PI binding activity, were found predominantly in the particulate, membrane containing fraction in knockout neurons. By contrast, the K45E mutant was present both in the soluble and particulate fractions (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Infection of neurons at a higher m.o.i. caused a significant accumulation of wild-type Dab1 in the soluble fraction (Fig. 5D, lane 1). The K45E form of Dab1 was almost exclusively soluble at this higher rate of infection. Taken together, these findings suggest that interaction with phosphoinositides, but not with the NPXY motifs, is required for the membrane association of Dab1. Effect of PTB Mutants on Reelin Signal Transduction—Next, we tested each mutant for its ability to participate in Reelin signaling, i.e. to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon Reelin binding to its receptors (4Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 8Beffert U. Morfini G. Bock H.H.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Wild-type primary mouse or rat neurons were transduced with lentiviral particles expressing the different Dab1 mutants (Fig. 6A, lanes 3–8) or an empty virus (lanes 1 and 2) at an m.o.i. of 0.2–0.5. Two to 3 days after transduction, the neurons were re-fed with either control (mock, M) or Reelin (R) containing medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an α-Myc antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with α-Myc (to monitor protein expression) and α-Phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 6). Upon Reelin stimulation, native Dab1 is efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 6, A, upper panel, lane 4; B, upper panel, lane 2). As expected, the 5F mutant (Fig. 6A, lanes 5 and 6), which does not contain tyrosine residues, could not be phosphorylated in response to Reelin. The S114T/F158V mutant (lanes 7 and 8) was also resistant to Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that high affinity interaction of the Dab1 PTB domain with the NPXY motifs is necessary for signal propagation. Likewise, the K45E mutant was completely resistant to Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6B, lane 4), although it was expressed at higher levels (bottom panel, lanes 3 and 4) than the wild-type Dab1 (lanes 1 and 2) that served as a control in this experiment. Thus, PI-mediated membrane association of Dab1 is critical for assembly of the Reelin sign"

Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy we localized TOSO to the cytoplasmic membrane of expressing cells. Using stably transfected mouse TOSO (mTOSO)-expressing Jurkat cells, we show that TOSO protects cells from Fas/Fas ligand- and tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis but not from TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis. The Fas-induced activation of caspase-8 was significantly inhibited by the expression of mTOSO. Using deletion mutants and glutathione S-transferase pull-down approaches, we have shown that mTOSO regulates apoptosis by directly binding to Fas-associated death domain through its C-terminal domain, suggesting the disruption of death-inducing signaling complex formation as mechanism of action. Furthermore, we have expressed mTOSO in transgenic mice and show that mTOSO overexpressing primary T lymphocytes are resistant to Fas/Fas ligand-induced apoptosis.

Certain members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily are capable of inducing apoptosis (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar), a key physiological process in development and tissue homeostasis. These so-called “extrinsic” apoptosis pathways are activated by ligand-bound death receptors such as TNF, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; mTOSO, mouse TOSO; FasL, Fas ligand; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; DR, death receptor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; Ab, antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus; a.a., amino acids; pNA, p-nitroaniline.

Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). All of these death receptors contain an intracellular domain called death domain. The Fas/FasL pathway is one of the best characterized system involved in regulating apoptosis. The Fas/FasL pathway plays a critical role in at least three types of physiological apoptosis: 1) peripheral deletion of activated mature T cells at the conclusion of an immune response (4Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3979) Google Scholar); 2) elimination of virus-infected cells or cancer cells by cytotoxic T cells or/and by natural killer cells (5Houston A. O'Connell J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); and 3) limiting or preventing immune responses and inflammatory reactions at so-called “immune-privileged” organs such as the eye (6Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar), testis, and brain (7Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 8Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Fas (CD95) is a 45-kDa type I transmembrane protein expressed on various cells (9Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2676) Google Scholar). FasL (CD95L) is a type II transmembrane protein of 40 kDa that can be secreted in a soluble form (26 kDa) by the action of metalloproteinases. Aggregation of Fas by FasL or agonistic anti-Fas antibodies results in recruitment of the adaptor protein (10Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). FADD contains two protein interaction domains: a death domain and a death effector domain. The currently accepted model is that FADD binds directly to Fas through interaction between their respective death domains. Consequently, the death effector domain of FADD interacts with the death effector domain of procaspase-8 to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (11Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Jux-taposition of procaspase-8 results in auto-cleavage and activation (12Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Active caspase-8 in turn activates downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7 (12Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), causing the cell to undergo apoptosis. Because of the importance of apoptosis in maintaining cell numbers, differentiation, and elimination of certain cells, these processes are tightly regulated. In fact, the balance between apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals is governed by multiple interacting molecules and at multiple levels. This level of complexity is a prerequisite for proper immune defense and homeostasis. As a case in point, a novel human gene dubbed TOSO was identified as a molecule that blocks Fas-mediated apoptosis by Hitoshi et al. (15Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). TOSO was found to be expressed mainly by lymphocytes. These investigators also suggested that TOSO regulates apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activation. Nevertheless, the relative importance of TOSO in the complex regulation of apoptosis has not been sufficiently investigated and remains largely unknown. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the mouse homologue of TOSO. We have significantly extended the knowledge about this new molecule and provide evidence for its mechanism of action. Cloning the Full-length Mouse TOSO (mTOSO) cDNA—Using the sequence of human TOSO gene (15Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the expressed sequence tag data bases were explored by saturated BLAST searches for mouse clones that contained human TOSO homologues. This search identified four mouse expressed sequence tag clones: AA290194, 521993, 509857, and 174968. These clones were purchased (from Research Genetics), sequenced, and analyzed; an open reading frame was identified; and the putative mouse TOSO sequence was obtained. The putative cDNA sequence was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, amplifying mTOSO cDNA from mouse spleen lymphocytes using primers designed from the putative mTOSO sequence. The 5′-untranslated region (84 nucleotides) and 3′-untranslated region (139 nucleotides) were obtained by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Invitrogen), respectively. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers 514618 and 514626). The coding sequence cDNA of mTOSO was cloned into mammalian expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) at the HindIII/XbaI sites and named pRC/CMV-TOSO. Plasmid Constructs—For cloning purposes all PCRs used Pfu high fidelity DNA polymerase enzyme (Stratagene). The plasmid pRC/CMV-TOSO-HA, which encodes HA-tagged mTOSO at the C terminus, was constructed by PCR cloning. Using pRC/CMV-TOSO as the template, the TOSO-HA fragment was generated by amplifying with linker primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGTGTGTCAGCCTCACT-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCAAGCGTAATCTGGTACGTCGTATGGGTATTGGCATGAAGATCTGGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI. The vector pRC/CMV was digested with HindIII and XbaI. The digested PCR fragments of HA-tagged mTOSO was ligated into the digested pRC/CMV. For constructions of mTOSO deletions, various fragments of mTOSO were generated by PCR cloning, and the fragments were then digested with HindIII and NotI. TOSO deletion construct 2 containing amino acids 16–422 was generated with primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTCACCATGGCCCTGAGA-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCATGGGCATGA-3′. Deletion construct 3 containing amino acids 232–422 was generated by primers 5′CCCAAGCTTCACCATGGACAGCCACCACA-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCATGGGCATGA-3′. Deletion construct 4 containing amino acids 291–422 was generated by primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTCACCATGGACAGAGCCTCCT-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCATGGGCATGA-3′. Deletion construct 5 containing amino acids 1–290 was generated by 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGTGTGTCAGCCTCACT-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCACCTCCTTTGAAT-3′. Deletion construct 6 containing amino acids 1–231 was generated by primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGTGTGTCAGCCTCACT-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCAGTAGCTGGC-3′. The vector pRC/CMV was digested with HindIII and XbaI and ligated with digested TOSO PCR products. All of the plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α strain (Invitrogen) and extracted by an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Generation of TOSO Stably Transfected Cell Lines—TOSO-negative Jurkat cells were transfected with pRC/CMV-TOSO that contains the full-length mTOSO cDNA and a neo G418-resistant cassette by eletro-poration with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 260 V, 960 microfarads according to the manufacturer's instruction. As a negative control, the cells were transfected with the vector pRC/CMV. To determine the mRNA expression of transfected mouse TOSO gene, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed. The clones were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) 72 h post-transfection for 2 weeks. Individual lines were obtained by limiting dilution and screened by PCR with primers specific for mTOSO gene: 5′-CGTAAGGATGTATCTGTGTC-3′ and 5′-CTATGACTCCAGAAGAGCTG-3′. The correct sequence was verified in three selected clones with vector-specific primers by DNA sequencing on an ABI prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Cell Culture and Transfection—The human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line 293 was propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human T lymphoma Jurkat cells were propagated and maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere. The cells were transfected with Effectin reagent (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—The HEK 293 cell line was found to be TOSO-negative but expressed the Fas cell surface protein. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pRC/CMV-TOSO-HA by Effectin reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were cultured on six-well, covered chamber slides. At 36 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with wash buffer (1% Triton in PBS), specimens were incubated with blocking solution (1%Triton, 1% nonfat milk, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Specimens were incubated with either 0.1% (v/v) mouse anti-Fas antibody Clone DX2 (PharMingen) or rabbit anti-HA9 antibodies (Clontech) for 1 h at 37 °C. After three 5-min washes with wash buffer at room temperature, secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag) or rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes) were applied and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the specimens were subjected to confocal fluorescent microscopy. Apoptosis Induction and Measurement—Transiently or stably transfected Jurkat cells and primary T cells extracted from mice spleens were treated with or without various concentrations of one or more of the following reagents: soluble recombinant human Fas Ligand (Alexis, Carlsbad, CA), the agonistic anti-Fas antibody JO2 (PharMingen), human recombinant TNF-α (Sigma), or recombinant TRAIL (Alexis) for different time periods at fixed concentration or different concentrations for various time durations as indicated in the figures. For TNF-α- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, the cells were co-treated with 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide (Sigma). For glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, purified primary T lymphocytes from mouse spleens were treated with dexamethasone (Sigma). 5 × 105 cells seeded in 96-well plates were treated with various concentrations (10-5–10-8m) Dexamethasone diluted from a 10-2m solution stored in ethanol or with 1:10000 dilution of ethanol alone as vehicle control for 12–24 h. Following the various treatment protocols, the cells were washed in PBS, stained with propidium iodide and annexin V conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate in binding buffer (PharMingen) and subjected to FACS analysis on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) cytometer. Caspase-8 Activity Assay—Caspase-8 activity was measured by ApoAlert caspase-8 Assay (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells treated with or without FasL for various periods were lysed, and the supernatant was mixed with reaction buffer containing IETD-pNA as the calorimetric substrate. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined at various time points following initiation of reaction. Fold decrease in caspase-8 activity was calculated by subtracting the background reading (cell lysates and buffers) from the reading of induced and uninduced samples. In Vitro GST Pull-down Assays—Plasmids containing full-length mTOSO or various deletions of mTOSO protein were transcribed and translated in vitro. In vitro translation was performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-FADD (gift from Dr. Marcus E. Peter, University of Chicago) was transformed into bacteria and induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. GST-FADD fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated with in vitro translated proteins for 2 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (PBS (1% Triton, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The beads were then washed five times in binding buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The bands were visualized by autoradiography. Generation of lck-mTOSO Transgenic Mice—mTOSO cDNA was inserted into the BamHI site of the p1017 expression vector containing the lck proximal promoter (33Chaffin K.E. Beals C.R. Wilkie T.M. Forbush K.A. Simon M.I. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The 6.9-kb NotI fragment containing lck proximal promoter, mTOSO, and human growth hormone fragment was then injected into (C57Bl/6 × DBA)F1 blastocysts and implanted into pseudo-pregnant mice. Founder mice were initially screened by PCR analysis of tail DNA using primers specific for human growth hormone gene (hGH) (5′-TAGGAAGAAGCCTATATCCCAAAGG-3′ and 5′-ACAGTCTCTCAAAGTCAGTGGGG-3′). The transgene-positive lines were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis probed by 32P-labeled hGH fragment generated by PCR using the primers listed above (Random Prime Labeling; Amersham Biosciences). Expression of mTOSO in lymphocytes of transgenic mice was confirmed by Northern blot analyses. These mice were bred and maintained in the animal facility at the University of Southern California School of Medicine with the approved Animal Care and Use Committee protocol. Isolation of Primary T Cells—Primary T cells from transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates were extracted from spleens of 7–9-week-old mice by grinding the tissue with the plunger of 1-ml sterile syringe and were then suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium (10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES buffer, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) (Invitrogen). Spleen cells were treated with a hemolysis buffer (17 mm Tris-HCl and 140 mm NH4Cl, pH 7.2) to remove red blood cells. Adherent cells were separated by incubation for 1 h on a 10-cm dish. To prepare splenic T cells, nonadherent cells were passed through a nylon wool column. Statistical Analyses—All of the experiments were performed at least three times. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. The significance of the difference between experimental and control groups was analyzed with Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The mouse TOSO cDNA obtained from mouse spleen lymphocytes encodes a 422-amino acid protein that shares a 57.7% homology with the 390-amino acid-long human TOSO protein (Fig. 1A). On the nucleotide level, a 70.2% homology exist between the mouse and the human TOSO cDNAs (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, analysis of Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot displayed striking similarity of mouse TOSO to human TOSO. Computer analysis of mTOSO protein indicated a leader sequence corresponding to amino acids 1–17 and a transmembrane domain spreading from amino acids 258 to 286. It was also predicated by computer analysis that mTOSO is a type I membrane protein with an intracellular C-terminal domain. The predicated molecular mass of mTOSO is about 47 kDa. The cytoplasmic region has a basic amino acid-rich region and an acidic amino acid-rich region. The extracellular domain has homology to the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) domains. The cytoplasmic region has partial homology to FAST kinase. Mouse TOSO Is a Cytoplasmic Membrane Protein—To determine the predicted subcellular localization of mTOSO, confocal microscopic analysis was performed by immunostaining HA-tagged TOSO. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pRC/CMV-TOSO-HA, which encodes C-terminally tagged mouse TOSO driven by CMV promoter. At 36 h post-transfection, mTOSO was detected by rabbit anti-HA Ab and visualized with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) on the cell surface (Fig. 2, middle image). As a control, the endogenous cell surface protein Fas was detected in these cells by mouse anti-human Fas Ab (DX2), and stained with Alexa Fluor 568 (red) (Fig. 2, left image). The overlapping of Fas and TOSO localizations is shown in the merged image (Fig. 2, right image). These results confirm the predicated cell surface localization of mouse TOSO. Furthermore, the super-imposed images of mTOSO and the Fas protein support the co-localization of these two molecules. Mouse TOSO Protects Jurkat Cells from Fas/FasL- and TNF-induced Apoptosis—Transfection experiments were performed to test the effects of mTOSO on apoptosis. TOSO-negative Jurkat cell line was stably transfected with pRC/CMV-mTOSO, containing the full-length mTOSO cDNA and a neo G418-resistant cassette. As a negative control, the cells were transfected with vector pRC/CMV. As shown in Fig. 3A, three positive clones (Cl-1, Cl-2, and Cl-3) express mTOSO mRNA, whereas parental Jurkat cells, and three negative clones (Cl-4, Cl-5, and Cl-6) that were transfected with the vector only do not express the transfected gene. To test whether ectopic expression of mTOSO could protect cells from apoptosis, stably transfected clones, control clones, and parental Jurkat cells were treated with various concentrations of FasL (0–100 ng/ml) for up to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3 (B and C), clones with stable expression of mTOSO significantly protected cells from FasL-induced apoptosis as compared with parental Jurkat cells and control lines. The effect was time-dependent (Fig. 3B) and dose-dependent (Fig. 3C). Similarly mTOSO protected Jurkat cells from apoptosis induced by TNF-α in the presence of cyclohexamide (Fig. 3D). TRAIL/Apo2L is another member of TNF superfamily that induces apoptosis through engagement of death receptors. Jurkat cells are susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, as shown in Fig. 3E, mTOSO expressing Jurkat cell lines were as susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis as the TOSO-negative Jurkat cells. Mouse TOSO Inhibits Caspase-8 Activation—The extrinsic apoptotic signal triggered by binding of FasL to Fas is transduced through the sequential assembly of DISC, which is composed of adaptor protein FADD and procaspase-8 (11Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar); therefore, the activity of the apical molecule caspase-8 in this pathway was examined. Stably transfected mTOSO expressing clone (Cl-3) cells, along with the control clone (Cl-4) cells, were treated with various concentrations of FasL for different periods of time. The activation of caspase-8 was determined by enzyme assays measuring its protease activity capable of cleaving substrate IETD-pNA. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of mTOSO significantly suppressed the activity of caspase-8, compared with control cells transfected with vector only. Mouse TOSO Binds Specifically to FADD through Its C-terminal Domain—The activation of pro-caspase 8 is attained by being recruited to FADD molecule (13Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) and subsequent formation of DISC complex (11Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar, 16Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Therefore, the disruption of FADD and caspase-8 binding by mTOSO could be one of the potential mechanisms of how mTOSO executes its anti-apoptotic function. To test this hypothesis, in vitro protein binding assays were performed. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated full-length mTOSO protein (lane 3) binds to immobilized GST-FADD protein (lane 8), whereas it did not bind to GST (lane 5). Furthermore, the addition of unlabeled mTOSO competed with the binding of 35S-labeled mTOSO (lane 10), whereas the addition of vector plasmid did not compete with the 35S-labeled mTOSO (lane 9), indicating the binding specificity between mTOSO and FADD molecules. To further determine the specific domain in mTOSO involved in binding, various deletion mutations of mTOSO were also studied in the GST-FADD pull-down assays. As illustrated in Fig. 6A construct 1 represents full-length protein (a.a. 1–422), construct 2 (a.a. 16–422, representing the protein without the signal peptide), construct 3 (a.a. 232–422, including the transmembrane and intracellular domain), construct 4 (a.a. 291–422, containing the C-terminal tail of the protein only), construct 5 (a.a. 1–290, lacking the C-terminal portion of the molecule), and construct 6 (a.a. 1–231, lacking the transmembrane and the entire intracellular domain of the molecule). The various deletion constructs were translated in vitro and [35S]methionine-labeled (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6C demonstrates the binding of the different constructs to immobilized GST-FADD and GST, respectively. The results indicate that the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of mTOSO, but not the extracellular N-terminal domain, was required for binding. Even the construct expressing only the tail portion of the cytoplasmic domain (lane 6) shows specific binding to GST-FADD. Primary T Cells Isolated from TOSO Transgenic Mice Are Resistant to Fas/FasL-induced Apoptosis—To confirm the relevance of mTOSO in regulating lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo,we produced transgenic mice that overexpress mTOSO in peripheral lymphocytes. Peripheral lymphocyte expressing mTOSO transgenic mice were established by injecting full-length cDNA of the mTOSO gene construct under the proximal lck promoter. Systematic characterization of these transgenic mice is ongoing and will be published separately. However, for the purpose of the present study, primary T cells were isolated from transgenic and nontransgenic littermates and evaluated for their capability to undergo apoptosis. Although primary mouse T lymphocytes are known to be resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, they are susceptible to Fas/FasL-induced as well as glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (17Cidlowski J.A. King K.L. Evans-Storms R.B. Montague J.W. Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 457-490PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 T lymphocytes overexpressing mTOSO were significantly more resistant to FasL- or anti-Fas Ab (Jo2)-induced apoptosis than T cells obtained from nontransgenic littermates. Fig. 7B shows dose-dependent curves obtained from four transgenic and three nontransgenic littermate mice treated with FasL. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the susceptibility of these T cells to apoptosis induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Fig. 7A shows cell death when treated with dexamethasone at 10-5 and 10-6m, respectively. These results support the specificity of mTOSO in regulating lymphocyte apoptosis. Several years ago Hitoshi et al. (15Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) cloned a human molecule that was capable of specifically inhibiting apoptosis induced by certain members of the TNF receptor family. As a reflection of the predicted importance of this molecule in protecting lymphocytes from apoptosis, the investigators named the molecule TOSO after the Japanese liquor “that is drunk on New Year's Day to celebrate long life and eternal youth” (15Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, no additional publications followed the original paper, suggesting perhaps a very short life of the molecule in the scientific literature. We have taken, therefore, a systematic approach in characterizing the mouse homologue of TOSO to first verify and confirm the suggested importance of this molecule. In this article, we report the cloning and characterization the mouse homologue of the human TOSO gene (15Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The 422-amino acid mouse TOSO has 57.7% homology with the 390-amino acid human TOSO. The analysis of Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot displayed striking similarity of mouse TOSO to human TOSO, both having a hydrophilic leader sequence and a transmembrane domain. To directly demonstrate the cell membrane localization of mTOSO, we conducted immunostaining and confocal microscopy experiments, whereas the C-terminal HA-tagged mTOSO was visualized on cell membrane surfaces (Fig. 2). Also, the deletion mutation studies of mTOSO by in vitro protein binding assays confirm that mTOSO is indeed a type I membrane protein where its C-terminal is involved in FADD binding (Fig. 6). To study the function of mouse TOSO, we established stably transfected Jurkat cell lines. Clones that contain transfected mTOSO gene significantly protected cells from FasL-induced apoptosis compared with the control Jurkat cells (Fig. 3). These results not only revealed that we had successfully cloned the functional mouse homologue of TOSO, but also it unequivocally demonstrated that mTOSO inhibits apoptosis induced by FasL. In accordance with the notion that the Fas pathway shares some factors mediating the signal transduction with TNF-α signaling, our results show that mTOSO also protects cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Because caspase-8 is the apical molecule in these pathways, we therefore examined whether the activation of this molecule was suppressed upon apoptosis triggering. Indeed, the caspase-8 activity in Jurkat cells expressing mTOSO was significantly inhibited compared with control Jurkat cells that do not express mTOSO. On the other hand, results indicate that expression of mTOSO in Jurkat cells does not protect cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results are somewhat surprising given that FADD and caspase 8 have been shown to associate with the endogenous TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 (3Thorburn A. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 18Kuang A.A. Diehl G.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 14: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the apparent involvement of TOSO in DISC formation is illustrated by the present study. However, other investigators have found that a FADD-independent pathway links TRAIL to caspases. Thus, ectopic expression of a dominant negative mutant of FADD, inhibited Fas-induced cell death, but did not block apoptosis triggered by TRAIL (22Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Donahue C.J. Ruppert S. Bauer K.D. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 750-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Unlike Fas, TNF receptor 1, and DR3, the TRAIL receptor DR4 could not use FADD to transmit the death signal (23Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FADD-deficient embryonic fibroblasts were susceptible to DR4-induced apoptosis but were resistant to Fas-, TNF receptor 1-, and DR3-induced cell death (24Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). An extra layer of complexity is added by the fact that except Fas, other TNF family receptors depend on additional intermediate proteins rather than direct binding to FADD. For instance, TNF receptor 1, DR3, and DR6 bind to the intermediate protein TRADD, which functions as the docking site for FADD (2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 25Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). In particular, DAP3 is the intermediate protein that links DR4 and DR5 to FADD in TRAIL-induced apoptosis (26Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, our observations support the notion that multiple pathways involving other yet to be determined factors exist in TRAIL-triggered apoptosis (27Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Ramakrishnan L. Gray C.L. Baker K. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A. Science. 1997; 277: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Hitoshi et al. (15Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) postulated that human TOSO inhibits caspase-8 activation through increasing mRNA level of cFLIP, which disturbs DISC formation (28Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, rapid assembly of DISC complex that is detectable 60 min after Fas induction in Jurkat cells and within 30 min in SKW6.4 B lymphoblastoid cells (28Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 29Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar) argues against such mechanism given the much longer time necessary for transcription and translation of cFILP. In contrast, a faster response mechanism in which a pre-existing factor TOSO inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis through the disruption of DISC complex formation and consequently the inhibition of caspase-8 activation is more likely to be the modus operandi. Based on the results obtained in this study, Fig. 8 is our present model of the mechanism of how mTOSO executes its anti-apoptotic function. Thus, we propose that TOSO binds via its C-terminal tail directly to FADD and thus interferes with the recruitment of pro-caspase 8 to FADD molecule and/or its activation. Furthermore, Fas receptor DISC immunoprecipitation experiments have shown a stable ligand-receptor complex that contains FADD and caspase-8 (2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). It is therefore believed that this initial caspase activation event occurs at the cell membrane. The localization of mTOSO to the cell membrane (Fig. 2) supports our proposal that the signaling event induced by TOSO occurs also at the cell membrane. Lastly, the anti-apoptotic function of mTOSO was confirmed in primary lymphocytes from mice that overexpress mTOSO under the lck promoter. Primary T cells from mTOSO transgenic mice showed enhanced resistance to FasL or agonistic anti-Fas Ab stimulation. This effect seems to be highly specific, because these same T lymphocytes were still sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. The importance of the Fas/FasL apoptotic pathway in vivo is underscored by the fact that mice that have a recessive mutation in Fas (lpr) (30Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar) or in the FasL (gld) (31Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Suda T. Nagata S. Cell. 1994; 76: 969-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar) develop fatal systemic autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation (32Cohen P.L. Eisenberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). In this respect it is noteworthy that TOSO knock-out mice are embryonically lethal. Therefore, we hope that further analysis (in progress) of the TOSO overexpressing transgenic mice will yield more insight into the function of TOSO in vivo. Given the importance of maintaining a proper balance of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals in the immune system, these studies will be able to determine whether TOSO can be a potential therapeutic target for pharmacological manipulation of autoimmune diseases. We thank Dr. Marcus E. Peter for the GST-FADD construct, Drs. Michael Li and Louis DuBeau for valuable discussions and helpful comments during the course of this work, and Yi Liu and Lily Li for expert technical assistance. We are grateful to the University of Southern California transgenic core facility for help in establishing the TOSO transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2135446642,"Human protease-activated receptor-1 (hPar1) plays a role in malignant and physiological invasion processes. We have identified a functional androgen response element (ARE) located in the hPar1 promoter upstream of the transcription start site at -1791 to -1777. Dihydrotestosterone treatment of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP increased endogenous hPar1 mRNA levels, consistent with the threefold increase in promoter activity of hPar1-luciferase reporter construct. Specific binding of the hPar1-derived ARE to LNCaP nuclear extracts was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This binding was abrogated by antiandrogen receptor (anti-AR) antibodies or excess cold oligonucleotide but not by a mutated oligonucleotide. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we confirm the in vivo interaction between the AR and ARE domain of the hPar1 promoter. In parallel, we show that hormone ablation therapy markedly reduces the otherwise high hPar1 expression levels in prostate cancer biopsy specimens. We suggest that the hPar1 gene is regulated transcriptionally by androgens, representing one of several target genes effectively reduced during hormone ablation therapy. A major limitation of hormonal deprivation is that it causes only a temporary remission, and the cancer eventually reappears in a more malignant, androgen-independent form. hPar1 is also overexpressed in CL1 cells, an aggressively metastasizing, hormone-independent subclone of LNCaP, and in PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma lacking AR in a mechanism yet to be fully elucidated. These data may imply that hPar1 expression correlates with prostate cancer progression in androgen-dependent and -independent phases and therefore, provides an instrumental, therapeutic target for treatment in prostate cancer."

The NPC1gene encodes a 1278-amino acid integral membrane protein involved in the sub-cellular trafficking of lipids. The exact biological function of NPC1 remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that NPC1 is a eukaryotic member of the RND permease family of transport proteins, which when expressed in bacteria is capable of transporting fatty acids. The goal of this project was to assess the role of NPC1 in the transport of fatty acids in primary human fibroblasts using normal fibroblasts and fibroblasts from patients with three lysosomal storage diseases: NPC, mucolipidosis IV, and Sandhoff disease. If NPC1 is a fatty acid transporter, we expect to find fatty acid accumulation only in NPC fibroblasts. We used three experimental approaches to assess the role of NPC1 as a fatty acid transporter. First, we evaluated the accumulation versusmetabolism of low density lipoprotein-derived oleic acid. Second, we assessed the amount of free fatty acid present after growth in lipoprotein-containing media. Third, we assessed the cellular accumulation of acriflavine, a fluorescent substrate for a number of resistance-nodulation-cell division permease transporters. Our results indicate that fatty acid flux through NPC1-deficient lysosomes is normal.

NPC is caused by mutations in either the NPC1(95% of clinical cases) or NPC2(5% of clinical cases) genes; the phenotype resulting from mutations in either gene is identical (1Patterson M.C.

McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 2625-2640Google Scholar). Symptoms of NPC can present at various points in development, and they include seizures, dystonias, ataxia, and a hallmark vertical gaze palsy (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki M.T. Morris J.A. Carstea E. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie J.E. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases for Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 2625-2640Google Scholar). Currently, there is no effective therapy for NPC. A key step in the development of therapeutics for this disease is likely to be a better understanding of the function of the NPC1 protein. NPC1 is a 1278-amino acid membrane protein found in late endosomes and lysosomes (2Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It contains 13 transmembrane domains, a sterol sensing domain, an NPC domain containing a leucine zipper, and a C-terminal lysosomal targeting sequence (3Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A. Brown A. Kaneski C.R.

Mutations leading to NPC disease occur throughout the protein, and the majority of patients are compound heterozygotes (4Greer W.L. Dobson M.J. Girouard G.S. Byers D.M. Riddell D.C. Neumann P.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1252-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Park W.D. O'Brien J.F. Lundquist P.A. Kraft D.L. Vockley C.W. Karnes P.S. Patterson M.C. Snow K. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations in NPC1 have been well studied in fibroblasts, where mutations lead to defective lipid trafficking and lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. Despite knowledge of the physical characteristics of the protein and its effects on cellular lipid transport, the exact function of the NPC1 protein remains elusive. It is clear that NPC1 is involved in the trafficking of lipids in the endosomal/lysosomal system; however, it is not clear how NPC1 exerts this effect. The first indication of a specific function that could be ascribed to NPC1 came from bioinformatics analysis, which showed that NPC1 is structurally similar to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family of prokaryotic permeases (6Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.N. Goffeau A. Saier Jr, M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar, 7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). RND permeases serve as proton-dependent efflux pumps, which extrude hydrophobic drugs, heavy metals, lipooligosaccharides, and antibiotics (6Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.N. Goffeau A. Saier Jr, M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar). When human NPC1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, it was found to mediate the transfer of an RND permease substrate, acriflavine, as well as a fatty acid, oleic acid, but not cholesterol, or cholesterol oleate (7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). NPC1-mediated fatty acid flux made some physiological sense, because fatty acids are released by late endosomal and lysosomal digestion of lipoproteins and membrane constituents; however, no studies have been conducted in mammalian cells to confirm that NPC1 transports fatty acids. The goal of this study was to address the hypothesis that endogenous NPC1 functions as a fatty acid transporter in human fibroblasts. This study was conducted in normal and NPC human skin fibroblasts. If NPC1 functions as a fatty acid transporter in normal cells, then we would expect fatty acids to accumulate in late endosomes and lysosomes of NPC cells. We also examined fibroblasts from patients with other lysosomal storage diseases to distinguish between lysosomal fatty acid accumulation specific for NPC1 dysfunction versussecondary accumulation due to lipid accumulation. No other lysosomal storage disease has an identical storage profile to NPC; however, two had similar attributes. One attribute of NPC that sets it apart from the other lysosomal storage diseases is that NPC results from a mutation in a protein involved in trafficking, whereas most other lysosomal storage diseases result from a mutation in a metabolic enzyme. Therefore, mucolipidosis IV (MLIV) was chosen as a control fibroblast because it shares this attribute with NPC1. The protein mutated in MLIV, mucolipin, is involved in intracellular trafficking of endocytosed lipids (8Chen C.S. Bach G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A second attribute of NPC that we considered is the fact that neuronal abnormalities in NPC closely resemble those of primary gangliosidoses. Thus we chose a primary gangliosidosis, Sandhoff disease, as our second control cell. We used three approaches to test the hypothesis that NPC1 is a fatty acid transporter. First, we evaluated the accumulation of LDL-derived oleic acid in normal and NPC1 fibroblasts. Second, the amount of free fatty acid present in the four fibroblast cultures after growth in lipoprotein-containing media was assessed. Third, we assessed the accumulation of acriflavine, a fluorescent substrate for a number of RND permease transporters, in normal, NPC, MLIV, and Sandhoff fibroblasts. Our results indicate that fatty acid flux through NPC1-deficient lysosomes is normal. Materials—The acyl-CoA/cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor CI-976 was obtained from Pfizer. [9,10-3H]Triolein (52.6 Ci/mmol) and [4-14C]cholesteryl oleate (56 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Invitrogen. Cholesteryl [9,10-3H]oleate (60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Tissue culture reagents were from Mediatech Cellgro or Fisher. Tetramethylrhodamine dextran (Mr70,000) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Nunc Lab-Tek Chambered Cover Glasses were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Cultured Cells, Preparation of LDL, Lipoprotein-deficient Serum, Media, and [3H]CO-LDL—Normal (GM05659D), NPC1 (GM3123A), MLIV (GM02408), and Sandhoff (GM11707) fibroblasts were purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was prepared by ultracentrifugation (9Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared as described, omitting the thrombin incubation (9Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The following media were prepared: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin (D-10% FCS); and D-10% FCS in which 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum was replaced with 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum (D-10% LPDS). [3H]CO-LDL was prepared with an average specific activity of 3700 dpm/nmol (10Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4861-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of [3H-T]LDL—Reconstitution of LDL with [3H]triolein (r[3H-T]LDL) was prepared by reconstituting LDL with [3H]triolein as described previously (11Krieger M. Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4093-4101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.9 mg of LDL was frozen and lyophilized in a starch tube. LDL core lipids were extracted twice with 5 ml of cold heptane. 100 μCi of [9,10-3H]triolein and 6 mg of cold triolein in 200 μl of heptane were added to the LDL. The solvent was evaporated, and the sample was resuspended in 300 μl of Tricine buffer, pH 7.3, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The starch was removed from the r[3H-T]LDL by centrifugation once at 750 × gand twice at 12,000 × gin a microcentrifuge. The r[3H-T]LDL had an average specific activity of 300,000 dpm/μg of protein. Uptake and Metabolism of LDL-derived [3H]Triolein or Cholesteryl [3H]Oleate—Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well in D-10% FCS. Cells were washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution and refed D-10% LPDS 48 h prior to the start of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, cells were pulsed with ∼20 μg/well r[3H-T]LDL or [3H]CO-LDL and 20 μmACAT inhibitor for 4 h. After the pulse, cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffered saline solution and new medium was added. The media were collected, and the cells were trypsinized for the 0-h time point. The remaining cells were incubated for 24 h, and then the media were collected and the cells were trypsinized. A 200-μl aliquot of each 1-ml cell sample was removed for protein determination (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids from the media and cells were extracted using the Bligh-Dyer method (13Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). 10 μl of recovery standard containing 100 μg of cholesteryl oleate, 50 μg of triolein, 100 μg of oleic acid, 25 μg of lecithin, and 4,200 dpm of [14C]cholesteryl oleate were added to each sample during the extraction. Labeled cellular and media lipids were analyzed by TLC developed with hexane:ethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (130:30:2). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting in ReadySafe. Gas Chromatography—For each fibroblast culture, a confluent 75-cm2flask was trypsinized and the cells seeded into six 150-mm dishes in D-10% FCS. Cells were cultured until confluent, with refeeding of D-10% FCS twice a week. On the day of harvest, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and pelleted in three-dish aliquots. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to a modified Bligh and Dyer extraction (13Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Briefly, to each cell sample, we added 2 ml of methanol, 1 ml of chloroform, 10 μg of nonadecanoic acid (Matreya, Inc.), 1 ml of chloroform, and 1 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride, with vortexing after each addition. The pH was adjusted to 3 with 3 nHCl, after which the samples were vortexed and subjected to centrifugation (2000 × g, 10 min). The bottom organic phases were transferred to a new tube, and the top aqueous phases re-extracted with chloroform:methanol (7.4:1). Bottom organic phases for each sample were pooled and dried under nitrogen. Samples were subjected to TLC on plastic-backed silica gel 60 plates developed with hexane:ethyl ether:formic acid (80:20:2). The RFof free fatty acids was determined by iodine staining of flanking standard lanes; sections of the TLC plates were cut out, placed in a test tube with 1.5 ml of 1% sulfuric acid in methanol, and heated for 10 min at 50 °C (14Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis. 3rd Ed. The Oily Press, Bridgwater, England2003Google Scholar). Two milliliters of 5% sodium chloride was added, and the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane, and the hexane extracts were backwashed with water and dried under nitrogen. Fatty acid methyl esters were quantified on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph using a Supelcowax 10 capillary column (30 m, 0.25-mm internal diameter, Supelco, Inc.). The oven temperature was maintained at 150 °C for 2 min, ramped at 10 °C/min to 200 °C, and held for 4 min, then ramped again at 5 °C/min to 240 °C and held for 3 min, and then finally ramped at 10 °C/min to 270 °C, where it was held for 5 min. The injector and flame ionization detector were maintained at 260 °C and 280 °C, respectively. Carrier gas flow rate was maintained at a constant 0.8 ml/min throughout. Peaks were identified by comparing retention times to known fatty acid methyl esters (Matreya, Inc.). Acriflavine Efflux—Cells were plated in 4-well coverglass slides in D-10% FCS and grown to 60–80% confluency. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml acriflavine for 30 min, rinsed with media, and refed D-10% FCS. At the indicated time points, slides were rinsed three times with media after which phenol-free DMEM was added to each well. Slides were viewed immediately using an Axiovert inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Photographs were taken with a Hamamatsu Orca cooled-charge-coupled device camera and evaluated using Metamorph 5.0 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). Cholesterol Esterification—Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells/well in D-10% FCS. Cells were washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution and refed D-10% LPDS 48 prior to the start of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, cells were pulsed with varying concentrations of LDL overnight. Cells were pulsed for 2 h with [3H]oleate (13,000 dpm/nmol). Lipids were isolated with hexane: isopropanol (3:2). A recovery standard containing 20 μg of cholesteryl oleate, 10 μg of triolein, and 2300 dpm of [14C]cholesteryl oleate was added to each sample. Labeled cellular lipids were analyzed by TLC developed with heptane:ethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (90:30:1). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting in ReadySafe. Microscopy of Acriflavine/Dextran-labeled Cells—Cells were plated in 4-well coverglass slides in D-10% FCS and grown to 60–80% confluency. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml acriflavine for 30 min, rinsed with media, and refed D-10% FCS for 3.5 h. Dextran was added at 5 mg/ml to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were rinsed with media, and full serum media was added for 2 h. Phenol-free DMEM was added to the wells, and cells were viewed as described above. Color was added to the black and white digital images using the Metamorph software. Microscopy of Acriflavine/Filipin-labeled Cells—Cells were plated in 4-well coverglass slides in D-10% FCS and grown to 60–80% confluency. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml acriflavine for 30 min, rinsed with media, and refed D-10% FCS for 4 h. Filipin was added at 25 μg/ml in phenol-free DMEM for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with media, phenol-free DMEM was added, and cells were viewed as described above. Microscopy of Dextran/Filipin-labeled Cells—Cells were plated in 4-well coverglass slides in D-10% FCS and grown to 60–80% confluency. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated with 5 mg/ml dextran at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were washed with media and incubated in full serum media for 2 h. Filipin was added at 25 μg/ml in phenol-free DMEM for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with media, phenol-free DMEM was added, and cells were viewed as described above. Statistics—Statistical analyses were done using an unpaired Student's ttest. Oleic Acid Derived from LDL Does Not Accumulate in NPC1 Cells—In normal cells, LDL is endocytosed and transported to endocytic vesicles where its core lipids, such as cholesteryl linoleate, are hydrolyzed to release cholesterol and linoleic acid. In NPC1 cells, LDL-derived cholesterol accumulates to high levels in endosomes and lysosomes. If NPC1 is a fatty acid transporter, we would expect fatty acids to be sequestered in storage compartments along with the cholesterol, sphingomyelin, lysobisphosphatidic acid, neutral and acidic glycosphingolipids, and phospholipids that are found in NPC cells. To evaluate the flux of LDL-derived oleic acid, normal and NPC cells were incubated with either r[3H-T]LDL, in which the core lipids of LDL were replaced with [3H]triolein or with [3H]CO-LDL, in which the core lipids contained cholesteryl [3H]oleate. In both experiments, hydrolysis of the 3H-labeled core lipids by acid lipase in endosomes will lead to release of [3H]oleic acid (15Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Du H. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27180-27189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). [3H]Oleic acid sequestered within the late endosome/lysosome compartment should remain as cellular free fatty acid, whereas that which is transported from late endosomes and lysosomes may be incorporated into cellular lipids or effluxed from the cells. We have examined the amount of [3H]oleic acid that remains free, is incorporated into cellular lipids, or is released from the cells into the medium. Fig. 1Ashows cellular [3H]lipids in normal and NPC cells after 4 h of pulse with r[3H-T]LDL and no chase incubation. The cells had similar levels of [3H]triolein (white bars) indicating equivalent LDL uptake. Very little free [3H]oleic acid (gray bars) was present in either cell type; instead, equivalent amounts had been incorporated into [3H]phospholipids (shaded bars). The oleic acid was not incorporated into cholesterol esters (black bars) as a result of the presence of the ACAT inhibitor. There were no significant differences between normal and NPC values. After a 24-h chase incubation, the [3H]triolein had largely been hydrolyzed in both normal and NPC cells (Fig. 1B). Still the level of free [3H]oleic acid (gray bars) was close to zero in both cell types. [3H]Oleic acid released by [3H]triolein hydrolysis had been incorporated into phospholipids or released from the cells in amounts that were not significantly different in normal and NPC cells. Fig. 1Cshows the distribution of cellular and medium [3H]lipids after 24 h of chase, expressed as a percentage of the 0-h chase. The key point is that the distribution is equivalent in normal and NPC cells and media, and that only 1% of the [3H]oleate remained as cellular fatty acid. The bulk of the [3H]oleate was found as unhydrolyzed [3H]triolein, or had been hydrolyzed and re-esterified to [3H]triolein and [3H]phospholipids. Approximately 25% of free [3H]oleate was released into the media. Fig. 2shows that incubating the cells with [3H]CO-LDL instead of r[3H-T]LDL leads to a similar distribution of [3H]-oleic acid. After 4 h of incubation and no chase (Fig. 2A), most of the [3H]oleate was in unhydrolyzed cholesteryl [3H]oleate (black bars). Some has been incorporated into other cellular lipids. There was no buildup of free [3H]oleic acid (gray bars) in either cell type. After 24 h of chase (Fig. 2B), the amount of cholesteryl [3H]oleate had decreased. Some of the released [3H]oleic acid had been incorporated into phospholipids (shaded bars). There was also a release of unhydrolyzed cholesteryl [3H]oleate, free [3H]oleic acid, and [3H]phospholipids into the media. There was no significant difference in the levels of free [3H]oleic acid inside the normal and NPC cells (gray bars). It had been proposed that NPC1 functions as a fatty acid transporter (7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). If this is the case then [3H]oleic acid derived from LDL should accumulate in NPC late endosomes and lysosomes. It should not be incorporated into other lipids or effluxed from the cell as efficiently as in normal cells. Figs. 1and 2indicate that oleic acid is released from NPC endosomes and lysosomes, incorporated into other lipids, and effluxed from the cells at similar percentages to normal cells. There Is No Detectable Accumulation of Free Fatty Acid in NPC Fibroblasts—Fatty acids are released in the cell's endocytic compartment, not only due to hydrolysis of endocytosed lipoproteins, but also due to autophagy of cellular organelles, and digestion of membrane constituents. As stated above, if NPC1 facilitates fatty acid efflux from the late endosome/lysosome compartment, then NPC fibroblasts should have a buildup of free fatty acids, sequestered away from acyl-CoA-synthetase and other metabolizing enzymes, that is detectable by mass measurements. To determine whether NPC fibroblasts have a higher level of free fatty acids than normal fibroblasts, lipids were extracted from normal, NPC, MLIV, and Sandhoff fibroblasts cultured in D-10% FCS. Each sample contained ∼1.5 mg of cell protein. Free fatty acids were isolated and analyzed by gas chromatography. Levels were normalized for nonadecanoic acid, which was added during the extraction procedure. We found that the relative levels of fatty acids in NPC, MLIV, and Sandhoff fibroblasts were 69, 63, and 75% of that in normal fibroblasts, respectively (average of two experiments). If lipoprotein-derived fatty acids were sequestered preferentially in NPC fibroblasts, we would expect to find higher levels of linoleic acid in NPC cells; however, the fatty acid distribution was equivalent in the four cell samples (Table I).Table IContent of free fatty acids in fibroblastsExperimentFatty acidNormalNPCMLIVSandhoff% of total116:023.624.624.325.418:024.726.830.929.818:129.928.125.024.918:22.01.92.92.318:33.23.74.45.920:416.614.912.411.7216:025.123.421.320.618:023.326.630.225.918:129.226.623.831.318:22.02.94.02.718:34.36.15.64.720:416.114.415.114.8 Open table in a new tab Acriflavine Does Not Accumulate Specifically in NPC1 Cells—NPC1 was first identified as a eukaryotic member of the RND permease family based on its structural homology with other RND family members such as E. coliAcrB and Pseudomonas aeruginosaMexD (6Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.N. Goffeau A. Saier Jr, M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar). Functional evidence that NPC1 might be an RND permease came from acriflavine loading experiments. When fibroblasts are incubated with acriflavine, the cationic fluorescent dye binds to nucleic acids; it also accumulates in perinuclear vesicles. Davies et al.(7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) identified the punctate vesicles as endosomes and lysosomes by co-localization with LysoTracker. Upon washout, they found that the dye was more quickly extruded from the normal lysosomes than NPC1 lysosomes (7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Is this sequestration due to NPC1 dysfunction, or is it secondary to the presence of storage material in the compartments? To test this, acriflavine accumulation was assessed in normal, NPC, MLIV, and Sandhoff fibroblasts by fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 3shows that punctate acriflavine accumulation was not specific to NPC cells. After a 30-min incubation with acriflavine and no washout time, all cells contained nuclear fluorescence and some punctate fluorescence; however, the punctate fluorescence in normal cells (panel A) was less than that in the NPC (panel B), Sandhoff (panel C) and MLIV (panel D) cells. The greatest punctate fluorescence was seen in the MLIV cells. After 16 h of washout, all cells had similar punctate staining (panels E–H). These results indicate that accumulation of acriflavine is not specific to NPC cells. All three lysosomal storage disease fibroblasts have immediate and lasting punctate staining. MLIV and Sandhoff Fibroblasts Do Not Have an NPC Phenotype—NPC, MLIV, and Sandhoff fibroblasts showed similar punctate acriflavine accumulation (Fig. 3). To determine whether the acriflavine accumulation was due to NPC1 inhibition secondary to lipid storage in MLIV and Sandhoff lysosomes, we performed the classic diagnostic test for NPC activity, LDL stimulation of cholesterol esterification. Fig. 4shows that ACAT-catalyzed cholesterol esterification was low when cells were cultured in the absence of LDL and was increased in normal fibroblasts given LDL but not in NPC1 cells. Both MLIV and Sandhoff fibroblasts showed normal LDL stimulation of cholesterol esterification. From this we concluded that the acriflavine accumulation in these lysosomal storage disease fibroblasts is independent of NPC1 activity. Acriflavine Does Not Accumulate in the NPC1 Cholesterol Storage Compartment—The acriflavine that accumulates in perinuclear vesicles in NPC cells was proposed to be in endosomes and lysosomes due to co-localization with LysoTracker (7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We investigated the acriflavine compartment further by examining its co-localization with a fluid phase marker and with filipin fluorescence. NPC1 fibroblasts were incubated with acriflavine, washed, and then incubated with dextran for 15 min. Cells were washed, cultured for an additional 2 h, and then viewed immediately without fixation. We found that the acriflavine (Fig. 5A) and dextran (Fig. 5B) were not in the same compartments (Fig. 5C). This indicated that acriflavine was not sequestered in endocytic compartments. The same result was found when cells were incubated with dextran for 15 min to 2 h, indicating that acriflavine is not in early or late endocytic compartments. Next, NPC cells were incubated with acriflavine and then stained with filipin to identify the cholesterol storage compartments. We found that the acriflavine (Fig. 5D) and filipin staining (Fig. 5E) were not in the same vesicles (Fig. 5F). This result indicated that acriflavine was not sequestered in the NPC1-containing cholesterol storage compartment. Lastly, we incubated the NPC1 cells with dextran and then stained the cells with filipin to determine if the fluid phase marker (Fig. 5G) reached the cholesterol storage compartment (Fig. 5H). The results in Fig. 5Ishow that the dextran and filipin were found in the same vesicles. The results presented in Fig. 5indicate that acriflavine is not sequestered in the NPC1-containing lysosomes. In this study we used three different experimental approaches to address the hypothesis that NPC1 is a fatty acid transporter. It is generally accepted that NPC1 facilitates the transport of lipid cargo from late endosomes and lysosomes. Storage compartments isolated from NPC tissues show accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin, phospholipids, glycolipids, and gangliosides (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki M.T. Morris J.A. Carstea E. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie J.E. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases for Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 2625-2640Google Scholar). Lipid trafficking studies in cultured fibroblasts show delayed movement of cholesterol. It is not clear how NPC1 exerts this effect on lipid movement or whether lipid storage is a direct or indirect consequence of NPC1 dysfunction. One recent proposal is that NPC1 functions to clear late endosomes and lysosomes of fatty acids that are released by acid lipase digestion of lipoproteins (7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Fatty acids are generated in the endosomal/lysosomal system due to hydrolysis of lipoproteins and also due to autophagy of cell organelles and degradation of membrane constituents. In cultured cells, the bulk of the fatty acids released from lysosomes is effluxed into the media, whereas the remaining fatty acids are incorporated into triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters (16Groener J.E. Bax W. Poorthuis B.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2271-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If NPC1 were responsible for the movement of fatty acids out of lysosomes, there should be a buildup of free fatty acids that are trapped in lysosomes as well as a decrease in the fatty acids incorporated into triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters or released into the media. To test this hypothesis, we chose NPC fibroblasts GM3123 with a classic phenotype: no LDL-stimulated cholesterol esterification (17Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17002-17008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and greatly delayed movement of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes to plasma membrane (18Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In our first experimental approach, the fate of LDL-derived fatty acids in NPC cells was evaluated. We found that LDL-derived fatty acids were incorporated into cellular lipids in similar amounts in normal and NPC cells. Additionally, similar amounts of the fatty acids were released into the media from both cell types. These results indicate that mutations in NPC1 did not prevent LDL-derived fatty acids from leaving the late endosomes and lysosomes. Our second approach looked directly at the mass of free fatty acids in normal and NPC cells. We found that NPC cells did not have increased levels of free fatty acids. Furthermore, normal and NPC cells had equivalent levels of free linoleic acid, the predominant fatty acid released by hydrolysis of LDL-derived cholesteryl esters (10Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4861-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our third approach looked at the accumulation of an RND permease substrate, acriflavine, in the four cell types. Acriflavine had previously been shown to accumulate in perinuclear vesicles in NPC GM3123 fibroblasts (7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We wished to determine if the sequestration resulted specifically from NPC1 dysfunction. Most lysosomal storage diseases accumulate multiple substrates. Some are primary and result from a blockage in a metabolic pathway, whereas others appear to be secondary. Lysosomal sequestration of acriflavine could occur because it is a substrate for NPC1 transporter activity, or it may accumulate secondarily either due to lipid accumulation or a trafficking defect. To test these possibilities, we examined NPC1 fibroblasts alongside two other lysosomal storage disease fibroblasts. We chose MLIV because, like NPC, it derives from mutation in a protein involved in endocytic trafficking (8Chen C.S. Bach G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We also chose Sandhoff fibroblasts, a GM2 gangliosidosis with a lipid accumulation similar to NPC. Our data show that the lysosomal storage disease fibroblasts initially sequester more acriflavine than normal; however, that equalizes with time. There was little difference in the acriflavine accumulation in NPC, Sandhoff, and MLIV fibroblasts, although MLIV cells consistently have the brightest fluorescence. These data indicate that acriflavine does not accumulate specifically in NPC cells. How do our results differ from those of previous work? Our results in fibroblasts indicate that dysfunctional NPC1 does not lead to aberrant fatty acid efflux from late endosomes and lysosomes and reduced incorporation into other lipids; however, prior experiments in macrophages indicated that either NPC1 mutation or U18666A treatment results in a decreased incorporation of LDL-derived oleic acid into phospholipids (19Leventhal A.R. Leslie C.C. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8084-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with other fibroblast studies indicating that progesterone and imipramine, which act like U18666A to block the NPC-mediated pathway, do not prevent the release of fatty acids from lysosomes (16Groener J.E. Bax W. Poorthuis B.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2271-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was noted in this latter study that progesterone, but not imipramine, stimulated incorporation of oleic acid into triacylglycerol at the expense of incorporation into phospholipids. It is possible that the discrepancy in the role of NPC1 in fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids is due in part to the different cell types. Another possibility is that there is a difference in fatty acid utilization based on its mode of entry into the cell. A previous study indicated that there is a difference in oleic acid incorporation into different phospholipids based on whether the oleic acid was derived from LDL-triolein or LDL-cholesteryl oleate (20Teruya J. Cluette-Brown J. Szczepiorkowski Z.M. Laposata M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 266-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, we found no difference in the utilization of oleic acid by normal or NPC1 fibroblasts when we used LDL-cholesteryl [3H]oleate instead of LDL-[3H]triolein. Previous work implicating NPC1 as a fatty acid transporter relied on three lines of evidence. First, the structural similarity between NPC1 and RND permeases suggested that NPC1 was a member of the RND family of transport proteins (6Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.N. Goffeau A. Saier Jr, M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar). This similarity is striking, and it seems likely that NPC1 is a member of this family of transporters. Nevertheless, members of this family transport many different substrates, and the structure does not suggest which substrate(s) NPC1 might transport. Our results do not dispute the possibility that NPC1 is a eukaryotic member of the RND permease family but they do indicate that acriflavine is not an NPC1 substrate. The second line of evidence is based on studies in a model system of E. coli-expressing human NPC1. The experiments with this model, in which E. colihave a leaky outer membrane, indicate that NPC1 transports oleic acid but not cholesterol. E. coliexpress a number of endogenous RND permeases that work in concert with membrane fusion proteins and outer membrane factors, and to facilitate movement of substrates across both membranes and the periplasmic space (21Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, NPC1 is located in the late endosome membrane, and putative substrates of NPC1 would only need to cross one membrane. In the modified E. colienvironment, which is different from the normal environments of NPC1 as well as endogenous E. coliRND permeases, one cannot be certain that substrates found in this model are in fact endogenous substrates for NPC1. It is also possible that NPC1 is able to transport fatty acids in mammalian cells, but that this function is not the only method by which cells mobilize fatty acids from late endosomes and lysosomes. The third line of evidence suggesting that NPC1 is a fatty acid transporter is based on accumulation of acriflavine, a cationic dye, in lysosomes of NPC fibroblasts (7Davies J. Chen F. Ioannou Y. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our data in the same fibroblasts suggest that acriflavine accumulation is not specific for NPC1 mutations and that acriflavine is not accumulating in the same compartment as cholesterol in NPC cells. Taken together, the results of our three experimental approaches indicate that NPC1 dysfunction does not result in a build up of fatty acids in human fibroblasts. The results do not dispute the idea that NPC1 is a member of the RND family of proteins, only that NPC1 is not solely responsible for the efflux of fatty acids from late endosomes and lysosomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that any NPC1 fatty acid efflux activity is unlikely to play a role in NPC disease pathology and that NPC1 is an RND permease with an unidentified endogenous substrate We thank Kathleen Riley and the Center for Gastroenterology Research on Absorptive and Secretory Processes (P30 DK34928) for excellent assistance with the fluorescence microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2013764354,"Cataract is a common cause of blindness and results from destruction of the microarchitecture of the lens. It is observed in many genetic syndromes, infections, inflammatory diseases and during aging. Fluctuations in lens density and light scattering by altered refraction index form the physical basis for this process, but the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Increased levels of gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 have been reported for cataract-associated disorders such as eye inflammation and diabetes. We demonstrate that incubation of lenses with gelatinase B leads immediately to cataract. In complete eye extracts, betaB1 crystallin was identified as the major gelatinase B substrate by combination of proteomics, mass spectrometry, and Edman degradation analysis. The cleavage of betaB1 crystallin was also observed in vivo after endogenous gelatinase B-induction by the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 in wild-type mice but not in gelatinase B-/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W2130367127,"The BARD1 gene is mutated in a subset of breast and ovarian cancers, implicating BARD1 as a potential tumor suppressor. BARD1 gains a ubiquitin E3 ligase activity when heterodimerized with BRCA1, but the only known BRCA1-independent BARD1 function is a p53-dependent proapoptotic activity stimulated by nuclear export to the cytoplasm. We described previously the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of BARD1, and in this study, we identify the transport sequences that target BARD1 to the nucleus and show that they are essential for BARD1 regulation of the cell cycle. We used deletion mapping and mutagenesis to define two active nuclear localization signals (NLSs) present in human BARD1 that are not conserved in rodent BARD1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the primary bipartite NLS abolished BARD1 nuclear import and caused its cytoplasmic accumulation. Using flow cytometry and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation assays, we discovered that transiently expressed BARD1 can elicit a p53-independent cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, and that this was abrogated by mutation of the BARD1 NLS but not by mutation of the nuclear export signal. Thus, BARD1 regulation of the cell cycle is a nuclear event and may be linked to its induced expression during mitosis and its possible involvement in the DNA damage checkpoint."

To investigate the bf Qi domain, we constructed the mutation R214H, which substitutes histidine for a conserved arginine in the cytochrome b6 polypeptide of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. SPCC 7002. At high light intensity, the R214H mutant grew ∼2.5-fold more slowly than the wild type. Slower growth arose from correspondingly slower overall turnover of the bf complex. Specifically, as shown in single flash turnover experiments of cytochrome b6 reduction and oxidation, the R214H mutation partially blocked electron transfer to the Qi site, mimicking the effect of the Qi site inhibitor 2-N-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide. The kinetics of cytochrome b6 oxidation were largely unaffected by hydrogen-deuterium exchange in the mutant but were slowed considerably in the wild type. This suggests that although protonation events influenced the kinetics of cytochrome b6 oxidation at the Qi site in the wild type, electron flow limited this reaction in the R214H mutant. Redox titration of membranes revealed midpoint potentials (Em,7) of the two b hemes similar to those in the wild type. Our data define cytochrome b6 Arg214 as a key residue for Qi site catalysis and turnover of the cytochrome bf complex. In the recent cytochrome bf structures, Arg214 lies near the Qi pocket and the newly discovered ci or x heme. We propose a model for Qi site function and a role for Arg214 in plastoquinone binding.

The most widely accepted model to explain the mechanism of bc-bf complexes is the “Q cycle” hypothesis of Mitchell (13Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). This scheme, as modified by Crofts et al. (14Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and others (for example see Ref. 15Osyczka A. Moser C.C. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), postulates both an oxidation of plastoquinol and a reduction of plastoquinone at two distinct sites within the protein, the Qo and Qi sites, located on opposite, positive and negative sides of the membrane. Plastoquinol oxidation at the Qo site involves transfer of electrons to both a high potential chain (the Rieske ISP, cytochrome f, and plastocyanin or cytochrome c6) and a low potential chain (hemes bL and bH and plastoquinone at the Qi site) as illustrated in Fig. 1. Plastoquinol oxidation releases two protons into the lumen, and plastoquinone reduction at the Qi site picks up two protons from the stromal space (reviewed in Refs. 5Kallas T. Bryant D.A.

A movement of the quinol molecule has also been predicted, based on the location within the Qo site of residues responsible for inhibitor resistance (reviewed in Ref. 12Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M.

These partners then move apart to reduce hemes bL and c1 (equivalent to heme f in the bf complex), respectively. The recent three-dimensional structures of cytochrome bf complexes (9Kurisu G.

Thus, under oxidizing conditions, plastoquinol at the Qo site reduces cytochrome bL, which in turn reduces cytochrome bH. A second turnover places both bL and bH in a reduced state causing the reduction of a plastoquinone to plastoquinol at the Qi site and proton uptake from the stromal space. This model has been confirmed experimentally for cytochrome bc complexes, mainly from results obtained with the inhibitor antimycin (26Degli Esposti M. de Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnello T.

Inhibitors of the cytochrome bf Qi site have been identified, but none are completely effective. The inhibitor NQNO (29Jones R.W. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 258-268Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which seems to operate by a mechanism similar to that of antimycin, only partially blocks electron flow (29Jones R.W. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 258-268Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Joliot P. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 211-222Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, the redox midpoint potentials of the b hemes differ in bc and bf complexes (reviewed in Ref. 6Hauska G. Schütz M. Büttner M. Ort D.R. Yocum C.Y. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar). Thus, the equilibrium between heme bH and the Qi site quinone lies in favor of the latter in bc complexes and the former in cytochrome bf complexes (16Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Crofts A.R. Wraight C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 149-185Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This suggests that although two electrons can be injected consecutively onto the quinone molecule in bc complexes, the transfer must occur essentially in a concerted manner in cytochrome bf complexes (16Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Crofts A.R. Wraight C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 149-185Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Finally, the additional heme near the Qi domain of bf complexes suggests that the mechanism of quinone reduction may be very different from that in cytochrome bc complexes. Based on its ligation properties, Stroebel et al. (10Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) have suggested that the new heme belongs to the family of the penta-coordinate high spin c hemes. Both the algal (10Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and cyanobacterial (9Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) structures suggest that the ci (or x) heme may be involved in electron flow from heme bH to the Qi plastoquinone and cyclic flow from photosystem I.No functional evaluation of the cytochrome bf Qi site mechanism has yet been obtained because mutations of this site have not been available from oxygenic, photosynthetic organisms. Prior to elucidation of the cytochrome bf crystal structures, we have initiated a molecular genetic study to probe the mechanism of quinone reduction in the cytochrome bf complex. Although loss-of-function mutations are not allowed in cyanobacterial bf complexes (reviewed in Ref. 5Kallas T. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of the Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 259-317Google Scholar), the feasibility of generating stable mutations within this complex in cyanobacteria is now well established (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Yan J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20925-20933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To dissect the catalytic mechanism of the Qi site, we generated mutation R214H in the PetB, cytochrome b6, polypeptide of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. This changes a conserved arginine in the cytochrome bf complex to a histidine that is the conserved, corresponding residue near the Qi pocket of cytochrome bc complexes. The converse H217R mutation in the bc complex of Rhodobacter capsulatus increases the binding affinity of the Qi semiquinone, increases the amplitude of b heme reduction, and slows electron transfer through the complex (33Gray K.A. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We report here that the PetB R214H mutation in Synechococcus decreases the overall growth and cytochrome bf turnover rates, slows electron transfer across the membrane between the two b hemes, and thus defines a key residue for quinone-reductase (Qi site) function in cytochrome bf complexes. These data are interpreted in light of the bc and bf structures, and a model is proposed for Qi site catalysis in the cytochrome bf complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSCyanobacterial Cultures—Stock cultures of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 were grown under cool white fluorescent lamps (20–30 μmol photons m-2 s-1) in medium A as described previously (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). R214H mutant cultures were supplemented with streptomycin (Sm) and spectinomycin (Sp) at 50 μg/ml. For growth rate determinations, mid-log phase cells were inoculated into medium A (bubbled with 1% CO2 in air) and incubated at 39 °C and 250 μmol photons m-2 s-1 light intensity. Cell density was determined by direct turbidity measurements on 18-mm-diameter culture tubes in a Spectronic 20D spectrophotometer (Milton Roy, Rochester, NY). Cultures for assays were grown at 200–250 μmol photons m-2 s-1 light intensity and harvested at mid-log phase. Chlorophyll concentrations were determined as described in Ref. 34Zhang L. Pakrasi H.B.

Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) is wild type for petB but carries the same Sm/Sp resistance cassette upstream of petB as in the R214H mutant. The BstUI strain was used as a control in some experiments. Its salient properties are indistinguishable from the wild type.Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Synechococcus petB Gene—Escherichia coli strains were grown in LB medium supplemented as needed with 150 μg/ml of ampicillin, 15 μg/ml tetracycline, or 25 μg/ml each of Sm and Sp as described previously (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Standard molecular genetic manipulations were performed as in (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pA6.2 carrying the Synechococcus petBD genes was used for site-directed mutagenesis of petB as described in Ref. 31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. The petB R214H mutation was created by means of the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CCACTTCCTCATG/ATtCaTAAGCAAGGTATTTC-3′. The lowercase letters identify the modified bases (wild type ATC CGT > ATt CaT in the R214H mutant), and the underlining indicates the newly created HinfI restriction site tag. The R214H mutation in plasmid pA6.2 was verified by plasmid isolation from E. coli transformants, PCR amplification from the primers TK-1 (5′-GACAGAGCAAGCTGTGTTAC-3′) or TL-F (5′-ACGATCACCGTTTCCTTC-3′) and TK-2 (5′-AGCCATCGCCACCGGACGAC-3′) (locations shown in Fig. 2), and restriction tests for the HinfI tag.Fig. 2Strategy for site-directed mutagenesis and characterization of mutants by allele-specific PCR. A illustrates the allele replacement strategy used to introduce mutant petB genes into the Synechococcus genome (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutant petB alleles on a nonreplicating plasmid (top line) integrate into the genome via homologous recombination. Transformants are initially selected for Sm/Sp resistance. B shows allele-specific PCR tests of putative R214H transformants. Lanes 2–11 show DNAs from transformants amplified from wild type (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) and R214H mutant-allele detection primers (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). Each pair of lanes (lanes 2 and 3; lanes 4 and 5; lanes 6 and 7; lanes 8 and 9; and lanes 10 and 11) contains one of five different DNA templates. The PCR product at 510 bp in lanes 3 and 11 (marked by arrows) and its absence in lanes 2 and 10 indicate that two of five transformants tested were segregants in which the petB R214H allele had replaced the wild type allele.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plasmid pA6.2-R214H carrying the petB R214H mutation was introduced into Synechococcus by transformation (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because this plasmid cannot replicate in Synechococcus, selection for Sm/Sp resistance forces integration into the genome of the Sm/Sp resistance cassette and flanking petBD sequences as illustrated in Fig. 2. Integration of the petB-R214H mutation and segregational loss of the wild type petB allele were confirmed by: (i) PCR amplification of petB from Synechococcus transformants and restriction tests for the HinfI tag as described above for E. coli, (ii) allele-specific PCR detection of the petB-R214H allele according to Ref. 31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar as shown in Fig. 2B, and (iii) DNA sequencing of petB PCR products from the TL-F and TK-2 primers. Forward primers for allele-specific PCR were 5′-CCACTTCCTCATGATCCG-3′ (for detection of wild type petB) or 5′-CCCACTTCCTCATGATtCa-3′ (for detection of the mutant petB-R214H allele). Both were used with the reverse primer, TK-2. DNA sequencing reactions were sent to the University of Wisconsin Madison Biotechnology Center for analysis.Spectroscopic Measurements—Turnover of the cytochrome bf complex was monitored by measuring the rate of reduction of cytochrome f/c6 following a saturating 40-ms light pulse as described previously (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Zhang L. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5036-5042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Time-resolved absorbance changes were measured in the α-band region (530–570 nm) of the cytochromes. Because the spectra of cytochromes f and c6 are largely superposed, and transfer between them is rapid, no effort was made to monitor these carriers separately (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To improve the signal to noise ratio, the measurements were averaged with an interval between flashes of 7–10 s. The cells were suspended at 1–5 μm chlorophyll in reaction medium containing 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm NaHCO3, at 39 °C. Prior to recording data, samples were light adapted by exposure to a series of saturating light flashes. The data shown are averages from three samples.Single turnover experiments were performed at room temperature, using a “Joliot-type” spectrophotometer (36Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Actinic flashes were provided by a xenon lamp (3 μs at half-height) filtered through a Schott filter (RG 695). Flashes were fired at a frequency of 0.15 Hz and were nonsaturating (hitting ∼ 20% of the reaction centers) unless otherwise indicated. Cyanobacteria were kept in the dark under an argon atmosphere in a large reservoir, connected to the measuring cuvette, to ensure dark reduction of the plastoquinone pool. Cytochrome b6 redox changes were evaluated as the difference between absorption at 563 nm and a base line drawn between 545 and 573 nm. At intervals following an actinic flash, the transmission of weak, monochromatic light passing through the sample was measured relative to a reference sample shielded from actinic light. Data were expressed as the difference (ΔI) in light transmission between the sample and reference cuvettes, normalized to light transmission (I) by the reference cuvette as in (36Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Barbagallo R.P. Breyton C. Finazzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26121-26127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells were collected in the exponential phase of growth and resuspended in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 20% Ficoll (w/v) to prevent cell sedimentation. 3-(3′,4′-Di-chloroprenyl)-1–1-dimethylurea and hydroxylamine were added at concentrations of 10 μm and 1 mm, respectively, to block photosystem II activity. Alternatively, the cells were harvested and resuspended in the same buffer containing D2O (99.8% D atom) with a pellet/buffer volume ratio of 1/10 and stirred for 1 h. After a second centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, with a pellet/buffer volume ratio of 1/20. No increase in the kinetic isotope effect was observed when the duration of the incubation in D2O was increased.Electrochemical Redox Titrations—Membranes of the Synechococcus R214H mutant were prepared and redox titrations performed in an electrochemical cell as described previously for wild type Synechococcus (38Baymann F. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Kallas T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10570-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl buffer containing the redox mediators anthraquinone 2-sulfonate (-225 mV), anthraquinone 1,5-disulfonate (-170 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (-145 mV), anthraquinone (-100 mV), 2,5-dihydroxy-2-benzoquinone (-60 mV), menadione (0 mV), and 1,4-naphthoquinone (+60 mV), each at a concentration of 100 μm. Cytochrome b6 absorbance spectra in the 540–580 nm range were recorded at ∼25-mV intervals from samples poised at electrical potentials of -200 mV to +35 mV. The cytochrome b6 peak absorbance values at 564 nm were plotted as a function of potential. The midpoint potentials of the b6 hemes were calculated by fitting these data to a sum of two Nernst equations (each n = 1) as in previous analysis of wild type Synechococccus (38Baymann F. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Kallas T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10570-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a global fit analysis was performed as in Ref. 38Baymann F. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Kallas T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10570-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, where the entire spectra were deconvoluted and fitted to a sum of Nernst curves. Both procedures yielded essentially identical results.RESULTSConstruction of the PetB R214H Mutant and Characterization of Growth—As stated, both photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport in cyanobacteria require the cytochrome bf complex, and therefore essential subunits cannot be inactivated (reviewed by Ref. 5Kallas T. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of the Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 259-317Google Scholar). Accordingly, the PetB R214H mutation was constructed by allele replacement (31Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2"

The possible interactions between selected and excluded genes cannot be readily studied in transgenic or knockout animals but may be addressed by crossing animals bred for opposite traits and studying the F2 offspring. Ninety-seven percent of Wistar-derived rats selectively bred for their voluntary low-alcohol consumption display a mutated nuclear allele of aldehyde dehydrogenase Aldh22 that encodes an enzyme with a low affinity for NAD+, whereas rats bred for high-alcohol consumption do not present the Aldh22 allele. This enzyme is inserted into mitochondria, where NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) regenerates NAD+. The possible influence of complex I on ALDH2 activity and voluntary ethanol intake was investigated. Homozygous Aldh22/Aldh22 rats derived from a line of high-drinker F0 females (and low-drinker F0 males) showed a markedly higher ethanol consumption (3.9=/-0.5 g x kg(-1) x day(-1)) than homozygous animals derived from a line of low-drinker F0 females (and high-drinker F0 males) (1.8+/-0.4 g x kg(-1) x day(-1)). Mitochondria of F2 rats derived from high alcohol-consuming females were more active in oxidizing substrates that generate NADH for complex I than were mitochondria derived from low alcohol-consuming females, leading in the former to higher rates of acetaldehyde metabolism and to a reduced aversion to ethanol. This is the first demonstration that maternally derived genes can either allow or counteract the phenotypic expression of a mutated gene in the context of alcohol abuse or alcoholism"

We engineered the two histidine ligands to the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster in the hyperthermophilic archaeal Rieske-type ferredoxin from Sulfolobus solfataricus to modify types and spacing of ligands and successfully converted the metal and cluster type at the redox-active site with a minimal structural change to a native Rieske-type protein scaffold. Spectroscopic analyses unambiguously established a rubredoxin-type mononuclear Fe3+/2+ center at the engineered local metal-binding site (Zn2+ occupies the iron site depending on the expression conditions). These results show the importance of types and spacing of ligands in the in vivo cluster recognition/insertion/assembly in biological metallosulfur protein scaffolds. We suggest that early ligand substitution and displacement events at the local metal-binding site(s) might have primarily allowed the metal and cluster type conversion in ancestral redox protein modules, which greatly enhanced their capabilities of conducting a wide range of unique redox chemistry in biological electron transfer conduits, using a limited number of basic protein scaffolds.

Natural selection allows the utilization of a limited number of protein scaffolds to produce proteins with different types of active sites for various biological catalysis, molecular recognition, and metabolic needs. Metal ions add new functionality to proteins, facilitating some of the most difficult biological catalytic reactions (1Holm R.H. Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem.

For this reason, design and engineering of a specific metal-binding site in natural and de novo protein scaffolds to promote new and specific functionalities are attractive targets in the field of basic and applied protein design research (4DeGrado W.F.

Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). In particular, the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are widely distributed over all living organisms and have been considered to be of early evolutionary origin (2Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E.

The mononuclear iron core is the simplest form of Fe-S redox sites, present in small modular proteins such as rubredoxin (Rd) 1The abbreviations used are: Rd, rubredoxin; ARF, archaeal Rieske-type ferredoxin; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; FT, Fourier transform.1The abbreviations used are: Rd, rubredoxin; ARF, archaeal Rieske-type ferredoxin; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; FT, Fourier transform. and desulforedoxin. These proteins have the iron atom coordinated in an approximately tetrahedral geometry to the sulfur atoms of four cysteinyl residues (1Holm R.H. Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). Other major forms of protein-bound Fe-S redox sites are polynuclear clusters (such as [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters) for which some specific synthesis/assembly enzymes are required for in vivo cluster formation and maturation steps (7Beinert H.

These sites are also found within complex metalloprotein molecules themselves where they form part of the internal electron transfer conduit to or from the catalytic site (e.g. in some membrane-bound respiratory complexes (11Trumpower B.L.

In contrast to regular plant- and vertebrate-type ferredoxins having complete cysteinyl ligations, the Rieske-type cluster has an asymmetric [2Fe-2S] core with the Sγ atom of each of the two cysteine residues coordinated to one iron site and the Nδ atom of each of the two histidine residues coordinated to the other iron site. The crystal structure of a mitochondrial Rieske protein domain fragment suggests that its cluster-binding loops have similar geometry as those found in the Rd and zinc ribbon scaffolds (17Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The presence of the two histidine ligands to the Rieske centers is considered to be essential in respiratory cytochrome bc complexes in which the protonation state of the histidine ligands plays a crucial role in the quinol-oxidizing Qo-site turnover (see Ref. 18Crofts A.R.

The expression vector, pET28a, was purchased from Novagen. Water was purified by a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore). Other chemicals mentioned in this study were of analytical grade.The nucleotide sequence determination was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method with an automatic DNA sequencer, ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). The DNA sequence was processed with the DNASIS v3.6 software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). The homology search against databases was performed with the BEAUTY and BLAST network service (24Worley K.C. Wiese B.A. Smith R.F.

The structural alignments were constructed using a Swiss-PdbViewer v3.7b2 (http://expasy.ch/spdbv/mainpage.htm).The arf gene coding for the ARF (ORF c06009, DDBJ accession number, AB047031) of S. solfataricus strain P-1 (DSM 1616T) has been cloned and sequenced (20Kounosu A.

For the double mutant (replacements of His-44 by cysteine and His-64 by cysteine (H44C/H64C)), PCR mutagenesis was carried out in a stepwise manner, with new sets of the following PCR primers: 5′-GGT GCG ATT TAT GCG GAT ATG AAT ATA GTC TTG AAA ACG GTG-3′ and 5′-CAC CGT TTT CAA GAC TAT ATT CAT ATC CGC ATA AAT CGC ACC-3′ for H64C, and 5′-GCA TAT TGT CCT TGT AAG GGA AGG AAT CTG G-3′ and 5′-CCA GAT TCC TTC CCT TAC AAG GAC AAT ATG C-3′ for H44C. For the H44I/K45C mutant (replacements of His-44 by isoleucine, and Lys-45 by cysteine) and the triple mutant (replacements of His-44 by isoleucine, Lys-45 by cysteine, and His-64 by cysteine (H44I/K45C/H64C)), PCR mutagenesis was carried out using pET28aARF and pET28aARF-H64C vectors as a template, respectively, with a new set of the following PCR primers: 5′-GCA TAT TGT CCT ATT TGC GGA AGG AAT CTG GAA TAT GGA GAG G-3′ and 5′-CCT CTC CAT ATT CCA GAT TCC TTC CGC AAA TAG GAC AAT ATG C-3′ for H44I/K45C. Each amplified PCR product was individually treated with DpnI, and transformed into E. coli HB101 competent cells. In each case, the nucleotide sequences of the resultant vectors were confirmed for both strands before subjecting to the second set of PCR mutagenesis.The pET28aARF vectors harboring the arf gene and its variants were transformed separately into the host strain, E. coli BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene). The transformants were grown overnight at 25 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100–200 μm FeCl3, and the recombinant holoprotein was overproduced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h at 25 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until use.Purification of each recombinant holoprotein having a hexahistidinetag at the N terminus was performed as described previously (20Kounosu A.

The recombinant holoprotein was further purified by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The purified recombinant holoprotein was stored at either 4 or –80 °C until use.Absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U3210 spectrophotometer or a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder. EPR measurements were performed by using a JEX-RE3X spectrometer equipped with an ES-CT470 Heli-Tran cryostat system and a Scientific Instruments digital temperature indicator/controller Model 9650 (25Iwasaki T.

Spin concentrations of purified recombinant proteins were estimated by double integration, with Cu-EDTA (0.1 mm) and Sulfolobus tokodaii sulredoxin (0.05 mm) (28Ankudinov A. Ravel B. Rehr J.J.

The slit width of the spectrometer is 80 μm, and a multiscan signal-averaging technique was employed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral data were processed using KaleidaGraph v3.51 (Synergy Software).Purified recombinant proteins were concentrated with a Centriprep-10 apparatus (Amicon) to ∼0.3–0.5 mm. Further concentration was achieved by placing the samples under a stream of dry argon gas. The resultant samples (∼1–2 mm), containing 30% (v/v) glycerol, were frozen in 24 × 3 × 2 mm polycarbonate cuvettes with a Mylar-tape front window for x-ray absorption spectra studies (19Cosper N.J.

X-ray absorption spectra at the iron K-edge were recorded at 10 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, beamline 7-3, with the SPEAR2 storage ring operating at 3.0 GeV and 60–100 mA. A Si (220) double crystal monochromator (with one crystal detuned to 50% reflected intensity for harmonic rejection) and an energy-resolving 30-element Ge solid state array detector (provided by the National Institutes of Health/Biological and Environmental Research Structural Molecular Biology Research Resource) were employed for data collection. Energies were calibrated using an internal iron foil standard, assigning the first inflection point to 7111.3 eV. All other data collection parameters were as reported previously (25Iwasaki T.

A scale factor (S 20) of 0.9 was used to fit experimental EXAFS amplitudes with those calculated by FEFF 8.2.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRational Design of an Archetypal Metal Site—Replacement of the two histidine ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of S. solfataricus ARF by cysteine residues (in the double mutant) largely impaired the cluster assembly in the recombinant variant protein (Fig. 2, a and d). The remaining [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin-type cluster in the purified double mutant (H44C/H64C) underwent irreversible decomposition of the cluster upon dithionite reduction (data not shown) and was unstable to heat treatment at 65 °C for 15 min. Similarly, replacement of His-44 (H44C, and H44I/K45C) resulted in impaired cluster assembly and iron binding, in contrast to H64C (20Kounosu A. Li Z. Cosper N.J. Shokes J.E. Scott R.A. Imai T.

The significantly higher stability of the wild-type ARF (20Kounosu A. Li Z. Cosper N.J. Shokes J.E. Scott R.A. Imai T. Urushiyama A. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12519-12528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) compared with the double mutant suggests natural optimization of the surrounding polypeptide for efficient [2Fe-2S] cluster insertion/assembly with the “two histidines-plus-two cysteines” coordination pattern in the Rieske-type protein scaffold, rather than complete cysteinyl coordination.In light of the structural similarity of the biological Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] clusters to the mononuclear iron center in Rd (17Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), which plays a central electron transfer function in the molecular oxygen-scavenging system in the hyperthermophiles (29Jenney Jr., F.E.

Chem. 2002; 7: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we replaced three residues (His-44, Lys-45, and His-64) in S. solfataricus ARF with cysteines and isoleucine (H44I/K45C/H64C) to mimic the mononuclear iron site in the Rd from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus (31Day M.W.

These mutations resulted in heterologous overproduction of a ruby-colored recombinant protein in E. coli, in stark contrast to the dark reddish purple color of the wild-type ARF (Fig. 2, a and c). The resultant triple mutant (H44I/K45C/H64C) was resistant to heat treatment at 65 °C for 20 min like the wild-type ARF but unlike the double mutant.The iron content in purified protein varies among preparations, and, in several cases, purified protein is enriched with zinc (50–70% zinc) when it is overproduced with a smaller amount of supplementary iron (∼50 μm or less) in the LB growth medium. Similar observations have been reported for recombinant Rds heterologously overproduced in E. coli in which zinc occupies the iron site (32Eidsness M.K. O'Dell J.E. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Robson R.L.

Therefore, this was not pursued in this study. We used the iron-enriched triple variant (prepared by supplying 150–200 μm FeCl3 in the growth medium during overexpression) in the following analyses.Mononuclear Iron Site Designed into the Rieske-type Protein Scaffold—The visible absorption and EPR spectra of the triple variant showed the presence of a high spin ferric iron site (Fig. 2, c and g). It displays a resonance at g = 9.22 associated with one principal direction of the lowest Kramers doublet (±1/2 or ±5/2) at 4.3 K and a number of features in the g = 3.9–4.7 range associated with the three principal directions of the ±3/2 doublet (Fig. 2g). These features are very similar to those reported for archaeal and bacterial Rds (34Xiao Z. Lavery M.J. Ayhan M. Scrofani S.D.B. Wilce M.C.J. Guss J.M. Tregloan P.A. George G.N. Wedd A.G. J. Am.

In accordance, the dithionite-reduced triple variant showed the expected bleaching of the visible absorption spectrum, as reported for Rds (data not shown).The resonance Raman spectrum at 77 K of the oxidized triple variant differs significantly from that of the wild-type protein (20Kounosu A.

Inhibition of AC by vasopressin is prevented by inhibition of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. We conclude that persistent inhibition of AC (probably AC-3) by vasopressin is mediated by inositol trisphosphate-evoked Ca2+ release causing activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7599-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ACs are also regulated by many additional signals including protein kinases, other G protein subunits, nitric oxide, membrane potential, and Ca2+ (3Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 4Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Front. Endocrinol. 2000; 21: 103-132Google Scholar). Because the isoforms differ in their regulation by these additional signals and each cell type expresses a different complement of AC isoforms, there is enormous potential for tailoring the cross-talk between AC and other signaling pathways to meet the specific needs of particular cell types. The effects of Ca2+ on AC activity are particularly significant because they allow interplay between two of the most important and ubiquitously expressed intracellular signaling pathways (3Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 7Cooper D.M.F. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Four isoforms of AC are regulated directly by Ca2+: AC-1 and AC-8 are stimulated by Ca2+-calmodulin, whereas AC-5 and AC-6 are inhibited by Ca2+. In addition, some isoforms are regulated by enzymes that are themselves Ca2+-regulated: AC-9 is inhibited by Ca2+-calcineurin (8Antoni F.A. Barnard R.J.O. Shipston M.J. Smith S.M. Simpson J. Paterson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28055-28061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and AC-1 and AC-3 are inhibited by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) IV and II, respectively (1Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 9Wei G. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For AC-3, regulation by CaMKII is probably more important than any direct effect of Ca2+, which, via calmodulin, potentiates stimulation of AC by forskolin or Gs but only at unphysiologically high [Ca2+] (9Wei G. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The effects of Ca2+ on AC also depend upon the source of the Ca2+ signal. In most cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores stimulates, by mechanisms that remain contentious, Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane via the so-called “capacitative Ca2+ entry” (CCE) pathway (12Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). The Ca2+ signals resulting from CCE have been shown to be most effective in inhibiting AC-5 and AC-6 (13Cooper D.M.F. Yoshimura M. Zhang Y. Chioni M. Mahey R. Biochem.

By contrast, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, whether mediated by IP3, ionophores, or inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases, is almost ineffective in regulating these isoforms of AC (10Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Fagan K.A. Graf R.A. Tolman S. Schaak J. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

This selective regulation of AC by CCE probably reflects the colocalization of some isoforms of AC and the Ca2+ channels that mediate CCE in caveolae or lipid rafts (19Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T.

Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CCE is not, however, universally associated with regulation of AC. Ca2+ entering via L-type Ca2+ channels effectively inhibits AC in cardiac myocytes (23Yu H.J. Ma H. Green R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 689-693PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulates it in cerebellar granule cells (24Cooper D.M.F. Schell M.J. Thorn P. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although in GH4C1 cells such Ca2+ signals are less effective than those evoked by CCE (18Fagan K.A. Graf R.A. Tolman S. Schaak J. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40187-40194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interactions between Ca2+ and cyclic nucleotides are important in regulating the activities of many cell types (25Bruce J.I.E. Straub S.V. Yule D.I. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Werry T.D. Wilkinson G.F. Willars G.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, such interactions are major determinants of both contractile activity and proliferation (27Wong S.T. Baker L.P. Trinh K. Hetman M. Suzuki L.A. Storm D.R. Bornfeldt K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34206-34212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ca2+ promotes contraction by stimulating phosphorylation of myosin light chain, whereas cGMP and cAMP, via their respective kinases, usually cause relaxation by either attenuating Ca2+ signals or by more direct interactions with the contractile machinery (28Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Woodrum D.A. Brophy C.M. Mol. Cell.

The importance of interactions between cyclic nucleotides and Ca2+ in controlling vascular smooth muscle is clear from the many clinically useful drugs that target the Ca2+ channels, guanylyl cyclases, or cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases of the cardiovascular system. A7r5 cells, a cell line originally derived from rat aorta (32Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), express at least three isoforms of AC (isoforms 3, 5, and 6) (33Webb J.G. Yates P.W. Yang Q. Mukhin Y.V. Lanier S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1545-H1552PubMed Google Scholar), and all three are directly (types 5 and 6) or indirectly (type 3) inhibited by Ca2+. A similar pattern of expression is found in vascular smooth muscle, where types 2–7 AC have been identified in different species, with AC-3 perhaps being particularly important (27Wong S.T.

In A7r5 cells, Arg8-vasopressin (AVP), via V1A receptors (37Thibonnier M. Bayer A.L. Simonson M.S. Kester M. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), stimulates phospholipase C and thereby both release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. The latter involves a complex interplay between different Ca2+ channels: AVP promotes opening of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (38Byron K.L. Lucchesi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7298-7307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and it can reciprocally regulate CCE and a noncapacitative Ca2+ entry (NCCE) pathway (39Moneer Z. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40Moneer Z. Dyer J.L. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given the importance of Ca2+-cAMP interactions in vascular smooth muscle, the evidence that not all Ca2+ signals are equally effective in regulating AC (7Cooper D.M.F. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and evidence that AVP inhibits AC in A7r5 cells (33Webb J.G. Yates P.W. Yang Q. Mukhin Y.V. Lanier S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1545-H1552PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to examine whether inhibition of AC in these cells was regulated selectively by distinct Ca2+ entry pathways. We unexpectedly found that inhibition of AC by AVP is mediated by release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and that the inhibition long outlasts the Ca2+ signal that initiates it. We suggest that the Ca2+ released through IP3 receptors selectively activates CaMKII leading to a relatively long lasting inhibition of AC activity. Our results demonstrate that an important interaction between two ubiquitous signaling pathways can be tuned selectively to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and that the interaction transduces a transient Ca2+ signal into a long lasting inhibition of AC. Materials—Alumina, ascorbic acid, AVP, carbamylcholine (CCh), GF 109203X (bisindoylmaleimide), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), isoprenaline, pertussis toxin, and most routine reagents were from Sigma. Ascorbic acid (0.8 mm) was always included with isoprenaline. Forskolin and nimodipine were from Tocris (Avonmouth, UK). Ro-31-8220, U73122 (1-[6((17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5 (10)-trien-17-yl)amino)-hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), U73122 (1-[6((17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl]-2,5-pyrroledione), and cAMP were from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). Dowex AG 50W-X8 (100–200 mesh) was from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Fluo4 AM and BAPTA-AM were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). [2,8-3H]Adenine (30 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell culture materials were from Invitrogen or Sigma (serum). Cell Culture—A7r5 cells, originally from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were grown in 12-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (1%) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Our initial intention had been to explore the relative effectiveness of Ca2+ entry via CCE and NCCE pathways in causing inhibition of AC, but we began our experiments (and then continued) using a variant of the cell line in which AVP neither inhibits CCE nor activates NCCE (39Moneer Z. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the cells used for this study, therefore, all AVP-evoked Ca2+ entry is mediated by CCE. Measurements of cAMP—For measurements of cAMP formation, cells were labeled with [3H]adenine. [3H]cAMP was then separated from [3H]ATP, [3H]ADP, and [3H]AMP using Dowex columns (to which cAMP adheres until eluted with water) and then alumina columns to which any residual [3H]ATP, [3H]ADP, and [3H]AMP adhere (41Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 42Farndale R.W. Allan L.M. Martin B.R. Milligan G. Cell Signalling: A Practical Approach. 1st Ed. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-103Google Scholar). When the cells were confluent, they were incubated with 1 μCi/well [3H]adenine in the same medium for at least 2 h. Immediately before an experiment, the labeling medium was removed and replaced with Hepes-buffered saline (HBS: 135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 11.6 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, at 20 °C). After two washes, the cells were incubated in HBS (or Ca2+-free HBS in which CaCl2 was replaced by 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm IBMX and appropriate inhibitors. Further additions (details in figure legends) were made after 5 min. To allow direct comparison with measurements of [Ca2+]i, all assays were performed at 20 °C. After an appropriate interval, the incubations were terminated by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration). [3H]ATP, [3H]ADP, and [3H]AMP were separated from [3H]cAMP by sequential elution from anion exchange (Dowex 50 equilibrated with 1 m HCl) and alumina columns (equilibrated with 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.5) (43Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar, 44Ho M.K.C. Wong Y.H. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 223-253Google Scholar). After 30 min on ice, the supernatants were loaded onto Dowex columns (1 ml): [3H]ATP (with [3H]ADP and [3H]AMP) was eluted in 3 ml of water, and after elution with a further 10 ml of water, the eluate was loaded onto a neutral alumina column from which [3H]cAMP was eluted with 100 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5. Levels of [3H]cAMP are expressed as percentages of [3H]ATP. Measurements of [Ca2+]i—A7r5 cells grown (as above) in 96-well plates were loaded with fluo4 by incubation with fluo4 AM (2 μm in fresh dimethyl sulfoxide, final concentration 0.2%) and 0.2 mg/ml Pluronic F-127 in HBS. After 1 h at 20 °C, the cells were washed three times with HBS, and then after 1 h in HBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (to allow complete hydrolysis of the indicator) the cells were again washed and used for experiments. For fluorescence measurements, the 96-well plate was mounted in a FlexStation (Molecular Devices), which allows up to three automated additions to each well. A xenon lamp provided the excitation light, and a scanning dual monochromator allowed control of excitation (485 nm) and emission (525 nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence was captured at 1-s intervals using SoftMaxPro software (Molecular Devices) and then averaged (over periods of 5 s). At the end of each experiment, fluorescence of the Ca2+-saturated indicator (Fmax) was determined for each well by addition of 10 μm ionomycin and CaCl2 (final free concentration 10 mm). The fluorescence recorded in the absence of Ca2+ (equivalent to autofluorescence because Ca2+-free fluo4 is not fluorescent) was determined on each plate by prolonged incubation (>10 min) of cells in at least 6 wells with 10 μm ionomycin in Ca2+-free HBS supplemented with 10 mm BAPTA. Autofluorescence was subtracted from all values before analysis. Fluorescence was calibrated to [Ca2+]i using Equation 1[Ca2+] i=Kd⋅F/(Fmax−F)(Eq. 1) where the Kd of fluo4 for Ca2+ is 345 nm; F and Fmax are the autofluorescence-corrected fluorescence recorded from the sample and after saturating the indicator with Ca2+. All results are reported as means ± S.E. Inhibition of AC by AVP Requires Activation of Phospholipase C—In the presence of 1 mm IBMX to inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, AVP, at concentrations (≤1 μm, 5 min) more than sufficient to stimulate release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores maximally, had no effect on cAMP levels (Fig. 1A). Under identical conditions, 5 min of incubation with forskolin caused a concentration-dependent (half-maximal effective concentration, EC50 ∼12 μm) stimulation of AC activity, and this was inhibited by AVP (Fig. 1A). A maximal concentration of AVP (1 μm) caused 33 ± 2% (n = 3) inhibition of the response evoked by 100 μm forskolin, and half-maximal inhibition (IC50) occurred with 0.89 ± 0.22 nm AVP (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when 10 μm isoprenaline, an agonist of β-adrenoceptors, was used to stimulate AC (Fig. 1A): AVP again caused a concentration-dependent inhibition (IC50 = 0.90 ± 0.3 nm). We have used forskolin and isoprenaline interchangeably to stimulate AC activity with indistinguishable results. The experiments reported here were performed over a substantial period during which the amplitude of the Ca2+ signals evoked by AVP varied by as much as 2-fold. All comparisons of the effects of AVP on AC and cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) were therefore performed in parallel experiments. AVP stimulated both release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1C). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, both the duration of the response and the maximal amplitude of the initial increase in [Ca2+]i (1.69 ± 0.05 μmversus 1.25 ± 0.09 μm) were reduced (Fig. 1C). The EC50 for AVP-evoked Ca2+ signals was similar in the presence (EC50 = 14 ± 3nm) and absence (36 ± 25 nm) of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1D), but significantly higher than the IC50 for inhibition of AC by AVP (Figs. 1B and 4A). Neither component of the Ca2+ response was affected by IBMX and forskolin (Fig. 1E) or isoprenaline (not shown). This is important because it allows the effects of Ca2+ on AC activity to be addressed without the complexity of cAMP affecting the Ca2+ signals. Treatment of cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 24 h to uncouple the G protein, Gi, from cell surface receptors, had no effect on the ability of AVP to inhibit AC activity, although it substantially reduced the effectiveness of CCh, an agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (Fig. 2A). We conclude, consistent with a previous report (33Webb J.G. Yates P.W. Yang Q. Mukhin Y.V. Lanier S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1545-H1552PubMed Google Scholar), that inhibition of AC by AVP is not mediated by Gi or any other pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Inhibition of AC by AVP was completely inhibited by 10 μm U73122, a selective inhibitor of phospholipase C (45Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar), although not by its inactive analog, U73343 (Fig. 2B). Nor did inhibitors of protein kinase C, GF 109203X (1 μm, Fig. 2B), or Ro 31-8220 (10 μm, not shown) prevent AVP from inhibiting AC. Indeed, and consistent with earlier work suggesting that protein kinase C tonically represses signaling from the AVP receptor (46Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 47Caramelo C. Tsai P. Okada K. Briner V.A. Schrier R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F46-F52PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of protein kinase C exaggerated the ability of AVP to inhibit AC. After preincubation with 10 μm Ro 81-3220 for 5 min, a maximal concentration of AVP inhibited forskolin-evoked AC activity by 57 ± 1% (n = 3, versus 35 ± 2% without inhibitor), although the sensitivity to AVP was unaltered (IC50 = 0.6 ± 0.2 nm). We conclude that inhibition of AC by AVP requires activation of phospholipase C but not protein kinase C, despite the presence in A7r5 cells of AC-6 (33Webb J.G. Yates P.W. Yang Q. Mukhin Y.V. Lanier S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1545-H1552PubMed Google Scholar), which is known to be inhibited by protein kinase C (48Lai H.-L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments, we therefore examined the role of Ca2+ in mediating the effects of AVP. Sustained Inhibition of AC by AVP Requires an Increase in Cytosolic [Ca2+]—Fig. 3 shows the time course of cAMP accumulation in the presence of forskolin and IBMX alone or with 100 nm AVP. As expected, cAMP continued to accumulate for at least 15 min in the presence of forskolin. After 2–3 min, the inhibitory effect of AVP had fully developed (∼30% inhibition). Thereafter, and despite further stimulation of AC by forskolin, AVP maintained that 30% inhibition (Fig. 3). The mechanism that links AVP to inhibition of AC therefore appears to take 2–3 min to become maximally active but then remains effective for at least 15 min after the addition of AVP. Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC by AVP, measured during a 5-min incubation, was unaffected by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Neither the maximal effect of AVP (52 ± 10% versus 48 ± 8% inhibition in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively) nor the sensitivity to AVP (IC50 = 2.9 ± 1.9 nmversus 1.2 ± 0.8 nm) was affected by removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). In cells loaded with 50 μm BAPTA-AM for 1 h in Ca2+-free HBS to buffer intracellular Ca2+, the Ca2+ signal evoked by AVP was abolished (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained when the intracellular stores were emptied by preincubation with 1 μm thapsigargin or 10 μm BHQ for 15 min in Ca2+-free HBS to inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps. In each of these situations, AVP failed to inhibit AC activity, although inhibition of AC by CCh, mediated by Gi, was unaffected (Fig. 4B). Although the Ca2+ release evoked by AVP inhibited AC, thapsigargin and BHQ were ineffective despite evoking peak Ca2+ signals larger than, and sustained Ca2+ signals similar to, those evoked by a maximal concentration of AVP (Fig. 4, D and E). These results establish that an increase in [Ca2+]i is required for AVP to inhibit AC and that AVP-evoked, but not thapsigargin-evoked, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores can mediate the inhibition. In subsequent experiments, we sought to establish whether release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores was uniquely capable of inhibiting AC or whether Ca2+ signals resulting from Ca2+ entry were also effective. Inhibition of AC by Ca2+Entry—Depolarization (by the addition of HBS containing 53 mm KCl in place of NaCl) stimulated an increase in [Ca2+]i which was prevented by 100 nm nimodipine or 10 μm verapamil and potentiated by 100 nm BAYK8644, confirming the involvement of L-type Ca2+ channels (39Moneer Z. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 49Byron K.L. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6945-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Although the peak [Ca2+]i evoked by L-type Ca2+ channels was significantly smaller than that evoked by a maximal concentration of AVP (0.31 ± 0.03 μmversus 1.7 ± 0.05 μm), it was comparable with the response evoked by ∼3 nm AVP, which did inhibit AC (Fig. 1, B and E). Nevertheless, depolarization had no significant effect on AC activity, whether stimulated by forskolin or isoprenaline (Fig. 5B). More importantly, neither nimodipine nor depolarization affected the inhibition of AC by AVP (Fig. 5B), despite modestly reducing (nimodipine) or increasing (depolarization) the amplitude of the initial AVP-evoked Ca2+ signals (Fig. 5C). These results establish that although AVP does stimulate Ca2+ entry via L-type Ca2+ channels, as reported by others (50Byron K.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this component of the Ca2+ signal does not effectively inhibit AC activity. Ionomycin (1 μm), which we previously used to empty intracellular Ca2+ stores rapidly (39Moneer Z. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), directly inhibited AC independent of its effects on intracellular Ca2+ (not shown). We therefore used prolonged pretreatment (15 min) with either 1 μm thapsigargin or 10 μm BHQ in Ca2+-free HBS to empty intracellular Ca2+ stores and so activate CCE. Restoration of Ca2+ then evoked an increase in [Ca2+]i the amplitude of which increased (to a maximum of 871 ± 89 nm, with 10 mm extracellular Ca2+) as a function of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6, A and B). Restoration of 1.5 mm Ca2+ to cells treated with thapsigargin caused [Ca2+]i to increase to 588 ±"

To understand the molecular basis of its cardiac regulatory functions, we investigated whether the primary structure of the H1-H2 domain in alpha-1 (alpha1) subunit of the enzyme plays a role in myocardial contractile regulation. Here we show that site-specific binding to this 1 H1-H2 domain with a targeted antibody (SSA78) markedly augments intracellular Ca2+ transients and contraction of rat ventricular cardiomyocytes without inactivating NKA. In vivo SSA78 infusion in mice results in a positive inotropic effect with enhanced contractile function yet no change in relaxation, indicating a direct cardiac effect linked to the H1-H2 domain. Competitive immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry reveal that SSA78 binding is antagonized by ouabain, supporting the interaction of SSA78 at one of the glycoside-effecter sites. These new findings suggest that the H1-H2 domain of 1 subunit of NKA is a critical determinant of enzyme biologic activity, which couples to enhanced myocyte calcium transient and inotropic action."
