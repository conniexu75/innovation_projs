https://openalex.org/W3125479368,"The nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may require governments to use privacy-encroaching technologies to help contain its spread. One technology involves co-location tracking through mobile Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth to permit health agencies to monitor people’s contact with each other, thereby triggering targeted social-distancing when a person turns out to be infected. The effectiveness of tracking relies on the willingness of the population to support such privacy encroaching measures. We report the results of two large surveys in the United Kingdom, conducted during the peak of the pandemic, that probe people’s attitudes towards various tracking technologies. The results show that by and large there is widespread acceptance for co-location tracking. Acceptance increases when the measures are explicitly time-limited and come with opt-out clauses or other assurances of privacy. Another possible future technology to control the pandemic involves “immunity passports”, which could be issued to people who carry antibodies for the COVID-19 virus, potentially implying that they are immune and therefore unable to spread the virus to other people. Immunity passports have been considered as a potential future step to manage the pandemic. We probe people’s attitudes towards immunity passports and find considerable support overall, although around 20% of the public strongly oppose passports."
https://openalex.org/W3122433605,"The formation of agricultural cooperatives has been widely promoted as an agricultural development policy initiative to help smallholder farmers cope with multiple production and marketing challenges. Using a nationally representative survey dataset of smallholder maize producers from rural Nigeria, this study assesses the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on technical efficiency (TE). We based our estimation approach on the combination of a newly developed sample selection stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to control for possible selectivity biases from both observables and unobservables. We estimate stochastic meta-frontiers to examine TE differences between cooperative members and non-members. Our results reveal that TE levels of members are consistently higher than that of non-members. This calls for continued policy incentives targeted at encouraging farmers to form as well as participate in agricultural cooperatives."
https://openalex.org/W3125071362,"The worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been a concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, because most people worked in self-isolation for fear of infection. We aimed to clarify the impact of social restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients and to identify risk factors associated with these symptoms. A cross-sectional, hospital-based survey was conducted from April 22, 2020 to May 15, 2020. PD patients and their family members were asked to complete paper-based questionnaires about neuropsychiatric symptoms by mail. PD patients were evaluated for motor symptoms using MDS-UPDRS part 2 by telephone interview. A total of 71 responders (39 PD patients and 32 controls) completed the study. Although there was no difference in the age distribution, the rate of females was significantly lower in PD patients (35%) than controls (84%) (P &lt; 0.001). Participants with clinical depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) were more common in PD patients (39%) than controls (6%) (P = 0.002). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an MDS-UPDRS part 2 score was correlated with the presence of clinical depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) and clinical anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 7) (clinical depression: OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04–1.66; P = 0.025; clinical anxiety: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07–1.72; P = 0.013). In the presence of social restrictions, more attention needs to be paid to the neuropsychiatric complications of PD patients, especially those with more severe motor symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3124991750,"A new distribution defined on (0,1) interval is introduced. Its probability density and cumulative distribution functions have simple forms. Thanks to its simple forms, the moments, incomplete moments and quantile function of the proposed distribution are derived and obtained in explicit forms. Four parameter estimation methods are used to estimate the unknown parameter of the distribution. Besides, simulation study is implemented to compare the efficiencies of these parameter estimation methods. More importantly, owing to the proposed distribution, we provide an alternative regression model for the bounded response variable. The proposed regression model is compared with the beta and unit-Lindley regression models based on two real data sets."
https://openalex.org/W3125428796,"Introduction Despite global recommendations for governments to implement a comprehensive suite of policies to address obesity, policy adoption has been deficient globally. This paper utilised political science theory and systems thinking methods to examine the dynamics underlying decisions regarding obesity prevention policy adoption within the context of the Australian state government initiative, Healthy Together Victoria (HTV) (2011–2016). The aim was to understand key influences on policy processes, and to identify potential opportunities to increase the adoption of recommended policies. Methods Data describing government processes in relation to the adoption of six policy interventions considered as part of HTV were collected using interviews (n = 57), document analyses (n = 568) and field note observations. The data were analysed using multiple political science theories. A systematic method was then used to develop a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) for each policy intervention. A simplified meta-CLD was generated from synthesis of common elements across each of the six policy interventions. Results The dynamics of policy change could be explained using a series of feedback loops. Five interconnected balancing loops served to reduce the propensity for policy change. These pertained to an organisational norm of risk aversion, and the complexity resulting from a whole-of-government policy approach and in-depth stakeholder consultation. However, seven virtuous reinforcing loops helped overcome policy resistance through policy actor capabilities that were improved over time as policy actors gained experience in advocating for change. Conclusion Policy processes for obesity prevention are complex and resistant to change. In order to increase adoption of recommended policies, several capabilities of policy actors, including policy skills, political astuteness, negotiation skills and consensus building, should be fostered and strengthened. Strategies to facilitate effective and broad-based consultation, both across and external to government, need to be implemented in ways that do not result in substantial delays in the policy process."
https://openalex.org/W3125807604,"The dynamics of soil microbial communities are important for plant health and productivity. Soil microbial communities respond differently to fertilization. Organic water soluble fertilizer is an effective soil improver, which can effectively improve soil nutrient status and adjust soil pH value. However, little is known about the effects of water soluble fertilizers on soil microbial community, and the combined effects on soil nutrients and sugarcane productivity. Therefore, this study sought to assess the effects of water soluble fertilizer (1,050 kg/hm 2 (WS1), 1,650 kg/hm 2 (WS2)) and mineral fertilizer (1,500 kg/hm 2 (CK)) on the soil microbial community, soil nutrients and crop yield of sugarcane. The results showed that compared with CK, the application of water soluble fertilizers (WS1 and WS2) alleviated soil acidity, increased the OM, DOC, and AK contents in the soil, and further improved agronomic parameters and sugarcane yield. Both WS1 and WS2 treatments significantly increased the species richness of microorganisms, especially the enrichment of beneficial symbiotic bacteria such as Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes, which are more conducive to the healthy growth of plants. Furthermore, we found that soil nutrient contents were associated with soil microbial enrichment. These results indicate that water soluble fertilizer affects the enrichment of microorganisms by improving the nutrient content of the soil, thereby affecting the growth and yield of sugarcane. These findings therefore suggest that the utilization of water soluble fertilizer is an effective agriculture approach to improve soil fertility."
https://openalex.org/W3121980158,"Background Early recognition of COVID-19 cases is essential for effective public health measures aimed at isolation of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–COV-2). The objective of this study was to describe characteristics, self-reported symptoms, and predictors of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based sample. Methods and findings This was a cross-sectional nationwide survey of adults in the US conducted between April 24 through May 13, 2020. The survey targeted a representative sample of approximately 5,000 respondents. The rate of COVID-19 cases and testing, most frequently reported symptoms, symptom severity, treatment received, impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health, and factors predictive of testing positive were assessed. Most of the 5,203 participants (85.6%) reported no COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the 747 (14.5%) participants reporting COVID-19-like symptoms, 367 (49.1%) obtained a diagnostic test. Eighty-nine participants (24.3%) reported a positive COVID-19 test result, representing 1.7% of the total sample. For those testing positive, the most common symptoms were dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing. Those who tested positive were more likely to report greater symptom severity versus those who tested negative. Severe dry cough, new loss of taste or smell, trouble waking up, living with someone experiencing symptoms, recent international travel, respiratory issues, and reporting ethnicity of Black or African American were predictive of testing positive. Conclusions This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 using community-level self-reported data across the US during the peak of most stay at home’ orders. Self-reported symptoms and risk factors identified in this study are consistent with the clinical profile emerging for COVID-19. In the absence of widespread testing, this study demonstrates the utility of a representative US community-based sample to provide direct-reported symptoms and outcomes to quickly identify high-risk individuals who are likely to test positive and should consider taking greater precautions."
https://openalex.org/W3121227347,"Multivariate statistical techniques, including cluster analysis (CA), discriminant analysis (DA), principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA), were used to evaluate temporal and spatial variations in and to interpret large and complex water quality datasets collected from the Shuangji River Basin. The datasets, which contained 19 parameters, were generated during the 2 year (2018–2020) monitoring programme at 14 different sites (3192 observations) along the river. Hierarchical CA was used to divide the twelve months into three periods and the fourteen sampling sites into three groups. Discriminant analysis identified four parameters (CODMn, Cu, As, Se) loading more than 68% correct assignations in temporal analysis, while seven parameters (COD, TP, CODMn, F, LAS, Cu and Cd) to load 93% correct assignations in spatial analysis. The FA/PCA identified six factors that were responsible for explaining the data structure of 68% of the total variance of the dataset, allowing grouping of selected parameters based on common characteristics and assessing the incidence of overall change in each group. This study proposes the necessity and practicality of multivariate statistical techniques for evaluating and interpreting large and complex data sets, with a view to obtaining better information about water quality and the design of monitoring networks to effectively manage water resources."
https://openalex.org/W3124263629,"The clinicopathological significance of altered SWI/SNF complex has not been well evaluated in gastric cancer (GC). We examined SMARCA2, SMARCA4, SMARCB1 and ARID1A expression by immunohistochemistry in 1224 surgically resected GCs with subtyping into Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), microsatellite instability (MSI) and non-EBV/MSI Lauren histotypes. SWI/SNF mutations were investigated using the GC dataset of the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas. Clinicopathological association was assessed by statistical analysis. There were 427 cases (35%) of SWI/SNF-attenuated GC, including 344 SMARCA2 (28%), 28 SMARCA4 (2%), 11 SMARCB1 (1%) and 197 ARID1A (16%) cases. Simultaneous alterations of multiple subunits were observed. Compared to SWI/SNF-retained cases, SWI/SNF-attenuated GC exhibited a significant predilection to older ages, EBV and MSI genotypes, higher lymphatic invasion and less hematogenous recurrence ( P &lt; 0.05). SWI/SNF attenuation was an independent risk factor for short overall survival ( P = 0.001, hazard ratio 1.360, 95% confidence interval 1.138–1.625). The survival impact stemmed from SMARCA2-attenuated GCs in stage III and non-EBV/MSI diffuse/mixed subtypes ( P = 0.019 and &lt; 0.001, respectively). ARID1A-lost/heterogeneous GCs were more aggressive in the EBV genotype ( P = 0.016). SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 loss was not restricted to rhabdoid/undifferentiated carcinoma. In the TCGA dataset, 223 of 434 GCs (52%) harbored deleterious SWI/SNF mutations, including ARID1A (27%), SMARCA2 (9%), ARID2 (9%), ARID1B (8%), PBRM1 (7%), and SMARCA4 (7%). SWI/SNF-mutated GCs displayed a favorable outcome owing to the high percentage with the MSI genotype. In conclusion, SWI/SNF-altered GCs are common and the clinicopathological significance is related to the genotype."

Methods Using the French national health database, we identified pregnancies ending with a birth between April 2010 and December 2018, in France. We studied prescription of antacids, antispasmodics, antinauseants, laxatives and antidiarrheals during pregnancy, between two trimesters before and two trimesters after delivery. We also assessed hospitalization for gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy. Results Among 6,365,471 pregnancies, 4,452,779 (74.0%) received at least one gastrointestinal drug during pregnancy; 2,228,275 (37.0%) received an antacid, 3,096,858 (51.5%) an antispasmodic, 1,861,731 (31.0%) an antinauseant, 919,116 (15.3%) a laxative and 617,808 (10.3%) an antidiarrheal. Prescription of proton pump inhibitors doubled from 12.2% in 2010 to 26.0% in 2018, while domperidone use decreased from 18.3% in 2010 to 2.2% in 2018. In addition, prescription of antacids increased from 7.0% during the trimester before pregnancy to 11.8% during the 1 st trimester, 17.0% during the 2 nd trimester and 23.4% during the 3 rd trimester. Antispasmodic use was 10.6% during the trimester before pregnancy, 23.1% during the 1 st trimester, 25.2% during the 2 nd trimester and 24.0% during the 3 rd trimester. Prescription of antinauseant drugs increased from 5.0% during the trimester before pregnancy to 25.7% during the 1 st trimester, then decreased to 6.4% during the 2 nd trimester and 3.2% during the 3 rd trimester. Nausea/vomiting was the most common cause of hospitalization for gastrointestinal symptoms or diseases during pregnancy, although it accounted for only 1.0% of pregnancies. Conclusions Approximately three-quarters of women use drugs for gastrointestinal symptoms during pregnancy in France. Prescription of gastrointestinal drugs during pregnancy should be the subject of more detailed risk-benefit assessment and recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W3123754871,"Introduction In view of the method of diagnosing sarcopenia being complex and considered to be difficult to introduce into routine practice, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) recommends the use of the SARC-F questionnaire as a way to introduce assessment and treatment of sarcopenia into clinical practice. Only recently, some studies have turned their attention to the presence of sarcopenia in systemic sclerosis (SSc).There is no data about performance of SARC-F and other screening tests for sarcopenia in this population. Objective To compare the accuracy of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F+EBM, and Ishii test as screening tools for sarcopenia in patients with SSc. Methods Cross-sectional study of 94 patients with SSc assessed by clinical and physical evaluation. Sarcopenia was defined according to the revised 2019 EWGSOP diagnostic criteria (EWGSOP2) with assessments of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, handgrip strength, and short physical performance battery (SPPB). As case finding tools, SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F+EBM and Ishii test were applied, including data on calf circumference, body mass index, limitations in strength, walking ability, rising from a chair, stair climbing, and self reported number of falls in the last year. The screening tests were evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Standard measures of diagnostic accuracy were computed using the EWGSOP2 criteria as the gold standard for diagnosis of sarcopenia. Results Sarcopenia was identified in 15 (15.9%) patients with SSc by the EWGSOP2 criteria. Area under the ROC curve of SARC-F screening for sarcopenia was 0.588 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.420–0.756, p = 0.283). The results of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (+LR), negative likelihood ratio (-LR) and diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR) with the EWGSOP2 criteria as the gold standard were 40.0% (95% CI, 19.8–64.2), 81.0% (95% CI, 71.0–88.1), 2.11 (95% CI, 0.98–4.55), 0.74 (95% CI, 0.48–1.13) and 2.84 (95% CI, 0.88–9.22), respectively. SARC-CalF and SARC-F+EBM showed better sensitivity (53.3%, 95% CI 30.1–75.2 and 60.0%, 95% CI 35.7–80.2, respectively) and specificity (84.8%, 95% CI 75.3–91.1 and 86.1%, 95% CI 76.8–92.0, respectively) compared with SARC-F. The best sensitivity was obtained with the Ishii test (86.7%, 95% CI 62.1–96.3), at the expense of a small loss of specificity (73.4%, 95% CI 62.7–81.9). Comparing the ROC curves, SARC-F performed worse than SARC-CalF, SARC-F+EBM and Ishii test as a sarcopenia screening tool in this population (AUCs 0.588 vs. 0.718, 0.832, and 0.862, respectively). Direct comparisons between tests revealed differences only between SARC-F and Ishii test for sensitivity ( p = 0.013) and AUC ( p = 0.031). Conclusion SARC-CalF, SARC-F+EBM, and Ishii test performed better than SARC-F alone as screening tools for sarcopenia in patients with SSc. Considering diagnostic accuracy and feasibility aspects, SARC-F+EBM seems to be the most suitable screening tool to be adopted in routine care of patients with SSc."
https://openalex.org/W3122735915,"Background Breast cancer burden is increasing in low-income countries (LICs). Increasing incidence and delayed presentation of breast cancer are mainly responsible for this burden. Many women do not participate in breast cancer screening despite its effectiveness. Moreover, studies are limited on the barriers associated with low utilization of breast cancer screening in LICs. This study identified breast cancer screening behavior and factors associated with breast cancer screening intention among women in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 500 women living in five municipalities of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Data were collected from July to September 2018, using a structured questionnaire. Interviews were conducted among women selected through proportionate random household sampling. This study was conceptualized using the theory of planned behavior, fatalism, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity. The outcome variables included: the intention to have mammography (MMG) biennially, the intention to have clinical breast examination (CBE) annually, and the intention to perform breast self-examination (BSE) monthly. Analysis was conducted separately for each outcome variable using partial proportional odds model. Results Out of 500 women, 3.4% had undergone MMG biennially, 7.2% CBE annually, and 14.4% BSE monthly. Women with a positive attitude, high subjective norms, and high perceived behavioral control were more likely to have the intention to undergo all three screening methods. Similarly, women were more likely to have intention to undergo CBE and MMG when they perceived themselves susceptible to breast cancer. Conversely, women were less likely to have intention to undergo CBE when they had high fatalistic beliefs towards breast cancer. Conclusion Women in this study had poor screening behavior. The practice of breast self-examination was comparatively higher than clinical breast examination and mammography. Multidimensional culturally sensitive interventions are needed to enhance screening intentions. Efforts should be directed to improve attitude, family support, and fatalistic belief towards cancer. Furthermore, the proper availability of screening methods should be ensured while encouraging women to screen before the appearance of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3122768045,"The Goss’s bacterial wilt pathogen, Clavibacter nebraskensis , of corn is a candidate A1 quarantine organism; and its recent re-emergence and spread in the USA and Canada is a potential biothreat to the crop. We developed and tested an amplicon-based Nanopore detection system for C . nebraskensis (Cn), targeting a purine permease gene. The sensitivity (1 pg) of this system in mock bacterial communities (MBCs) spiked with serially diluted DNA of C . nebraskensis NCPPB 2581 T is comparable to that of real-time PCR. Average Nanopore reads increased exponentially from 125 (1pg) to about 6000 reads (1000 pg) after a 3-hr run-time, with 99.0% of the reads accurately assigned to C . nebraskensis . Three run-times were used to process control MBCs, Cn-spiked MBCs, diseased and healthy leaf samples. The mean Nanopore reads doubled as the run-time is increased from 3 to 6 hrs while from 6 to 12 hrs, a 20% increment was recorded in all treatments. Cn-spiked MBCs and diseased corn leaf samples averaged read counts of 5,100, 11,000 and 14,000 for the respective run-times, with 99.8% of the reads taxonomically identified as C . nebraskensis . The control MBCs and healthy leaf samples had 47 and 14 Nanopore reads, respectively. 16S rRNA bacteriomic profiles showed that Sphingomonas (22.7%) and Clavibacter (21.2%) were dominant in diseased samples while Pseudomonas had only 3.5% relative abundance. In non-symptomatic leaf samples, however, Pseudomonas (20.0%) was dominant with Clavibacter at 0.08% relative abundance. This discrepancy in Pseudomonas abundance in the samples was corroborated by qPCR using EvaGreen chemistry. Our work outlines a new useful tool for diagnosis of the Goss’s bacterial wilt disease; and provides the first insight on Pseudomonas community dynamics in necrotic leaf lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3125347264,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPrCa) arises de novo or after accumulation of genomic alterations in pre-existing adenocarcinoma tumors in response to androgen deprivation therapies. We have provided evidence that small extracellular vesicles released by PrCa cells and containing the αVβ3 integrin promote neuroendocrine differentiation of PrCa in vivo and in vitro. Here, we examined αVβ3 integrin expression in three murine models carrying a deletion of PTEN (SKO), PTEN and RB1 (DKO), or PTEN, RB1 and TRP53 (TKO) genes in the prostatic epithelium; of these three models, the DKO and TKO tumors develop NEPrCa with a gene signature comparable to those of human NEPrCa. Immunostaining analysis of SKO, DKO and TKO tumors shows that αVβ3 integrin expression is increased in DKO and TKO primary tumors and metastatic lesions, but absent in SKO primary tumors. On the other hand, SKO tumors show higher levels of a different αV integrin, αVβ6, as compared to DKO and TKO tumors. These results are confirmed by RNA-sequencing analysis. Moreover, TRAMP mice, which carry NEPrCa and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, also have increased levels of αVβ3 in their NEPrCa primary tumors. In contrast, the αVβ6 integrin is only detectable in the adenocarcinoma areas. Finally, analysis of 42 LuCaP patient-derived xenografts and primary adenocarcinoma samples shows a positive correlation between αVβ3, but not αVβ6, and the neuronal marker synaptophysin; it also demonstrates that αVβ3 is absent in prostatic adenocarcinomas. In summary, we demonstrate that αVβ3 integrin is upregulated in NEPrCa primary and metastatic lesions; in contrast, the αVβ6 integrin is confined to adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Our findings suggest that the αVβ3 integrin, but not αVβ6, may promote a shift in lineage plasticity towards a NE phenotype and might serve as an informative biomarker for the early detection of NE differentiation in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3125831186,"Introduction Patients’ burden from lung cancer treatment is not well researched, but this understanding can facilitate a patient-centred treatment approach. Current models of treatment burden suggest it is influenced by a patient’s perception of their disease and treatment and their capacity to do the work required to treat their disease. Methods Sixteen patients and 1 carer who were undergoing or had completed conventional or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy for lung cancer in the last 6 months participated in a semi-structured interview. A treatment burden framework was used with three main themes: a) treatment work, b) consequences of treatment and c) psychosocial factors affecting treatment burden. Results The majority of patients did not feel unduly burdened by treatment tasks, despite having a large treatment-associated workload. Many saw treatment as a priority, causing them to restructure their life to accommodate for it. Patients wished that they would have been better informed about the lifestyle changes that they would have to make before treatment for lung cancer commenced and that the health service would provide services to assist them with this task. Discussion While there was a large burden associated with lung cancer treatment, patients felt motivated and equipped to manage the workload because the disease was considered severe and life-threatening, and the treatment was seen as beneficial. Before initiating treatment for lung cancer, patients should be informed about lifestyle changes they likely have to make and should be offered assistance."
https://openalex.org/W3123048065,"Objective To determine whether the French AmbUlatory Cesarean Section (FAUCS) technique reduces postoperative pain and promotes maternal autonomy compared with the Misgav Ladach cesarean section (MLCS) technique in elective conditions. Study design One hundred pregnant women were randomly, but in a non-blinded manner, assigned to undergo FAUCS or MLCS. The primary outcome was a postoperative mean pain score (PMPS), and secondary outcomes were a combined pain/medication score, time to regain autonomy, surgical duration, calculated blood loss, surgical complications, and neonatal outcome. Results Women in the FAUCS group experienced less pain than those in the MLCS group (PMPS = 1.87 [1.04–2.41] vs. 2.93 [2.46–3.75], respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Six hours after surgery, the combined pain/medication score for FAUCS patients was 33% lower than that for MLCS patients (p &lt; 0.001). FAUCS patients more rapidly regained autonomy, with 94% reaching autonomy within 12 h vs. 4% of MLCS patients (p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in maternal surgical or neonatal complications between groups. Conclusions Our results indicate that FAUCS can reduce postoperative pain and accelerate recovery, suggesting that this technique might be superior to MLCS and should be more widely used. One potentially key difference between FAUCS and MLCS is that MLCS includes 100 mcg spinal morphine anesthesia in addition to the same anesthesia used by FAUCS. Any interpretation of apparent differences must take the presence/absence of morphine into account."
https://openalex.org/W3124351681,"Objective Behaviorally unresponsive patients in intensive care units (ICU) are unable to consistently and effectively communicate their most fundamental physical needs. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology has been established in the clinical context, but faces challenges in the critical care environment. Contrary to cue-based BCIs, which allow activation only during pre-determined periods of time, self-paced BCI systems empower patients to interact with others at any time. The study aims to develop a self-paced BCI for patients in the intensive care unit. Methods BCI experiments were conducted in 18 ICU patients and 5 healthy volunteers. The proposed self-paced BCI system analyzes EEG activity from patients while these are asked to control a beeping tone by performing a motor task (i.e., opening and closing a hand). Signal decoding is performed in real time and auditory feedback given via headphones. Performance of the BCI system was judged based on correlation between the optimal and the observed performance. Results All 5 healthy volunteers were able to successfully perform the BCI task, compared to chance alone ( p &lt;0.001). 5 of 14 (36%) conscious ICU patients were able to perform the BCI task. One of these 5 patients was quadriplegic and controlled the BCI system without any hand movements. None of the 4 unconscious patients were able to perform the BCI task. Conclusions More than one third of conscious ICU patients and all healthy volunteers were able to gain control over the self-paced BCI system. The initial 4 unconscious patients were not. Future studies will focus on studying the ability of behaviorally unresponsive patients with cognitive motor dissociation to control the self-paced BCI system."
https://openalex.org/W3125235395,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained in popularity over the last few years. The space of online learning resources has been increasing exponentially and has created a problem of information overload. To overcome this problem, recommender systems that can recommend learning resources to users according to their interests have been proposed. MOOCs contain a huge amount of data with the quantity of data increasing as new learners register. Traditional recommendation techniques suffer from scalability, sparsity and cold start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations. Furthermore, they cannot accommodate the incremental update of the model with the arrival of new data making them unsuitable for MOOCs dynamic environment. From this line of research, we propose a novel online recommender system, namely NoR-MOOCs, that is accurate, scales well with the data and moreover overcomes previously recorded problems with recommender systems. Through extensive experiments conducted over the COCO data-set, we have shown empirically that NoR-MOOCs significantly outperforms traditional KMeans and Collaborative Filtering algorithms in terms of predictive and classification accuracy metrics."
https://openalex.org/W3125909378,"In mid-winter 2018, an unprecedented sediment deposition event occurred throughout portions of the Great Marsh in Massachusetts. Evaluation of this event in distinct marsh areas spanning three towns (Essex, Ipswich, and Newbury) revealed deposition covering 29.2 hectares with an average thickness of 30.1±2.1 mm measured shortly after deposition. While sediment deposition helps marshes survive sea level rise by building elevation, effects of such a large-scale deposition on New England marshes are unknown. This natural event provided an opportunity to study effects of large-scale sediment addition on plant cover and soil chemistry, with implications for marsh resilience. Sediment thickness did not differ significantly between winter and summer, indicating sediment is not eroding or compacting. The deposited sediment at each site had similar characteristics to that of the adjacent mudflat (e.g., texture, bivalve shells), suggesting that deposited materials resulted from ice rafting from adjacent flats, a natural phenomenon noted by other authors. Vegetative cover was significantly lower in plots with rafted sediment (75.6±2.3%) than sediment-free controls (93.1±1.6%) after one growing season. When sorted by sediment thickness categories, the low thickness level (1–19 mm) had significantly greater percent cover than medium (20–39 mm) and high (40–90 mm) categories. Given that sediment accretion in the Great Marsh was found to average 2.7 mm per year, the sediment thickness documented herein represents ~11 years of sediment accretion with only a 25% reduction in plant cover, suggesting this natural sediment event will likely increase long-term marsh resilience to sea level rise."
https://openalex.org/W3125216817,"Mali has a high pastoral potential with diverse coexisting production systems ranging from traditional (nomadic, transhumant, sedentary) to commercial (fattening and dairy production) production systems. Each of those systems is characterised by close interactions between animals and humans, increasing the potential risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases. The nature of contact network suggests that the risks may vary according to species, production systems and behaviors. However, the study of the link between small ruminants and zoonotic diseases has received limited attention in Mali. The objective of this study was to assess brucellosis seroprevalence and determine how the husbandry systems and human behaviour expose animal and human to infection risk. A cross-sectional study using cluster sampling was conducted in three regions in Mali. Blood was collected from 860 small ruminants. The sera obtained were analysed using both Rose Bengal and cELISA tests. In addition, 119 farmers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire in order to identify the characteristics of farms as well as the risk behaviors of respondents. Husbandry systems were dominated by agro-pastoral systems followed by pastoral systems. The commercial farms (peri-urban and urban) represent a small proportion. Small ruminant individual seroprevalence was 4.1% [2.8–5.6% (95% CI)]. Herd seroprevalence was estimated at 25.2% [17.7–33.9% (95% CI)]. Peri-urban farming system was more affected with seroprevalence of 38.1% [18.1–61.5 (95% CI)], followed by pastoral farming system (24.3% [11.7–41.2 (95% CI)]). Identified risk behaviors of brucellosis transmission to animals were: exchange of reproductive males (30.2%); improper disposal of placentas in the farms (31.1%); and keeping aborted females in the herd (69.7%). For humans, risk factors were: close and prolonged contact with animals (51.2%); consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (26.9%); and assisting female animals during delivery without any protection (40.3%). This study observed a high seroprevalence of brucellosis in small ruminants and also identified risky practices that allow cross transmission between the two populations. This calls for control strategy using a multi-sectoral and multidimensional approach."
https://openalex.org/W3123040434,"Background Postpartum depression is the most common mental health problem among women of childbearing age in resource-poor countries. Poor maternal mental health is linked with both acute and chronic negative effects on the growth and development of the child. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with depressive symptoms among postpartum mothers in the lowland region in southern Nepal. Methods A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 st July to 25 th August 2019 among 415 randomly selected postpartum mothers attending the child immunization clinic at Narayani hospital. The postpartum depressive symptoms were measured using the validated Nepalese version of the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The data were entered into EpiData software 3.1v and transferred into Stata version 14.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) for statistical analyses. To identify the correlates, backward stepwise binary logistic regression models were performed separately for the dichotomized outcomes: the presence of postpartum depressive symptoms. The statistical significance was considered at p-value &lt;0.05 with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Among the total 415 study participants, 33.7% (95% CI: 29.2–38.5%) of postpartum mothers had depressive symptoms. Study participant’s whose family monthly income &lt;150 USD compared to ≥150 USD (aOR = 13.76, 95% CI: 6.54–28.95), the husband had migrated for employment compared to not migrated (aOR = 8.19, 95% CI:4.11–15.87), nearest health facility located at more than 60 minutes of walking distance (aOR = 4.52, 95% CI: 2.26–9.03), delivered their last child by cesarean section compared to normal (vaginal) delivery (aOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.12–3.59) and received less than four recommended antenatal care (ANC) visits (aOR = 2.28, 95% CI:1.25–4.15) had higher odds of depressive symptoms. Participants who had planned pregnancy (aOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25–0.77) were associated with 56% lower odds of depressive symptoms. Conclusions One-third of the mothers suffered from postpartum depressive symptoms. The participant’s husband migrated for employment, family income, distance to reach a health facility, delivery by cesarean section, not receiving recommended ANC visits, and plan of pregnancy were independent predictors for postpartum depressive symptoms. The study results warranted the urgency for clinical diagnosis of PPD and implementation of preventive package in study settings. Mental health education to pregnant women during ANC visits and proper counseling during the antepartum and postpartum period can also play a positive role in preventing postpartum depression."
https://openalex.org/W3123457136,"Wide Area Protection System (WAPS) undertakes the important task of maintaining system reliability and stability when the power system is subject to abnormal or predetermined unstable conditions. The existing WAPS adopts a centralized mechanism to record and audit communication messages, which faces the risk of excessive authority and tampering with communication records and audit logs, thus making it impossible to achieve true transparency and fairness. Due to the involvement of multiple parties and equipment maintained by different manufacturers in the communication of WAPS, there are difficulties in tracing the cause of the accident and determining the at-fault party following misoperations and miss trips. To address this issue, we propose a semi-centralized blockchain system with multi-chain for auditing communications of WAPS. We first propose a semi-centralized system architecture according to the system architecture and management requirements of WAPS. Then, we utilize the blockchain network as a self-recording channel to achieve tamper-proof and non-repudiation verification interaction. We also design a multi-chain structure and classification node mechanism to meet the communication auditing requirements of multiple WAPS. We have designed a new block structure that conforms to the communication protocol of WAPS. To reduce the storage burden caused by the ever-expanding blockchain ledger, we propose a deletable blockchain scheme while maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain. Analysis and experiments show that the proposed blockchain system can support the secure, transparent, tamper-proof and traceable communication recording and auditing of WAPS along with high performance."
https://openalex.org/W3124792967,"Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Data characterizing the burden of injury in rural Uganda is limited. Hospital-based trauma registries are a critical tool in illustrating injury patterns and clinical outcomes. This study aims to characterize the traumatic injuries presenting to Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) in order to identify opportunities for quality improvement and policy development. From October 2016 to July 2019, we prospectively captured data on injured patients using a locally designed, context-relevant trauma registry instrument. Information regarding patient demographics, injury characteristics, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were recorded. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted. A total of 4109 injured patients were treated during the study period. Median age was 26 years and 63% were male. Students (33%) and peasant farmers (31%) were the most affected occupations. Falls (36%) and road traffic injuries (RTIs, 35%) were the leading causes of injury. Nearly two-thirds of RTIs were motorcycle-related and only 16% involved a pedestrian. Over half (53%) of all patients had a fracture or a sprain. Suffering a burn or a head injury were significant predictors of mortality. The number of trauma patients enrolled in the study declined by five-fold when comparing the final six months and initial six months of the study. Implementation of a context-appropriate trauma registry in a resource-constrained setting is feasible. In rural Uganda, there is a significant need for injury prevention efforts to protect vulnerable populations such as children and women from trauma on roads and in the home. Orthopedic and neurosurgical care are important targets for the strengthening of health systems. The comprehensive data provided by a trauma registry will continue to inform such efforts and provide a way to monitor their progress moving forward."
https://openalex.org/W3121141545,"Background Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis. Leptospirosis incidence (LI) in Sri Lanka is high. Infected animals pass leptospires to the environment with their urine. Leprospires' survival in the environment to infect a new host depends on meteorological factors. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) modulate the weather in Sri Lanka. Objectives The determination of interrelationship between the LI in the Hambantota District, and local meteorological parameters, ENSO and IOD. Methods We acquired notified leptospirosis cases in the Hambantota District and population data. We calculated weekly leptospirosis incidences for 2008 to 2017.Weather data from two weather stations was obtained, averaged and converted into weekly data. We plotted time series graphs and observed the correlation between seven aggregated weather parameters and LI. We estimated cross-correlations between those weather parameters and LI. As our principal analysis we determined correlation between LI and seven local weather parameters, Nino 3.4, Nino4 and Dipole Mode Index (DMI) indices using wavelet analysis. Results Our wavelet analysis results showed troughs of minimum, maximum, mean temperatures, soil temperature, the evaporation rate, the duration of sunshine were followed by peaks in LI and peaks of rainfall followed by peaks of LI, all after lag periods. Our time series graphs and cross-correlation determination results are generally in agreement with these results. However there was no significant correlation between rainfall and LI in the cross-correlation analysis. There were peaks of LI following both peaks and troughs of DMI. There was no clear correlation between both Nino indices and LI. Discussion This may be the first long-term study demonstrating soil temperature, evaporation rate and IOD are correlating with LI. The correlation pattern of LI with temperature parameters differs from similar past studies and we explain the reasons. We propose ways to control high LI we observed after periods of weather favorable for transmission of leptospirosis."
https://openalex.org/W3121276966,"Despite its deleterious impact on farming and agriculture, the physiology and energetics of insect migration is poorly understood due to our inability to track their individual movements in the field. Many insects, e.g. monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus (L.), are facultative migrants. Hence, it is important to establish whether specific insect populations in particular areas migrate. The polyphagous insect, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), is especially interesting in this regard due to its impact on a variety of crops. Here, we used a laboratory-based flight mill assay to show that Helicoverpa armigera populations clearly demonstrate facultative migration in South India. Based on various flight parameters, we categorized male and female moths as long, medium or short distance fliers. A significant proportion of moths exhibited long-distance flight behavior covering more than 10 km in a single night, averaging about 8 flight hours constituting 61% flight time in the test period. The maximum and average flight speeds of these long fliers were greater than in the other categories. Flight activity across sexes also varied; male moths exhibited better performance than female moths. Wing morphometric parameters including forewing length, wing loading, and wing aspect ratio were key in influencing long-distance flight. Whereas forewing length positively correlated with flight distance and duration, wing loading was negatively correlated."
https://openalex.org/W3123064806,"Iterative image reconstruction is widely used in positron emission tomography. However, it is known to contribute to quantitation bias and is particularly pronounced during dynamic studies with 11 C-labeled radiotracers where count rates become low towards the end of the acquisition. As the strength of the quantitation bias depends on the counts in the reconstructed frame, it can differ from frame to frame of the acquisition. This is especially relevant in the case of neuro-receptor studies with simultaneous PET/MR when a bolus-infusion protocol is applied to allow the comparison of pre- and post-task effects. Here, count dependent changes in quantitation bias may interfere with task changes. We evaluated the impact of different framing schemes on quantitation bias and its propagation into binding potential (BP) using a phantom decay study with 11 C and 3D OP-OSEM. Further, we propose a framing scheme that keeps the true counts per frame constant over the acquisition time as constant framing schemes and conventional increasing framing schemes are unlikely to achieve stable bias values during the acquisition time range. For a constant framing scheme with 5 minutes frames, the BP bias was 7.13±2.01% (10.8% to 3.8%) compared to 5.63±2.85% (7.8% to 4.0%) for conventional increasing framing schemes. Using the proposed constant true counts framing scheme, a stabilization of the BP bias was achieved at 2.56±3.92% (3.5% to 1.7%). The change in BP bias was further studied by evaluating the linear slope during the acquisition time interval. The lowest slope values were observed in the constant true counts framing scheme. The constant true counts framing scheme was effective for BP bias stabilization at relevant activity and time ranges. The mean BP bias under these conditions was 2.56±3.92%, which represents the lower limit for the detection of changes in BP during equilibrium and is especially important in the case of cognitive tasks where the expected changes are low."
https://openalex.org/W3123557059,"Five-year absolute breast cancer risk prediction models are required to comply with national guidelines regarding risk reduction regimens. Models including the Gail model are under-utilized in the general population for various reasons, including difficulty in accurately completing some clinical fields. The purpose of this study was to determine if a streamlined risk model could be designed without substantial loss in performance. Only the clinical risk factors that were easily answered by women will be retained and combined with an objective validated polygenic risk score (PRS) to ultimately improve overall compliance with professional recommendations. We first undertook a review of a series of 2,339 Caucasian, African American and Hispanic women from the USA who underwent clinical testing. We first used deidentified test request forms to identify the clinical risk factors that were best answered by women in a clinical setting and then compared the 5-year risks for the full model and the streamlined model in this clinical series. We used OPERA analysis on previously published case-control data from 11,924 Gail model samples to determine clinical risk factors to include in a streamlined model: first degree family history and age that could then be combined with the PRS. Next, to ensure that the addition of PRS to the streamlined model was indeed beneficial, we compared risk stratification using the Streamlined model with and without PRS for the existing case-control datasets comprising 1,313 cases and 10,611 controls of African-American (n = 7421), Caucasian (n = 1155) and Hispanic (n = 3348) women, using the area under the curve to determine model performance. The improvement in risk discrimination from adding the PRS risk score to the Streamlined model was 52%, 46% and 62% for African-American, Caucasian and Hispanic women, respectively, based on changes in log OPERA. There was no statistically significant difference in mean risk scores between the Gail model plus risk PRS compared to the Streamlined model plus PRS . This study demonstrates that validated PRS can be used to streamline a clinical test for primary care practice without diminishing test performance. Importantly, by eliminating risk factors that women find hard to recall or that require obtaining medical records, this model may facilitate increased clinical adoption of 5-year risk breast cancer risk prediction test in keeping with national standards and guidelines for breast cancer risk reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3124179148,"Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) relates to a family of enzymes that can detect DNA breaks and initiate DNA repair. While this activity is generally seen as promoting cell survival, PARP enzymes are also known to be involved in cell death in numerous pathologies, including in inherited retinal degeneration. This ambiguous role of PARP makes it attractive to have a simple and fast enzyme activity assay, that allows resolving its enzymatic activity in situ , in individual cells, within complex tissues. A previously published two-step PARP activity assay uses biotinylated NAD + and streptavidin labelling for this purpose. Here, we used the fluorescent NAD + analogues ε-NAD + and 6-Fluo-10-NAD + to assess PARP activity directly on unfixed tissue sections obtained from wild-type and retinal degeneration-1 ( rd1 ) mutant retina. In standard UV microscopy ε-NAD + incubation did not reveal PARP specific signal. In contrast, 6-Fluo-10-NAD + resulted in reliable detection of in situ PARP activity in rd1 retina, especially in the degenerating photoreceptor cells. When the 6-Fluo-10-NAD + based PARP activity assay was performed in the presence of the PARP specific inhibitor olaparib, the activity signal was completely abolished, attesting to the specificity of the assay. The incubation of live organotypic retinal explant cultures with 6-Fluo-10-NAD + , did not produce PARP specific signal, indicating that the fluorescent marker may not be sufficiently membrane-permeable to label living cells. In summary, we present a new, rapid, and simple to use fluorescence assay for the cellular resolution of PARP activity on unfixed tissue, for instance in complex neuronal tissues such as the retina."
https://openalex.org/W3122110457,"Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms incorporate large course catalogs from which individual students may register multiple courses. We performed a network-based analysis of student achievement, considering how course-course interactions may positively or negatively affect student success. Our data set included 378,000 users and 1,000,000 unique registration events in France Université Numérique (FUN), a national MOOC platform. We adapt reliability theory to model certificate completion rates with a Weibull survival function, following the intuition that students “survive” in a course for a certain time before stochastically dropping out. Course-course interactions are found to be well described by a single parameter for user engagement that can be estimated from a user’s registration profile. User engagement, in turn, correlates with certificate rates in all courses regardless of specific content. The reliability approach is shown to capture several certificate rate patterns that are overlooked by conventional regression models. User engagement emerges as a natural metric for tracking student progress across demographics and over time."
https://openalex.org/W3123535149,"αKlotho is primarily known to express as a transmembrane protein. Proteolytic cleavage results in shedding of the extracellular domain which enters systemic circulation. A truncated form of αKlotho resulting from alternative splicing of the αKLOTHO transcript exists and is believed to be secreted, thereby also entering systemic circulation. Existing ELISA methods fail to distinguish between the two circulating isoforms resulting in inconsistencies in assessing circulating αKlotho levels. We have exploited a unique 15aa peptide sequence present in the alternatively spliced secreted isoform to generate an antibody and show that it is able to specifically detect only the secreted Klotho isoform in human plasma. This finding will facilitate in distinguishing the levels of different circulating Klotho isoforms in health and disease and enhance their potential to serve as a biomarker for CKD and other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3125147066,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence among South African youth is high, yet HIV testing remains suboptimal. We explored how perceptions of HIV risk and behaviours informed decisions to test for HIV. This study was conducted from April 2018 to March 2019 in Ekurhuleni district, Gauteng Province with males and females aged between 15–24 years. Twenty-five youth with unknown HIV status participated in in-depth interviews (IDIs); while four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with those that previously tested for HIV. Probes used in the guides included types of incentives that youth would value when testing for HIV or receiving treatment; barriers and motivators to HIV testing; enablers and challenges to using cellphone technology and preferences on type of social media that could be used to create awareness about HIV testing services. IDIs and FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated. QSR NVIVO 10 was used for the analysis. The majority of the youth perceived that their risk of HIV infection was low due to factors such as being young, lacking physical signs of HIV, being sexually inactive and parents not being HIV positive. However, youth identified high risk behaviours such as unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, excessive drinking of alcohol, being victims of sexual abuse, road accidents and violent behaviour as increasing their vulnerability to HIV. Most youth highlighted cues to action that would motivate them to test for HIV such as support of parents, receiving incentives, improved confidentiality during HIV testing and receiving information about HIV via social media (Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp). Despite perceptions of low risk to HIV, youth remain vulnerable to HIV. Disseminating HIV information via digital platforms; giving youth options to choose between testing locations that they consider to be private; providing incentives and equipping parents/guardians to encourage youth to test could optimise HIV testing."
https://openalex.org/W3125572995,"Compared to the age-matched men, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases is lower in premenopausal but higher in postmenopausal women, suggesting the cardio-protective role of estrogen in females. Although cardiac stem cells (CSCs) express estrogen receptors, yet the effects of estrogen on CSCs remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the potential role of estrogen in maintaining the quality of CSCs by in vivo and in vitro experiments. For the in vivo study, estrogen deficiency was induced by ovariectomy in 6-weeks-old C57BL/6 female mice, and then randomly given 17β-estradiol (E 2 ) replacements at a low dose (0.01 mg/60 days) and high dose (0.18 mg/60 days), or vehicle treatment. All mice were killed 2 months after treatments, and heart tissues were collected for ex vivo expansion of CSCs. Compared to age-matched healthy controls, estrogen deficiency slightly decreased the yield of CSCs with significantly lower telomerase activity and more DNA damage. Interestingly, E 2 replacements at low and high doses significantly increased the yield of CSCs and reversed the quality impairment of CSCs following estrogen deficiency. For the in vitro study, twice-passaged CSCs from the hearts of adult healthy female mice were cultured with the supplement of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM E 2 in the medium for 3 days. We found that E 2 supplement increased c-kit expression, increased proliferative activity, improved telomerase activity, and reduced DNA damage of CSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggested the potential role of estrogen in maintaining the quality of CSCs, providing new insight into the cardio-protective effects of estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W3125721976,"Background Implementation of the programmes for the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) into antenatal care over the last three decades could inform implementation of interventions for other health challenges such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study assessed PMTCT outcomes, and how GDM screening, care, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prevention were integrated into PMTCT in Western Cape (WC), South Africa. Methods A convergent mixed methods and triangulation design were used. Content and thematic analysis of PMTCT-related policy documents and of 30 semi-structured interviews with HIV/PMTCT experts, health care workers and women under PMTC diagnosed with GDM complement quantitative longitudinal analysis of PMTCT implementation indicators across the WC for 2012–2017. Results Provincial PMTCT and Post Natal Care (PNC) documents emphasized the importance of PMTCT, but GDM screening and T2DM prevention were not covered. Data on women with both HIV and GDM were not available and GDM screening was not integrated into PMTCT. Women who attended HIV counselling and testing annually increased at 17.8% (95% CI: 12.9% - 22.0%), while women who delivered under PMTCT increased at 3.1% (95% CI: 0.6% - 5.9%) annually in the WC. All 30 respondents favour integrating GDM screening and T2DM prevention initiatives into PMTCT. Conclusion PMTCT programmes have not yet integrated GDM care. However, Western Cape PMTCT integration experience suggests that antenatal GDM screening and post-partum initiatives for preventing or delaying T2DM can be successfully integrated into PMTCT and primary care."
https://openalex.org/W3125948613,"Background Young people face many barriers to accessing appropriate health care services including screening for HIV and tuberculosis (TB). The study aimed to identify perceived barriers to the uptake of health services among young adults entering the tertiary education system in South Africa. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among first-year students aged 18–25 years, registered at one of three universities in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2017. Participants completed a self-administered paper-based questionnaire. We describe perceived barriers to accessing health services, stratified by gender and recent engagement in TB or HIV services, together with sources of information about HIV and TB. Results Seven hundred and ninety-two (792) students were included in the study of which 54.8% were female. Perceived barriers to accessing services included long waiting time (n = 342,43.2%), attitude of health workers (n = 263,33.2%), lack of sufficient information/poor health literacy (n = 148,18.7%), and inability to leave/stay away from studies (n = 137,17.3%). Among participants who tested for HIV in the past 6 months (n = 400, 50.5%), waiting time and attitude of health care workers were perceived as barriers to accessing services. Compared to males, females were more likely to view attitudes of health workers (40.3% vs. 25.0%; p = 0.001) and inability to leave/stay away from studies (20.5% vs.13.4%; p = 0.025) as potential barriers. While just over half of the students (50.5%; 400/792) in this study had accessed health services in the past 6 months, very few (15.0%) opted to use campus health services, and even less (5%) reported receiving information about HIV and TB from the university itself. Conclusion Despite perceived barriers to accessing HIV and TB services off campus, fewer than one in five students starting out at university opted to use campus health services. Campus health services could address many of the barriers unique to university students."
https://openalex.org/W3125698132,"The present study describes adult diabetes self-management (DSM) profiles using self-reported outcomes associated with the engagement in diabetes care activities and psychological adjustment to the disease. We used self-reported data from a community-based cohort of adults with diabetes (N = 316) and conducted a cluster analysis of selected self-reported DSM outcomes ( i . e ., DSM behaviors, self-efficacy and perceived empowerment, diabetes distress and quality of life). We tested whether clusters differed according to sociodemographic, clinical, and care delivery processes variables. Cluster analysis revealed four distinct DSM profiles that combined high/low levels of engagement in diabetes care activities and good/poor psychological adjustment to the disease. The profiles were differently associated with the variables of perceived financial insecurity, taking insulin treatment, having depression, and the congruence of the care received with the Chronic Care Model. The results could help health professionals gain a better understanding of the different realities facing people living with diabetes, identify patients at risk of poor outcomes related to their DSM, and lead to the development of profile-specific DSM interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3125881598,"Material decomposition (MD) is an important application of computer tomography (CT). For phase contrast imaging, conventional MD methods are categorized into two types with respect to different operation sequences, i.e., “before” or “after” image reconstruction. Both categories come down to two-step methods, which have the problem of noise amplification. In this study, we incorporate both phase and absorption (PA) information into MD process, and correspondingly develop a simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART). The proposed method is referred to as phase &amp; absorption material decomposition-SART (PAMD-SART). By iteratively solving an optimization problem, material composition and substance quantification are reconstructed directly from absorption and differential phase projections. Comparing with two-step MD, the proposed one-step method is superior in noise suppression and accurate decomposition. Numerical simulations and synchrotron radiation based experiments show that PAMD-SART outperforms the classical MD method (image-based and dual-energy CT iterative method), especially for the quantitative accuracy of material equivalent atomic number."
https://openalex.org/W3126092686,"Feelings of fear, anxiety, dyspnea and panic when inhaling carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) are variable among humans, in part due to differences in CO 2 sensitivity. Rat aversion to CO 2 consistently varies between individuals; this variation in aversion may reflect CO 2 sensitivity, but other personality traits could also account for individual differences in aversion. The aims of this study were to 1) assess the stability of individual differences in rat aversion to CO 2 , 2) determine if individual differences in sweet reward motivation are associated with variation in aversion to CO 2 , and 3) assess whether variation in aversion to CO 2 is related to individual differences in motivation to approach gains (promotion focus) or maintain safety (prevention focus). Twelve female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed multiple times at three different ages (3, 9 and 16 months old) to CO 2 in approach-avoidance testing to assess motivation to avoid CO 2 against motivation to gain sweet rewards. Rats were also tested for motivation to find hidden sweet rewards, and for their motivation to approach rewards or darkness. Tolerance to CO 2 increased with repeated exposures and was higher at older ages. Individual differences in aversion to CO 2 were highly repeatable but unrelated to motivation for sweet rewards or the strength of promotion and prevention focus. These results indicate that individual differences in aversion to CO 2 reflect variation in CO 2 sensitivity."

Recently, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) was identified as a mediator of delayed wound healing in insulin resistant states. Herein, we explored the relationship between obesity, insulin resistance and biomarkers of NET formation in TJA subjects. We enrolled 14 obese (body mass index [BMI]≥30 kg/m2), and 15 lean (BMI<30 kg/m2) subjects undergoing primary knee or hip TJA. On the day of surgery, skeletal muscle proximal to the operated joint and plasma were collected. Protein abundance of NETosis biomarkers, peptidylarginine deaminase 4 (PAD4) and neutrophil elastase (NE) were assessed in skeletal muscle by immunoblotting and metabolic parameters (glucose, insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids) and cell-free double-stranded DNA (cf-dsDNA) were assessed in plasma and were correlated with obesity and insulin resistance (as measured by the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance). When comparing lean and obese subjects, there were no significant differences in plasma cf-dsDNA or skeletal muscle NE or PAD4 abundance. In contrast, skeletal muscle PAD4 abundance, but not NE or plasma cf-dsDNA, was positively correlated with insulin resistance. Compared to insulin sensitive subjects, insulin resistant TJA subjects have higher expression of PAD4 at the surgical site and therefore may have higher rates of NET formation, which may lead to delayed surgical site wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W3122124989,"To avoid harm to the public and the environment, lost ionizing radiation sources must be found and brought back under the regulatory control as soon as possible. Usually, mobile gamma spectrometry systems are used in such search missions. It is possible to estimate the position and activity of point gamma sources by performing Bayesian inference on the measurement data. The aim of this study was to theoretically investigate the improvements in the Bayesian estimations of the position and activity of a point gamma source due to introduction of data from multiple detectors with angular variations of efficiency. Three detector combinations were tested—a single 123% HPGe detector, single 4l NaI (Tl) detector and a 123% HPGe with 2x4l NaI (Tl) detector combination—with and without angular efficiency variations for each combination resulting in six different variants of the Bayesian algorithm. It was found that introduction of angular efficiency variations of the detectors did improve the accuracy of activity estimation slightly, while introduction of data from additional detectors lowered the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of the system significantly, increasing the stability and accuracy of the estimated source position and activity, for a given signal-to-noise ratio."
https://openalex.org/W3122156150,"Research and theory have shown a link between heart rate reactivity during cognitive testing and extraversion in younger adults; however, similar work has not been conducted with older adults. This study was designed to explore age and extraversion-related differences in within-person heart rate (HR) reactivity during two working memory tasks of varying difficulty using a multi-level modeling approach. Across 570 total within-person assessments of continuous HR monitoring, 28 younger adults ( M = 19.76, SD = 1.15) and 29 older adults ( M = 71.19, SD = 6.63) were administered two working memory tasks (backward digit span and n -back). There were no age differences in reactivity during the backward digit span. However, similar to previous findings, on the more difficult n -back task, younger adults low in extraversion showed a trend toward higher HR reactivity than young adults high in extraversion. Interestingly, the older adults showed the opposite pattern in that lower extraversion older adults were less reactive than the higher extraversion older adults who showed the steepest increase in HR. The HR increase of the older adults high in extraversion may be an indication of higher engagement in this more difficult task. Individual differences in extraversion need to be taken into account when administering working memory tasks in older adults."

Methods We used the Iran Cancer Registry to extract cancer incidence data and applied several statistical procedures to overcome the dataset’s incompleteness and misclassifications. Using Spatio-temporal and random intercept mixed effect models, we imputed missing values for cancer incidence by sex, age, province, and year. Besides, we addressed case duplicates and geographical misalignments in the data. Results Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) increased 1.17 times from 0.57 (95% UI: 0.37–0.78) per 100,000 population in 2000 to 0.67 (0.50–0.85) in 2016. It had a 21.8% total percentage change increase during this time, with a 1.28 annual percentage change in both sexes. Male to female ASIR ratio was 1.51 in 2000 and 1.57 in 2016. Overall, after the age of 50 years, HCC incidence increased dramatically with age and increased from 1.19 (0.98–1.40) in the 50–55 age group to 6.65 (5.45–7.78) in the &gt;85 age group. The geographical distribution of this cancer was higher in the central, southern, and southwestern regions of Iran. Conclusion The HCC incidence rate increased from 2000 to 2016, with a more significant increase in subgroups such as men, individuals over 50 years of age, and the central, southern, and southwestern regions of the country. We recommend health planners and policymakers to adopt more preventive and screening strategies for high-risk populations and provinces in Iran."
https://openalex.org/W3123380973,"Pyrethroid resistance was first reported in 2013 for the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella , but the genetic underpinnings of pyrethroid resistance are unknown. We investigated the role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) belonging to the CYP3 and CYP4 clans using colonies derived from individuals collected in 2016 from almond orchards in two counties. One colony (ALM) originated from an almond orchard in Madera County with no reported pyrethroid resistance and the second colony (R347) originated from the same Kern County orchard where pyrethroid resistance was first reported. We used high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses of 65 P450s in the CYP3 and CYP4 clans of A . transitella to identify P450s induced by bifenthrin and associated with pyrethroid resistance. Nine P450s were constitutively overexpressed in R347 compared to ALM, including CYP6AE54 (11.7-fold), belonging to a subfamily associated with metabolic pesticide detoxification in Lepidoptera and CYP4G89 (33-fold) belonging to a subfamily associated with cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) synthesis and resistance via reduced pesticide penetrance. Cuticular hydrocarbons analysis revealed that R347 produced twice as many total CHCs in the egg and adult stages as ALM. Topical toxicity bioassays for R347 determined that egg mortality was reduced at low bifenthrin concentrations and larval mortality was reduced at high concentrations of bifenthrin compared to ALM. Our discovery of both changes in metabolism and production of CHCs for R347 have implications for the possible decreased efficacy of other classes of insecticide used to control this insect. The threat of widespread pyrethroid resistance combined with the potential for cross-resistance to develop through the mechanism of reduced penetrance warrants developing management strategies that facilitate insecticide passage across the cuticle."
https://openalex.org/W3123567315,"LRFN2 encodes a synaptic adhesion-like molecule that physically interacts with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 1 and its scaffold proteins. Previous studies in humans and mice have demonstrated its genetic association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as learning deficiency and autism. In this study, we showed that Lrfn2-deficient (KO) mice exhibit abnormalities of erythropoietic systems due to altered NMDA receptor function. In mature Lrfn2 KO male mice, peripheral blood tests showed multilineage abnormalities, including normocytic erythrocythemia, and reduced platelet volume. Colony forming unit assay using bone marrow cells revealed decreases in the counts of erythrocyte progenitors (CFU-E) as well as granulocytes and monocyte progenitors (CFU-GM). Whole bone marrow cell staining showed that serum erythropoietin (EPO) level was decreased and EPO receptor-like immunoreactivity was increased. Flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow cells revealed increased early erythroblast count and increased transferrin receptor expression in late erythroblasts. Further, we found that late erythroblasts in Lrfn2 KO exhibited defective NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx, which was inhibited by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801. These results indicate that Lrfn2 has biphasic roles in hematopoiesis and is associated with the functional integrity of NMDA receptors in hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, taken together with previous studies that showed the involvement of NMDA receptors in hematopoiesis, the results of this study indicate that Lrfn2 may regulate erythropoiesis through its regulatory activity on NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3123738684,"Introduction Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a chronic progressive disease that resembles atherosclerosis development. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) is reportedly associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. This study aimed to examine the development of AS in patients with myeloperoxidase-AAV (MPO-AAV) with renal involvement at more than 1 year after the onset of vasculitis. Methods We performed a retrospective review of clinical records of MPO-AAV patients with renal involvement without AS at the onset of vasculitis who were treated in three hospitals and three dialysis clinics. Results The study included 97 MPO-AAV patients with renal involvement and 230 control patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Among them, 64 patients had AS. The prevalence rates of AS were 28.9% and 15.7% in MPO-AAV and control patients, respectively (p = 0.006). The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that MPO-AAV, dialysis dependence, and hypertension were independently associated factors for AS. In MPO-AAV patients, systolic blood pressure was positively significantly associated with AS, whereas glucocorticoid dose of induction therapy was negatively significantly associated. The use of cyclophosphamide tended to be negatively associated with AS. The survival rate was significantly lower for patients with AS than for those without AS. Conclusions The AS prevalence rate was significantly higher in MPO-AAV patients at more than 1 year after the onset of vasculitis than in control CKD patients. Therefore, regular monitoring of echocardiography during MPO-AAV treatment is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3123660184,"As a type of flexible impermeable material, a PVC geomembrane must be cooperatively used with cushion materials. The contact interface between a PVC geomembrane and cushion easily loses stability. In this present paper, we analyzed the shear models and parameters of the interface to study the stability. Two different cushion materials were used: the common extrusion sidewall and non-fines concrete. To simulate real working conditions, flexible silicone cushions were added under the loading plates to simulate hydraulic pressure loading, and the loading effect of flexible silicone cushions was demonstrated by measuring the actual contact areas under different normal pressures between the geomembrane and cushion using the thin-film pressure sensor. According to elastomer shear stress, there are two main types of shear stress between the PVC geomembrane and the cushion: viscous shear stress and hysteresis shear stress. The viscous shear stress between the geomembrane and the cement grout was measured using a dry, smooth concrete sample, then the precise formula parameters of the viscous shear stress and viscous friction coefficient were obtained. The hysteresis shear stress between the geomembrane and the cushion was calculated by subtracting the viscous shear stress from the total shear stress. The formula parameters of the hysteresis shear stress and hysteresis friction coefficient were calculated. The three-dimensional box-counting dimensions of the cushion surface were calculated, and the formula parameters of the hysteresis friction were positively correlated with the three-dimensional box dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W3123670815,"Background The current prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in France is estimated to be 2.6 million and is predicted to increase to 2.8 million by 2025. Presently, there is a lack of data on COPD management within the private healthcare setting. The aim of this study was to investigate the management of COPD exacerbations by pulmonologists within private practices in France. Methods A prospective, online, qualitative survey was distributed to private practice pulmonologists in France. The survey covered all aspects of COPD management from diagnosis and therapeutic management, to secondary prevention and organization of care. Survey responses were collected between 27 January 2018 and 18 June 2018 and all data were summarized descriptively. Results The survey had a response rate of 20.6%, with 116 out of 563 pulmonologists providing responses. Overall, 87.4% of respondents stated that the management of COPD represented over 15% of their total clinical activity. Most respondents indicated that they work closely with general practitioners and a large multidisciplinary team to manage patients with numerous comorbidities. Following a COPD exacerbation, the majority of respondents (78.4%) were in favor of using respiratory-connected devices (class 2a-connected medical device according to the French HAS classification and available on medical prescription) to assist with patient follow-up at home. Conclusions COPD management forms part of the core clinical activity for pulmonologists within the private practice setting in France. Patients with COPD generally have multiple comorbidities and are managed by a multidisciplinary team in line with French guidelines. The use of respiratory-connected devices was highlighted as an important new strategy for improving patient care following a COPD exacerbation."
https://openalex.org/W3125873499,"Information such as the prevalence and frequency of criminal behaviour is difficult to estimate using standard survey techniques because of the tendency of respondents to withhold or misrepresent information. Social desirability bias is a significant threat to the validity of self-reported data, especially when supplied by persons such as sexual offenders or those convicted of theft or substance abuse. The randomized response approach is an alternative to the standard interview method and offers great potential for researchers in the field of criminal justice. By means of a survey of 792 prison inmates, incorporating both indirect and direct response techniques, we investigate if the prison population also has problems recognizing their participation in criminal acts such as theft, illicit drug use, violence against property, reckless driving and arson. Our research findings suggest that self-reported criminal behaviour among a prison population is affected by social desirability bias and that the behaviour considered is significantly associated with the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The results also demonstrate the inadequacy of traditional, yet widely used, direct questioning methods, and the great potential for indirect questioning techniques to advance policy formation and evaluation in the field of criminal behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3126057169,"In this study, porous methacrylate-modified FDU-12/poly(methyl methacrylate) and amine-modified FDU-12/Nylon 6 nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile solution casting protocol. The physicochemical properties of the prepared materials were studied using various characterization techniques including Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption. After characterization of the materials, the prepared nanocomposites were applied as novel adsorbents for the removal of Pb(II) from aqueous media. In this regard, the effect of various parameters including solution pH, adsorbent amount, contact time, and initial concentration of Pb(II) on the adsorption process was investigated. To study the mechanism of adsorption, kinetic studies were conducted. The kinetic models of pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion were employed. The results revealed that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto methacrylate-modified FDU-12/poly(methyl methacrylate) and amine-modified FDU-12/Nylon 6 adsorbents followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Also, different isotherms including Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich were applied to evaluate the equilibrium adsorption data. Langmuir isotherm provided the best fit with the equilibrium data of both adsorbents with maximum adsorption capacities of 99.0 and 94.3 mg g -1 for methacrylate-modified FDU-12/poly(methyl methacrylate) and amine-modified FDU-12/Nylon 6, respectively, for the removal of Pb(II)."
https://openalex.org/W3126065904,"Bamen Bay is located at the intersection of the Wenjiao River and Wenchang River in Hainan Province (China), where mangroves have been facing a threat of water quality deterioration. Therefore, it is imperative to study the characteristics of the surface water quality on a watershed scale. Water samples were collected three times from 36 monitoring sites from 2015 to 2016. It was found that nitrate was the main inorganic nitrogen form and all the surface water types were alkaline. Meanwhile, aquaculture water had high content of nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a ( Chl . a ), total organic carbon (TOC), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Significant spatial and temporal variations were found for most parameters. However, stable isotopes of δD and δ 18 O indicated that river water mainly originated from atmospheric precipitation and experienced strong evaporation. The water chemistry and isotopes of the Bamen Bay, mangroves, and aquaculture water were initially affected by the mixing of fresh water and seawater, followed by evaporation. The river and reservoir water chemistry were mainly controlled by water–rock interactions and cation exchange as deduced from the ionic relationships and Gibbs plots. These interactions involved the dissolution of calcite-, bicarbonate-, carbonate-, and calcium-containing minerals. Oxidized environments (river, reservoir, and Bamen Bay) were conducive for nitrification, while anaerobic conditions (mangrove and aquaculture water) were beneficial to the reduced nitrogen forms."
