While quantitative molecular techniques have been increasingly used in phytoplankton research, an effective and simple method broadly applicable to different lineages and natural assemblages is still lacking. In this study, we developed a bead-beating protocol based on our previous experience and tested it against 9 species of phytoplankton representing different lineages and different cell covering rigidities. We found the bead-beating method enhanced the final yield of DNA (highest as 2 folds) in comparison with the non-bead-beating method, while also preserving the DNA integrity. When our method was applied to a field sample collected at a subtropical bay located in Xiamen, China, the resultant ITS clone library revealed a highly diverse assemblage of phytoplankton and other micro-eukaryotes, including Archaea, Amoebozoa, Chlorophyta, Ciliphora, Bacillariophyta, Dinophyta, Fungi, Metazoa, etc. The appearance of thecate dinoflagellates, thin-walled phytoplankton and “naked” unicellular organisms indicates that our method could obtain the intact DNA of organisms with different cell coverings. All the results demonstrate that our method is useful for DNA extraction of phytoplankton and environmental surveys of their diversity and abundance."

Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that soluble cardiotoxic LCs are themselves harmful for cells, by which they are internalized. Hypothesizing that interaction of soluble cardiotoxic LCs with cellular proteins contributes to damage, we characterized their interactome in cardiac cells. LCs were purified from patients with AL amyloidosis cardiomyopathy or multiple myeloma without amyloidosis (the nonamyloidogenic/noncardiotoxic LCs served as controls) and employed at concentrations in the range observed in AL patients' sera. A functional proteomic approach, based on direct and inverse coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, allowed identifying LC-protein complexes. Findings were validated by colocalization, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and ultrastructural studies, using human primary cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) and stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Amyloidogenic cardiotoxic LCs interact in vitro with specific intracellular proteins involved in viability and metabolism. Imaging confirmed that, especially in hCFs, cardiotoxic LCs (not controls) colocalize with mitochondria and spatially associate with selected interactors: mitochondrial optic atrophy 1-like protein and peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (FLIM-FRET efficiencies 11 and 6%, respectively). Cardiotoxic LC-treated hCFs display mitochondrial ultrastructural changes, supporting mitochondrial involvement. We show that cardiotoxic LCs establish nonphysiologic protein-protein contacts in human cardiac cells, offering new clues on the pathogenesis of AL cardiomyopathy."

Healthy Taiwanese men aged 18 years or older who participated in a standard medical screening program from 2008-2013 run by a private firm were included in this study. Semen parameters including sperm concentration (SC), total sperm motility (TSM), progressive motility (PRM) and normal sperm morphology (NSM) were recorded. A dietary questionnaire was used to categorize the participants into 5 groups: ""Healthy diet"", ""Western diet"", ""High-carbohydrate diet"", ""High sweet snacks & sugar-sweetened drinks"" and ""High-sodium diet"".A total of 7282 men completed the questionnaire regarding dietary pattern, and examination of anthropometric indexes was performed and laboratory data were obtained. A high intake of a ""Western diet"" resulted in statistically linear declines of SC and NSM (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). Similarly, a greater intake of ""High sweet snacks & sugar-sweetened drinks"" was associated with a lower SC (P = 0.001). Increased intake of a ""High-carbohydrate diet"" was related to higher prevalences of abnormal TSM and PRM (P = 0.012 and P = 0.025). Similarly, a greater intake of a ""High-sodium diet"" was correlated with an elevated prevalence of abnormal NSM (P = 0.035).This study showed that a greater intake of a ""Western diet"" is associated with poorer SC and NSM, a ""High sweet snacks and sugar-sweetened drinks"" intake is correlated with a lower SC, and high-carbohydrate food is related to elevated prevalences of abnormal TSM and PRM."

Nine of ∼30 genes involved in 22qDS have the potential of disrupting mitochondrial metabolism (COMT, UFD1L, DGCR8, MRPL40, PRODH, SLC25A1, TXNRD2, T10, and ZDHHC8). Deficits in bioenergetics during early postnatal brain development could set the basis for a disrupted neuronal metabolism or synaptic signaling, partly explaining the higher incidence in developmental and behavioral deficits in these individuals. Here, we investigated whether mitochondrial outcomes and metabolites from 22qDS children segregated with the altered dosage of one or several of these mitochondrial genes contributing to 22qDS etiology and/or morbidity. Plasma metabolomics, lymphocytic mitochondrial outcomes, and epigenetics (histone H3 Lys-4 trimethylation and 5-methylcytosine) were evaluated in samples from 11 22qDS children and 13 age- and sex-matched neurotypically developing controls. Metabolite differences between 22qDS children and controls reflected a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (higher lactate/pyruvate ratios) accompanied by an increase in reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate (increased concentrations of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, cholesterol, and fatty acids). Altered metabolism in 22qDS reflected a critical role for the haploinsufficiency of the mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1, further enhanced by HIF-1α, MYC, and metabolite controls.

https://openalex.org/W1596082116,"Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the aetiological agent of Johne's disease (JD), a chronic enteritis in ruminants that causes substantial economic loses to agriculture worldwide. Current diagnostic assays are hampered by low sensitivity and specificity that seriously complicate disease control; a new generation of diagnostic and prognostic assays are therefore urgently needed. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to have significant potential as novel biomarkers for a range of human diseases, but their potential application in the veterinary sphere has been less well characterised. The aim of this study was therefore to apply RNA-sequencing approaches to serum from an experimental JD infection model as a route to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic miRNA biomarkers. Sera from experimental MAP-challenged calves (n = 6) and age-matched controls (n = 6) were used. We identified a subset of known miRNAs from bovine serum across all samples, with approximately 90 being at potentially functional abundance levels. The majority of known bovine miRNAs displayed multiple isomiRs that differed from the canonical sequences. Thirty novel miRNAs were identified after filtering and were found within sera from all animals tested. No significant differential miRNA expression was detected when comparing sera from MAP-challenged animals to their age-matched controls at six-month's post-infection. However, comparing sera from pre-infection bleeds to six-month's post-infection across all 12 animals did identify increased miR-205 (2-fold) and decreased miR-432 (2-fold) within both challenged and control groups, which suggests changes in circulating miRNA profiles due to ageing or development (P<0.00001). In conclusion our study has identified a range of novel miRNA in bovine serum, and shown the utility of small RNA sequencing approaches to explore the potential of miRNA as novel biomarkers for infectious disease in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W1611106917,"Both obesity and dysmenorrhea are prevalent among women. Few population-based longitudinal studies investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and dysmenorrhea yielding mixed results, especially for obesity. This study aims to investigate the long-term association between BMI and dysmenorrhea.9,688 women from a prospective population-based cohort study were followed for 13 years. Data were collected through self-reported questionnaires. The longitudinal association between dysmenorrhea and BMI or BMI change was investigated by logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations to account for the repeated measures.When the women were aged 22 to 27 years, approximately 11% were obese, 7% underweight, and 25% reported dysmenorrhea. Compared to women with a normal weight, significantly higher odds of reporting dysmenorrhea were detected for both women who were underweight (odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15, 1.57) and obese (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11, 1.35). Compared to women who remained at normal weight or overweight over time, significant risk was detected for women who: remained underweight or obese (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.20, 1.48), were underweight despite weight gain (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12, 1.58), became underweight (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02, 1.61). However the higher risk among obese women disappeared when they lost weight (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85, 1.32).A U-shaped association was revealed between dysmenorrhea and BMI, revealing a higher risk of dysmenorrhea for both underweight and obese women. Maintaining a healthy weight over time may be important for women to have pain-free periods."
https://openalex.org/W2131278995,"Bivalve shell is a biomineralized tissue with various layers/microstructures and excellent mechanical properties. Shell matrix proteins (SMPs) pervade and envelop the mineral crystals and play essential roles in biomineralization. Despite that Mytilus is an economically important bivalve, only few proteomic studies have been performed for the shell, and current knowledge of the SMP set responsible for different shell layers of Mytilus remains largely patchy. In this study, we observed that Mytilus galloprovincialis shell contained three layers, including nacre, fibrous prism, and myostracum that is involved in shell-muscle attachment. A parallel proteomic analysis was performed for these three layers. By combining LC-MS/MS analysis with Mytilus EST database interrogations, a whole set of 113 proteins was identified, and the distribution of these proteins in different shell layers followed a mosaic pattern. For each layer, about a half of identified proteins are unique and the others are shared by two or all of three layers. This is the first description of the protein set exclusive to nacre, myostracum, and fibrous prism in Mytilus shell. Moreover, most of identified proteins in the present study are novel SMPs, which greatly extended biomineralization-related protein data of Mytilus. These results are useful, on one hand, for understanding the roles of SMPs in the deposition of different shell layers. On the other hand, the identified protein set of myostracum provides candidates for further exploring the mechanism of adductor muscle-shell attachment."
https://openalex.org/W965673883,"Intercellular communication between cancer cells, especially between cancer and stromal cells, plays an important role in disease progression. We examined the intercellular transfer of organelles and proteins in vitro and in vivo and the role of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in this process. TNTs are membrane bridges that facilitate intercellular transfer of organelles of unclear origin. Using 3-dimensional quantitative and qualitative confocal microscopy, we showed that TNTs contain green fluorescent protein (GFP)-early endosome antigen (EEA) 1, GFP Rab5, GFP Rab11, GFP Rab8, transferrin (Tf), and Tf receptor (Tf-R) fused to mCherry (Tf-RmCherry). Tf-RmCherry was transferred between cancer cells by a contact-dependent but secretion-independent mechanism. Live cell imaging showed TNT formation preceding the transfer of Tf-RmCherry and involving the function of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab8, which colocalized with Tf-RmCherry in the TNTs and was cotransferred to acceptor cells. Tf-RmCherry was transferred from cancer cells to fibroblasts, a noteworthy finding that suggests that this process occurs between tumor and stromal cells in vivo. We strengthened this hypothesis in a xenograft model of breast cancer using enhanced (e)GFP-expressing mice. Tf-RmCherry transferred from tumor to stromal cells and this process correlated with an increased opposite transfer of eGFP from stromal to tumor cells, together pointing toward complex intercellular communication at the tumor site."

https://openalex.org/W1599703185,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the major isoform of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family, is a constitutive nuclear and mitochondrial protein with well-recognized roles in various essential cellular functions such as DNA repair, signal transduction, apoptosis, as well as in a variety of pathophysiological conditions including sepsis, diabetes and cancer. Activation of PARP-1 in response to oxidative stress catalyzes the covalent attachment of the poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) groups on itself and other acceptor proteins, utilizing NAD+ as a substrate. Overactivation of PARP-1 depletes intracellular NAD+ influencing mitochondrial electron transport, cellular ATP generation and, if persistent, can result in necrotic cell death. Due to their high metabolic activity, skeletal muscle cells are particularly exposed to constant oxidative stress insults. In this study, we investigated the role of PARP-1 in a well-defined model of murine skeletal muscle differentiation (C2C12) and compare the responses to oxidative stress of undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. We observed a marked reduction of PARP-1 expression as myoblasts differentiated into myotubes. This alteration correlated with an increased resistance to oxidative stress of the myotubes, as measured by MTT and LDH assays. Mitochondrial function, assessed by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential, was preserved under oxidative stress in myotubes compared to myoblasts. Moreover, basal respiration, ATP synthesis, and the maximal respiratory capacity of mitochondria were higher in myotubes than in myoblasts. Inhibition of the catalytic activity of PARP-1 by PJ34 (a phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor) exerted greater protective effects in undifferentiated myoblasts than in differentiated myotubes. The above observations in C2C12 cells were also confirmed in a rat-derived skeletal muscle cell line (L6). Forced overexpression of PARP1 in C2C12 myotubes sensitized the cells to oxidant-induced injury. Taken together, our data indicate that the reduction of PARP-1 expression during the process of the skeletal muscle differentiation serves as a protective mechanism to maintain the cellular functions of skeletal muscle during oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2428764380,"CUX1 and CUX2 proteins are characterized by the presence of three highly similar regions called Cut repeats 1, 2, and 3. Although CUX1 is ubiquitously expressed, CUX2 plays an important role in the specification of neuronal cells and continues to be expressed in postmitotic neurons. Cut repeats from the CUX1 protein were recently shown to stimulate 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), an enzyme that removes oxidized purines from DNA and introduces a single strand break through its apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity to initiate base excision repair. Here, we investigated whether CUX2 plays a similar role in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Cux2 knockdown in embryonic cortical neurons increased levels of oxidative DNA damage. In vitro, Cut repeats from CUX2 increased the binding of OGG1 to 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-containing DNA and stimulated both the glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activities of OGG1. Genetic inactivation in mouse embryo fibroblasts or CUX2 knockdown in HCC38 cells delayed DNA repair and increased DNA damage. Conversely, ectopic expression of Cut repeats from CUX2 accelerated DNA repair and reduced levels of oxidative DNA damage. These results demonstrate that CUX2 functions as an accessory factor that stimulates the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Neurons produce a high level of reactive oxygen species because of their dependence on aerobic oxidation of glucose as their source of energy. Our results suggest that the persistent expression of CUX2 in postmitotic neurons contributes to the maintenance of genome integrity through its stimulation of oxidative DNA damage repair.

In mammalian cells, four DNA glycosylases specific for oxidized bases have been identified: 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), Nth homolog 1 (NTH1), and Nei-like 1 and 2 (NEIL1 and NEIL2). Although each of these glycosylases exhibits substrate preference, none has absolute specificity (for a review, see Ref. 12Hegde M.L. Hazra T.K. Mitra S.

DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases perform two enzymatic activities. The glycosylase activity involves hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to generate an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. Subsequently, an AP lyase activity generates a single strand nick 3′ to the AP site via β (OGG1 and NTH1) or β-δ (NEIL1 and NEIL2) elimination. End processing of the resulting single strand break is then performed by APE1 or polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase, and repair synthesis and ligation are accomplished by the short patch or long patch pathways (18Demple B.

BER is essential to all organisms, and DNA glycosylases, the key enzyme in this pathway, are highly conserved in evolution. Research on DNA glycosylases was originally carried out in bacterial systems, mostly Escherichia coli, and enzymes with similar activities were rapidly identified in eukaryotes and mammals (20Caradonna S.J.

Further research has led to the identification of a number of proteins that modulate the activity of BER enzymes through various mechanisms.

Knockdown or genetic inactivation of CUX1 was found to delay the repair of oxidative DNA damage, whereas higher CUX1 expression accelerated DNA repair. These findings suggest that a physiological role of CUX1 is to protect cells against mutagenesis in situations of oxidative stress. In cancer, however, this biochemical activity is exploited by RAS-driven tumor cells that generate high levels of ROS. Indeed, higher CUX1 expression prevents RAS-induced senescence and promotes the development of tumors from cells that spontaneously acquire an activating Kras mutation (53Ramdzan Z.M. Vadnais C.

Biochemical analysis of CUX2 revealed that various combinations of its DNA binding domains (CR1CR2, CR2CR3 and the homeodomain (CR2CR3HD), and CR3HD) exhibit DNA binding preferences similar to the corresponding domains of CUX1 (67Gingras H.

However, all CUX2 DNA binding domains exhibit very rapid DNA binding kinetics, suggesting that CUX2 does not bind stably to DNA, whereas an isoform of CUX1, called p110 CUX1, interacts stably with DNA and can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on promoter context (for reviews, see Refs. 68Hulea L.

In European waters the most extensive reefs are found at depths of 300 - 500 m on the continental margin. In Norwegian waters many of these reefs are located in areas of interest for oil and gas exploration and production. In this study drilling was carried out in the Morvin drill field in proximity to a number of small Lophelia pertusa coral reefs (closest reefs 100 m upstream and 350 m downstream of point of waste drill material release). In a novel monitoring study, ROV video surveys of 9 reefs were conducted prior, during, immediately after and >1 year after drilling operations. Behavior of coral polyps inhabiting reefs exposed to differing concentrations of drill cuttings and drilling fluids (waste drilling material) were compared. Levels of expected exposure to these waste materials were determined for each reef by modelling drill cutting transport following release, using accurate in-situ hydrodynamic data collected during the drilling period and drill cutting discharge data as parameters of a dispersal model. The presence / absence of associate reef species (Acesta excavata, Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis) were also determined from each survey video. There were no significant differences in Lophelia pertusa polyp behavior in corals modelled to have been exposed to pulses of >25 ppm drill cutting material and those modelled to be exposed to negligible concentrations of material. From the video data collected, there were no observed degradations of reef structure over time, nor reductions of associate fauna abundance, regardless of modelled exposure concentration at any of the surveyed reefs. This study focused exclusively on adult fauna, and did not assess the potential hazard posed by waste drilling material to coral or other larvae. Video data was collected by various ROV's, using different camera and lighting setups throughout the survey campaign, making comparison of observations prior, during and post drilling problematic. A standardization of video monitoring in future monitoring campaigns is recommended."

The sn-1,3-specific lipase from Aspergillus oryzae (AOL) is highly and efficiently immobilized with the polystyrene-based hydrophobic resin D3520, with a significant 49.54-fold increase in specific lipase activity compared with the AOL powder in catalyzing the synthesis of OPO through the acidolysis between palm stearin and oleic acid (OA). The optimal immobilization conditions were investigated, including time course, initial protein concentration and solution pH. The sn-1,3 specificity of lipases under different immobilization conditions was evaluated and identified as positively associated with the lipase activity, and the pH of the immobilization solution influenced the regiospecificity and synthetic activity of these lipases. Immobilized AOL D3520, as the biocatalyst, was used for the enzymatic synthesis of the structured lipid OPO through the acidolysis between palm stearin and OA. The following conditions were optimized for the synthesis of structured lipid OPO: 65 °C temperature; 1:8 substrate molar ratio between palm stearin and OA; 8% (w/w) enzyme load; 3.5% water content of the immobilized lipase; and 1 h reaction time. Under these conditions, highly efficient C52 production (45.65%) was achieved, with a tripalmitin content of 2.75% and a sn-2 palmitic acid (PA) proportion of 55.08% in the system."

Characterising the effect of small molecules on cell cycle distribution is important for understanding their mechanism of action especially in oncology drug discovery but also for understanding potential toxicology liabilities. Here, a high-throughput phenotypic assay utilising the PerkinElmer Operetta high-content imager and Harmony software to determine cell cycle distribution is described. PhenoLOGIC, a machine learning algorithm within Harmony software was employed to robustly separate single cells from cell clumps. DNA content, EdU incorporation and pHH3 (S10) expression levels were subsequently utilised to separate cells into the various phases of the cell cycle. The assay is amenable to multiplexing with an additional pharmacodynamic marker to assess cell cycle changes within a specific cellular sub-population. Using this approach, the cell cycle distribution of γH2AX positive nuclei was determined following treatment with DNA damaging agents. Likewise, the assay can be multiplexed with Ki67 to determine the fraction of quiescent cells and with BrdU dual labelling to determine S-phase duration. This methodology therefore provides a relatively cheap, quick and high-throughput phenotypic method for determining accurate cell cycle distribution for small molecule mechanism of action and drug toxicity studies."
https://openalex.org/W1026429265,"Because hearts with a temporally induced knockout of acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (Acsl1(T-/-)) are virtually unable to oxidize fatty acids, glucose use increases 8-fold to compensate. This metabolic switch activates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which initiates growth by increasing protein and RNA synthesis and fatty acid metabolism, while decreasing autophagy. Compared with controls, Acsl1(T-/-) hearts contained 3 times more mitochondria with abnormal structure and displayed a 35-43% lower respiratory function. To study the effects of mTORC1 activation on mitochondrial structure and function, mTORC1 was inhibited by treating Acsl1(T-/-) and littermate control mice with rapamycin or vehicle alone for 2 wk. Rapamycin treatment normalized mitochondrial structure, number, and the maximal respiration rate in Acsl1(T-/-) hearts, but did not improve ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption, which was likely caused by the 33-51% lower ATP synthase activity present in both vehicle- and rapamycin-treated Acsl1(T-/-) hearts. The turnover of microtubule associated protein light chain 3b in Acsl1(T-/-) hearts was 88% lower than controls, indicating a diminished rate of autophagy. Rapamycin treatment increased autophagy to a rate that was 3.1-fold higher than in controls, allowing the formation of autophagolysosomes and the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Thus, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase isoform 1 (ACSL1) deficiency in the heart activated mTORC1, thereby inhibiting autophagy and increasing the number of damaged mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1958221304,"The NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is one of the main sources of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and is involved in several inflammatory-related pathologies.

Results showed that basal pain sensitivity is unaltered in NLRP3-/- mice as well as responses to formalin test. Spared nerve injury (SNI) surgery induced the development of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in a similar way in both genotypes and did not modify mRNA levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome components in the spinal cord. Intrathecal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection increases apoptosis-associated speck like protein (ASC), caspase-1 and IL-1β expression in both wildtype and NLRP3-/- mice.

https://openalex.org/W2406400975,"Cisplatin and its derivatives, nitrogen mustards and mitomycin C, are used widely in cancer chemotherapy. Their efficacy is linked primarily to their ability to generate DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs), which effectively block the progression of transcription and replication machineries. Release of this block, referred to as unhooking, has been postulated to require endonucleases that incise one strand of the duplex on either side of the ICL. Here we investigated how the 5′ flap nucleases FANCD2-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), exonuclease 1 (EXO1), and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) process a substrate reminiscent of a replication fork arrested at an ICL. We now show that EXO1 and FEN1 cleaved the substrate at the boundary between the single-stranded 5′ flap and the duplex, whereas FAN1 incised it three to four nucleotides in the double-stranded region. This affected the outcome of processing of a substrate containing a nitrogen mustard-like ICL two nucleotides in the duplex region because FAN1, unlike EXO1 and FEN1, incised the substrate predominantly beyond the ICL and, therefore, failed to release the 5′ flap. We also show that FAN1 was able to degrade a linear ICL substrate. This ability of FAN1 to traverse ICLs in DNA could help to elucidate its biological function, which is currently unknown. Cisplatin and its derivatives, nitrogen mustards and mitomycin C, are used widely in cancer chemotherapy.

Release of this block, referred to as unhooking, has been postulated to require endonucleases that incise one strand of the duplex on either side of the ICL. Here we investigated how the 5′ flap nucleases FANCD2-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), exonuclease 1 (EXO1), and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) process a substrate reminiscent of a replication fork arrested at an ICL. We now show that EXO1 and FEN1 cleaved the substrate at the boundary between the single-stranded 5′ flap and the duplex, whereas FAN1 incised it three to four nucleotides in the double-stranded region. This affected the outcome of processing of a substrate containing a nitrogen mustard-like ICL two nucleotides in the duplex region because FAN1, unlike EXO1 and FEN1, incised the substrate predominantly beyond the ICL and, therefore, failed to release the 5′ flap. We also show that FAN1 was able to degrade a linear ICL substrate. This ability of FAN1 to traverse ICLs in DNA could help to elucidate its biological function, which is currently unknown. DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) 2The abbreviations used are: ICLinterstrand cross-linkFAFanconi anemiaMMCmitomycin Csssingle-strandeddsdouble-strandedNMnitrogen mustardDSBdouble strand break. are highly cytotoxic because of their propensity to block both transcription and replication (1Schärer O.D. DNA interstrand crosslinks: natural and drug-induced DNA adducts that induce unique cellular responses.ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In all organisms studied to date, ICL repair involves protein constituents of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, translesion polymerases, and the machinery of homologous recombination (2Hinz J.M. Role of homologous recombination in DNA interstrand crosslink repair.Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2010; 51: 582-603PubMed Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, ICL processing also requires proteins of the FANC complementation group and their interactors. Correspondingly, cells lacking these proteins are exquisitely sensitive to ICL-inducing agents. This is of substantial clinical relevance. Mutations in genes encoding FANC polypeptides predispose to Fanconi anemia (FA), a severe genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities and cancer predisposition, and cellular sensitivity to the cross-linking agents diepoxybutane or mitomycin C (MMC) is used in FA diagnosis (3Auerbach A.D. Fanconi anemia and its diagnosis.Mutat. Res. 2009; 668: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). interstrand cross-link Fanconi anemia mitomycin C single-stranded double-stranded nitrogen mustard double strand break. Of the 17 FANC proteins identified to date, eight form the so-called core complex, which is activated at stalled replication forks by the ATR kinase. The FANCL subunit of the activated core complex monoubiquitylates the FANCD2/FANCI heterodimer that is believed to recruit to the cross-linked site in chromatin the polypeptides required for ICL removal (4Crossan G.P. Patel K.J. The Fanconi anaemia pathway orchestrates incisions at sites of crosslinked DNA.J. Pathol. 2012; 226: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the first step, these proteins have to separate the cross-linked strands in a process referred to as “unhooking,” in which one strand of the duplex is nucleolytically incised on either side of the cross-link. Studies carried out during the past three decades helped to identify several nuclease-encoding genes, the disruption of which results in sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents, and biochemical characterization of their respective gene products confirmed that these nucleases could indeed be involved in ICL unhooking. The primary candidates are SLX1-SLX4, XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, SNM1A, and FAN1. Despite some seminal mechanistic studies that have been described in the recent literature (reviewed in Ref. 5Zhang J. Walter J.C. Mechanism and regulation of incisions during DNA interstrand cross-link repair.DNA Repair. 2014; 19: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), our understanding of the possible functions of these enzymes in ICL unhooking is still rudimentary. The situation is further complicated by functional redundancies of several of the involved proteins, their interplay with other members of the ICL repair pathway, and differences in helical distortions induced by different types of ICLs (6Clauson C.

As a consequence, FAN1 was predicted to be a novel FANC protein. However, experiments with chicken DT40 knockout cell lines failed to yield evidence of an epistasis between FAN1 and FANCC or FANCJ (13Yoshikiyo K. Kratz K. Hirota K. Nishihara K. Takata M. Kurumizaka H. Horimoto S. Takeda S. Jiricny J. KIAA1018/FAN1 nuclease protects cells against genomic instability induced by interstrand cross-linking agents.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21553-21557Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and no mutations in FAN1 were identified in unassigned FA patients. Instead, FAN1 loss has been linked to karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (14Zhou W. Otto E.A. Cluckey A. Airik R. Hurd T.W. Chaki M. Diaz K. Lach F.P. Bennett G.R. Gee H.Y. Ghosh A.K. Natarajan S.

FAN1 mutations cause karyomegalic interstitial nephritis, linking chronic kidney failure to defective DNA damage repair.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, even though its involvement in ICL processing is beyond doubt, FAN1 does not appear to be a FANC protein. However, current evidence does not exclude the possibility that FAN1 does participate in the FANC pathway but that its deficiency does not lead to FA because of functional redundancy with other polypeptide(s). In an attempt to address the latter point, we set out to compare how structures resembling ICL-blocked replication forks are addressed by three 5′ flap endonucleases and 5′ to 3′ exonucleases with known roles in DNA replication and repair: EXO1, FAN1, and FEN1. EXO1 (15Orans J. McSweeney E.A. Iyer R.R. Hast M.A. Hellinga H.W. Modrich P. Beese L.S.

Lafrance-Vanasse J. Tainer J.A. The cutting edges in DNA repair, licensing, and fidelity: DNA and RNA repair nucleases sculpt DNA to measure twice, cut once.DNA Repair. 2014; 19: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). FAN1 has been shown to incise 5′ flap structures two to four nucleotides 3′ from the ss/ds junction (9Kratz K. Schöpf B. Kaden S. Sendoel A. Eberhard R. Lademann C. Cannavó E. Sartori A.A.

Given their similar substrate specificities, we wondered whether these enzymes could compensate for one another in ICL processing. We therefore synthesized a 5′ flap structure containing a single cross-link resembling an ICL induced by nitrogen mustards (NMs), positioned two nucleotides 3′ from the ss/ds junction (18Mukherjee S. Guainazzi A. Schärer O.D. Synthesis of structurally diverse major groove DNA interstrand crosslinks using three different aldehyde precursors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 7429-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As controls, we also synthesized a linear duplex containing a similar ICL as well as several unmodified substrates. We now show that all three enzymes could cleave the 5′ flaps but that FAN1 was also able to traverse the cross-link on both ICL substrates. Furthermore, we show that FAN1 depletion leads to a reduction in the number of MMC-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). This could imply that FAN1-dependent processing of ICLs leads to the generation of repairable DSBs, whereas FAN1 absence or malfunction may lead to ICL persistence and cytotoxicity.

FEN1 was purchased from Gentaur (catalog no. C140). Unless stated otherwise, the nuclease assays were carried out by incubating the substrates for 30 min at 37 °C in the appropriate nuclease buffer (see above). Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points, mixed with an equal volume of loading dye (80% formamide, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 1 mm EDTA), and loaded on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (20 × 20 × 0.05 cm) that were run in TBE buffer for 1 h at 800 V. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to phospho screens, which were then scanned in a PhosphorImager (Typhoon 9400, GE Healthcare). Quantification of the bands was carried out using ImageJ, and the graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism. The overall efficiency of substrate processing was obtained by dividing the integral values of all the product bands by the integral value of all the bands. The cleavage efficiencies of the 5′ flaps in the unmodified and ICL substrates were calculated by dividing the integral values of the product bands by the integral value of all bands.

Experimental evidence implicating FAN1 in this process has, however, not been forthcoming. In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, FAN1 depletion caused no detectable defect in unhooking of a single ICL in a plasmid substrate, but this could be explained by functional redundancy with other nucleases in the extract (23Klein Douwel D.

To learn with which nuclease FAN1 could be redundant, we set out to test its ability to process a 5′ flap substrate containing a single NM-like ICL (Fig. 1A) and compared it with those of two other 5′ flap endonucleases, EXO1 and FEN1.

TTMs have an unusual tunnel domain fold that harbors substrate- and metal co-factor binding sites. It is presently poorly understood how TTMs specifically sense different triphosphate-containing substrates and how catalysis occurs in the tunnel center. Here we describe substrate-bound structures of inorganic polyphosphatases from Arabidopsis and Escherichia coli, which reveal an unorthodox yet conserved mode of triphosphate and metal co-factor binding. We identify two metal binding sites in these enzymes, with one co-factor involved in substrate coordination and the other in catalysis. Structural comparisons with a substrate- and product-bound mammalian thiamine triphosphatase and with previously reported structures of mRNA capping enzymes, adenylate cyclases, and polyphosphate polymerases suggest that directionality of substrate binding defines TTM catalytic activity. Our work provides insight into the evolution and functional diversification of an ancient enzyme family.

Our work provides insight into the evolution and functional diversification of an ancient enzyme family. Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a linear polymer of orthophosphate units joined by phosphoanhydride bonds. It occurs ubiquitously and abundantly in all life forms (1Rao N.N. Gómez-García M.R.

A staggering number of different catalytic activities and substrate preferences has been reported within the TTM family (10Bettendorff L. Wins P. Thiamine triphosphatase and the CYTH superfamily of proteins.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 6443-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the lack of substrate- and product-bound structures has made it difficult to define the sequence-fingerprints responsible for a specific enzyme activity in individual family members. AtTTM3 (Uniprot ID Q9SIY3) was cloned into vector pMH-HT providing an N-terminal His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. Protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) RIL to A600 nm = 0.6 was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-galactoside in terrific broth at 16 °C for 16 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 30 min, washed in PBS buffer, centrifuged again at 4500 × g for 15 min, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For protein purification cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), homogenized (Emulsiflex C-3, Avestin), and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ affinity column (HisTrap HP 5 ml, GE Healthcare), washed with 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 1 m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and eluted in lysis buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The His6 tag was cleaved with tobacco etch virus for 16 h at 4 °C during dialysis against lysis buffer. AtTTM3 was further purified by a second Ni2+ affinity step and by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR26/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Monomeric peak fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and concentrated to 35 mg/ml for crystallization. Protein concentrations were estimated by protein absorption at 280 nm using the calculated molecular extinction coefficient. Site-specific mutations were introduced by PCR, and mutant proteins were purified like wild type. The coding sequence of ygiF was amplified from genomic DNA (E. coli Mach 1 cells, Life Technologies) by PCR, and a synthetic gene coding for full-length mouse ThTPase (Uniprot ID Q8JZL3) and codon-optimized for expression in E. coli was obtained from Geneart (Life Technologies). Coding sequences were cloned into plasmid pMH-HT, and expression and purification were performed as described for AtTTM3. Tetragonal AtTTM3 crystals (form A) developed at room temperature from hanging drops composed of 1.5 μl of protein solution and 1.5 μl of crystallization buffer (2.6 m NaCl, 0.1 m citric acid/NaOH (pH 5.0)) suspended over 1.0 ml of the latter as reservoir solution. Crystals were transferred in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and 0.5 m KI for 20 s and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data were collected on a Rigaku MicroMax rotating anode equipped with a copper filament, osmic mirrors, and an R-AXIS IV++ detector. Subsequently, an isomorphous native dataset was collected on a crystal originating from the same crystallization drop (see Table 1). A monoclinic crystal form (form B) developed in 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Bis-Tris (pH 7.0) and diffracted up to 1.3 Å resolution. Data processing and scaling were done with XDS (November 2014 version) (28Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Hexagonal crystals for full-length ygiF grew at room temperature in hanging drops (1.5 μl and 1.5 μl) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 20 (w/v) PEG 3350. Crystals were transferred into crystallization buffer supplemented with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For phasing, 0.1 m NaI was added to the cryo solution, and crystals were soaked for 5 min. SAD data were collected at a wavelength of 1.9 Å (see Table 2). Tetragonal mouse ThTPase crystals (form A) developed at room temperature from hanging drops composed of 1.5 μl of protein solution and 1.5 μl of crystallization buffer (27% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 m Tris (pH 9.0), 0.2 m MgCl2) suspended over 1.0 ml of the latter as reservoir solution. Crystals were transferred into a reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Monoclinic crystals (form B) developed in 1.6 m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (1:1 ratio) and were cryo-protected by stepwise transfer into a solution containing 1.6 m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for AtTTM3AtTTM3 NaI soak (Co Kα)AtTTM3/PPPi/Mg2+ (form A)AtTTM3/PPPi/Mn2+ (form A)AtTTM3/PPPi/Mn2+ (form A; Mn-K edge)AtTTM3/PPPi/Mn2+ (form B)AtTTM3/PPPi/Mn2+ (form B, Mn-K edge)AtTTM3/Pi/Mn2+PDB ID5a5y5a665a675a68Data collectionBeam lineIn houseSLS PXIISLS PXIISLS PXIISLS PXIIISLS PXIIISLS PXIIWavelength (Å)1.541.01.01.81.01.821.0Space groupI422I422I422I422P21P21P21Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)136.03, 136.03, 145.64136.33, 136.33, 144.20136.27, 136.27, 145.48136.32, 136.32, 145.9944.37, 33.87, 72.2244.36, 33.87, 72.3244.22, 33.81, 71.81α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 94.96, 9090, 94.98, 9090, 94.4, 90Resolution (Å)19.76-2.6045.33-1.9248.18-2.0548.20-2.7619.61-1.3044.19-2.5243.20-1.67(2.76-2.60)(2.04-1.92)(2.17-2.05)(2.93-2.76)(1.37-1.30)(2.67-2.52)(1.77-1.67)Rsym0.145 (0.763)0.076 (1.212)0.088 (0.74)0.266 (1.117)0.046 (0.772)0.038 (0.061)0.085 (0.615)I/σI12.11 (1.96)20.06 (2.18)19.13 (2.20)12.02 (1.82)20.04 (1.94)25.29 (15.68)9.5 (1.73)Completeness (%)98.8 (93.9)98.5 (90.8)98.0 (88.1)98.1 (88.6)98.3 (93.3)98.4 (95.0)94.4 (76.8)Redundancy5.02 (3.75)10.59 (8.35)11.73 (6.47)8.34 (6.52)6.24 (5.27)3.30 (3.08)4.1 (2.95)RefinementResolution (Å)45.33-1.9248.18–2.0519.61-1.3043.20-1.67No. reflections46,15038,45150,17221,931Rwork/Rfree0.153/0.1980.182/0.2200.138/0.1740.182/0.222No. atomsProtein3455345517751670Pi/PPi/PPPi26261310Mg2+/Mn2+2223Water239227248135B-factorsProtein38.6030.0715.0715.65Pi/PPi/PPPi34.7829.4118.3434.16Mg2+/Mn2+36.0029.9720.5021.43Water44.8240.8935.3339.39r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.0070.0060.0130.010Bond angles (°)1.2681.0981.3771.486Ramachandran plot (%)Favored99.399.3100100Outliers0000 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for ygiFygiF (NaI soak)ygiF/PPPi/Mg2+ygiF/PPPi/Mn2+ygiF/PPPi/Mn2+ (Mn-K edge)PDB ID5a605a61Data collectionBeam lineSLS PXIISLS PXIISLS PXIISLS PXIIWavelength (Å)1.91.01.01.7Space groupP65P65P65P65Cell dimensionsa = b, c (Å)91.11, 125.5689.92, 125.5889.68, 125.3389.95, 125.31α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 12090, 90, 12090, 90, 12090, 90, 120Resolution (Å)49.127-2.7048.88-1.8248.77-1.5048.74-1.86(2.87-2.70)(1.93-1.82)(1.59-1.50)(1.97-1.86)Rsym0.077 (0.186)0.068 (0.944)0.036 (1.20)0.037 (0.313)I/σI31.08 (11.28)14.91 (2.18)23.90 (1.93)26.80 (3.91)Completeness (%)95.8 (90.2)98.8 (96.9)99.7 (98.3)97.9 (90.2)Redundancy19.63 (18.47)9.70 (9.06)15.48 (14.18)8.30 (3.55)RefinementResolution (Å)48.88-1.8248.77–1.50No. reflections47,52086,573Rwork/ Rfree0.150/0.1890.151/0.171No. atomsProtein33983395Pi/PPi/PPPi1313Mg2+/Mn2+22Water289295B-factorsProtein55.8352.41Pi/PPi/PPPi46.8342.84Mg2+/Mn2+46.6542.53Water58.3458.82r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.0070.006Bond angles (°)1.1491.186Ramachandran plot (%)Favored99.199.3Outliers00 Open table in a new tab AtTTM3-PPPi-Mg2+/Mn2+ form A crystals were transferred into the soaking solution (2.6 m NaCl, 0.1 Bis-Tris (pH 5), 10 mm sodium tripolyphosphate (Sigma), 10 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2), 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol) by serial transfer to replace the citrate otherwise bound to the tunnel center. For AtTTM3-PPPi-Mg2+/Mn2+, form B crystals were soaked for 20–30 min in 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Bis-Tris pH 7.0, 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 10 mm sodium tripolyphosphate, 5 mm MnCl2 using the same procedure as outlined above (substrate-bound structure). For AtTTM3-Pi-Mn2+, AtTTM3 was co-crystallized with 5 mm sodium tripolyphosphate and 10 mm MnCl2 (product-bound structure). For ygiF-PPPi-Mg2+/Mn2+, the substrate-bound complex was obtained by soaking (20–30 min) ygiF apo crystals in their crystallization buffer supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm sodium tripolyphosphate and 5 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2. ThTPase-ThTP-Mg2+. Form B crystals were soaked in crystallization buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm thiamine triphosphate and 10 mm MgCl2. For ThTPase-ThDP-Mg2+, the product-bound structure was obtained by soaking form A crystals in a solution containing 10 mm sodium tripolyphosphate and 10 mm MnCl2 for 30 min. Two data sets were collected, one with λ = 1.0 Å and one close to the Mn-K edge (λ = 1.9 Å). No anomalous signal was found in the latter data set, possibly due to the high MgCl2 (0.2 m) concentration present in the crystallization buffer. To solve the structure of AtTTM3, SAD and native data were scaled together with the program XPREP (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI) for SIRAS (single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) phasing.

A series of one-dimensional 31P NMR experiments was acquired at 310 K with a 600-MHz Bruker Avance-III spectrometer using a QXI probe-head allowing direct detection of 31P and equipped with a z-spoil gradient coil. 31P spectra were recorded using a relaxation delay of 1 s and an acquisition time of 42.6 ms (spectral width = 12,019.23 Hz). 128 scans were collected, resulting in a measurement time of 140 s per spectrum. 512 spectra were collected over a total acquisition time of ∼20 h. The enzymatic reaction was performed using 50 nm AtTTM3 and 5 mm sodium tripolyphosphate in 20 mm Bis-Tris propane (pH 8.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 mixture. Deuterated water was added to a final concentration of 20% to the reaction mix before starting the experiment. Spectral parameters were calibrated and optimized on a 5 mm sodium tripolyphosphate sample to minimize time loss between the beginning of the reaction and the beginning of its observation by NMR. Spectra were processed using Topspin (version 2.1.6) (Bruker). For the determination of the phosphohydrolase activity 2.5 nm AtTTM3 were incubated with 0.5 μm concentrations of the different phosphate-containing substrates in reaction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Bis-Tris propane (pH 8.5), 5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped after 10 min, and the amount of free inorganic phosphate released was measured using the malachite green assay with minor modifications (37Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. A malachite green procedure for orthophosphate determination and its use in alkaline phosphatase-based enzyme immunoassay.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). 100 μl of reaction solution were mixed with 28 μl of dye mix (3 mm malachite green, 15% (v/v) sulfuric acid, 1.5% molybdate (w/v), 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20). After 5 min of incubation with the dye, the absorption at 595 nm was measured using a synergy H4 plate reader (Biotek). For each substrate a blank reaction was prepared lacking the enzyme. Controls either contained EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm, or the enzyme was heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. To compare wild-type and mutant versions of AtTTM3 and ygiF, enzyme concentrations were increased to 180 nm to detect residual activity for some of the mutant proteins. Experiments were performed in triplicate; average values are plotted ±S.D. Thermal shift assays were performed as previously described (38Cummings M.D. Farnum M.A. Nelen M.I. Universal screening methods and applications of ThermoFluor.J. Biomol. Screen. 2006; 11: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Sypro Orange (Sigma) was added to wild-type and mutant AtTTM3 proteins in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol mixed with Sypro Orange to a final protein concentration of 10 μm. The protein-dye mixtures were loaded into a 96-well RT-PCR plate (Thermo Scientific), and measurements were performed using a C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). The fluorescence of SYPRO Orange was continously monitored at 570 nm, as a temperature gradient was applied (0.05 °C/s from 10 °C to 95 °C). Data were analyzed using the CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad). The maximum of the first derivative for each melting curve indicates the melting point of the protein. Experiments were performed in triplicate; average values are plotted ±S.D. Reactions contained 50 μm concentrations of the respective enzyme (AtTTM3, ygiF, mouse ThTPase, Vtc4p) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Bis-Tris propane (pH 8.3), 1 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm ATP as substrate. Reactions were incubated at room temperature overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding Proteinase K (Sigma), and the resulting samples were mixed 1:1 with sample buffer (50% (w/v) urea, 2× Tris borate-EDTA, 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue).

Methods Forty-eight patients, all diagnosed with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 in 2009, were retrospectively included in this study. Each patient in the study was monitored for 11-13 months by standard pulmonary function examination. The examination included monitoring respiratory tract infection symptoms (cough, expectoration or gasping) and vital signs. Long-term changes in symptoms and changes in vital signs were correlated back to and compared with the severity of the initial H1N1 influenza infection. Results One year post discharge, mild to moderate pulmonary dysfunction was observed in the majority of patients. Further, 54.2% of patients had signs of severe abnormal pulmonary function, including diffusion disorder (33.3%) and small airway dysfunction (33.3%). Fourteen patients presented with respiratory tract infection symptoms; 12 with abnormal pulmonary function and two with normal pulmonary function. Our results indicated that the change in pulmonary function at one year post discharge was not significantly correlated with the severity of H1N1 influenza. Conclusion Signs and symptoms of abnormal pulmonary function accompanied by respiratory tract infection symptoms remain for some patients after one year following discharge from the hospital for mild influenza A virus subtype H1N1 infection. These patients should continue to be monitored for any changes in condition and symptoms and rehabilitation treatment should be provided when necessary."

In this study lysozyme prefibrillar oligomers and fibrils in both mature and sonicated states have been isolated through an optimized ultrafiltration/ultracentrifugation method and characterized with various optical spectroscopic techniques, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We examined their level and mode of toxicity on rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells in both differentiated and undifferentiated states. We find that oligomers and fibrils display cytotoxic capabilities toward cultured cells in vitro, with oligomers producing elevated levels of cellular injury toward undifferentiated PC12 cells (PC12undiff). Furthermore, dual flow cytometry staining experiments demonstrate that the oligomers and mature fibrils induce divergent cellular death pathways (apoptosis and secondary necrosis, respectively) in these PC12 cells. We have also shown that oligomers but not sonicated mature fibrils inhibit hippocampal long term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity implicated in learning and memory, in vivo. We conclude that our in vitro and in vivo findings confer a level of resistance toward amyloid fibrils, and that the PC 12-based comparative cytotoxicity assay can provide insights into toxicity differences between differently aggregated protein species.

https://openalex.org/W1513077219,"Leucocytozoon parasites infect a large number of avian hosts, including domestic chicken, and cause significant economical loss to the poultry industry. Although the transmission stages of the parasites were observed in avian blood cells more than a century ago, the specific host cell type(s) that the gametocytes infect remain uncertain. Because all the avian blood cells, including red blood cells (RBCs), are nucleated, and the developing parasites dramatically change the morphology of the infected host cells, it has been difficult to identify Leucocytozoon infected host cell(s). Here we use cell-type specific antibodies to investigate the identities of the host cells infected by Leucocytozoon sabrazesi gametocytes. Anti-RBC antibodies stained RBCs membrane strongly, but not the parasite-infected cells, ruling out the possibility of RBCs being the infected host cells. Antibodies recognizing various leukocytes including heterophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages did not stain the infected cells either. Antisera raised against a peptide of the parasite cytochrome B (CYTB) stained parasite-infected cells and some leukocytes, particularly cells with a single round nucleus as well as clear/pale cytoplasm suggestive of thrombocytes. Finally, a monoclonal antibody known to specifically bind chicken thrombocytes also stained the infected cells, confirming that L. sabrazesi gametocytes develop within chicken thrombocytes. The identification of L. sabrazesi infected host cell solves a long unresolved puzzle and provides important information for studying parasite invasion of host cells and for developing reagents to interrupt parasite transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1950158767,"We present a study of the metabolism of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis after exposure to antibiotics using proteomics data and flux balance analysis (FBA). The use of FBA to study prokaryotic organisms is well-established and allows insights into the metabolic pathways chosen by the organisms under different environmental conditions. To apply FBA a specific objective function must be selected that represents the metabolic goal of the organism. FBA estimates the metabolism of the cell by linear programming constrained by the stoichiometry of the reactions in an in silico metabolic model of the organism. It is assumed that the metabolism of the organism works towards the specified objective function. A common objective is the maximization of biomass. However, this goal is not suitable for situations when the bacterium is exposed to antibiotics, as the goal of organisms in these cases is survival and not necessarily optimal growth. In this paper we propose a new approach for defining the FBA objective function in studies when the bacterium is under stress. The function is defined based on protein expression data. The proposed methodology is applied to the case when the bacterium is exposed to the drug mefloquine, but can be easily extended to other organisms, conditions or drugs. We compare our method with an alternative method that uses experimental data for adjusting flux constraints. We perform comparisons in terms of essential enzymes and agreement using enzyme abundances. Results indicate that using proteomics data to define FBA objective functions yields less essential reactions with zero flux and lower error rates in prediction accuracy. With flux variability analysis we observe that overall variability due to alternate optima is reduced with the incorporation of proteomics data. We believe that incorporating proteomics data in the objective function used in FBA may help obtain metabolic flux representations that better support experimentally observed features."
https://openalex.org/W977409017,"A key component of eukaryotic lipid homeostasis is the esterification of sterols with fatty acids by sterol O-acyltransferases (SOATs). The esterification reactions are allosterically activated by their sterol substrates, the majority of which accumulate at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that in yeast, sterol transport from the plasma membrane to the site of esterification is associated with the physical interaction of the major SOAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-related enzyme (Are)2p, with 2 plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: Aus1p and Pdr11p. Are2p, Aus1p, and Pdr11p, unlike the minor acyltransferase, Are1p, colocalize to sterol and sphingolipid-enriched, detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs). Deletion of either ABC transporter results in Are2p relocalization to detergent-soluble membrane domains and a significant decrease (53-36%) in esterification of exogenous sterol. Similarly, in murine tissues, the SOAT1/Acat1 enzyme and activity localize to DRMs. This subcellular localization is diminished upon deletion of murine ABC transporters, such as Abcg1, which itself is DRM associated. We propose that the close proximity of sterol esterification and transport proteins to each other combined with their residence in lipid-enriched membrane microdomains facilitates rapid, high-capacity sterol transport and esterification, obviating any requirement for soluble intermediary proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1027546764,"C1q/TNF-related protein-3 (CTRP3) is a novel adipokine with roles in multiple cellular processes. However, little is known about its function in prostate cells. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of CTRP3 in prostate cells. We first generated and purified CTRP3 protein in HEK 293T cells. Proliferation of RWPE-1 prostate cells was evaluated by MTT analyses under treatment with different concentrations of CTRP3 for various exposure times. The results revealed maximum enhancement of proliferation with 10 μg/mL CTRP3 for 72 h. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by TUNEL staining and flow cytometry analysis. TUNEL assay showed decreased TUNEL-positive cells in RWPE-1 prostate cells treated with CTRP3, and flow cytometry showed significantly decreased apoptotic cells upon CTRP3 treatment (treated cells, 8.34±1.175 vs. controls, 20.163±0.35) (P < 0.01). Moreover, flow cytometry analysis also showed a significant decrease of cells in the G1 phase and an increase of cells in the S and G2 phase upon CTRP3 treatment (treated cells, 42.85±1.40 vs. control, 52.77±0.90; 28.41±0.57 vs. 23.49±1.13; 27.08±1.97 vs. 22.20±1.32, respectively) (all P < 0.05). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified differentially expressed proteins, including cytokeratin-19, GLRX3 and DDAH1, which were upregulated in CTRP3 treated cells, and cytokeratin-17 and 14-3-3 sigma, which were downregulated. GLRX3, DDAH1 and 14-3-3 sigma were confirmed using western blot analysis. A PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, was used to inhibit PKC activity in CTRP3 treated RWPE-1 cells. Staurosporine completely abolished the CTRP3-induced increased phosphorylation of intracellular PKC substrates and CTRP3-stimulated effect by RWPE-1 cells. Our results provide the first evidence for a physiological role of the novel adipokine, CTRP3, in prostate cells. Our findings suggest that CTRP3 could improve proliferation and anti-apoptosis of prostate cells through protein kinase C signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1928464948,"In land systems, equitably managing trade-offs between planetary boundaries and human development needs represents a grand challenge in sustainability oriented initiatives. Informing such initiatives requires knowledge about the nexus between land use, poverty, and environment. This paper presents results from Lao PDR, where we combined nationwide spatial data on land use types and the environmental state of landscapes with village-level poverty indicators. Our analysis reveals two general but contrasting trends. First, landscapes with paddy or permanent agriculture allow a greater number of people to live in less poverty but come at the price of a decrease in natural vegetation cover. Second, people practising extensive swidden agriculture and living in intact environments are often better off than people in degraded paddy or permanent agriculture. As poverty rates within different landscape types vary more than between landscape types, we cannot stipulate a land use-poverty-environment nexus. However, the distinct spatial patterns or configurations of these rates point to other important factors at play. Drawing on ethnicity as a proximate factor for endogenous development potentials and accessibility as a proximate factor for external influences, we further explore these linkages. Ethnicity is strongly related to poverty in all land use types almost independently of accessibility, implying that social distance outweighs geographic or physical distance. In turn, accessibility, almost a precondition for poverty alleviation, is mainly beneficial to ethnic majority groups and people living in paddy or permanent agriculture. These groups are able to translate improved accessibility into poverty alleviation. Our results show that the concurrence of external influences with local-highly contextual-development potentials is key to shaping outcomes of the land use-poverty-environment nexus. By addressing such leverage points, these findings help guide more effective development interventions. At the same time, they point to the need in land change science to better integrate the understanding of place-based land indicators with process-based drivers of land use change."

A total of 61 species belonging to 33 families were recorded from the suburban area. 55 species belonging to 32 families were observed in nearby wildland habitat consisting of natural vegetation whereas only 26 species belonging to 18 families were observed in urban area. Results indicated that the suburban habitat had more complex bird community structure in terms of higher species richness, higher species diversity and higher evenness in comparison to urban and wildland habitat. Bird species richness and diversity varied across seasons. Maximum species richness and diversity was observed during spring season in all type of habitat. Most of the birds observed in urban areas were found to belong to either rare or irregular category on the basis of their abundance. The observed pattern of avian community structure is due to combined effect of both environmental and human related disturbance variables."
https://openalex.org/W2232939500,"Punding, one of dopamine replacement treatment related complications, refers to aimless and stereotyped behaviors. To identify possible neural correlates of punding behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), we investigated the patterns of cognitive profiles and cortical thinning.Of the 186 subjects with PD screened during the study period, we prospectively enrolled 10 PD patients with punding and 43 without punding on the basis of a structured interview. We performed comprehensive neuropsychological tests and voxel-based and regions-of-interest (ROIs)-based cortical thickness analysis between PD patients with and without punding.The prevalence of punding in patients with PD was 5.4%. Punding behaviors were closely related to previous occupations or hobbies and showed a temporal relationship to changes of levodopa-equivalent dose (LED). Significant predisposing factors were a long duration of PD and intake of medications of PD, high total daily LED, dyskinesia, and impulse control disorder. Punding severity was correlated with LED (p = 0.029). The neurocognitive assessment revealed that PD patients with punding showed more severe cognitive deficits in the color Stroop task than did those without punding (p = 0.022). Voxel-based analysis showed that PD-punders had significant cortical thinning in the dorsolateral prefrontal area relative to controls. Additionally, ROI-based analysis revealed that cortical thinning in PD-punders relative to PD-nonpunders was localized in the prefrontal cortices, extending into orbitofrontal area.We demonstrated that PD patients with punding performed poorly on cognitive tasks in frontal executive functions and showed severe cortical thinning in the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal areas. These findings suggest that prefrontal modulation may be an essential component in the development of punding behavior in patients with PD."
https://openalex.org/W1661681884,"Healthcare-associated infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment is increasingly complicated by the escalating incidence of antimicrobial resistance. Among drug-resistant pathogens, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAb) is of increasing concern because of the limited applicable therapies and its expanding global distribution in developed countries and newly industrialized countries. Therefore, a rapid detection method that can be used even in resource-poor countries is urgently required to control this global public health threat. Conventional techniques, such as bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are insufficient to combat this threat because they are time-consuming and laborious. In this study, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for detecting blaOXA-23-positive CRAb, the most prevalent form of CRAb in Asia, especially in Thailand, and confirmed its efficacy as a surveillance tool in a clinical setting. Clinical samples of sputum and rectal swabs were collected from patients in a hospital in Bangkok and used for LAMP assays. After boiling and centrifugation, the supernatants were used directly in the assay. In parallel, a culture method was used for comparison purposes to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of LAMP. As a first step, a total of 120 sputum samples were collected. The sensitivity of LAMP was 88.6% (39/44), and its specificity was 92.1% (70/76) using the culture method as the “gold standard”. When surveillance samples including sputum and rectal swabs were analyzed with the LAMP assay, its sensitivity was 100.0%. This method enables the direct analysis of clinical specimens and provides results within 40 minutes of sample collection, making it a useful tool for surveillance even in resource-poor countries."
https://openalex.org/W2131793079,"Protein receptor conformations, obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, have become a promising treatment of its explicit flexibility in molecular docking experiments applied to drug discovery and development. However, incorporating the entire ensemble of MD conformations in docking experiments to screen large candidate compound libraries is currently an unfeasible task. Clustering algorithms have been widely used as a means to reduce such ensembles to a manageable size. Most studies investigate different algorithms using pairwise Root-Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values for all, or part of the MD conformations. Nevertheless, the RMSD only may not be the most appropriate gauge to cluster conformations when the target receptor has a plastic active site, since they are influenced by changes that occur on other parts of the structure. Hence, we have applied two partitioning methods (k-means and k-medoids) and four agglomerative hierarchical methods (Complete linkage, Ward's, Unweighted Pair Group Method and Weighted Pair Group Method) to analyze and compare the quality of partitions between a data set composed of properties from an enzyme receptor substrate-binding cavity and two data sets created using different RMSD approaches. Ensembles of representative MD conformations were generated by selecting a medoid of each group from all partitions analyzed. We investigated the performance of our new method for evaluating binding conformation of drug candidates to the InhA enzyme, which were performed by cross-docking experiments between a 20 ns MD trajectory and 20 different ligands. Statistical analyses showed that the novel ensemble, which is represented by only 0.48% of the MD conformations, was able to reproduce 75% of all dynamic behaviors within the binding cavity for the docking experiments performed. Moreover, this new approach not only outperforms the other two RMSD-clustering solutions, but it also shows to be a promising strategy to distill biologically relevant information from MD trajectories, especially for docking purposes."

The most common risk factor of acute lung injury is severe sepsis. Patients with sepsis-related acute respiratory distress syndrome have higher mortality. Recent studies reveal regulatory roles of Wnt3a and Wnt5a signaling in inflammatory processes. Wnt3a signaling has been implicated in anti-inflammatory effects, whereas Wnt5a signaling has been postulated to have pro-inflammatory properties. However, the balance between Wnt3a and Wnt5a signaling pathway in the lung of rats with endotoxic shock has not been determined. Thus, we investigated the major components of Wnt3a and Wnt5a signaling pathway in the lung of endotoxemic rats. Male Wistar rats were intravenously infused with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg). The changes of hemodynamics, biochemical variables, and arterial blood gas were examined during the experimental period. At 6 h after saline or LPS, animals were sacrificed, and lungs were obtained for analyzing superoxide production, water accumulation, histologic assessment, and protein expressions of Wnt3a and Wnt5a signaling pathway. Animals that received LPS showed circulatory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, hyperventilation, lung edema, and high mortality. The lung from rats with endotoxic shock exhibited significant decreases in the levels of Wnt3a, Fzd1, Dsh1, phosphorylated GSK-3β at Ser9, and β-catenin. In contrast, the expressions of Wnt5a, Fzd5, and CaMKII were up-regulated in the lung of endotoxemic rats. These findings indicate the major components of Wnt3a and Wnt5a signaling in the lung are disturbed under endotoxic insult."
https://openalex.org/W2220104944,"A highly sensitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method was developed in this study for efficient screening of triazophos residues in a large number of samples. Based on the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by China and CAC for triazophos in different agro-products, the representative apple, orange, cabbage, zucchini, and rice samples were selected as spiked samples, and the triazophos at the concentrations of the MRL values were spiked to blank samples. Subsequently, the five samples with the spiked triazophos standard were measured by CLEIA 100 times, and the detection results indicated that the correction factors of the apple, orange, cabbage, zucchini, and rice were determined as 0.79, 0.66, 0.85, 0.76, and 0.91, respectively. In this experiment, 1500 real samples were detected by both the CLEIA and the GC-MS methods. With the GC-MS method, 1462 samples were identified as negative samples and 38 samples as positive samples. Based on the correction factors, the false positive rate of the CLEIA method was 0.13%, and false negative rate was 0. The results showed that the established CLEIA method could be used to screen a large number of real samples."
https://openalex.org/W3023115372,"The earliest bioeroded inorganic hard substrates in the Ordovician of Estonia appear in the Dapingian. Hardgrounds are also known from the Sandbian and Katian. Most of the bioerosion of inorganic hard substrates occurs as the boring Trypanites Mägdefrau, 1932 along with some possible Gastrochaenolites borings. North American hardground borings are more diverse than those in Baltica. In contrast to a worldwide trend of increasing boring intensity, the Estonian record seems to show no increase in boring intensities during the Middle and Late Ordovician. Hardgrounds seem to be more common during the temperate climate interval of the Ordovician calcite sea in Estonia (seven hardgrounds during 15 my) than in the part with a tropical climate (four hardgrounds during 12 my). Bioerosion is mostly associated with carbonate hardgrounds, but cobbles and pebbles broken from the hardgrounds are also often penetrated by Trypanites borings. The general diversity of boring ichnotaxa in Baltica increased from one ichnospecies in the Cambrian to seven by the end of Ordovician, showing the effect of the GOBE on bioeroding ichnotaxa. The diversity of inorganic hard substrate borers increased by only two times. This difference can be explained by the wider environmental distribution of organic as compared to inorganic substrates in the Ordovician seas of Baltica, and their more continuous temporal availability, which may have caused increased specialization of several borers. The inorganic substrates may have been bioreroded only by the generalists among boring organisms."
https://openalex.org/W971668724,"Objective To reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with benign prostatic disease, however, without missing significant PCa the present study re-evaluates the age-dependent PSA cut-offs in the Tyrol Prostate Cancer (PCa) early detection program. Patients and Methods The study population included 2225 patients who underwent prostate biopsy due to elevated PSA levels at our department. We divided our patient collective into four age groups: ≤49 years (n = 178), 50-59 years (n = 597), 60-69 years (n = 962) and ≥70 years (n = 488). We simulated different scenarios for PSA cut-off values between 1.25 and 6 ng/mL and fPSA% between 15 and 21% for all four age groups and calculated sensitivity, specificity, confidence intervals and predictive values. Results PCa was detected in 1218 men (54.7%). We found that in combination with free PSA ≤21% the following PSA cut-offs had the best cancer specificity: 1.75 ng/ml for men ≤49 years and 50-59 years, 2.25 ng/ml for men aged 60-69 years and 3.25 ng/ml for men ≥70 years. Using these adjusted PSA cut-off values all significant tumors are recognized in all age groups, yet the number of biopsies is reduced. Overall, one biopsy is avoided in 13 to 14 men (number needed to screen = 13.3, reduction of biopsies = 7.5%) when decision regarding biopsy is done according to the “new” cut-off values instead of the “old” ones. For the different age groups the number needed to screen to avoid one biopsy varied between 9.2 (≤49 years) and 17.4 (50-59 years). Conclusion With “new”, fine-tuned PSA cut-offs we detect all relevant PCa with a significant reduction of biopsies compared to the “old” cut-off values. Optimization of age-specific PSA cut-offs is one step towards a smarter strategy in the Tyrol PCa Early Detection Program."
https://openalex.org/W1024674079,"Hedge detection is used to distinguish uncertain information from facts, which is of essential importance in biomedical information extraction. The task of hedge detection is often divided into two subtasks: detecting uncertain cues and their linguistic scope. Hedge scope is a sequence of tokens including the hedge cue in a sentence. Previous hedge scope detection methods usually take all tokens in a sentence as candidate boundaries, which inevitably generate a large number of negatives for classifiers. The imbalanced instances seriously mislead classifiers and result in lower performance. This paper proposes a dependency-based candidate boundary selection method (DCBS), which selects the most likely tokens as candidate boundaries and removes the exceptional tokens which have less potential to improve the performance based on dependency tree. In addition, we employ the composite kernel to integrate lexical and syntactic information and demonstrate the effectiveness of structured syntactic features for hedge scope detection. Experiments on the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task corpus show that our method achieves 71.92% F1-score on the golden standard cues, which is 4.11% higher than the system without using DCBS. Although the candidate boundary selection method is only evaluated on hedge scope detection here, it can be popularized to other kinds of scope learning tasks."
https://openalex.org/W1612527270,"Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortens with age, and is a prospective marker of mortality related to cardiovascular disease. Many health behaviors and social environmental factors have been found to be associated with LTL. Several of these are also associated with conscientiousness, a dispositional personality trait. Conscientiousness is a propensity to be planful, adhere to social norms, and inhibit pre-potent responses. Like LTL, conscientiousness is prospectively related to mortality, possibly through cumulative effects on health over the life course via multiple pathways. As a result, we hypothesized that childhood levels of conscientiousness would predict LTL prospectively in adulthood. We selected a sample of 60 women in the Hawaii Personality and Health Cohort; 30 described by their teachers as high on conscientiousness in childhood and 30 described as low on the trait. Dried blood spot samples collected in adulthood 40 years later were used as sources of DNA for the LTL assay. Conscientiousness was associated with longer LTL (p = .02). Controlling for age did not account for this association. Controlling for education and physiological dysregulation partially attenuated the association, and the effect remained significant when accounting for differences in LTL across cultural groups. These results represent the first evidence that childhood personality prospectively predicts LTL 40 years later in adulthood. Our findings would be consistent with a mediation hypothesis whereby conscientiousness predicts life paths and trajectories of health that are reflected in rates of LTL erosion across the lifespan."

There is still controversy over whether some thyroid diseases are actually IgG4-related disease. The objective of this study was to elucidate the clinicopathological features of Graves' disease with diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the thyroid.Among 1,484 Graves' disease patients who underwent thyroidectomy, we examined their histopathological findings including the degree of lymphoplasmacytic and fibrotic infiltration and levels of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the thyroid. Their clinical pictures were defined by laboratory and ultrasonographic evaluation.A total of 11 patients (0.74%) showed diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the stroma of the thyroid gland. Meanwhile, other patients showed variable lymphoid infiltration ranging from absent to focally dense but no aggregation of plasma cells in the thyroid gland. Based on the diagnostic criteria of IgG4-related disease, 5 of the 11 subjects had specifically increased levels of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the thyroid. Fibrotic infiltration was present in only 1 patient developing hypothyroidism after anti-thyroid drug treatment for 4 years, but not in the other 10 patients with persistent hyperthyroidism. Obliterative phlebitis was not identified in any of the 11 subjects. Thyroid ultrasound examination showed 1 patient developing hypothyroidism who had diffuse hypoechogenicity, but the other hyperthyroid patients had a coarse echo texture.In our study, Graves' disease patients with persistent hyperthyroidism who had diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells in the thyroid showed no concomitant fibrosis or obliterative phlebitis."
https://openalex.org/W1825553969,"The aim of this analysis was to assess the impact of chronic back pain and psychological distress on the utilization of primary and secondary levels of care in the ambulatory health care sector in Austria - a country without a gatekeeping system. Additionally, we aimed to determine if the joint effect of chronic back pain and psychological distress was higher than the impact of the sum of the two single conditions. The database used for this analysis was the Austrian Health Interview Survey, with data from 15,474 individuals. Statistical methods used were descriptive tests, regression models and the calculation of synergistic effects. Both chronic back pain and psychological distress had a positive association with the utilization of the primary (OR for chronic back pain 1.53 and psychological distress 1.33) and secondary (OR for chronic back pain 1.32 and psychological distress 1.24) levels of the health care sector. In the fully adjusted model, the synergistic effect of chronic back pain and psychological distress was significant for the secondary level of care (S 1.99, PAF 0.20), but not for the primary level of care (S 1.16, PAF 0.07). Synergistic effects and associations for chronic back pain and psychological distress on the utilization of both the primary and secondary levels of the ambulatory health care sector were observed, particularly for the secondary level of care. Our results demonstrate the utilization of health care services settings by individuals with these conditions, and offer opportunities to consider reorganization and structuring of the Austrian health care system."
https://openalex.org/W937241371,"p21-activated kinases (Paks) are serine/threonine protein kinases involved in biological events linked to malignant tumor progression. In this study, expression of Pak1, p-Pak2 Ser20, Pak4, pPak4 Ser474 in 21 normal endometrium, 16 hyperplastic endometrium without atypia, 17 atypical complex hyperplasia and 67 endometrial cancers was assessed by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. We also accessed the proliferative role and downstream targets of Pak1 in endometrial cancer. Pak1 was expressed in cytoplasm whereas Pak4 and p-Pak4 were expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of endometrial tissues. In normal endometrium, significantly higher Pak1 (P = 0.028) and cytoplasmic p-Pak2 (P = 0.048) expression was detected in proliferative endometrium than secretory endometrium. Pak1, cytoplasmic and nuclear Pak4 and nuclear p-Pak4 was significantly overexpressed in endometrial cancer when compared to atrophic endometrium (all P<0.05). Moreover, type I endometrioid carcinomas showed significantly higher Pak1 expression than type II non-endometrioid carcinomas (P<0.001). On the other hand, Pak1, Pak4 and p-Pak4 expression negatively correlated with histological grade (all P<0.05) while p-Pak2 and cytoplasmic Pak4 expression inversely correlated with myometrial invasion (all P<0.05). Furthermore, patients with endometrial cancers with lower cytoplasmic Pak4 expression showed poorer survival (P = 0.026). Multivariate analysis showed cytoplasmic Pak4 is an independent prognostic factor. Functionally, knockdown of Pak1, but not Pak4, in endometrial cancer cell line led to reduced cell proliferation along with reduced cyclin D1, estrogen receptor (ERα) and progestogen receptor (PR) expression. Significant correlation between Pak1 and PR expression was also detected in clinical samples. Our findings suggest that Pak1 and cytoplasmic p-Pak2 may promote cell proliferation in normal endometrium during menstral cycle. Pak1, cytoplasmic and nuclear Pak4 and nuclear p-Pak4 are involved in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer especially in postmenopausal women. Pak1 promote endometrial cancer cell proliferation, particular in type I endometrioid carcinoma. Cytoplasmic Pak4 can be potential prognostic marker in endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1625229024,"Population viability of a single species, when evaluated with metapopulation based landscape evaluation tools, always increases when the connectivity of the landscape increases. However, when interactions between species are taken into account, results can differ. We explore this issue using a stochastic spatially explicit meta-community model with 21 competing species in five different competitive settings: (1) weak, coexisting competition, (2) neutral competition, (3) strong, excluding competition, (4) hierarchical competition and (5) random species competition. The species compete in randomly generated landscapes with various fragmentation levels. With this model we study species loss over time. Simulation results show that overall diversity, the species richness in the entire landscape, decreases slowly in fragmented landscapes whereas in well-connected landscapes rapid species losses occur. These results are robust with respect to changing competitive settings, species parameters and spatial configurations. They indicate that optimal landscape configuration for species conservation differs between metapopulation approaches, modelling species separately and meta-community approaches allowing species interactions. The mechanism behind this is that species in well-connected landscapes rapidly outcompete each other. Species that become abundant, by chance or by their completive strength, send out large amounts of dispersers that colonize and take over other patches that are occupied by species that are less abundant. This mechanism causes rapid species loss. In fragmented landscapes the colonization rate is lower, and it is difficult for a new species to establish in an already occupied patch. So, here dominant species cannot easily take over patches occupied by other species and higher diversity is maintained for a longer time. These results suggest that fragmented landscapes have benefits for species conservation previously unrecognized by the landscape ecology and policy community. When species interactions are important, landscapes with a low fragmentation level can be better for species conservation than well-connected landscapes. Moreover, our results indicate that metapopulation based landscape evaluation tools may overestimate the value of connectivity and should be replaced by more realistic meta-community based tools."
https://openalex.org/W2136696769,"Do all traits within an organism age for the same reason? Evolutionary theories of aging share a common assumption: the strength of natural selection declines with age. A corollary is that additive genetic variance should increase with age. However, not all senescent traits display such increases suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play. Using longitudinal data collected from more than 5400 houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) with an exhaustive recorded pedigree, we investigated the genetics of aging in one female reproductive trait (egg production) and three male reproductive traits (courtship display rate, ejaculate size and sperm viability), that display senescence at the phenotypic level. Animal models revealed an increase in additive genetic variance with age for courtship display rate and egg production but an unexpected absence of increased additive genetic variance for ejaculate size and no additive genetic variance for sperm viability. Our results suggest that the mechanisms behind the senescence of some traits are linked with a change in genetic expression, whereas for some other traits, aging may result from the constraints associated with physiological wear and tear on the organism throughout the life of the individual."
https://openalex.org/W1643782242,"ADAMTS9 is a metalloprotease that cleaves components of the extracellular matrix and is also implicated in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. It has been reported that an ADAMTS9 gene variant is associated with type 2 diabetes. The underlying pathology of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAMTS9 function in beta cells and peripheral tissues are unknown. We show that loss of C. elegans GON-1, an ADAMTS9 homolog, alters lifespan and dauer formation. GON-1 loss impairs secretion of proteins such as insulin orthologs and TGF-beta, and additionally impacts insulin/IGF-1 signaling in peripheral tissues. The function of the GON domain, but not the protease domain, is essential for normal lifespan and dauer formation in these scenarios. We conclude that the GON domain is critical for ADAMTS9/GON-1 function across species, which should help the understanding of type 2 diabetes in humans."

Study results in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are contradicting as to whether RBV concentration correlates with sustained virological response (SVR).We included 262 HCV treatment naïve HIV/HCV-coinfected Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) participants treated with RBV and pegIFN between 01.01.2001-01.01.2010, 134 with HCV genotype (GT) 1/4, and 128 with GT 2/3 infections. RBV levels were measured retrospectively in stored plasma samples obtained between HCV treatment week 4 and end of therapy. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between RBV concentration and SVR in GT 1/4 and GT 2/3 infections. The analyses were repeated stratified by treatment phase (week 4-12, 13-24, >24) and IL28B genotype (CC versus CT/TT).SVR rates were 35.1% in GT 1/4 and 70.3% in GT 2/3 infections. Overall, median RBV concentration was 2.0 mg/L in GT 1/4, and 1.9 mg/L in GT 2/3, and did not change significantly across treatment phases. Patients with SVR had similar RBV concentrations compared to patients without SVR in both HCV genotype groups. SVR was not associated with RBV levels ≥2.0 mg/L (GT 1/4, OR 1.19 [0.5-2.86]; GT 2/3, 1.94 [0.78-4.80]) and ≥2.5 mg/L (GT 1/4, 1.56 [0.64-3.84]; GT 2/3 2.72 [0.85-8.73]), regardless of treatment phase, and IL28B genotype.In HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegIFN/RBV, therapeutic drug monitoring of RBV concentrations does not enhance the chance of HCV cure, regardless of HCV genotype, treatment phase and IL28B genotype."

Hierarchical regression analysis is used to assess the impact of hospital specialization on the following four aspects of operational performance: productivity, profitability, efficiency and quality of care.The results show that a focused strategy (high HHI) improves the income and adjusted number of patients per specialist through the efficient utilization of human resources. However, a diversified strategy (high ITI) improves the hospital utilization ratio, income per bed and adjusted number of patients per bed (controlling for material resources such as beds). In addition, as the concentration index increases, case-mix mortality rates and referral rates decrease, indicating that specialization has a positive relationship with quality of care."

Compared to point features, line segments are more robust to matching errors, occlusions, and image uncertainties. In addition to line triangulation, a better metric is needed to evaluate 3D errors of line triangulation. In this paper, the line triangulation problem is investigated by using the Lagrange multipliers theory. The main contributions include: (i) Based on the Lagrange multipliers theory, a formula to compute the Plücker correction is provided, and from the formula, a new linear algorithm, LINa, is proposed for line triangulation; (ii) two optimal algorithms, OPTa-I and OPTa-II, are proposed by minimizing the algebraic error; and (iii) two metrics on 3D line space, the orthogonal metric and the quasi-Riemannian metric, are introduced for the evaluation of line triangulations. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real images are carried out to validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

However, the cognitive and affective factors contributing to children’s avoidance to high punishment frequency remain unknown. The present study explored psychophysiological, cognitive, and metacognitive processes associated with sensitivity to punishment frequency. We evaluated 54 participants (between 8 and 15 years old) with a modified Iowa Gambling Task for children (IGT-C) which included options with varying long-term profit and punishment frequencies. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) were recorded during this task. Additionally, we assessed IGT-C metacognitive knowledge, fluid intelligence, and executive functions. Participants exhibited behavioral avoidance and high anticipatory SCRs to options with high frequency of punishment. Moreover, age, IGT-C metacognitive knowledge, and inhibitory control were associated with individual differences in sensitivity to punishment frequency. Our results suggest that children’s preference for infrequently punished decisions is partially explained by psychophysiological signals as well as task complexity and development of cognitive control."
