https://openalex.org/W2061145292,"A crystalline substance, designated abscisin, which accelerates abscission of excised debladed petioles at 10-2 microgram per abscission zone, has been isolated from cotton burs. The yield was approximately 1 milligram from 10 kilograms of dry plant material."
https://openalex.org/W2087890532,"Absorption studies, made on suspensions of Anacystis nidulans, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and Porphyridium cruentum by means of an integrating spectrophotometer, suggest the existence of pigments absorbing ""extreme red"" light in the 720- to 800-mmicro region. In the bluegreen alga Anacystis, one pigment of this type exists, which produces a relatively strong absorption band at 750 mmicro. In the green alga Chlorella and the red alga phyridium, two considerably weaker absorption bands appear, at 730 to 740 mmicro and 750 to 760 mmicro, which may be due to one or two pigments. These pigments must be responsible for the photoinhibition of photosynthesis observed in these algae in the same spectral region; as yet, no photoinhibition has been observed in Anacystis."
https://openalex.org/W2042569488,"Littorina littorea, an abundant northeast North American gastropod, was thought to have been introduced from Europe about 1840. Shells of that species found in ancient Micmac Indian camp sites in Nova Scotia have been radiocarbon-dated as pre-Columbian. Failure of L. littorrea to extend its range southward before 1840 may have been due to oceanographic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1997570893,Results casting doubt on the reported findings of Wells and Wolff on conditioned alpha desynchronization are presented. The experimental findings indicate that these authors were most likely dealing with the phenomenon of adaptation to a complex stimulus. These results are compared to similar phenomena in the conditioning of the galvanic skin response.

https://openalex.org/W2086752579,The luminous band around the horizon noted by J. Glenn in the first U.S. manned orbital flight is attributable to airglow. Dip-of-the-horizon measurements on the star gamma Ursae Majoris showed that the band is centered at an elevation of 91 kilometers or somewhat higher. The edge-on brightness of the airglow layer was 6 x 10(-7) candles per square centimeter.

https://openalex.org/W2010787279,"An adequate civilian defense system has two phases. The first phase demands special structures, including stocked fallout shelters throughout the country and a maximum number of blast-resistant structures in and near population centers, with adequate instruments for detecting and measuring air pollutants and maintaining communications. The second, or recovery, phase requires stockpiling of fuels for operating farm machinery; power sources (fossii or nuclear) for rebuilding the nation's industrial plant; and, above all, stockpiling of food to keep human beings alive and functioning.
