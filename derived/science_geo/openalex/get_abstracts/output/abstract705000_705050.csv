https://openalex.org/W4310437632,"While coral reefs in Australia have historically been a showcase of conventional management informed by research, recent declines in coral cover have triggered efforts to innovate and integrate intervention and restoration actions into management frameworks. Here we outline the multi-faceted intervention approaches that have developed in Australia since 2017, from newly implemented in-water programs, research to enhance coral resilience and investigations into socio-economic perspectives on restoration goals. We describe in-water projects using coral gardening, substrate stabilisation, coral repositioning, macro-algae removal, and larval-based restoration techniques. Three areas of research focus are also presented to illustrate the breadth of Australian research on coral restoration, (1) the transdisciplinary Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), one of the world's largest research and development programs focused on coral reefs, (2) interventions to enhance coral performance under climate change, and (3) research into socio-cultural perspectives. Together, these projects and the recent research focus reflect an increasing urgency for action to confront the coral reef crisis, develop new and additional tools to manage coral reefs, and the consequent increase in funding opportunities and management appetite for implementation. The rapid progress in trialling and deploying coral restoration in Australia builds on decades of overseas experience, and advances in research and development are showing positive signs that coral restoration can be a valuable tool to improve resilience at local scales (i.e., high early survival rates across a variety of methods and coral species, strong community engagement with local stakeholders). RRAP is focused on creating interventions to help coral reefs at multiple scales, from micro scales (i.e., interventions targeting small areas within a specific reef site) to large scales (i.e., interventions targeting core ecosystem function and social-economic values at multiple select sites across the Great Barrier Reef) to resist, adapt to and recover from the impacts of climate change. None of these interventions aim to single-handedly restore the entirety of the Great Barrier Reef, nor do they negate the importance of urgent climate change mitigation action."
https://openalex.org/W4310337193,"Scientific teams are increasingly diverse in discipline, international scope and demographics. Diversity has been found to be a driver of innovation but also can be a source of interpersonal friction. Drawing on a mixed-method study of 22 scientific working groups, this paper presents evidence that team diversity has a positive impact on scientific output (i.e., the number of journal papers and citations) through the mediation of the interdisciplinarity of the collaborative process, as evidenced by publishing in and citing more diverse sources. Ironically these factors also seem to be related to lower team member satisfaction and perceived effectiveness, countered by the gender balance of the team. Qualitative data suggests additional factors that facilitate collaboration, such as trust and leadership. Our findings have implications for team design and management, as team diversity seems beneficial, but the process of integration can be difficult and needs management to lead to a productive and innovative process."
https://openalex.org/W4310477231,"As mortality rates from COVID-19 disease fall, the high prevalence of long-term sequelae (Long COVID) is becoming increasingly widespread, challenging healthcare systems globally. Traditional pathways of care for Long Term Conditions (LTCs) have tended to be managed by disease-specific specialties, an approach that has been ineffective in delivering care for patients with multi-morbidity. The multi-system nature of Long COVID and its impact on physical and psychological health demands a more effective model of holistic, integrated care. The evolution of integrated care systems (ICSs) in the UK presents an important opportunity to explore areas of mutual benefit to LTC, multi-morbidity and Long COVID care. There may be benefits in comparing and contrasting ICPs for Long COVID with ICPs for other LTCs.This study aims to evaluate health services requirements for ICPs for Long COVID and their applicability to other LTCs including multi-morbidity and the overlap with medically not yet explained symptoms (MNYES). The study will follow a Delphi design and involve an expert panel of stakeholders including people with lived experience, as well as clinicians with expertise in Long COVID and other LTCs. Study processes will include expert panel and moderator panel meetings, surveys, and interviews. The Delphi process is part of the overall STIMULATE-ICP programme, aimed at improving integrated care for people with Long COVID.Ethical approval for this Delphi study has been obtained (Research Governance Board of the University of York) as have approvals for the other STIMULATE-ICP studies. Study outcomes are likely to inform policy for ICPs across LTCs. Results will be disseminated through scientific publication, conference presentation and communications with patients and stakeholders involved in care of other LTCs and Long COVID.Researchregistry: https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry#home/registrationdetails/6246bfeeeaaed6001f08dadc/."
https://openalex.org/W4309476505,"Can SARS-CoV-2 hitchhike on the olfactory projection and take a direct and short route from the nose into the brain? We reasoned that the neurotropic or neuroinvasive capacity of the virus, if it exists, should be most easily detectable in individuals who died in an acute phase of the infection. Here, we applied a postmortem bedside surgical procedure for the rapid procurement of tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid samples from deceased COVID-19 patients infected with the Delta, Omicron BA.1, or Omicron BA.2 variants. Confocal imaging of sections stained with fluorescence RNAscope and immunohistochemistry afforded the light-microscopic visualization of extracellular SARS-CoV-2 virions in tissues. We failed to find evidence for viral invasion of the parenchyma of the olfactory bulb and the frontal lobe of the brain. Instead, we identified anatomical barriers at vulnerable interfaces, exemplified by perineurial olfactory nerve fibroblasts enwrapping olfactory axon fascicles in the lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W4310141934,"Dysfunction of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic circuits is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, it is unclear how genetic predispositions impact circuit assembly. Using in vivo two-photon and widefield calcium imaging in developing mice, we show that Gabrb3, a gene strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Angelman syndrome (AS), is enriched in contralaterally projecting pyramidal neurons and is required for inhibitory function. We report that Gabrb3 ablation leads to a developmental decrease in GABAergic synapses, increased local network synchrony, and long-lasting enhancement in functional connectivity of contralateral-but not ipsilateral-pyramidal neuron subtypes. In addition, Gabrb3 deletion leads to increased cortical response to tactile stimulation at neonatal stages. Using human transcriptomics and neuroimaging datasets from ASD subjects, we show that the spatial distribution of GABRB3 expression correlates with atypical connectivity in these subjects. Our studies reveal a requirement for Gabrb3 during the emergence of interhemispheric circuits for sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W4310438132,"Evidence has shown that the Five precepts significantly affect the relationship between attachment and resilience; however, little is known whether observing the Five Precepts would help reduce depressive symptoms among those who experience risks. The aim of this study was to examine the moderating role of the Five Precepts in the mediation model relationship among neuroticism, perceived stress, and depression.The study employed a cross-sectional survey design and data were collected from the end of 2019 to September 2022 in Thailand. In all, 644 general participants completed questionnaires on the Neuroticism Inventory (NI), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Depression Subscale, and the Five-Precept Subscale of the Inner Strength-based Inventory (SBI-PP). Mediation and moderation analyses with 5000 bootstrapping methods were used.Among all, 74.2% were female, and the mean age totalled 28.28 years (SD = 10.6). SBI-PP was shown to have a moderation effect on the relationship between NI, PSS and depressive symptoms. The moderating effect between SBI-PP and PSS was significant, whereas SBI-PP and NI was not. The index of moderated mediation from the Five Precepts was significant (b = -0.019 (95%CI -0.029, -0.009)). The moderated mediation model increased the percent variance explaining depressive symptoms to 47.6%, compared with 32.6% from the mediation model alone.Observing the Five Precepts offers evidence that it buffers the effect of perceived stress on depression. People with high levels of observing the Five Precepts are less likely to develop depressive symptoms. Implications as well as possible future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4310477269,"Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has been shown to perpetuate neuroinflammation, alter intestinal permeability, and modify repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (RmTBI)-induced deficits. However, there have been no investigations regarding the comparative effects that the microbiome may have on RmTBI in adolescents and adults. Therefore, we examined the influence of microbiome depletion prior to RmTBI on microbial composition and metabolome, in adolescent and adult Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were randomly assigned to standard or antibiotic drinking water for 14 days, and to subsequent sham or RmTBIs. The gut microbiome composition and metabolome were analysed at baseline, 1 day after the first mTBI, and at euthanasia (11 days following the third mTBI). At euthanasia, intestinal samples were also collected to quantify tight junction protein ( TJP1 and occludin ) expression. Adolescents were significantly more susceptible to microbiome depletion via antibiotic administration which increased pro-inflammatory composition and metabolites. Furthermore, RmTBI induced a transient increase in ‘beneficial bacteria’ ( Lachnospiraceae and Faecalibaculum ) in only adolescents that may indicate compensatory action in response to the injury. Finally, microbiome depletion prior to RmTBI generated a microbiome composition and metabolome that exemplified a potentially chronic pathogenic and inflammatory state as demonstrated by increased Clostridium innocuum and Erysipelatoclostridium and reductions in Bacteroides and Clostridium Sensu Stricto . Results highlight that adolescents are more vulnerable to RmTBI compared to adults and dysbiosis prior to injury may exacerbate secondary inflammatory cascades."
https://openalex.org/W4310991391,"To ensure efficient photosynthesis, chloroplast proteins need to be flexibly regulated under fluctuating light conditions. Thiol-based redox regulation plays a key role in reductively activating several chloroplast proteins in a light-dependent manner. The ferredoxin (Fd)/thioredoxin (Trx) pathway has long been recognized as the machinery that transfers reducing power generated by photosynthetic electron transport reactions to redox-sensitive target proteins; however, its biological importance remains unclear, because the complete disruption of the Fd/Trx pathway in plants has been unsuccessful to date. Especially, recent identifications of multiple redox-related factors in chloroplasts, as represented by the NADPH-Trx reductase C, have raised a controversial proposal that other redox pathways work redundantly with the Fd/Trx pathway. To address these issues directly, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create Arabidopsis mutant plants in which the activity of the Fd/Trx pathway was completely defective. The mutants generated showed severe growth inhibition. Importantly, these mutants almost entirely lost the ability to reduce several redox-sensitive proteins in chloroplast stroma, including four Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes, NADP-malate dehydrogenase, and Rubisco activase, under light conditions. These striking phenotypes were further accompanied by abnormally developed chloroplasts and a drastic decline in photosynthetic efficiency. These results indicate that the Fd/Trx pathway is indispensable for the light-responsive activation of diverse stromal proteins and photoautotrophic growth of plants. Our data also suggest that the ATP synthase is exceptionally reduced by other pathways in a redundant manner. This study provides an important insight into how the chloroplast redox-regulatory system operates in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4310287096,"Abstract Animals learn trajectories to rewards in both spatial, navigational contexts and relational, non-navigational contexts. Synchronous reactivation of hippocampal activity is thought to be critical for recall and evaluation of trajectories for learning. Do hippocampal representations differentially contribute to experience-dependent learning of trajectories across spatial and relational contexts? In this study, we trained mice to navigate to a hidden target in a physical arena or manipulate a joystick to a virtual target to collect delayed rewards. In a navigational context, calcium imaging in freely moving mice revealed that synchronous CA1 reactivation was retrospective and important for evaluation of prior navigational trajectories. In a non-navigational context, reactivation was prospective and important for initiation of joystick trajectories, even in the same animals trained in both contexts. Adaptation of trajectories to a new target was well-explained by a common learning algorithm in which hippocampal activity makes dissociable contributions to reinforcement learning computations depending upon spatial context."
https://openalex.org/W4310337152,"The primate fovea is specialized for high acuity chromatic vision, with the highest density of cone photoreceptors and a disproportionately large representation in visual cortex. The unique visual properties conferred by the fovea are conveyed to the brain by retinal ganglion cells, the somas of which lie at the margin of the foveal pit. Microelectrode recordings of these centermost retinal ganglion cells have been challenging due to the fragility of the fovea in the excised retina. Here we overcome this challenge by combining high resolution fluorescence adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy with calcium imaging to optically record functional responses of foveal retinal ganglion cells in the living eye. We use this approach to study the chromatic responses and spatial transfer functions of retinal ganglion cells using spatially uniform fields modulated in different directions in color space and monochromatic drifting gratings. We recorded from over 350 cells across three Macaca fascicularis primates over a time period of weeks to months. We find that the majority of the L vs. M cone opponent cells serving the most central foveolar cones have spatial transfer functions that peak at high spatial frequencies (20-40 c/deg), reflecting strong surround inhibition that sacrifices sensitivity at low spatial frequencies but preserves the transmission of fine detail in the retinal image. In addition, we fit to the drifting grating data a detailed model of how ganglion cell responses draw on the cone mosaic to derive receptive field properties of L vs. M cone opponent cells at the very center of the foveola. The fits are consistent with the hypothesis that foveal midget ganglion cells are specialized to preserve information at the resolution of the cone mosaic. By characterizing the functional properties of retinal ganglion cells in vivo through adaptive optics, we characterize the response characteristics of these cells in situ."
https://openalex.org/W4310351994,"Understanding the response and tolerance mechanisms of nitrogen (N) stress is essential for the taproot plant of sugar beet. Hence, in this study, low (0.5 and 3 mmol/L; N0.5 and N3), moderate (5 mmol/L; N5; control) and high (10 and 12 mmol/L; N10 and N12) N were imposed to sugar beet to comparatively investigate the growth and physiological changes, and expression pattern of the gene involving ammonia transporting at different seedling stages. The results showed that, different from N5 which could induce maximum biomass of beet seedlings, low N was more likely to inhibit the growth of beet seedlings than high N treatments. Morphological differences and adverse factors increased significantly with extension of stress time, but sugar beet seedlings displayed a variety of physical responses to different N concentrations to adapt to N abnormal. At 14 d, the chlorophyll content, leaf and root surface area, total dry weight and nitrogen content of seedlings treated with N0.5 decreased 15.83%, 53.65%, 73.94%, 78.08% and 24.88% respectively, compared with N12; however, the root shoot ratio increased significantly as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline content, especially in root. The expression of BvAMT1.2 was also regulated in an N concentration-dependent manner, and was mainly involved in the tolerance of beet leaves to N stress, which significantly positively correlated to GS activity on the basis of its high affinity to N. It can be deduced that the stored nutrients under low N could only maintain relatively stable root growth, and faced difficulty in being transported to the shoots. Sugar beet was relatively resilient to N0.5 stress according to the mean affiliation function analysis. These results provide a theoretical basis for the extensive cultivation of sugar beet in N-stressed soil."
https://openalex.org/W4310352022,"Technologies and their production systems are used by archaeologists and anthropologists to study complexity of socio-technical systems. However, there are several issues that hamper agreement about what constitutes complexity and how we can systematically compare the complexity of production systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach to assess the behavioural and structural complexity of production systems using Petri nets. Petri nets are well-known formal models commonly used in, for example, biological and business process modelling, as well as software engineering. The use of Petri nets overcomes several obstacles of current approaches in archaeology and anthropology, such as the incompatibility of the intrinsic sequential logic of the available methods with inherently non-sequential processes, and the inability to explicitly model activities and resources separately. We test the proposed Petri net modelling approach on two traditional production systems of adhesives made by Ju/’hoan makers from Nyae, Namibia from Ammocharis coranica and Ozoroa schinzii plants. We run simulations in which we assess the complexity of these two adhesive production systems in detail and show how Petri net dynamics reveal the structural and behavioural complexity of different production scenarios. We show that concurrency may be prevalent in the production system of adhesive technologies and discuss how changes in location during the process may serve to control the behavioural complexity of a production system. The approach presented in this paper paves the way for future systematic visualization, analysis, and comparison of ancient production systems, accounting for the inherent complex, concurrent, and action/resource-oriented aspects of such processes."
https://openalex.org/W4310351917,"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is among the most widely used model animals in scientific research. Historically, these fish have been reared in the laboratory using simple methods developed by home aquarists. For laboratories with high demand for breeding and generation turn-over, however, there has been a shift away from this approach towards one that leverages techniques, tools, and feeds from commercial aquaculture to help accelerate growth rates and decrease generation times. While these advances have improved efficiency, the effects of feeding zebrafish diets that are designed to grow disparately related cold-water fish species to market size quickly are not well-understood. To explore the impacts that intensive feeding protocols may have on this species, groups of zebrafish larvae from two different wild-type lines were stocked into treatment tanks at a standard density of 10 fish per liter and were administered either a ""high"" or ""low"" food diet for a maximum of 63 days. During their growth phase, the ""high"" food diet group received at least 8x more rotifers and at least 2x more Artemia than the ""low"" food diet group. Growth, survival, and reproductive performance (fecundity and viability) were measured in these fish and in their offspring. We found that fish that were fed more grew more rapidly and were able to reproduce earlier than fish that were fed less, but they were also more likely to produce higher proportions of non-viable embryos."
https://openalex.org/W4310437659,"Increasing attention is being paid to the carbon sequestration and storage services provided by coastal blue carbon ecosystems such as saltmarshes. Sites restored by managed realignment, where existing sea walls are breached to reinstate tidal inundation to the land behind, have considerable potential to accumulate carbon through deposition of sediment brought in by the tide and burial of vegetation in the site. While this potential has been recognised, it is not yet a common motivating factor for saltmarsh restoration, partly due to uncertainties about the rate of carbon accumulation and how this balances against the greenhouse gases emitted during site construction. We use a combination of field measurements over four years and remote sensing to quantify carbon accumulation at a large managed realignment site, Steart Marshes, UK. Sediment accumulated rapidly at Steart Marshes (mean of 75 mm yr-1) and had a high carbon content (4.4% total carbon, 2.2% total organic carbon), resulting in carbon accumulation of 36.6 t ha-1 yr-1 total carbon (19.4 t ha-1 yr-1 total organic carbon). This rate of carbon accumulation is an order of magnitude higher than reported in many other restored saltmarshes, and is somewhat higher than values previously reported from another hypertidal system (Bay of Fundy, Canada). The estimated carbon emissions associated with the construction of the site were ~2-4% of the observed carbon accumulation during the study period, supporting the view that managed realignment projects in such settings may have significant carbon accumulation benefits. However, uncertainties such as the origin of carbon (allochthonous or autochthonous) and changes in gas fluxes need to be resolved to move towards a full carbon budget for saltmarsh restoration."
https://openalex.org/W4310337141,"In recent years, time-frequency analysis (TFA) methods have received widespread attention and undergone rapid development. However, traditional TFA methods cannot achieve the desired effect when dealing with nonstationary signals. Therefore, this study proposes a new TFA method called the local maximum synchrosqueezing scaling-basis chirplet transform (LMSBCT), which is a further improvement of the scaling-basis chirplet transform (SBCT) with energy rearrangement in frequency and can be viewed as a good combination of SBCT and local maximum synchrosqueezing transform. A better concentration in terms of the time-frequency energy and a more accurate instantaneous frequency trajectory can be achieved using LMSBCT. The time-frequency distribution of strong frequency-modulated signals and multicomponent signals can be handled well, even for signals with close signal frequencies and low signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical simulations and real experiments were conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed method over traditional methods."
https://openalex.org/W4310352020,"Based on China's transaction-level trade data and firm-level production data during the period 2000-2006, this paper firstly estimates the export cutoff productivity by applying non-parametric ROC method. The results are as follows. First, under the full sample, the export cutoff productivity is 7.051. Second, the export cutoff productivity of home enterprises is relatively low, and that of foreign enterprises is relatively high. Third, the export thresholds of capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries are relatively high, while that of labor-intensive industry is relatively low. Fourth, the export threshold of western provinces is relatively high, followed by central provinces and eastern provinces. In addition, this paper investigates the dynamic change of export threshold. The result indicates that the evolution of export threshold is generally a horizontal S-shape during the sample period, and after China's accession to WTO in 2001, it is an inverted U-shape."
https://openalex.org/W4310352346,"In biotechnology, cell growth is one of the most important properties for the characterization and optimization of microbial cultures. Novel live-cell imaging methods are leading to an ever better understanding of cell cultures and their development. The key to analyzing acquired data is accurate and automated cell segmentation at the single-cell level. Therefore, we present microbeSEG, a user-friendly Python-based cell segmentation tool with a graphical user interface and OMERO data management. microbeSEG utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning-based segmentation method and can be used for instance segmentation of a wide range of cell morphologies and imaging techniques, e.g., phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy. The main focus of microbeSEG is a comprehensible, easy, efficient, and complete workflow from the creation of training data to the final application of the trained segmentation model. We demonstrate that accurate cell segmentation results can be obtained within 45 minutes of user time. Utilizing public segmentation datasets or pre-labeling further accelerates the microbeSEG workflow. This opens the door for accurate and efficient data analysis of microbial cultures."
https://openalex.org/W4310434327,"Medial meniscal extrusion (MME) is the medial displacement of the meniscus, which extends beyond the tibial margin. Studies have shown an association between MME and knee pain and that surgical treatment can reduce the extent of MME. Here, we describe the beneficial effects of physical therapy as a feasible conservative treatment for MME.Data of 30 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent stretching of the semimembranosus tendon and passive range of motion (ROM) exercises twice a week for 8 weeks were retrospectively analyzed. MME was the measured distance between the medial meniscus and the line connecting the medial borders of the femur and tibia using ultrasound. Ultrasound findings of surrounding tissues, including the deep posterior bundle of the medial collateral ligament (dMCL), were recorded. Additionally, knee extension ROM was measured, and inner knee pain when walking was evaluated using a numerical rating scale.There were significant improvements between the baseline and 8 weeks for MME in the non-weight-bearing position (3.6 ± 0.3 mm vs. 3.0 ± 0.4 mm), MME in the weight-bearing position (4.3 ± 0.4 mm vs. 3.8 ± 0.5 mm), ROM (-12.3° ± 4.1° vs. -3.1° ± 3.8°), and knee pain (7.0 ± 0.9 vs. 1.1 ± 1.4) (each p < 0.001). In almost all cases in which the knee extension ROM improved, the dMCL was bulging at the baseline; after 8 weeks, the dMCL was flattened, suggesting ligament tension on ultrasound imaging.Stretching of the semimembranosus tendon and passive ROM exercises may reduce the extent of MME in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The ultrasound findings suggest that improvement in knee extension ROM may have led to the re-acquisition of MCL tension, which may have influenced MME reduction. Therefore, physical therapy may be a feasible conservative treatment for the reduction of MME."
https://openalex.org/W4310437958,"Research in ecology often requires robust assessment of animal behaviour, but classifying behavioural patterns in free-ranging animals and in natural environments can be especially challenging. New miniaturised bio-logging devices such as accelerometers are increasingly available to record animal behaviour remotely, and thereby address the gap in knowledge related to behaviour of free-ranging animals. However, validation of these data is rarely conducted and classification model transferability across closely-related species is often not tested. Here, we validated accelerometer and water sensor data to classify activity states in two free-ranging freshwater turtle species (Blanding’s turtle, Emydoidea blandingii , and Painted turtle, Chrysemys picta ). First, using only accelerometer data, we developed a decision tree to separate motion from motionless states, and second, we included water sensor data to classify the animal as being motionless or in-motion on land or in water. We found that accelerometers separated in-motion from motionless behaviour with &gt; 83% accuracy, whereas models also including water sensor data predicted states in terrestrial and aquatic locations with &gt; 77% accuracy. Despite differences in values separating activity states between the two species, we found high model transferability allowing cross-species application of classification models. Note that reducing sampling frequency did not affect predictive accuracy of our models up to a sampling frequency of 0.0625 Hz. We conclude that the use of accelerometers in animal research is promising, but requires prior data validation and development of robust classification models, and whenever possible cross-species assessment should be conducted to establish model generalisability."
https://openalex.org/W4310438318,"Restoration of species-rich semi-natural grassland requires not only a seed source but also appropriate soil properties. In Europe, approximately 10 years are required for the properties of fertilized soils to reach suitable conditions and be considered successfully restored. However, restoration may require additional time in Japan because heavier precipitation causes leaching of basic cations from soils, resulting in soil acidification; volcanic ejecta also forms active Al and Fe hydroxides with high phosphate sorption. Within this context, we aimed to answer the following questions: i) whether and how the impacts of fertilization remain in the soil properties after half a century in Japan; and ii) how fertilization affects the restoration of semi-natural grasslands in Japan. We investigated the vegetation and soil properties of a Zoysia japonica pasture improved half a century ago with a single application of fertilizer and an adjacent semi-natural grassland (native pasture) in Japan, and found the following: (1) the two pastures had similar dominance of Z. japonica, but differed in the species composition; (2) the improved pasture exhibited lower species richness than the native pasture; (3) soil nutrients, including N, P, K, Mg, and Ca, were higher in the improved pasture than in the native pasture; and (4) many chemical properties of the soils were associated with species composition; namely, the vegetation on nutrient-rich soil had more alien species and fewer native species. We conclude that a single dose of fertilization can affect soil properties in semi-natural grasslands over half a century in Japan, leading to species loss and changing the species composition. We suggest that fertilized soils under grazing in Japan may require more than half a century to restore the nutrients to suitable levels for the establishment of a species-diverse grassland."
https://openalex.org/W4310477368,"The initial stages of diapsid evolution, the clade that includes extant reptiles and the majority of extinct reptilian taxa, is surprisingly poorly known. Notwithstanding the hypothesis that varanopids are diapsids rather than synapsids, there are only four araeoscelidians and one neodiapsid present in the late Carboniferous and early Permian. Here we describe the fragmentary remains of a very unusual new amniote from the famous cave deposits near Richards Spur, Oklahoma, that we recognize as a diapsid reptile, readily distinguishable from all other early amniotes by the unique dentition and lower jaw anatomy. The teeth have an unusual reeding pattern on the crown (long parallel ridges with rounded surfaces), with some teeth posteriorly tilted and strongly recurved, while a ventral protuberance forms the anterior terminus of the dentary. Overall, the lower jaw is unusually slender with a flattened ventral surface formed by the dentary and splenial anteriorly and the angular in the mid-region. The presence of a very slender triradiate jugal revealed through computed tomography confirms the existence of a large lower temporal fenestra, while the medial edge of the maxilla and the anatomy of the palatine confirm the presence of a large suborbital fenestra. Computed tomography of this new taxon reveals maxillary innervation that is characteristically reptile, not synapsid. Although no other definitively identifiable skull roof elements exist, the suborbital fenestra borders preserved on the palatine and maxilla supports the hypothesis that this is a diapsid reptile. Interestingly, the right dentary shows evidence of pathology, a rarely reported occurrence in Paleozoic amniotes, with several empty tooth sockets filled by bone. This small predator with delicate subthecodont implanted dentition provides strong evidence that diapsid reptiles were already diversifying rapidly in the early Permian, but likely were relatively rare members of terrestrial vertebrate assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W4310565118,"As a historical nomadic group in Central Asia, Kazaks have mainly inhabited the steppe zone from the Altay Mountains in the East to the Caspian Sea in the West. Fine scale characterization of the genetic profile and population structure of Kazaks would be invaluable for understanding their population history and modeling prehistoric human expansions across the Eurasian steppes. With this mind, we characterized the maternal lineages of 200 Kazaks from Jetisuu at mitochondrial genome level. Our results reveal that Jetisuu Kazaks have unique mtDNA haplotypes including those belonging to the basal branches of both West Eurasian (R0, H, HV) and East Eurasian (A, B, C, D) lineages. The great diversity observed in their maternal lineages may reflect pivotal geographic location of Kazaks in Eurasia and implies a complex history for this population. Comparative analyses of mitochondrial genomes of human populations in Central Eurasia reveal a common maternal genetic ancestry for Turko-Mongolian speakers and their expansion being responsible for the presence of East Eurasian maternal lineages in Central Eurasia. Our analyses further indicate maternal genetic affinity between the Sherpas from the Tibetan Plateau with the Turko-Mongolian speakers."

https://openalex.org/W4310337144,"Introduction High frequency ultrasound has shown as a promising imaging modality to evaluate peri-implant tissues. It is not known if the ultrasound imaging settings might influence ultrasound’s ability to differentiate implant structures. The aim of this benchtop study was to evaluate the dependence of ultrasound on imaging angles and modes to measure implant geometry-related parameters. Methods A clinical ultrasound scanner (ZS3, Mindray) with an intraoral probe (L30-8) offering combinations of harmonic and compound imaging modes was employed for imaging 16 abutments and 4 implants. The samples were mounted to a micro-positioning system in a water tank, which allowed a range of -30 to 30-degree imaging angles in 5-degree increment between the probe and samples. The abutment angle, implant thread pitch and depth were measured on ultrasound, compared to the reference readings. The errors were computed as a function of the image angles and modes. All samples were replicated 3 times for 3 image modes and 11 image angles, thus resulting in 2,340 images. Results The mean errors of ultrasound to estimate 16 abutment angles, compared to the reference values, were between -1.8 to 2.7 degrees. The root mean squared error (RMSE) ranged from 1.5 to 4.6 degrees. Ultrasound significantly overestimated the thread pitch by 26.1 μm to 36.2 μm. The error in thread depth measurements were in a range of -50.5 μm to 39.6 μm, respectively. The RMSE of thread pitch and depth of the tested 4 implants was in a range of 34.7 to 56.9 μm and 51.0 to 101.8 μm, respectively. In most samples, these errors were independent of the image angle and modes. Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, high-frequency ultrasound was feasible in imaging abutments and implant fixtures independent of scanning angle within ±30° of normal incidence and for compounding and non-compounding-based imaging modes."

We estimated the prevalence of comorbidities experienced by individuals with SCD enrolled in employer-based health insurance plans in the US over their non-elderly lifetimes (0–64 years of age) with a retrospective cohort design using Truven Health MarketScan commercial claims data from 2007–2018. ICD-9/10 codes were used to identify individuals with SCD using a previously published algorithm. For this cohort, comorbidities associated with SCD were identified across 3 age categories (&lt;18, 18–45, 46–64 years-old), based on the CMS Chronic Comorbidities Warehouse or SCD-specific diagnosis codes, when applicable. The total number of SCD patients available for analysis in each age category was 7,502 (&lt;18 years), 10,183 (18–45 years) and 4,459 (46–64 years). Across all ages, vaso-occlusive pain, infections (non-specific), and fever were the most common comorbidities. Vaso-occlusive pain and infection were the most prevalent conditions for persons age &lt;18- and 18–45-year-olds, while in the 46–54-year-old age group, infection and cardiovascular including pulmonary hypertension were most prevalent. Compared to persons &lt;18 years old, the prevalence of vaso-occlusive pain, fever, and acute chest syndrome claims declined in older populations. The comorbidity burden of SCD is significant across all age groups. SCD patients experience comorbidities of age such as chronic pain, cardio-vascular conditions including pulmonary hypertension and renal disease at far higher rates than the general population. Novel disease modifying therapies in development have the potential to significantly reduce the comorbidity burden of SCD."
https://openalex.org/W4310352179,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection on pregnancy outcome in pregnant Japanese women. We utilized the data from a nationwide birth cohort study, the Japan Environment and Children’s Study (JECS), for this study. We enrolled 26,385 individuals who could refer to data on pregnancy outcomes and confounding factors, with data on CT. Binominal logistic regression models were used to determine whether pregnant women with CT positivity were at more risk of experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes, preterm birth (PTB), preterm prelabor rupture of membrane (pPROM), low birth weight (LBW) infants, small for gestational age (SGA) births, or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). After adjusting for maternal age, parity, marital status, smoking status, and education status, there were no significantly increased risks of PTB, pPROM, LBW infants, SGA, and HDP in the odds ratios. No significant increase in the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was observed in any of the subgroup analyses, which were limited to the pregnancy women in Fukushima prefecture, where CT screening could be confirmed at 28−30 weeks of gestation. We believe that the results of this study will make a significant contribution to the future of medical care for pregnant women in Japan. Our findings are important for medical practitioners to contribute to the future medical treatment of Japanese pregnant women, and also to contribute to pre-conception care for Japanese society as a whole, including pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W4310352190,"The HORSE-BC study previously demonstrated that second-line endocrine therapy (ET) for patients with acquired endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancer (MBC) still provided a clinically meaningful benefit. Herein, we investigated the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the HORSE-BC study.Patients with acquired endocrine-resistant MBC who were scheduled for second-line ET were recruited. The HRQOL was assessed at baseline, and 1 and 3 months after second-line ET initiation. To investigate the minimally important difference (MID) in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES), we evaluated the means and standard deviations for the distribution-based method, and differences in the change in HRQOL for the anchor-based method. We also investigated the association between FACT-ES total scores and clinical benefit.Overall, 56 patients were enrolled. Of these, 47 were analyzed. When defined as 1/3 standard deviation estimates based on the distribution method, the calculated MID was 5.9. The MIDs of the FACT-ES total scores based on the anchor method were 7.7 for decline and 4.1 for improvement. The MID decline proportions were 6.1% and 14.7% lower in patients who experienced clinical benefits than in those who did not at 1 and 3 months, respectively. The ratios of MID improvement in patients who experienced clinical benefits were 18.3% and 3.2% higher, respectively; the mean change in the FACT-ES total score from baseline improved in patients who experienced clinical benefits.Maintaining the HRQOL as determined by FACT-ES may be associated with clinical benefits in patients with acquired endocrine-resistant MBC treated with ET."
https://openalex.org/W4310352197,"Adolescent girls have a greater nutrient demand and their poor dietary intake is associated with micronutrient deficiencies and poor maternal outcomes. Having information on micronutrient intake inadequacy in adolescent girls is critical for promoting healthy behavior and breaking the cycle of intergenerational malnutrition. Thus, this study assessed overall micronutrient intake inadequacy and associated factors among school adolescent girls in Meshenti town of Bahir Dar City Administration, North West Ethiopia.A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 401 adolescent girls from February 7 to 23, 2020. A Simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants. A multiple-pass 24-hour dietary recall with portion size estimation method and recommended dietary allowance cut-off point were used to assess micronutrient intake inadequacy. Overall micronutrient intake inadequacy was measured using the mean adequacy ratio. Nutrient databases were developed by ESHA FOOD PROCESSOR version 8.1 software. Data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify determinants of overall micronutrient intake inadequacy and an adjusted odds ratio at a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to see the strength of statistical association.The prevalence of overall micronutrient intake inadequacy was 44.4% (95% CI: 39.7%-49.6%). Early adolescent age (AOR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.71-4.42), food-insecure household (1.74, 95%CI: 1.087-2.784), low dietary diversity score (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.35-5.92), and high peer pressure on eating and body concern (AOR = 1.853, 95% CI: 1.201-2.857) were significantly associated factors with overall micronutrient intake inadequacy.Findings of this study revealed that micronutrient intake inadequacy among adolescent girls was a high public health problem in the study area. Therefore, attention should be given to adolescent girls of the study area, especially the ones in the early adolescent age. Interventions should also focus on nutrition-sensitive activities to address food insecurity, a less diversified diet, and the negative impact of peer influence."
https://openalex.org/W4310352199,"The fast rate of viral mutations of SARS CoV-2 result in decrease in the efficacy of the vaccines that have been developed before the emergence of these mutations. Thus, it is believed that using additional measures to combat the virus is not only advisable but also beneficial. Two antiviral drugs were authorized for emergency use by the FDA, namely Pfizer’s two-drug regimen sold under the brand name Paxlovid, and Merck’s drug Lagevrio. Pfizer’s two-drug combination consists of nirmatrelvir, a protease inhibitor that blocks coronavirus ability to multiply and another antiviral, ritonavir, that lowers the rate of drug clearance to boost the longevity and activity of the protease inhibitor. Merck’s drug Lagevrio (molnupiravir) is a nucleoside analogue with a mechanism of action that aims to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus. We believe the armament against the virus can be augmented by the addition of another class of enzyme inhibitors that are required for viral survival and its ability to replicate. Enzymes like nsp14 and nsp10/16 methyltransferases (MTases) represent another class of drug targets since they are required for viral RNA translation and evading the host immune system. In this communication, we have successfully verified that the MTase-Glo, which is universal and homogeneous MTase assay can be used to screen for inhibitors of the two pivotal enzymes nsp14 and nsp16 of SARS CoV-2. Furthermore, we have carried out extensive studies on those enzymes using different RNA substrates and tested their activity using various inhibitors and verified the utility of this assay for use in drug screening programs. We anticipate our work will be pursued further to screen for large libraries to discover new and selective inhibitors for the viral enzymes particularly that these enzymes are structurally different from their mammalian counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W4310352349,"We used prospective data (spanning 8 years) from a national sample of older U.S. adults aged &gt; 50 years (the Health and Retirement Study, N = 13,771) to evaluate potential factors that lead to subsequent religious service attendance. We applied a lagged exposure-wide epidemiologic design and evaluated 60 candidate predictors of regular subsequent religious service attendance. Candidate predictors were drawn from the following domains: health behaviors, physical health, psychological well-being, psychological distress, social factors, and work. After rigorous adjustment for a rich set of potential confounders, we observed modest evidence that changes in some indices of physical health, psychological well-being, psychological distress, and social functioning predicted regular religious service attendance four years later. Our findings suggest that there may be opportunities to support more regular religious service attendance among older adults who positively self-identify with a religious/spiritual tradition (e.g., aid services for those with functional limitations, psychological interventions to increase hope), which could have downstream benefits for various dimensions of well-being in the later years of life."
https://openalex.org/W4310352356,"Achieving reliable power efficiency from a high voltage induction motor (HVIM) is a great challenge, as the rigorous control strategy is susceptible to unexpected failure. External cooling is commonly used in an HVIM cooling system, and it is a vital part of the motor that is responsible for keeping the motor at the proper operating temperature. A malfunctioning cooling system component can cause motor overheating, which can destroy the motor and cause the entire plant to shut down. As a result, creating a dynamic model of the motor cooling system for quality performance, failure diagnosis, and prediction is critical. However, the external motor cooling system design in HVIM is limited and separately done in the past. With this issue in mind, this paper proposes a combined modeling approach to the HVIM cooling system which consists of integrating the electrical, thermal, and cooler model using the mathematical model for thermal performance improvement. Firstly, the development of an electrical model using an established mathematical model. Subsequently, the development of a thermal model using combined mathematical and linear regression models to produce motor temperature. Then, a modified cooler model is developed to provide cold air temperature for cooling monitoring. All validated models are integrated into a single model called the HVIM cooling system as the actual setup of the HVIM. Ultimately, the core of this modeling approach is integrating all models to accurately represent the actual signals of the motor cooler temperature. Then, the actual signals are used to validate the whole structure of the model using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) analysis. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the HVIM cooling system representation with less than 1% error tolerance based on the industrial plant experts. Thus, it will be helpful for future utilization in quality maintenance, fault identification and prediction study."
https://openalex.org/W4310352370,"Despite the availability of various pressure injury (PI) prevention strategies (e.g., risk identification, use of pressure re-distribution surfaces, frequent repositioning), they persist as a significant issue for healthcare systems worldwide. Continuous pressure imaging (CPI) is a novel technology that could be integrated within a comprehensive approach to the prevention of PIs. We studied the perceptions of healthcare providers and patients/families to identify facilitators and barriers to the use of this technology.Hospitalized patients/family members from a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of CPI in preventing PIs completed a survey after 72 hours (or upon discharge from hospital) of CPI monitoring. They were asked questions about prior and current experience with CPI technology. For healthcare providers, perceptions on the use of the device and its impact on care were explored through a survey distributed by email or hard copies.A total of 125 healthcare providers and 525 patients/family members completed the surveys. Of the healthcare providers, 95% either agreed/strongly agreed that the CPI technology was easy to use and 65% stated that the device improved how they provided pressure relief for patients. Identified issues with the device were cost, the fitting of the mattress cover, and the fixation of the patients/families on the device. Over a quarter of the patient/family respondents agreed/strongly agreed that the device influenced how pressure relief was provided. This response was statistically associated with whether the monitor was turned on (intervention arm; 52.7%) or off (control arm; 4.2%).CPI technology was positively perceived by healthcare providers. Most patients/families felt it influenced care when the CPI monitor was turned on. Concerns raised around cost and the ease of use of these devices by healthcare providers may affect the decisions of healthcare system administrators to adopt and implement this technology."
https://openalex.org/W4310358045,"Globally, at least 4.7 million people die from being overweight or obese. In Ethiopia, the level of overweight and obesity among women grew from 3% to 8%. However, as far as my literature searching, studies concerning the spatial variation of overweight/obesity and factors associated are not researched in Ethiopia using geospatial techniques. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the spatial variation of overweight/obesity and factor associated among reproductive age group women in Ethiopia using geospatial techniques.A total weighted sample of 10,928 reproductive age women were included in the study. ArcGIS version10.7 was used to explore the spatial variation of overweight/obesity. Bernoulli based model was used to analyze the purely spatial cluster detection of overweight/obesity through SaTScan version 9.6.1 software. Ordinary Least Square analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis was employed to assess the association between an outcome variable and explanatory variables by using ArcGIS 10.7 software. P value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statically significant.The spatial distribution of overweight/obesity in Ethiopia was clustered. Statistically, a significant-high hot spot overweight/obesity was identified at Addis Ababa, harrari, Dire Dawa. SaTScan identified 66 primary spatial clusters (RR = 4.17, P < 0.001) located at Addis Ababa, southeast amhara, central part of oromia region and northern part of SNNP region. In geographically weighted regression, rich wealth index, women's age (35-39 and 40-44 years), watching TV, internet use and not working were statistically significant that affecting spatial variation of overweight/obesity.In Ethiopia, overweight/obesity varies across the region. Statistically, significant-high hot spots of overweight/obesity were detected in Addis Ababa, Harari, Dire Dawa, some parts of Amhara and afar region, most of the Oromia and Somalia region, and the South Nation Nationality and People region of Ethiopia. Therefore, the ministry of health and the Ethiopian public health institute, try to initiate policies and practices that could include providing funding for physical education as well as recreational centers in communities most in need. In addition, public and private mass media create awareness of healthy lifestyles is promoted by health education regarding increased physical activity and reduced sedentary behavior through various media platforms."
https://openalex.org/W4310358385,"Routine use of the Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28) to assess the disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is limited due to its dependency on laboratory investigations and the complex calculations involved. In contrast, the clinical disease activity index (CDAI) is simple to calculate, which makes the ""treat to target"" strategy for the management of RA more practical. We aimed to assess the validity of CDAI compared to DAS28 in RA patients in Sri Lanka. A total of 103 newly diagnosed RA patients were recruited, and their disease activity was calculated using DAS 28 and CDAI during the first visit to the clinic (0 months) and re-assessed at 4 and 9 months of follow-up visits. The validity of the CDAI, compared to DAS 28, was evaluated. Patients had a female preponderance (6:1) and a short symptom duration (mean = 6.33 months). Internal consistency reliability of CDAI, as assessed by Cronbach’s α test, was 0.868. Convergent validity was assessed by correlation and Kappa statistics. Strong positive correlations were observed between CDAI and DAS 28 at the baseline (0 months), 4 and 9 months of evaluation (Spearman’s r = 0.935, 0.935, 0.910, respectively). Moderate-good inter-rater agreements between the DAS-28 and CDAI were observed (Weighted kappa of 0.660, 0.519, and 0.741 at 0, 4, and 9 months respectively). Discriminant validity, as assessed by ROC curves at 0, 4 th , and 9 th months of the evaluation, showed the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.958, 0.979, and 0.910, respectively. The suggested cut-off points for different CDAI disease activity categories according to ROC curves were ≤ 4 (Remission), &gt; 4 to ≤ 6 (low), &gt; 6 to ≤ 18 (moderate), &gt; 18 (high). These findings indicate that the CDAI has good concordance with DAS 28 in assessing the disease activity in RA patients, in this study sample."

The objective of this study was to document changes in HIV care associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at selected clinics in Central Africa, along with clinic-level strategies for minimizing disruptions in HIV care and treatment for people with HIV (PWH).A 51-item questionnaire on COVID-19 pandemic-associated changes in HIV service delivery was completed by clinicians involved in HIV care at 21 clinics in five countries participating in Central Africa International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (CA-IeDEA). The survey was completed at two timepoints: June-July 2020 and October 2020 to February 2021. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize changes in HIV care and related services.While 81% of sites reported at least one negative consequence of COVID-19 for clinic operations during the first survey, none reported suspending antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation services for new patients, and 24% reported adopting telemedicine. In the follow-up survey, fewer sites (48%) reported at least one disruption to clinic operations, and more sites reported mitigation strategies, including expanding rapid ART initiation services and providing extra supplies of ART medications to reduce visit frequency. In the follow-up survey, more sites, especially in Rwanda, reported stockouts of commodities, including HIV and viral load testing and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. More than one-fifth of sites reported stockouts of second- or third-line ART at each survey timepoint.While the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in concerning disruptions to HIV service delivery at CA-IeDEA sites, most of these disruptions attenuated over time, and many sites introduced measures to help PWH avoid frequent visits to the clinic for care and medications. The impact of HIV commodity stockouts and clinic mitigation strategies on treatment outcomes needs to be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W4310436464,"With a cluster of commodity hardware, how can we efficiently find all connected components of an enormous graph containing hundreds of billions of nodes and edges? The problem of finding connected components has been used in various applications such as pattern recognition, reachability indexing, graph compression, graph partitioning, and random walk. Several studies have been proposed to efficiently find connected components in various environments. Most existing single-machine and distributed-memory algorithms are limited in scalability as they have to load all data generated during the process into the main memory; they require expensive machines with vast memory capacities to handle large graphs. Several MapReduce algorithms try to handle large graphs by exploiting distributed storage but fail due to data explosion problems, which is a phenomenon that significantly increases the size of data as the computation proceeds. The latest MapReduce algorithms resolve the problem by proposing two distinguishing star-operations and executing them alternately, while the star-operations still cause massive network traffic as a star-operation is a distributed operation that connects each node to its smallest neighbor. In this paper, we unite the two star-operations into a single operation, namely UniStar, and propose UniCon, a new distributed algorithm for finding connected components in enormous graphs using UniStar. The partition-aware processing of UniStar effectively resolves the data explosion problems. We further optimize UniStar by filtering dispensable edges and exploiting a hybrid data structure. Experimental results with a cluster of 10 cheap machines each of which is equipped with Intel Xeon E3-1220 CPU (4-cores at 3.10GHz), 16GB RAM, and 2 SSDs of 1TB show that UniCon is up to 13 times faster than competitors on real-world graphs. UniCon succeeds in processing a tremendous graph with 129 billion edges, which is up to 4096 times larger than graphs competitors can process."
https://openalex.org/W4310436560,"Introduction This paper examines the convergence of the opinions of European higher education institution (HEI) experts on possible implementation of dual career policies and provision areas at university level. Methods An online 32-item questionnaire encompassing 26 dual career aspects collected the opinion of European HEI experts as the last phase of a Delphi method preceded by i) focus groups with student-athletes who aimed to identify needs for dual careers and ii) a workshop with 21 dual career experts to generate the statements to be included in the survey. Seventy-one HEI experts from 12 EU member states participated in the survey, rating each dual career aspect identified in previous phases. Results The relative position of each aspect has been plotted based on relevance (x-axis) and feasibility (y-axis). The Quadrant IV of the resulting scatterplots identified the following nine aspects rated as highly relevant and highly feasible for implementation: tutorship/mentorship, psychological support, programmes based on integration of academic departments and sports services, and adaptable programmes to the needs of each student-athletes (assistance/tutorship area), individual study plans and distance learning (curricula requirements area), publicity for student-athletes and initiatives for increasing the awareness of student-athletes and knowledge of dual career issues (social support area), and access to educational facilities (logistic support area). Discussion and conclusions The HEI experts’ views represent a coherent and useful starting point to develop a deep understanding of the considered 26 aspects founded on a phenomenological lifeworld-led approach and emphasizes the need for a minimum standard for dual career policies and provisions."
https://openalex.org/W4310436568,"In this paper, we propose a simple and elegant method to extract the thickness and the optical constants of various films from the reflectance and transmittance spectra in the wavelength range of 350 − 1000 nm. The underlying inverse problem is posed here as an optimization problem. To find unique solutions to this problem, we adopt an evolutionary optimization approach that drives a population of candidate solutions towards the global optimum. An ensemble of Tauc-Lorentz Oscillators (TLOs) and an ensemble of Gaussian Oscillators (GOs), are leveraged to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra for different candidate thickness values and refractive index profiles. This model-based optimization is solved using two efficient evolutionary algorithms (EAs), namely genetic algorithm (GA) and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMAES), such that the resulting spectra simultaneously fit all the given data points in the admissible wavelength range. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in estimating the optical parameters of interest."
https://openalex.org/W4310436952,"Objectives Studies have identified increased cancer risk among patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared to the general population. However, evidence of all-cause and site-specific cancer risk associated with different bearing surfaces has varied, with previous studies having short latency periods with respect to use of modern Metal-on-Metal (MoM) bearings. Using the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) linked to Australasian Association of Cancer Registries data, our aim was to evaluate risk of all-cause and site-specific cancer according to bearing surfaces in patients undergoing THA for osteoarthritis and whether risk increased with MoM bearings. Methods Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by comparing number of observed cancer cases to expected number based on incidence rate in the Australian population. All-cause and site-specific cancer rates were calculated for all conventional stemmed THA (csTHA) and resurfacing THA (rsTHA) procedures performed for osteoarthritis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare cancer rates for MoM, ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) and resurfacing procedures with a comparison group comprising metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) or ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP) procedures. Results There were 156,516 patients with csTHA procedures and 11,321 with rsTHA procedures for osteoarthritis performed between 1999 and 2012. Incidence of all-cause cancer was significantly higher for csTHA (SIR 1.24, 95% CI 1.22–1.26) and rsTHA (SIR 1.74, 95% CI 1.39–2.04) compared to the Australian population. For csTHA, there was no significant difference in all-site cancer rates for MoM (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.01, 95%CI 0.96–1.07) or CoC (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.94–1.02) compared to MoP and CoP bearings. Significantly increased risk of melanoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, myeloma, leukaemia, prostate, colon, bladder and kidney cancer was found for csTHA and, prostate cancer, melanoma for rsTHA procedures when compared to the Australian population, although risk was not significantly different across bearing surfaces. Conclusions csTHA and rsTHA procedures were associated with increased cancer incidence compared to the Australian population. However, no excess risk was observed for MoM or CoC procedures compared to other bearing surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W4310437259,"Figure skating is associated with a high prevalence of sport-specific injuries and overuse symptoms. Impacts are of greater magnitude in jumps with more revolutions that are thus connected to a greater risk of injury. While figure skating programs seem to have recently increased in difficulty, performance trends have not yet been reported in the literature. We hypothesized increasing performance and decreasing age trends of the best athletes who competed at international level in recent years. Furthermore, we aimed to identify and analyse objective performance parameters and to assess a potential link between age and the risk of injury. The development of the number of double, triple and quadruple jumps in the singles figure skating events at the World and European Championships since the introduction of the new ISU Judging System in the 2004/2005 season was analysed using regression statistics and Student's T-Tests. In all groups, the numbers of jumps with fewer rotations significantly decreased in the favour of jumps with more rotations. Women only started to perform jumps with four rotations in 2019. In the men, the number of quadruple jumps increased from an average of less than one to more than three in recent years (European and World Championships, both p < 0.001). In the European, but not in the World Championships, the average age increased in the men and decreased in the women (European Championships, men and women p = 0.006). Our study was the first to assess performance trends in elite figure skating. The incidence of injuries and overuse syndromes in figure skating needs to be monitored cautiously, as increases can be expected following recent gains in performance and jump complexity."
https://openalex.org/W4310437737,"Vulnerable populations such as camped refugees are often exposed to spread of infectious diseases because of their living conditions, limited resources available to them and exclusion from social services. This study examined the psychological state of camped refugees in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic and how their background characteristics predict the severity of the pandemic’s psychological impact. It covered 763 refugees aged 15 years and above resident in two (Krisan = 316 and Ampain = 447) camps. Nine COVID-19 Anxiety Scale indicators were used to examine the psychological state of camped refugees. A composite indicator was derived to examine the overall psychological impact. Logistic regression was used to examine the factors that were associated with severe psychological impact. The multivariate analysis revealed that sex of the respondent, marital status and age of head of household were the only socio-demographic factors associated with having a severe psychological impact of the pandemic. There was very strong evidence that respondents who had moderate (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.7) and high (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.63) knowledge of the disease had increased odds of severe psychological impact. Also, those with moderate (OR = 2.97, 95% CI = 1.78, 4.97) and high (OR = 12.98, 95% CI = 7.86, 21.42) adherence had increased odds of severe psychological impact. None of the pre-existing health conditions and challenges were not significantly associated with severe psychological impact. The limited number of significant socio-demographic covariates suggests that severe psychological impact of the pandemic was a problem in the general population, and thus interventions should target the general population of camped refugees. Also, health education should not only focus on enhancing knowledge and promoting preventive measures but also on managing psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W4310437817,"Social network analysis (SNA) is an increasingly popular and effective tool for modeling psychological phenomena. Through application to the personality literature, social networks, in conjunction with passive, non-invasive sensing technologies, have begun to offer powerful insight into personality state variability. Resultant constructions of social networks can be utilized alongside machine learning-based frameworks to uniquely model personality states. Accordingly, this work leverages data from a previously published study to combine passively collected wearable sensor information on face-to-face, workplace social interactions with ecological momentary assessments of personality state. Data from 54 individuals across six weeks was used to explore the relative importance of 26 unique structural and nodal social network features in predicting individual changes in each of the Big Five (5F) personality states. Changes in personality state were operationalized by calculating the weekly root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) in 5F state scores measured daily via self-report. Using only SNA-derived features from wearable sensor data, boosted tree-based machine learning models explained, on average, approximately 28–30% of the variance in individual personality state change. Model introspection implicated egocentric features as the most influential predictors across 5F-specific models, with network efficiency, constraint, and effective size measures among the most important. Feature importance profiles for each 5F model partially echoed previous empirical findings. Results support future efforts focusing on egocentric components of SNA and suggest particular investment in exploring efficiency measures to model personality fluctuations within the workplace setting."
https://openalex.org/W4310437947,"Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) are territorial, group living carnivores that live in packs typically consisting of a dominant breeding pair and their offspring. Breeding tenures are relatively short and competitive, with vacancies usually occurring following a breeder's death, and are often filled by unrelated immigrants or by relatives of the previous breeder. The frequency and conditions of active breeder displacements are poorly understood. Position changes in the dominance hierarchy are common yet rarely documented in detail. We describe a male breeding position turnover in a wolf pack by males from a neighboring pack in mid-summer 2016 in Yellowstone National Park. Over the course of two months, three males from the Mollie's pack displaced the breeding male of the neighboring Wapiti Lake pack, joined the pack's two adult females, and subsequently raised the previous male's four approximately three-month old pups. In the five years following the displacement (2017 to 2021), at least one of the intruding males has successfully bred with the dominant female and most years with a subordinate female (who was one of the pups at the time of displacement). The pack reared pups to adulthood each year. Male breeding displacements are likely influenced by male-male competition and female mate choice. These changes are the result of individuals competing to improve breeding position and may lead to increased pack stability and greater reproductive success. We report in detail on the behavior of a closely observed breeding displacement and we discuss the adaptive benefits of the change."

This qualitative investigation explored, through observation, how 30 caregivers responded to a HIV Disclosure study conducted between 2017 and 2020 at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Soweto, South Africa. Caregivers were assisted in disclosing to their children, aged 7-13 years; followed by a sub-sample of caregivers providing in-depth interviews to elaborate on findings.1) Barriers to disclosure included: caregivers being ill equipped, the fear of negative consequences and children considered lacking emotional or cognitive readiness. 2) Deflecting diagnosis from their children and the need for medication, motivated caregivers to disclosure. 3) Apprehension was evident during disclosure; however, overall disclosure was a positive experience with the support of the healthcare providers. These results highlight the significant role healthcare providers' play in supporting caregivers through the disclosure process."
