https://openalex.org/W2025751554,"The administration of vita-min D(3) to rachitic chicks induces in intestinal mucosal tissue the formation or elaboration of a calcium-binding factor which is found in the supernatant of the mucosal homogenate. The enhanced binding of Ca by the ""vitanmin D"" supernatant (in contrast to ""rachitic"" supernatant) was indicated by a slower rate of diffusion of Ca(45) across a cellophane dialyzing membrane and by a lesser amount of Ca(45) being bound to an ion-exchange resin (Chelex-100) in the presence of vitamiiin D(3) supernatant. The binding activity was only associated with the protein fraction from a Sephadex G-25 column and was destroyed by trypsin digestion. This and other evidence suggest that the soluble factor is a protein. The vitamin D(3)-enhanced duodenal absorption of Ca(47) in rachitic chicks occurred almost simultaneously with the appearance of the vitamin D(3)-induced factor, and there was good correlation between the concentration of binding factor and the rate of absorption of Ca(47)."

Filamentous organic structures of probable biological origin, and complex alkanes, which apparently contain small amounts of the isoprenoid hydrocarbons pristane and phytane, are also indigenous to this Early Precambrian sediment. These organic remnants comprise the oldest known evidence of biological organization in the geologic record."

https://openalex.org/W2069597518,"Rabbit tropomyosin exhibits a polymorphism dependent on divalent cations and pH. Above a critical divalent cation concentration fibers with a period of about 400 angstroms are formed. Below this concentration, and near the isoelectric point, lattices are formed. Implications for the morphology and function of striated and smooth muscle are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2023736388,Partition coefficients of monovalent trace ions between liquids and either solid NaNO3 or KCl were determined. The isotropic elastic model of ionic crystals was used for calculating the energy change caused by the ionic substitutions. The observed values of partition coefficients in KCl are in good agreement with calculated values.
https://openalex.org/W1982771599,"The first occurrence of deep-sea Lower Cretaceous (Albian) sediments in the Pacific Ocean is reported from the Shatsky Rise at 31 degrees 51'N, 157 degrees 20'E. Seismic-profile records indicate that the core was taken between the extensive seismic reflectors A and B. Two hundred meters of unconsolidated sediment lies between the core site and basement (B) and suiggests that the sediment just above basement may be at least as old as Middle Jurassic."
https://openalex.org/W2002222198,A much sharper and lower superconducting transition has been found for alpha-uranium than any reported previously. A model that explains the unusual volume dependence of alpha-uranium below 43 degrees K and the unusual pressure dependence of its superconducting transition temperature is presented.
https://openalex.org/W2036147157,"A common test for the presence of toxic organic substances in plant tissues, and therefore of the potential role of antibiosis (specifically allelopathy) in native plant cozmmunities, has been to apply a water extract of the tissues in germination tests of cultivated annuals. The observed osmotic pressure of the extracts can be high, and sucrose solutions of similar osmotic pressure result in a depression of germnination and early development. Thus in the aforementioned type of test, extracts must be diluted to an osmotic pressure no greater than 0.5 atmopheres."

https://openalex.org/W2043249919,Incorporation of H(3)-leucine into dorsal root ganglion cells in rats was markedly increased over that of controls following section of sciatic and femoral nerves. Crush lesion of dorsal roots did not increase the H(3)-leucine uptake of these cells except in animals which had received nerve growth factor after the operation.
https://openalex.org/W1978807546,"Chlorocarbonyl-bis(triphenylphosphine)iridium(I), in solution, reacts reversibly with carbon monoxide under normal conditions, one molecule per metal atom. Formation of a 1 : 1 metal complex-CO adduct is verified by CO absorption measurements and the infrared spectrum of the adduct measured in situ. The spectrum suggests that the metal-C-O bonding is of the type found in conventional metal carbonyl."
https://openalex.org/W2087717252,"The performance of female rats, in pressing a bar for electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus, changes during the estrous cycle. Highest bar-pressing rates accompany the appearance of vaginal cornification. This increase is not an artifact of increased spontaneous activity at estrus, although the factors underlying these changes in activity may also mediate the changes in self-stimulation behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1967282019,"Hydrocortisone depresses hemnolytic complement in male and female mice. Testosterone causes increase of serum complement in female mice, and diethylstilbestrol causes decrease of serum complement in male mice, in each instance to activities approximating those found normally in the opposite sex. Male and female sex hormones have no effect, in the doses used, on the serum complement of male and female mice respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1982410834,"When tooth germs derived from 14-day mouse embryos were cultured on gelatin sponges in vitro for 37 days, they lost their characteristic morphology, appearing as a layer of undifferentiated epithelium on the sponge surface, with the mesenchymal cells scattered throughout the interstices. These cultures were then transplanted subcutaneously into isologous, newborn recipients and, over a period of 56 days, developed into incisor teeth that were almost perfect in shape and structure."
https://openalex.org/W2078422171,"The paired optic lobes of teleost fish are connected by two commissures. One of these, the tectal commissure, was studied with metal microelectrodes. Fibers are rhythmically active for prolonged periods in the dark and respond to light by a decrease in the rate of discharge. There is a rebound acceleration when the light is turned of. Each fiber is influenced by light in one eye only, and there is no response when light is projected into the opposite eye. This behavior resembles the ""off"" response recorded from the optic lobes and the optic nerve of fish. Unlike most units from the visual pathways of lower animals, single commissural fibers do not seem to give any recognizable response to patterned input such as small light or dark objects or small light sources stationary or moving anywhere in the visual field, nor do they respond to a vertical black bar moved over a white background."
https://openalex.org/W2092013562,"It is argued that the single-layer ionosphere at 125 kilometers discovered in the Mariner IV occultation experiment is an F1 region coinciding with the ultraviolet photoionization peak. The CO2 density there must be of the order of 1011 molecules per cubic centimeter. Such a density is consistent with the properties of the lower atmosphere by Mariner IV and the temperature model of Chamberlain and McElroy if the atmosphere is mainly CO2 below 70 kilometers. The absence of an F2 region can be explained even if the density ratio of O to CO2 is 100 at 230 kilometers on the basis of the rapid conversion of O+ to O2 by CO2. Thus a model with an exospheric temperature of 400Â°K, a modest degree of CO2 dissociation, and diffusive separation above 70 kilometers is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2090182323,"Rabbit antiserums were prepared against three submicrosomal fractions from liver of normal or phenobarbital-treated rats. The two membrane fractions originating from the rough- and smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum were characterized by the same soluble antigens, with the exception of a highly basic coinponent present only in extracts of rough membranes. The third fraction, whose subcellular origin is unknown, was different. It contained at least two typical marker antigens not present in the other fractions. Of eight tissue antigens common for the endoplasmic reticulum, five displayed nonspecific esterase activity. Some of these esterases were also found in other organs, but none was seen in rat serum. Phenobarbital treatment of the rats led to a rise in activity and characteristic changes in the esterase patterns of all these submicrosomal liver fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2091891896,"An unusual homocysteine-containing compound, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide-5'-S-homocysteinylriboside, was isolated from the urine of a child with homocystinuria and detected in the urines of six homocystinurics. Its metabolic origin is not clear, and the data suggest the existence in man of now unknown alternate pathways for the metabolism of methionine and of purines."
https://openalex.org/W2015474081,"Sex hormones influence the hemolytic of one or more of the late-acting components of complement measured in the presence of trisodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The titers of the serums of male mice, normally tenfold higher than those of females, fell after castration, becoming about the same as those of females. The titers of the serums from females rose after these mice were castrated, but castration did not affect the activities of the first, second, and fourth components of complement. Serums of normal and castrated mice of both sexes treated with testosterone showed increased late-acting component activity, whereas the estrogen caused decreased activity. Treatment in vitro of mouse serum with these hormones had no effect on the activity of late-acting components."
https://openalex.org/W2018541639,"Immunofluorescent techniques have demonstrated a difference in surface components of hyphae and rhizoids of Allomyces macrogynus. An antigenic component detected on the rhizoidal surface may be present, but masked, in the hyphal-wall matrix material. The system also allows visualization of the hyphal wall during aging, when changes from a smooth to a fissured surface are noted, and differences in adsorptive properties occur."
https://openalex.org/W1965199876,The degree of organization of polyribonucleotides determines their modalities of reaction with antibodies (NG-I) which are present in serums of animals hyperimmunized with ribosomes. The immunochemical behavior of the highly helical two-stranded complex of polyadenylic acid and polyuridylic acid and the corresponding three-stranded complex of one molecule of polyadenylic acid and two molecules of polyuridylic acid can be determined from examination of the associatinge and nonassociating mixtures of polyadenylic and polyuridylic acids. The immunochemical characteristics of various forms of polyinosinic acid in solution are described.

https://openalex.org/W2039212235,Fourteen radiocarbon dates of shells and wood from late Pleistocene sediments in northwest Washington provide evidence for correlation of the Everson interstadial with the Two Creeks interval of the midcontinent and suggest possible correlations between the Sumas and Valders stadials and between the Vashon stadial and part of the Tazewell-Cary advances.
https://openalex.org/W1999742609,"Single tobacco callus cells with or without tobacco mosaic virus inclusion bodies from systemically infected Nicotiana tabacum plants were grown in microcultures. The culture medium consisted of mineral salts and sucrose; it also contained coconut milk. Out of 100 inclusion-bearing cells and 150 inclusion-free cells, 10 and 70 cultured cells divided; eventually 5 and 65 cells, respectively, formed single cell clones. The 5 clones derived from inclusion-bearing cells, and all but 3 of 40 clones from inclusion-free cells, showed virus inclusions in somne cells. The virus could not be detected in three inclusion-free clones by local lesion assay. The results suggest single-cell culture methods for differentiating virus-free plants from cells of pathogen-infected plants."
