https://openalex.org/W1991517295,"Three major species of viral DNA have been observed in cells infected by retroviruses: a linear, double-stranded copy of a subunit of viral RNA; closed circular DNA; and proviral DNA inserted covalently into the genome of the host cell. We have studied the structures of the unintegrated forms of avian sarcoma virus (ASA) DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis in conjunction with restriction endonucleases and molecular hybridization techniques. The linear duplex DNA is approximately the same length as a subunit of viral RNA (approximately 10 kb) and it bears natural repeats of approximately 300 nucleotides at its termini. The repeats are composed of sequences derived from both the 3' and 5' termini of viral RNA in a manner suggesting that the viral DNA polymerase is transferred twice between templates. Thus the first end begins with a sequence from the 5' terminus of viral RNA and is permuted by about 100 nucleotides with respect to the 3' terminus of viral RNA; the linear DNA terminates with a sequence of about 200 nucleotides derived from the 3' end of viral RNA. We represent this structure, synthesized from right to left, as 3'5'-----3'5'. Two closed circular species of approximately monomeric size have been identified. The less abundant species contain all the sequences identified in linear DNA, including two copies in tandem of the 300 nucleotide 3'5' repeat. The major species lacks about 300 base pairs (bp) mapped to the region of the repeated sequence; thus it presumably contains only a single copy of that sequence. The strategies used to determine these structures involved the assignment of over 20 cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases on the physical maps of ASV DNA. Several strains of ASV were compared with respect to these sites, and the sites have been located in relation to deletions frequently observed in the env and src genes of ASV."

https://openalex.org/W1494422769,"Sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane vesicle fractions were isolated from cardiac microsomes. Separation of sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane markers was documented by a combination of correlative assay and centrifugation techniques. To facilitate the separation, the crude microsomes were incubated in the presence of ATP, Ca2+, and oxalate to increase the density of the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. After sucrose gradient centrifugation, the densest subfraction (sarcoplasmic reticulum) contained the highest (K+,Ca2+)-ATPase activity and virtually no (Na2+,K+)-ATPase activity, even when latent (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity was unmasked. In addition, the sarcoplasmic reticulum fraction contained no significant sialic acid, beta receptor binding activity, or adenylate cyclase activity. Sarcolemmal membrane fractions were of low buoyant density. Preparations most enriched in sarcolemmal vesicles contained the highest level of all the other parameters and only about 10% of the (K+,Ca2+)-ATPase activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum fraction. The results suggest that (Na+,K+)-ATPase, sialic acid, beta-adrenergic receptors, and adenylate cyclase can be entirely accounted for by the sarcolemmal content of cardiac microsomes. Gel electrophoresis of the sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane fractions showed distinct bands. Membrane proteins exclusive to each of the fractions were also demonstrated by phosphorylation. Cyclic AMP stimulated phosphorylation by [gamma-32P]ATP of two proteins of apparent Mr = 20,000 and 7,000 that were concentrated in sarcoplasmic reticulum, but the stimulation was markedly dependent on the presence of added soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Cyclic AMP also stimulated phosphorylation of membrane proteins in sarcolemma, but this phosphorylation was mediated by an endogenous protein kinase activity. The apparent molecular weights of these phosphorylated proteins were 165,000, 90,000, 56,000, 24,000, and 11,000. The results suggest that sarcolemma may contain an integral enzyme complex, not present in sarcoplasmic reticulum, that contains beta-adrenergic receptors, adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and several substrates of the protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1997664029,"We have analyzed the DNA from 15 clones of avian sarcoma virus (ASV)-transformed rat cells with restriction endonucleases and molecular hybridization techniques to determine the location and structure of proviral DNA. All twenty units of proviral DNA identified in these 15 clones appear to be inserted at different sites in host DNA. In each of the ten cases that could be sufficiently well mapped, entirely different regions of cellular DNA were involved. Thus ASV DNA can be accommodated at many positions in cellular DNA, but the existence of preferred sites has not been excluded. Six of the 15 clones carry only one normal provirus, two contain two normal proviruses, and seven harbor either one or two proviruses that appear anomalous in physical mapping tests. Both ends of at least 18 proviruses, however, were found to contain sequences specific to both the 3' and 5' termini of viral RNA. The organization of these terminally redundant sequences appeared identical to that of the 300 base pair (bp) repeats found at the ends of unintegrated linear DNA (Shank et al., 1978). Proviral DNA is therefore co-extensive, or nearly co-extensive, with unintegrated linear DNA and has a structure we denote as CELL DNA-3'5'----------3'5'-CELL DNA. Three of the four anomalous proviruses which were fully analyzed were deletion mutants lacking 25--65% of the genetic content of ASV; the fourth provirus had a novel site for cleavage by Eco RI but was otherwise normal. Tests for the biological competence of proviral DNA, based upon rescue of transforming virus after fusion with chicken cells, were generally consistent with the physical mapping studies."

https://openalex.org/W2042295629,"Purified rat Schwann cells were found to proliferate very slowly in normal growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Crude extracts of bovine pituitary or brain markedly enhanced Schwann cell growth, while similar extracts of nerve roots, liver and kidney did not. Pituitary extracts were more potent than brain extracts, and extracts from both anterior and posterior pituitary were active. The mitogenic activity of pituitary extracts was reduced by treatment with trypsin, and abolished by pronase and by boiling. A variety of known anterior and posterior pituitary hormones, as well as fibroblast, epidermal and nerve growth factors, were not mitogenic. FCS (greater than 1%) was required for Schwann cell proliferation, but even high concentrations of FCS did not substitute for pituitary or brain extracts, and serum from various other species did not support Schwann cell growth. Although various agents that increase cyclic AMP levels (such as cholera toxin) had been shown to be Schwann cell mitogens, extracts of pituitary or brain did not increase cyclic AMP levels. Extracts of various bovine tissues, including pituitary, brain, liver and kidney, acted synergistically with cholera toxin in stimulating Schwann cell proliferation, although the increase in cyclic AMP induced by the mixture was not greater than that seen with cholera toxin alone. We conclude that there are at least two separate pathways for stimulating Schwann cell division, only one of which involves an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1597402433,"A partially purified extract from thymus tissue termed thymosin Fraction 5 has been shown to reconstitute immunological deficiencies resulting from the lack of thymic function in several animal models, as well as humans with primary and secondary immunodeficiency diseases. Thymosin Fraction 5 consists of a family of polypeptides with molecular weights ranging from 1,000 to 15,000. Several of these polypeptides contribute individually to the biological activity of the parent compound. Two polypeptide components of thymosin Fraction 5, termed thymosin alpha1 and polypeptide beta1, have been characterized chemically and biologically. Thymosin alpha1 is a highly acidic molecule composed of 28 amino acid residues. This polypeptide has potent biological activity and has been found to be 10 to 1,000 times as active as thymosin Fraction 5 in one in vivo and several in vitro bioassay systems designed to measure differentiation and function of thymus-dependent lymphocytes (T cells). Polypeptide beta1, in contrast, is inactive in our bioassay systems, suggesting that it is not involved in thymic hormone action. Sequence analysis and homology studies have indicated that polypeptide beta1, although present in Fraction 5, does not contribute to the biological activity of thymosin Fraction 5."
https://openalex.org/W2065391658,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) chromatin isolated from infected BSC-1 cell nuclei was incubated with deoxyribonuclease I, staphylococcal nuclease or an endonuclease endogenous to BSC-1 cells under conditions selected to introduce one doublestrand break into the viral DNA. Full-length linear DNA was isolated, and the distribution of sites of initial cleavage by each endonuclease was determined by restriction enzyme mapping. Initial cleavage of SV40 chromatin by deoxyribonuclease I or by endogenous nuclease reduced the recovery of Hind III fragment C by comparison with the other Hind III fragments. Similarly, Hpa I fragment B recovery was reduced by comparison with the other Hpa I fragments. When isolated SV40 DNA rather than SV40 chromatin was the substrate for an initial cut by deoxyribonuclease I or endogenous nuclease, the recovery of all Hind III or Hpa I fragments was approximately that expected for random cleavage. Initial cleavage by staphylococcal nuclease of either SV40 DNA or SV40 chromatin occurred randomly as judged by recovery of Hind III or Hpa I fragments. These results suggest that, in at least a portion of the SV40 chromatin population, a region located in Hind III fragment C and Hpa I fragment B is preferentially cleaved by deoxyribonuclease I or by endogenous nuclease but not by staphylococcal nuclease. Complementary information about this nuclease-sensitive region was provided by the appearance of clusters of new DNA fragments after restriction enzyme digestion of DNA from viral chromatin initially cleaved by endogenous nuclease. From the sizes of new fragments produced by different restriction enzymes, preferential endonucleolytic cleavage of SV40 chromatin has been located between map positions 0.67 and 0.73 on the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W1506202992,"Binding and proximity relationships of hydrophobic ligands on human serum albumin have been studied using absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ligands studied were bilirubin, two conjugated linear polyene fatty acids, cis-parinaric acid and cis-eleostearic acid, and three nitroxide derivatives of stearic acid with doxyl groups at positions 5, 10, and 12, respectively. Binding of polyene fatty acids was monitored by absorption peak shifts, induced circular dichroism, enhancement of fluorescence, and energy transfer between albumin's single tryptophanyl residue and the polyene chromophore. Induced circular dichroism studies indicate excitonic ligand-ligand interaction between bound fatty acids. Fluorescence enhancement of cis-parinaric acid was analyzed using a stepwise multiple equilibrium model, and six binding constants in the range 10(8) to 10(6) M-1 were obtained, in agreement with previous measurements for other fatty acids. The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants indicates that the binding enthalpy is nearly zero. Fluorescence energy transfer was similarly used to quantitate bilirubin binding to albumin. Energy transfer, nitroxide quenching of fluorescence, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to elucidate binding geometries which support and extend proposed structural models for albumin. It is suggested that the first two fatty acids bind side-by-side in an antiparallel fashion in domain III of human serum albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1554610725,"Progesterone treatment of Xenopus oocytes in vitro causes progression through meiotic cell division. The role of altered intracellular levels of cAMP on the initiation of meiotic cell division has been studied. Basal levels of cAMP averaged 1.5 pmol in oocytes from eight females, and exposure to progesterone caused a rapid drop in cAMP to about 40 to 60% of basal. Half-maximal decreases occurred within 15 to 60 s, and cAMP returned to near basal values by 20 min after progesterone. Theophylline inhibition of progesterone-induced cell division was characterized by a small increase in basal levels of cAMP and a reduced drop in cAMP due to the hormone. Cholera toxin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, was found to be a potent inhibitor of progesterone-induced meiosis, with half-maximal inhibition at 8 times 10(-12) M. In addition, the purified A subunit of cholera toxin was an effective inhibitor of progesterone action when microinjected into oocytes, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at an approximate internal concentration of 1 X 10(-7) M. Cholera toxin alone increased cAMP levels by 20%, but upon addition of progesterone, the level increased transiently to 200% of basal, indicating that the inhibition was due to elevated levels of cAMP. The results support a model in which the initiation of meiotic cell division is regulated by cAMP and protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2089002965,"The coated pit-coated vesicle system has a key role in the uptake of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) and other receptor-bound proteins in human fibroblasts. To study the distribution of coated pits and coated vesicles in fibroblasts by immunochemical techniques at both the light and electron microscopic levels, we immunized rabbits with coat protein extracted from bovine brain-coated vesicles. The resulting anti-coat protein antibody was directed predominantly against clathrin, the 180,000 dalton protein that constitutes the major component of coat protein. By indirect immunoperoxidase electron microscopy, the anti-coat protein antibody was observed to bind specifically to coated pits on the surface of human fibroblasts and to coated vesicles within the cell. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining techniques at the light microscopic level revealed that the coat protein was distributed in fibroblasts in two distinctive patterns: as discrete foci on or near the cell surface that were linearly aligned in association with phase-dense cellular fibers (first pattern), and as intracellular foci that were randomly arranged around the cell nucleus (second pattern). The distribution of coat protein in fibroblasts was compared with the distribution of ferritin-labeled LDL, which was studied with the use of similar electron microscopic and immunofluorescence techniques. As previously reported, electron microscopic studies revealed that the LDL-ferritin binding sites at 4°C were clustered in coated pits. By immunofluorescence microscopy, the LDL-ferritin that was bound to receptors with coated pits was shown to be arranged linearly over the cell surface in a pattern that was similar to the linear arrangement of coat protein (first pattern). Considered together, the current data indicate that coated pits in human fibroblasts contain a protein analogous to clathrin, and that those coated pits which contain receptors for LDL are located over intracellular fibers most likely corresponding to stress fibers. These observations may have relevance to the mechanisms by which the coated pit-coated vesicle system efficiently delivers receptor-bound ligands to lysosomes"
https://openalex.org/W2793654547,"The mechanism whereby islet-activating protein (IAP) purified from the culture medium of Bordetella pertussis potentiates insulin secretion was studied by experiments in vitro with islets of rats once injected with IAP (0.5 micrograms/100 g body weight, 3 days before killing) or with islets that had been exposed to IAP (0.1 to 100 ng/ml) for 24 h. The IAP treatment markedly enhanced insulin secretory responses and cAMP accumulation in islets, facilitated the efflux of 45Ca through the cell membrane, and abolished the alpha-adrenergic action of epinephrine (and somatostatin) to inhibit glucose-induced insulin release, cAMP accumulation, and 45Ca uptake. These effects of the IAP treatment were reduced when islets were incubated in a low calcium medium. Based on these results, it was concluded that IAP interacts directly but slowly with the islet B cell in such a manner as to render more calcium available to the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism as a result of sustained activation of native calcium ionophores on the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2000632863,"Temperature-sensitive mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) belonging to complementation group III contain a lesion in the matrix (M) protein. This results in a 2–5 fold increase in transcription at the nonpermissive temperature. Co-infection of cells with one of these mutants and wild-type virus reverses this mutant phenotype. Separation of the transcriptional and translational products from mutant-infected cells reveals an overall increase in each of the viral mRNA species concomitant with degradation of the M protein at the nonpermissive temperature. The increase in mRNA, however, does not lead to increased synthesis of viral proteins. Quantitation of individual mRNA species indicates that M protein acts as a direct inhibitor of transcription as well as an attenuator of sequential transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1974016360,"Theophylline, salbutamol, isoproterenol, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibited E-rosette formation by human T lymphocytes and immunoglobulin M secretion from human plaque-forming B cells and augmented T-suppressor cell activity in three patients with agammaglobulinemia. Lithium chloride increased mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and inhibited suppressor cell activity. In the presence of lithium, the effects of all the drugs except dibutyryl cyclic AMP could be prevented. The data suggest a role for lithium in the modulation of cyclic AMP-dependent events in lymphocytes. Its potential role as an inhibitor of suppressor cell activity warrants further attention."
https://openalex.org/W1981831223,"Intact male rats exhibited more grooming in unfamiliar testing chambers than in their home cages. Hypophysectomized rats showed a much reduced increase in grooming in these testing chambers. Intraventricular injections of antiserum to adrenocorticotropic hormone to intact rats decreased the grooming usually observed in the novel situation, whereas a similar injection of control serum did not produce this effect. Peripheral injections of the antiserum did not affect grooming. Since intraventricularly injected adrenocorticotropic hormone induces excessive grooming, these results suggest that the increased grooming observed in the novel environment may be at least partly due to the release of this hormone directly into the cerebral ventricular system."
https://openalex.org/W1991521915,"We have compared the mechanisms of entry into host cells of three enveloped viruses: Sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus. Virus entry by membrane fusion should antigenically modify the surface of a newly infected cell in such a way that it will be killed by anti-viral antibody and complement. On the other hand, virus entry by a mechanism involving uptake by the cell of the whole virion should not make cells sensitive to antibody and complement. As expected, cells newly infected with Sendai virus were readily and completely lysed by anti-Sendai antibody and complement. In marked contrast, however, cells newly infected with either Sindbis virus or VSV were killed by anti-viral antibody and complement only when infected at an extremely high multiplicity of infection, in excess of 1000 plaque-forming units per cell. We favor the following explanation for these results with Sindbis virus and VSV: a very large majority of the Sindbis and VSV virions entered the infected cells by some means other than membrane fusion, presumably engulfment of the whole particle. Efficient entry by way of membrane fusion may therefore not be a general characteristic of enveloped viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1568462943,"EPR spectroscopic and chemical analyses of spinach nitrite reductase show that the enzyme contains one reducible iron-sulfur center, and one site for binding either cyanide or nitrite, per siroheme. The heme is nearly all in the high spin ferric state in the enzyme as isolated. The extinction coefficient of the enzyme has been revised to E386 = 7.6 X 10(4) cm-1 (M heme)-1. The iron-sulfur center is reduced with difficulty by agents such as reduced methyl viologen (equilibrated with 1 atm of H2 at pH 7.7 in the presence of hydrogenase) or dithionite. Complexation of the enzyme with CO (a known ligand for nitrite reductase heme) markedly increases the reducibility of the iron-sulfur center. New chemical analyses and reinterpretation of previous data show that the enzyme contains 6 mol of iron and 4 mol of acid-labile S2-/mol of siroheme. The EPR spectrum of reduced nitrite reductase in 80% dimethyl sulfoxide establishes clearly that the enzyme contains a tetranuclear iron-sulfur (Fe4S4) center. The ferriheme and Fe4S4 centers are reduced at similar rates (k = 3 to 4 s-1) by dithionite. The dithionite-reduced Fe4S4 center is rapidly (k = 100 s-1) reoxidized by nitrite. These results indicate a role for the Fe4S4 center in catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2058338657,"The membrane glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), synthesized in vitro in the presence of pancreatic microsomes, is glycosylated in two distinct steps while its polypeptide chain is nascent ( Rothman and Lodish, 1977 Rothman J.E. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1977; 269: 775-780 Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar ). We show here that unglycosylated glycoprotein, which accumulates in vivo following treatment of cells with tunicamycin and in vitro as a result of translation in the presence of detergent-treated microsomal membranes, is inserted normally as a transmembrane protein. This means that glycosylation, while normally occurring concurrently with insertion, is not required for insertion. Our experiments also show that the two steps in glycosylation correspond to the sequential transfer of preformed “core” oligosaccharides of typical structure to two Asn residues in the growing chain. The accumulation of unglycosylated glycoprotein in vitro is due to the fact that the completed transmembrane polypeptide cannot be glycosylated. The detergent treatment of microsomes impairs their rate of glycosylation so that chains are frequently completed before they can be glycosylated. This provides a simple explanation for certain types of heterogeneity often found in glycoproteins. We believe that the detergent treatment procedure results in the solubilization of the microsomal membrane followed by reconstitution. This is a prerequisite for the eventual purification of the membrane proteins and lipids involved in insertion and glycosylation of this model membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1574470608,"The cytoplasmically made subunit V of the yeast mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex is synthesized as a larger polypeptide in vitro. This was shown by programming a reticulocyte lysate with yeast RNA and immunoprecipitating the labeled translation products with a subunit V-specific antiserum. The larger form of subunit V could also be detected in pulse-labeled spheroplasts; upon a subsequent chase, most of it disappeared. A proteolytic fingerprint of the larger form was closely similar to that of the mature subunit. These data suggest that the cytoplasmically made subunit V is translated as a larger precursor which is cleaved to the mature subunit either during or after its entry into the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2166729093,"Isolated restriction endonuclease fragments of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome were introduced into hamster embryo cells to identify DNA sequences capable to transforming the cells with respect to acquisition of properties correlated with tumorigenicity. One of the fragments generated by cleavage of HSV-1 DNA with the restriction endonuclease Xba I was found to induce transformation at a frequency of about 10 colonies per quantity of fragment recovered from 1 microgram of uncut DNA; fractions containing the other Xba I fragments failed to induce transformation reproducibly, although occasional colonies were detected. The fragment with transforming activity (Xba I-F) is 15.5 X 10(6) daltons in molecular weight and is located between 0.30 and 0.45 map units on the HSV-1 genome. The Xba I-F transformants obtained were selected for their ability to replicate in low concentrations of serum; in addition, they were found to attain high saturation densities in the presence of 10% serum and to form colonies in semisolid medium. Moreover, the transformed cells produced at least one of the viral gene products (a membrane glycoprotein) encoded in the fragment used for transformation, indicating not only that viral DNA was incorporated into the cells, but also that viral genes were expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2026583600,"Kinase-negative mutants of S49 mouse lymphoma cells are pleiotropically negative for all known cAMP-mediated responses of S49 cells and yield cell extracts which are deficient in cAMP binding activity and devoid of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. In hybrids between kinase-negative and wild-type cells, the mutant phenotype is dominant: the tetraploid hybrids have reduced cAMP-binding activity and undetectable cAMP-dependent kinase activity. The mutant phenotype is attributable to neither a soluble inhibitor of kinase catalytic subunit, nor a defective kinase regulatory subunit acting as an inhibitor, nor a defective catalytic subunit which sequesters regulatory subunits in inactive complexes. We propose that these mutants carry trans-dominant lesions in a regulatory locus responsible for setting intracellular levels of kinase expression."
https://openalex.org/W2007660010,The 5' terminal protein (VPg) on poliovirion RNA can be removed by cell-free extracts from a variety of uninfected cells. This soluble enzymatic activity is found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of heLa cells and is activated by Mg++. The enzyme activity cleaves the tyrosine-phosphate bond that links the protein to the RNA. In a partially purified form it has insufficient nonspecific protease or nuclease activity to account for its action. The existence of this enzyme implies that poliovirus RNA is translated in cell-free extracts in a form that lacks the 5' terminal protein. The role of this enzyme in the uninfected cell is not known.
https://openalex.org/W1964816336,"DNA isolated from defective and nondefective virions of herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) (strain Patton) was digested with restriction endonucleases, and the resulting DNA fragments were inserted in the EK2 coliphage vector lambdagtWES . lambdaB. The recombinant DNA was encapsidated in vitro under P4 maximum containment conditions. These lambda-HSV1 hybrids were purified and amplified, and the DNA was isolated in the P4 facility. DNA, free of viable phage and bacteria, was removed from P4 conditions and analyzed. Represented among the hybrids studied to date are DNA fragments from about 50 percent of the normal HSV-1 genome. The hybrids derived from defective HSV-1 DNA fragments demonstrate the existence of many similar but not identical classes of defective genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2076814881,"Detergent extracts of polyoma virus-infected mouse cells contain three major proteins of approximately 100,000--108,000 (100K), 55,000 (55K) and 21,500 (22K) daltons, which react with sera obtained from rats carrying tumors induced by the virus. A comparison of the 35S-methionine-, 3H-leucine- and 3H-proline-labeled tryptic peptides of each of these proteins by cation-exchange chromatography followed by descending paper chromatography has shown that: at least five peptides are shared by all three T-reactive proteins; at least three peptides are shared by the 55K and 22K proteins, but not by the 100K protein; at least three peptides are found only in the 22K protein; at least six peptides are found only in the 55K protein; and at least sixteen peptides are found only in the 100K protein. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the polypeptide chains of the 100K, 55K and 22K dalton tumor antigens of polyoma virus share a common virus-coded amino terminal region. The data also suggest that there is a portion of the polypeptide chains (probably immediately adjacent to the common amino terminal region of the molecules) that is shared by the 55K and 22K proteins, but not by the 100K protein (perhaps because this portion of the genetic information is spliced out of the messenger RNA coding for the 100K protein). The facts that all the peptides common to the 100K and 55K proteins are also found in the 22K protein and are thus assigned to the common amino terminal region of the molecules, and that there are several peptides unique to the 100K protein, as well as several peptides unique to the 55K protein, suggest that the presumed carboxy terminal portion of the polypeptide chain of the 100K protein is considerably, if not entirely, different from that of the 55K protein."
https://openalex.org/W1596380237,"As a model cell culture system for studying polyoma-mediated control of host gene expression, we isolated methotrexate-resistant 3T6 cells in which one of the virus-induced enzymes, dihydrofolate reductase, is a major cellular protein. In highly methotrexate-resistant cell lines dihydrofolate reductase synthesis accounts for over 10% that of soluble portein, corresponding to an increase of approximately 100-fold over the level in parental cells. This increase in dihydrofolate reductase synthesis is due to a corresponding increase in the abundance of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA and gene sequences. We have used these cells to show that infection with polyoma virus results in a 4- to 5-fold increase in the relative rate of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis and a corresponding increase in dihydrofolate reductase mRNA abundance. The increase in dihydrofolate reductase synthesis begins 15 to 20 h after infection and continues to increase until cell lysis. These observations represent the first direct evidence that viral infection of eukaryotic cells results in the increased synthesis of a specific cellular enzyme and an increase in the abundance of a specific cellular mRNA. In order to gain additional insight into the control of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis we examined other parameters affecting dihydrofolate reductase synthesis. We found that the addition of fresh serum to stationary phase cells results in a 2-fold stimulation of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis, beginning 10 to 12 h after serum addition. Serum stimulation of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis is completely inhibited by the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP as well as by theophylline or prostaglandin E1, compounds which cause an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels. In fact, the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline results in a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the rate of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis and the abundance of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA. However, in contrast to the effect on serum stimulation, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline do not inhibit polyoma virus induction of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis or dihydrofolate reductase mRNA levels. These observations suggest that dihydrofolate reductase gene expression is controlled by at least two regulatory pathways: one involving serum that is blocked by high levels of cyclic AMP and another involving polyoma induction that is not inhibited by cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1972825626,"Cholera toxin inhibition of progesterone-induced meiosis of Xenopus laevis oocytes in vitro has been correlated with increased cAMP levels. Inhibition of germinal vesicle breakdown (Gvbd) and cAMP increase occurred after a lag period of 2 hr, when cholera toxin was injected, or 4--5 hr, when applied externally. The ability of the maturation-promoting factor (Mpf) to provoke Gvbd when injected into recipient oocytes was found to be dependent upon whether the oocytes had been exposed to cholera toxin alone or to toxin and progesterone. With the former, cAMP levels were elevated and Mpf activity was abolished, whereas with the latter, the increase in cAMP was less pronounced and Mpf activity was observed. Injection of cAMP or its 8-thio derivatives shortly before the appearance of progesterone-induced Mpf abolished Gvbd. If injected earlier or later, no inhibition was observed. In contrast, cholera toxin inhibited maturation even when added several hours before progesterone, suggesting a sustained accumulation of cAMP. No Gvbd occurred when 8-thio-methyl-cAMP was injected together with Mpf. These data suggest that cAMP is involved in the control of the formation/amplification and/or activity of Mpf-a result which may be of general significance in cell division mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1986642717,"To explore the generality of the effects of sarcoma viruses, tumor-promoting phorbol esters and retinoic acid, we have studied plasminogen activator production in differentiating chick myogenic cultures. Although slightly higher than in chick fibroblast cultures, the level of spontaneously synthesized enzyme is low; it reaches a peak shortly after maximum cell fusion has been completed and then declines. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) transformation of differentiating myotubes was accomplished by infecting myoblasts with a temperature-sensitive mutant, maintaining cultures at the nonpermissive temperature until completion of fusion and shifting to permissive temperatures at selected times thereafter. RSV transformation, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and retinoic acid all induced high levels of plasminogen activator production by differentiating myotubes in the absence of DNA synthesis. In comparison with fibroblasts, virus-induced enzyme synthesis by myogenic cultures proceeded more slowly but ultimately reached comparably high levels. Whereas cAMP strongly repressed RSV- and PMA-induced plasminogen activator production by chick fibroblasts, it weakly stimulated enzyme synthesis by myotubes. This suggests that enzyme induction by RSV and PMA is not mediated primarily through effects on cAMP metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1569966409,"Cholesterol synthesis in actively growing bovine vascular endothelial cells is regulated by low density lipoprotein (LDL) at a step prior to mevalonate formation, in a manner comparable to that found in aortic smooth muscle cells. LDL uptake by these cells is associated with induction of cholesterol esterification, an increase in total cell cholesterol, and an inhibition of endogenous sterol synthesis. In contrast, cholesterol metabolism in confluent contact-inhibited endothelial cultures was not significantly affected by LDL even though the cells bind the lipoprotein at high affinity receptor sites. Lysosomal degradation and subsequent regulatory effects on cellular cholesterol metabolism, however, were observed in contact-inhibited endothelial cells incubated with cationized rather than native LDL. Cationized LDL enter the cells independently of the high affinity sites. Therefore, the primary regulation of cholesterol metabolism in these cells is neither through the appropriate intracellular enzymes nor through the high affinity surface receptors, but via an inhibition of LDL internalization. It is suggested that this inhibition is due to a strict contact-inhibited morphology which enables the endothelium of the larger arteries to function as a selective barrier to the high circulating levels of plasma LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1581359924,"A fragment of glucagon encompassing its first six NH2-terminal residues (His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe) binds to the glucagon receptor and stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in rat liver plasma membranes. Glucagon1-6 is a partial agonist since it stimulates, at saturating concentrations, to the extent of 75% of the maximal activity given by the native hormone. The binding affinity and potency of glucagon1-6 are 0.001% the native hormone. Discussed are the implications of these findings on the structure-function relationships required for the action of glucagon and for preparing clinically useful analogs of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2099365238,"We have analyzed the arrangement of SV40 DNA sequences integrated in human chromosome 7 in two lines of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids: one containing only one human chromosome 7 per cell and the other containing an average of about three. We found that the integration site differs in both the viral and host sequences in the two clones. However, the sites of integration into the several copies of human chromosome 7 of one clone are identical. Each chromosome 7 in both clones carries approximately six viral genomes tandemly linked. Some of these genomes lack about 20% of the DNA from the late region, including the Eco RI site."
https://openalex.org/W1562204756,"Effects of glucagon and guanyl nucleotides on the rat liver plasma membrane adenylyl cyclase were studied. It was established that: 1) glucagon stimulates the fully guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P)-activated enzyme between 20 and 70%, provided a guanyl nucleotide is present in the assay; 2) glucagon has no effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes activated fully by GMP-P(NH)P and then washed free of nucleotides. It is concluded that occupancy of the guanyl nucleotide binding site that activates the catalytic moiety of the system is not sufficient to promote hormone-receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase and that occupancy of a second site by guanyl nucleotides is essential to effect stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by the glucagon-receptor complex. The data presented raise the question whether the guanyl nucleotide site that promotes coupling is distinct from the guanyl nucleotide site that modulates binding of glucagon to receptor and whether the occupancy of the guanyl nucleotide site associated with the catalytic moiety is necessary for coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2037782174,"We have investigated some aspects of the metabolism of the integral membrane protein acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in normal and transformed cultures of chick embryo muscle cells. Turnover of AChR in control muscle cell cultures was compared with turnover in cultures infected and transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and with cultures treated with the tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The parameters of AChR metabolism were estimated using 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin as a stoichiometric high affinity ligand for the AChR. We found that both RSV transformation and PMA increased the rate of degradation and decreased the rate of synthesis of AChR. The consequent reduction in steady state receptor levels suggests that oncogenic transformation and tumor promoter significantly alter the metabolism of cell surface membranes. We also observed that parameters of AChR metabolism in control cultures changed systematically in a pattern which depended upon the age of the culture as well as the use of embryo extract or fetal bovine serum as medium supplements. The muscle cell system allows quantitative measurement of an integral membrane protein and its metabolism, and may serve as a more general model for alterations in membrane and surface receptor metabolism associated with the transformed state."

https://openalex.org/W1543350658,"In an attempt to elucidate the role of the 5'-terminal 7-methylguanosine residue in translation of mammalian mRNAs, vesicular stomatitis virus (VS virus), and reovirus mRNAs containing and lacking this residue, and also Qbeta RNA, were translated in cell-free extracts from reticulocytes and wheat germ under a variety of ionic conditions. Optimal translation of mRNAs lacking a 5' m7G occurred at concentrations of KOAc or KCl which were lower than those optimal for normal mRNAs. However, this salt dependence was much less marked in the mammalian reticulocyte extract and, at salt concentrations optimal for translation of normal capped mRNAs, reticulocyte lysates translated uncapped with mRNAs at 30 to 60% the normal efficiency. At low K+ concentrations, wheat germ ribosomes bound and translated appreciable amounts of uncapped VS virus mRNA; controls showed that no m7G residue is added to the 5' end of the bound RNA. Analogues of the 5' end, such as m7GpppAm, inhibited translation of both normal and uncapped VS virus RNAs in wheat germ extracts to about the same extent, but the efficiency of its action was reduced at low K+ concentrations. We conclude that there is a reduced importance of the 5' m7G residue in ribosome-mRNA recognition at low K+ concentrations, and that translation of mRNAs in reticulocyte extract is, under any reaction conditions, less dependent on the presence of a 5' cap than in wheat germ extracts."

https://openalex.org/W1560686539,"Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), Sf60 to 400, from normolipemic individuals do not suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity in cultured normal human fibroblasts at concentrations 20-fold higher than those of low density lipoproteins (LDL) that give total suppression. To determine if these VLDL contain all of the structural elements necessary for receptor-mediated suppression, they were converted in vitro with bovine milk lipoprotein lipase to low density lipoproteins. These LDL-like lipoproteins were as effective in suppression as LDL isolated directly from plasma, with half-maximal and complete suppression at 1 and 4 microgram of cholesterol ml-1. Neither native LDL nor LDL produced in vitro suppressed receptor-negative fibroblasts. We conclude that action of lipoprotein lipase on VLDL leads to a rearrangement of lipoprotein components that permits interaction of LDL produced in vitro with the LDL-specific cell surface receptor of fibroblasts and subsequent suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase."

https://openalex.org/W1985660367,"Abstract To demonstrate directly that the carboxy terminal portion of simian virus 40 (SV40) small t is encoded by a sequence of nucleotides from the region between 0.59-0.54 map units on SV40 DNA, we characterized the putative shortened forms or fragments of small t produced by mutants of SV40 (dl 884, dl 885, dl 890) with deletions in this region of the genome. Attempts to isolate the putative fragments of small t from mutant-infected cells, or from cell-free systems primed with mRNA from mutant-infected cells, resulted in only low yields of the fragments. Experiments using purified SV40 mRNA in low background cell-free systems, in which large T and small t could be detected without immunoprecipitation, suggested that these low yields were accounted for by reduced amounts of mRNA coding for the shortened forms of small t present in the mutant-infected cells. Larger amounts of putative fragments of small t were produced by translation of deletion mutant cRNA (complementary RNA synthesized in vitro using purified deletion mutant DNA and E. coli RNA polymerase). Fingerprint analysis of the proteins produced showed that they contain most, if not all, of the methionine peptides common to small t and large T. Furthermore, the fragments of small t produced in response to dl 884 and dl 890 lack two methionine peptides that are present in small t but not in large T. These data provide direct evidence that the region between 0.59-0.54 map units on SV40 DNA codes for polypeptide sequences that are unique to small t, and establishes that the nucleotide sequences from the region between 0.59-0.54 map units are both a coding sequence (for small t) and an intervening sequence (for large T)."

https://openalex.org/W1556445075,"Inhibition studies with the photoreactive AMP analog, 8-azidoadenosine 5'-monophosphate (8-azido-AMP), demonstrate that this compound is, like AMP, an allosteric inhibitor of pig kidney and muscle fructose-1,6-biphosphateses. Photolysis of a mixture of purified pig kidney fructose-1,6-biphosphate and 8-azido-[14C]AMP results in the loss of enzyme activity and the reagent is incorporated to the protein. The incorporation of reagent linearly correlates with the loss of enzyme activity. Extrapolation to zero activity correlates with the incorporation of 3.7 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme (i.e. 0.9 per subunit). Thus, 8-azido-AMP appears to be a photoaffinity label for the allosteric AMP binding site of fructose-1,6-biphosphatase."

First, the ESR spectra of platelets labeled with either reagent revealed two classes of sulfhydryl groups, a mobile class and an immobile class. Second, when spin-labeled platelets were titrated with high concentrations of potassium ferricyanide (greater than 10(-3) M), there was a decrease in the peak heights of the mobile class of sulfhydryl groups due to dipole-dipole exchange. Third, plots of peak heights of the mobile class versus ferricyanide concentration revealed three classes of mobile sulfhydryl groups compared to a single immobile class. This technique may be used to show the relative locations of spin-labeled groups on cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1511078626,"Short term incubation of WI-38 cultures with 5.7 micron prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) caused cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity in fibroblast homogenates to fall by 25 to 35% as compared to controls. The PGE1-induced decline in phosphodiesterase activity coincided with a rapid increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels in response to the hormone and was rapidly reversed by washing the cultures free of the prostaglandin before homogenizing the cells. The effect of PGE1 on WI-38 phosphodiesterase activity was localized to the enzyme form(s) present in 27,000 times g supernatant fractions of cell homogenates. These data suggest that the pattern of cyclic AMP accumulation in WI-38 fibroblasts exposed to PGE1 may be related, at least in part, to decreased phosphodiesterase activity during hormone stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1599638169,Inhibition of rat skeletal muscle adenylate deaminase by reported previously is due to inorganic pyrophosphate present as a contaminant in commercial preparations of phosphate. This conclusion is based on the following evidence: a compound that inhibits adenylate deaminase can be separated from commercially prepared by ion exchange chromatography; the inhibition by creatine phosphate and by the separated inhibitory compound is relieved by treatment with inorganic pyrophosphatase; inhibition by inorganic pyrophosphate is similar to that produced by unpurified phosphate; and pyrophosphate is present in commercially available in amounts sufficient to account for the inhibition. Some commercial preparations of contain much less pyrophosphate than others; these preparations are only weakly inhibitory. Inorganic triphosphate is a more powerful inhibitor of the enzyme than pyrophosphate; it may also be present as a contaminant in phosphate.
https://openalex.org/W1503840202,"Acetate kinase (ATP:phosphotransferase E.C.2.7.2.1) has been purified to a high state of purity from Veillonella alcalescens. The native enzyme had a molecular weight of 88,000, as determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration. The molecular weight of the monomeric enzyme, estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was 42,000. The enzyme was determined to be a homodimer from the amino acid composition and the results of trypsin digestion and cyanogen bromide cleavage. Two moles of phosphate were incorporated into the dimer upon incubation of the enzyme with ATP and acetate. These results support the conclusion that each subunit of the dimeric enzyme consists of a single active catalytic center. Succinate enhanced the rate of ATP-ADP phosphoryl group exchange 20-fold and the binding of ATP 10-fold. These results are considered in light of data from previous reports (Pelroy, R. A., and Whiteley, H. R. (1971) J. Bacteriol. 105, 259-267; Bowman, C. M., Valdez, R. O., and Nishimura, J. S. (1976) J. Biol. Chem 251, 3117-3121)."
