https://openalex.org/W3089628938,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is straining public health systems worldwide, and major non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to slow its spread1‚Äì4. During the initial phase of the outbreak, dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was primarily determined by human mobility from Wuhan, China5,6. Yet empirical evidence on the effect of key geographic factors on local epidemic transmission is lacking7. In this study, we analyzed highly resolved spatial variables in cities, together with case count data, to investigate the role of climate, urbanization and variation in interventions. We show that the degree to which cases of COVID-19 are compressed into a short period of time (peakedness of the epidemic) is strongly shaped by population aggregation and heterogeneity, such that epidemics in crowded cities are more spread over time, and crowded cities have larger total attack rates than less populated cities. Observed differences in the peakedness of epidemics are consistent with a meta-population model of COVID-19 that explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies. We paired our estimates with globally comprehensive data on human mobility and predict that crowded cities worldwide could experience more prolonged epidemics. Analysis of spatial heterogeneity of crowding in China and Italy, together with COVID-19 case data, show that cities with higher crowding have longer epidemics and higher attack rates after the first epidemic wave."

https://openalex.org/W3092412936,"Background Understanding public perceptions of government responses to COVID-19 may foster improved public cooperation. Trust in government and population risk of exposure may influence public perception of the response. Other population-level characteristics, such as country socio-economic development, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and degree of democratic government, may influence perception. Methods and findings We developed a novel ten-item instrument that asks respondents to rate key aspects of their government’s response to the pandemic (COVID-SCORE). We examined whether the results varied by gender, age group, education level, and monthly income. We also examined the internal and external validity of the index using appropriate predefined variables. To test for dimensionality of the results, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) for the ten survey items. We found that Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92 and that the first component of the PCA explained 60% of variance with the remaining factors having eigenvalues below 1, strongly indicating that the tool is both reliable and unidimensional. Based on responses from 13,426 people randomly selected from the general population in 19 countries, the mean national scores ranged from 35.76 (Ecuador) to 80.48 (China) out of a maximum of 100 points. Heterogeneity in responses was observed across age, gender, education and income with the greatest amount of heterogeneity observed between countries. National scores correlated with respondents’ reported levels of trust in government and with country-level COVID-19 mortality rates. Conclusions The COVID-SCORE survey instrument demonstrated satisfactory validity. It may help governments more effectively engage constituents in current and future efforts to control COVID-19. Additional country-specific assessment should be undertaken to measure trends over time and the public perceptions of key aspects of government responses in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W3092077375,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic represents a global challenge. SARS-CoV-2's ability to replicate in host cells relies on the action of its non-structural proteins, like its main protease (Mpro). This cysteine protease acts by processing the viruses' precursor polyproteins. As proteases, together with polymerases, are main targets of antiviral drug design, we here have performed biochemical high throughput screening (HTS) with recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. A fluorescent assay was used to identify inhibitors in a compound library containing known drugs, bioactive molecules and natural products. These screens led to the identification of 13 inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 μM to 23 μM. The screens confirmed several known SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, such as the organo-mercuric compounds thimerosal and phenylmercuric acetate. Benzophenone derivatives could also be identified among the most potent screening hits. Additionally, Evans blue, a sulfonic acid-containing dye, could be identified as an Mpro inhibitor. The obtained compounds could be of interest as lead compounds for the development of future SARS-CoV-2 drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3092121807,"The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a deluge of publications. For this cross-sectional study we compared the amount and reporting characteristics of COVID-19-related academic articles and preprints and the number of ongoing clinical trials and systematic reviews. To do this, we searched the PubMed database of citations and abstracts for published life science journals by using appropriate combinations of medical subject headings (MeSH terms), and the COVID-19 section of the MedRxiv and BioRxiv archives up to 20 May 2020 (21 weeks). In addition, we searched Clinicaltrial.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, EU Clinical Trials Register, and 15 other trial registers, as well as PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews. The characteristics of each publication were extracted. Regression analyses and Z tests were used to detect publication trends and their relative proportions. A total of 3635 academic publications and 3805 preprints were retrieved. Only 8.6% (n = 329) of the preprints were already published in indexed journals. The number of academic and preprint publications increased significantly over time (p<0.001). Case reports (6% academic vs 0.9% preprints; p<0.001) and letters (17.4% academic vs 0.5% preprints; p<0.001) accounted for a greater share of academic compared to preprint publications. Differently, randomized controlled trials (0.22% vs 0.63%; p<0.001) and systematic reviews (0.08% vs 5%) made up a greater share of the preprints. The relative proportion of clinical studies registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, and EU Clinical Trials Register was 57.9%, 49.5%, and 98.9%, respectively, most of which were still “recruiting”. PROSPERO listed 962 systematic review protocols. Preprints were slightly more prevalent than academic articles but both were increasing in number. The void left by the lack of primary studies was filled by an outpour of immediate opinions (i.e., letters to the editor) published in PubMed-indexed journals. Summarizing, preprints have gained traction as a publishing response to the demand for prompt access to empirical, albeit not peer-reviewed, findings during the present pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3090072122,"The epigenome and three-dimensional (3D) genomic architecture are emerging as key factors in the dynamic regulation of different transcriptional programs required for neuronal functions. In this study, we used an activity-dependent tagging system in mice to determine the epigenetic state, 3D genome architecture and transcriptional landscape of engram cells over the lifespan of memory formation and recall. Our findings reveal that memory encoding leads to an epigenetic priming event, marked by increased accessibility of enhancers without the corresponding transcriptional changes. Memory consolidation subsequently results in spatial reorganization of large chromatin segments and promoter-enhancer interactions. Finally, with reactivation, engram neurons use a subset of de novo long-range interactions, where primed enhancers are brought in contact with their respective promoters to upregulate genes involved in local protein translation in synaptic compartments. Collectively, our work elucidates the comprehensive transcriptional and epigenomic landscape across the lifespan of memory formation and recall in the hippocampal engram ensemble."
https://openalex.org/W3090217273,"Recent work has suggested that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in context-dependent perceptual decision-making. In this study, we addressed that role using a new method for identifying task-relevant dimensions of neural population activity. Specifically, we show that the PFC has a multidimensional code for context, decisions and both relevant and irrelevant sensory information. Moreover, these representations evolve in time, with an early linear accumulation phase followed by a phase with rotational dynamics. We identify the dimensions of neural activity associated with these phases and show that they do not arise from distinct populations but from a single population with broad tuning characteristics. Finally, we use model-based decoding to show that the transition from linear to rotational dynamics coincides with a plateau in decoding accuracy, revealing that rotational dynamics in the PFC preserve sensory choice information for the duration of the stimulus integration period. Aoi et al. used a new dimensionality-reduction method to disentangle the contributions of different task variables to neural population activity, which revealed rotational dynamics in monkey PFC during context-dependent decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3091076281,"Somatic mutations in driver genes may ultimately lead to the development of cancer. Understanding how somatic mutations accumulate in cancer genomes and the underlying factors that generate somatic mutations is therefore crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies. To understand the interplay between spatial genome organization and specific mutational processes, we studied 3,000 tumor–normal-pair whole-genome datasets from 42 different human cancer types. Our analyses reveal that the change in somatic mutational load in cancer genomes is co-localized with topologically-associating-domain boundaries. Domain boundaries constitute a better proxy to track mutational load change than replication timing measurements. We show that different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions where certain processes generate mutations in active domains, and others generate mutations in inactive domains. Overall, the interplay between three-dimensional genome organization and active mutational processes has a substantial influence on the large-scale mutation-rate variations observed in human cancers. Somatic mutational loads in cancer genomes change with chromatin domain boundaries. Different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions in active versus inactive domains, including during tumor evolution."

https://openalex.org/W3092396254,"The R2R3-MYB genes comprise one of the largest transcription factor gene families in plants, playing regulatory roles in plant-specific developmental processes, defense responses and metabolite accumulation. To date MYB family genes have not yet been comprehensively identified in the major staple fruit crop banana. In this study, we present a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of the MYB genes from Musa acuminata DH-Pahang (A genome). A total of 285 R2R3-MYB genes as well as genes encoding three other classes of MYB proteins containing multiple MYB repeats were identified and characterised with respect to structure and chromosomal organisation. Organ- and development-specific expression patterns were determined from RNA-Seq data. For 280 M. acuminata MYB genes for which expression was found in at least one of the analysed samples, a variety of expression patterns were detected. The M. acuminata R2R3-MYB genes were functionally categorised, leading to the identification of seven clades containing only M. acuminata R2R3-MYBs. The encoded proteins may have specialised functions that were acquired or expanded in Musa during genome evolution. This functional classification and expression analysis of the MYB gene family in banana establishes a solid foundation for future comprehensive functional analysis of MaMYBs and can be utilized in banana improvement programmes."
https://openalex.org/W3091891415,"In the medical system, the verification, preservation and synchronization of electronic medical records has always been a difficult problem, and the random dissemination of patient records will bring various risks to patient privacy. Therefore, how to achieve secure data sharing on the basis of ensuring users' personal privacy becomes the key. In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve data sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. So, a distributed electronic medical records searchable scheme was proposed by leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. Firstly, we perform a hash calculation on the electronic medical data and store the corresponding value on the blockchain to ensure its integrity and authenticity. Then, we encrypt the electronic medical data and store it in the interplanetary file system which is a distributed storage protocol. These operations not only can solve centralized data store of servers of several medical institutions, but also be good at lowering stress from data store and high-frequency access to blockchain. Secondly, the encrypted keyword index information of electronic medical records was stored on the Ethereum blockchain, meanwhile a smart contract deployed in the Ethereum blockchain is used to realize keyword search instead of depending on a centralized third party. Furthermore, we use attribute-based encryption scheme to ensure that only the attributes meeting the access policy can decrypt the encrypted electronic medical records. Finally, our performance analysis and security analysis show that the scheme is secure and efficient."
https://openalex.org/W3091963498,"COVID-19 has highlighted an opportunity for medical professionals to engage in online Public Engagement with Science (PES). Currently a popular platform for PES is Reddit. Reddit provides an Ask Me Anything (AMA) format for subject matter experts to answer questions asked by the public. On March 11, 2020, from 2:00 to 4:00pm EST, two Emergency Department physicians from Massachusetts General Hospital hosted an AMA session on coronavirus. We retroactively conducted an analysis of the questions and answers from this AMA session in order to better understand the public’s concerns around coronavirus and identify future opportunities for medical experts to leverage the Reddit AMA format in communicating with the general public. Results suggested that participants sought not only to obtain information, but to engage in discussion, and did so with each other in the absence of expert responses. The majority of bi-directional discussion occurred between participants. Due to the volume of questions and ratio of experts to participants, not all questions were answered. More posts provided facts or opinions, than posts that providing resources or requesting resources."
https://openalex.org/W3092243669,"The global COVID-19 pandemic is causing unprecedented job loss and financial strain. It is unclear how those most directly experiencing economic impacts may seek assistance from disparate safety net programs. To identify self-reported economic hardship and enrollment in major safety net programs before and early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we compared individuals with COVID-19 related employment or earnings reduction with other individuals. We created a set of questions related to COVID-19 economic impact that was added to a cross-sectional, nationally representative online survey of American adults (age ≥18, English-speaking) in the AmeriSpeak panel fielded from April 23–27, 2020. All analyses were weighted to account for survey non-response and known oversampling probabilities. We calculated unadjusted bivariate differences, comparing people with and without COVID-19 employment and earnings reductions with other individuals. Our study looked primarily at awareness and enrollment in seven major safety net programs before and since the pandemic (Medicaid, health insurance marketplaces/exchanges, unemployment insurance, food pantries/free meals, housing/renters assistance, SNAP, and TANF). Overall, 28.1% of all individuals experienced an employment reduction (job loss or reduced earnings). Prior to the pandemic, 39.0% of the sample was enrolled in ≥1 safety net program, and 50.0% of individuals who subsequently experienced COVID-19 employment reduction were enrolled in at least one safety net program. Those who experienced COVID-19 employment reduction versus those who did not were significantly more likely to have applied or enrolled in ≥1 program (45.9% versus 11.7%, p<0.001) and also significantly more likely to specifically have enrolled in unemployment insurance (29.4% versus 5.4%, p < .001) and SNAP (16.8% versus 2.8%, p = 0.028). The economic devastation from COVID-19 increases the importance of a robust safety net."
https://openalex.org/W3091695455,"The angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie pathway is essential for the proper maturation and remodeling of the vasculature. Despite its importance in disease, the mechanisms that control signal transduction through this pathway are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HS GAGs) regulate Ang-Tie signaling through direct interactions with both Ang ligands and Tie1 receptors. HS GAGs formed ternary complexes with Ang1 or Ang4 and Tie2 receptors, resulting in potentiation of endothelial survival signaling. In addition, HS GAGs served as ligands for the orphan receptor Tie1. The HS-Tie1 interaction promoted Tie1-Tie2 heterodimerization and enhanced Tie1 stability within the mature vasculature. Loss of HS-Tie1 binding using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in vivo led to decreased Tie protein levels, pathway suppression and aberrant retinal vascularization. Together, these results reveal that sulfated glycans use dual mechanisms to regulate Ang-Tie signaling and are important for the development and maintenance of the vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W3092611331,"Beneficial microbes are all around us and it remains to be seen, whether all diseases and disorders can be prevented or treated with beneficial microbes. In this study, the presence of various beneficial bacteria were identified from the sediments of Indian major Rivers Ganga and Yamuna from nine different sites using a metagenomic approach. The metagenome sequence analysis using the Kaiju Web server revealed the presence of 69 beneficial bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis among these bacterial species revealed that they were highly diverse. Relative abundance analysis of these bacterial species is highly correlated with different pollution levels among the sampling sites. The PCA analysis revealed that Lactobacillus spp. group of beneficial bacteria are more associated with sediment sampling sites, KAN-2 and ND-3; whereas Bacillus spp. are more associated with sites, FAR-2 and ND-2. This is the first report revealing the richness of beneficial bacteria in the Indian rivers, Ganga and Yamuna. The study might be useful in isolating different important beneficial microorganisms from these river sediments, for possible industrial applications."

This study also shows prevention of these phenotypes using a human-derived recombinant antibody against the poly-GA dipeptide RAN proteins. These data provide strong support that the phenotypes found in these animals are relevant to the disease and are driven by RAN protein pathology. A second study performed at UF also showed that C9-BAC mice had significantly decreased survival compared with NT littermates (Pattamatta et al., 2020Pattamatta A. Nguyen L. Olafson H. Scotti M.

Although these two studies were done at UF, two additional studies using this mouse model, performed independently at different institutions, had similar findings. In this Matters Arising response, we include new data from a third and fourth study. The third study, performed by the Saxena lab at the University of Bern (UBern), shows reduced survival, behavioral deficits, neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and molecular features of disease in C9-BAC mice. Additionally, the fourth study, conducted by the Gelbard lab at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), shows decreased survival of C9-BAC mice versus NT controls as well as neurodegenerative changes. We also describe severe seizure phenotypes affecting C9 and NT animals in an additional recent cohort of mice that in which C9-BAC mice were bred with JAX FVB/NJ mice.

https://openalex.org/W3091890341,"Introduction Anemia is a common problem in children particularly in developing countries and taking steps to tackle it is one of the major public health challenges for Nepal. The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence of individual, household and community level determinants of childhood anemia in Nepal. Methods Data was taken from a nationally representative sample of 1,942 Nepalese children aged from 6–59 months. The Chi-square test was used to determine the bivariate relationship between the selected variables and childhood anemia and a multilevel logistic regression model with a random intercept at household and community level was used to identify important determinants of this kind of anemia. Results The results showed that 52.6% (95% CI: 49.8%-55.4%) of the children were anemic while 26.6% (95% CI: 24.0%-29.3%) of them were moderate to severe. The prevalence of overall anemia was higher among children aged less than 11 months as well as in underweight children, children of underweight, anemic and uneducated mothers and those in the terrain ecological regions. Multivariable analysis showed that children aged less than 11 months, who were underweight and had anemic mothers were more likely to have moderate or severe anemia. Children in the hilly ecological region were less likely to have it compared to mountain and terrain ecological regions. Children in middle-class families and children of mothers who completed secondary education were more likely to have anemia. Conclusion Nepal is facing a serious public health problem due to the high prevalence of childhood anemia. This adverse situation occurs due to socio-demographic and geographical factors such as age, malnutrition status, mother’s anemia status, socio-economic status and regional variations. Prevention of childhood anemia should be given top priority in Nepal and should be considered as a major public health intervention."

In this study, the single crystal X-ray structure of methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate was determined at 120 K. The crystal structure comprises three methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate molecules condensed to a 3D framework via extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed to determine the intermolecular interactions and the crystal packing. In addition, computational calculations of methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate were obtained using the Gaussian 09W program, and by quantum mechanical methods, Hartree Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the 6–311G(d,p) basis set. The experimental FT-IR spectrum strongly correlated with the computed vibrational spectra (R2 = 0.995). The energies of the frontier orbitals, HOMO and LUMO, were used to calculate the chemical quantum parameters. The lower band gap value (ΔE) indicates the molecular determinants underlying the known pharmaceutical activity of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W3092325931,"The recent literature shows that the type of gambling practiced influences problem gambling. This study was aimed at investigating the factors associated with gambling type, including gambling severity, gambling motives, and cognitive distortions. A total of 291 regular male gamblers (229 skill gamblers and 62 mixed gamblers, i.e., those who play at least one game of chance and one skill game) were recruited online and assessed for gambling severity (South Oaks Gambling Screen), gambling motives (Gambling Motives Questionnaire-Financial), cognitive distortions (Gambling-Related Cognition Scale), and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). After controlling for the number of games played and psychological distress, we found that gambling type was significantly associated with gambling severity. Moreover, controlling for psychological distress showed that gambling type was also significantly associated with coping motives and interpretative bias. First, mixed gamblers had higher severity scores and higher coping motivation than skill gamblers; second, skill gamblers seemed more at risk of developing interpretative bias. Thus, the gamblers presented different psychological, motivational, and cognitive profiles according to gambling type, indicating that different clinical interventions may be relevant. Working on coping motives and anxiety and depression symptoms with an abstinence purpose would be more suitable for mixed gamblers. Indeed, working on these points could lead to the gambler reducing or eventually ceasing gambling, as the need to regulate negative emotions through gambling behavior would fade in parallel. Gambling type, psychological distress, gambling motives, and cognitive distortions should be taken into consideration systematically in clinical interventions of patients with plural and mixed practice of games."
https://openalex.org/W3091976691,"Background Multiple sexual partnerships increase the risk of transmission of HIV and can be exacerbated by substance abuse. However, the association between psychoactive substance use and multiple sexual partnerships among young people in informal settlements of low-income countries is not well known. This study established the prevalence of multiple sexual partnerships and associated factors among young psychoactive-substance-users in informal settlements in Kampala, Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving 744 young (aged 18–24 years), sexually active, psychoactive substance-users selected from 12 of the 57 informal settlements of Kampala City. The prevalence of multiple sexual partnerships and their differential distribution by socio-demographic strata was established. Modified Poisson regression models were run in Stata 14 software to generate prevalence rate ratios for the factors associated with multiple sexual partnerships. Results About 40.6% (37.9% of males and 50.0% of females) had engaged in multiple sexual partnerships in the last 30 days. Engaging in multiple sexual partnerships in the last 30 days was positively associated with being female (PR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03–1.63); staying in the informal settlement for 6–10 years (PR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02–1.75) and chewing khat in the last 30 days (PR 1.93, 95% CI: 1.10–3.40). Conclusion Multiple sexual partnerships are highly prevalent among young psychoactive-substance-users, irrespective of the socio-demographic strata. Being female, having lived in the informal settlement for 6–10 years, and chewing khat were significantly associated with having multiple sexual partners in the last 30 days. In tackling this high-risk sexual behaviour, it is recommended that risk-reduction interventions are considered for the different socio-demographic strata identified in this study, i.e. females, those who have lived in the informal settlement for about 6–10 years, and those who chew khat."
https://openalex.org/W3092553761,"Biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles provides many advantages over synthetic nanoparticles including clean and non-toxic approaches. Nanoparticle-based application for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics is a promising field that requires further enrichment and investigation. The use of biological systems for the generation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been extensively studied. The search for a biocompatibility approach for the development of nanoparticles is of great interest since it can provide more targeting and less toxicity. Here, we reported a bio-reductive approach of gold to AuNPs using metabolites extracted from mammalian cells, which provided a simple and efficient way for the synthesis of nanomaterials. AuNPs were more efficiently synthesized by the metabolites extracted from breast cancer (MCF7) and normal fibroblasts (F180) cells when compared to metabolites extracted from cell-free supernatants. The metabolites involved in biogenic synthesis are mainly alcohols and acids. Spectroscopic characterization using UV-visible spectra, morphological characterization using electron microscopy and structural characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the AuNPs synthesis from mammalian cells metabolites. AuNPs generated from MCF7 cells metabolites showed significant anticancer activities against MCF7 and low toxicity when compared to those generated from F180 cells metabolites. The results reflected the cytotoxic activities of the parent metabolites extracted from MCF7 versus those extracted from F180. Comparative metabolomics analysis indicated that MCF7-generated AuNPs harbored tetratetracontane, octacosane, and cyclotetradecane while those generated from F180 harbored a high percentage of stearic, palmitic, heptadecanoic acid. We related the variation in cytotoxic activities between cell types to the differences in AuNPs-harboring metabolites. The process used in this study to develop the nanoparticles is novel and should have useful future anticancer applications mainly because of proper specific targeting to cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3091775071,"Phasmatodea represents an order of hemimetabolous insects. This group includes species with extreme forms of masquerade crypsis, whereby they imitate twigs, bark, lichen, moss, and leaves. In this study, we sequenced and annotated three mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from Phasmatodea. The lengths of the novel mitogenomes range from 14,162 bp to 15,879 bp. The gene content and organization correspond to those inferred for the ancestral insect. We conducted phylogenetic analyses together with the existing mitogenomes of polyneopterans and mayflies. In most cases, the Phasmatodea was non-monophyletic, with Embioptera and Zoraptera nested inside. The mitogenome sequences from Embioptera and Zoraptera suffered from high substitution rates and displayed very long branches in phylogenetic trees. The monophyletic Phasmatodea was recovered only when the analysis employed the site-heterogeneous CAT-GTR model in PhyloBayes and used the nucleotide dataset PCG_nt. The Euphasmatodea was well established by various data types and inference methods. In addition, the clade Heteropterygidae and the subfamilies Lonchodinae and Necrosciinae were strongly supported. The Australasian clade Lanceocercata was recovered across analyses. However, the Clitumninae was non-monophyletic."

The mycobiome composition of the roots of wheat plants, especially spelt, under drought stress has been rarely investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the composition of fungal communities in the root endosphere and rhizosphere of three Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta L. cultivars and one Triticum aestivum ssp. vulgare L. cultivar, grown under drought and controlled conditions in different soil preparations. Culture-dependent fungal community profiling was performed to examine the impact of rhizocompartments (endosphere, rhizosphere), host genotype, watering status and different soil preparation on roots mycobiome structure. A total of 117 fungal strains, belonging to 22 genera, were found to colonize the internal and external parts of roots in T. aestivum ssp. spelta L. and T. aestivum ssp. vulgare L. cultivars. The results showed that the part of root and soil preparation type significantly determined the mycobiome composition of wheat roots."
https://openalex.org/W3092408999,"Mental fatigue has repeatedly been associated with decline in task performance in controlled situations, such as the lab, and in less controlled settings, such as the working environment. Given that a large number of factors can influence the course of mental fatigue, it is challenging to objectively and unobtrusively monitor mental fatigue on the work floor. We aimed to provide a proof of principle of a method to monitor mental fatigue in an uncontrolled office environment, and to study how typewriting dynamics change over different time-scales (i.e., time-on-task, time-of-day, day-of-week). To investigate this, typewriting performance of university employees was recorded for 6 consecutive weeks, allowing not only to examine performance speed, but also providing a natural setting to study error correction. We show that markers derived from typewriting are susceptible to changes in behavior related to mental fatigue. In the morning, workers first maintain typing speed during prolonged task performance, which resulted in an increased number of typing errors they had to correct. During the day, they seemed to readjust this strategy, reflected in a decline in both typing speed and accuracy. Additionally, we found that on Mondays and Fridays, workers adopted a strategy that favored typing speed, while on the other days of the week typing accuracy was higher. Although workers are allowed to take breaks, mental fatigue builds up during the day. Day-to-day patterns show no increase in mental fatigue over days, indicating that office workers are able to recover from work-related demands after a working day."
https://openalex.org/W3091832125,"Huanglongbing (HLB) is a deadly, incurable citrus disease putatively caused by the unculturable bacterium, ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (CLas), and transmitted by Diaphorina citri. Prior studies suggest D. citri transmits CLas in a circulative and propagative manner; however, the precise interactions necessary for CLas transmission remain unknown, and the impact of insect sex on D. citri-CLas interactions is poorly understood despite reports of sex-dependent susceptibilities to CLas. We analyzed the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and microbiome of male and female adult D. citri reared on healthy or CLas-infected Citrus medica to determine shared and sex-specific responses of D. citri and its endosymbionts to CLas exposure. More sex-specific than shared D. citri responses to CLas were observed, despite there being no difference between males and females in CLas density or relative abundance. CLas exposure altered the abundance of proteins involved in immunity and cellular and oxidative stress in a sex-dependent manner. CLas exposure impacted cuticular proteins and enzymes involved in chitin degradation, as well as energy metabolism and abundance of the endosymbiont ‘Candidatus Profftella armatura’ in both sexes similarly. Notably, diaphorin, a toxic Profftella-derived metabolite, was more abundant in both sexes with CLas exposure. The responses reported here resulted from a combination of CLas colonization of D. citri as well as the effect of CLas infection on C. medica. Elucidating these impacts on D. citri and their endosymbionts contributes to our understanding of the HLB pathosystem and identifies the responses potentially critical to limiting or promoting CLas acquisition and propagation in both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W3092102627,"The progress of next-generation sequencing has lead to the availability of massive data sets used by a wide range of applications in biology and medicine. This has sparked significant interest in using modern Big Data technologies to process this large amount of information in distributed memory clusters of commodity hardware. Several approaches based on solutions such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark, have been proposed. These solutions allow developers to focus on the problem while the need to deal with low level details, such as data distribution schemes or communication patterns among processing nodes, can be ignored. However, performance and scalability are also of high importance when dealing with increasing problems sizes, making in this way the usage of High Performance Computing (HPC) technologies such as the message passing interface (MPI) a promising alternative. Recently, MetaCacheSpark, an Apache Spark based software for detection and quantification of species composition in food samples has been proposed. This tool can be used to analyze high throughput sequencing data sets of metagenomic DNA and allows for dealing with large-scale collections of complex eukaryotic and bacterial reference genome. In this work, we propose MetaCache-MPI, a fast and memory efficient solution for computing clusters which is based on MPI instead of Apache Spark. In order to evaluate its performance a comparison is performed between the original single CPU version of MetaCache, the Spark version and the MPI version we are introducing. Results show that for 32 processes, MetaCache-MPI is 1.65× faster while consuming 48.12% of the RAM memory used by Spark for building a metagenomics database. For querying this database, also with 32 processes, the MPI version is 3.11× faster, while using 55.56% of the memory used by Spark. We conclude that the new MetaCache-MPI version is faster in both building and querying the database and uses less RAM memory, when compared with MetaCacheSpark, while keeping the accuracy of the original implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3091828194,"In 2015, UN member states committed to eliminate female genital mutilation (FGM) by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Agenda. To reach this goal, interventions need to be targeted and guided by the best available evidence. To date, however, estimates of the number of girls and women affected by FGM and their trends over time and geographic space have been limited by the availability, specificity and quality of population-level data. We present new estimates based on all publicly available nationally representative surveys collected since the 1990s that contain both information on FGM status and on the age at which FGM occurred. Using survival analysis, we generate estimates of FGM risk by single year of age for all countries with available data, and for rural and urban areas separately. The likelihood of experiencing FGM has decreased at the global level, but progress has been starkly uneven between countries. The available data indicate no progress in reducing FGM risk in Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Guinea. In addition, rural and urban areas have diverged over the last two decades, with FGM declining more rapidly in urban areas. We describe limitations in the availability and quality of data on FGM occurrence and age-at-FGM. Based on current trends, the SDG goal of eliminating FGM by 2030 is out of reach, and the pace at which the practice is being abandoned would need to accelerate to eliminate FGM by 2030. The heterogeneity in trends between countries and rural vs urban areas offers an opportunity to contrast countries where FGM is in rapid decline and explore potential policy lessons and programmatic implications for countries where the practice of FGM appears to remain entrenched."
https://openalex.org/W3092383659,"In recent years, the environmental problems caused by excessive carbon emissions from energy sources have become increasingly serious, which not only aggravates the climate change caused by the greenhouse effect but also seriously restricts the sustainable development of Chinese economy. An attempt is made in this paper to use energy consumption method and input-output method to study the carbon emission structure of China's energy system and industry in 2015 from two perspectives, namely China's energy supply side and energy demand side, by taking into account the two factors of energy invest in gross capital formation and export. The results show that neglecting these two factors will lead to underestimation of intermediate use carbon emissions and overestimation of final use carbon emissions. On energy supply side, the carbon emission structure of China's energy system is still dominated by high-carbon energy (raw coal, coke, diesel, and fuel oil, etc.), accounting for more than 70% of total energy carbon emissions; on the contrary, the natural gas such as clean energy accounts for only 3.45% of total energy carbon emissions, indicating that the energy consumption structure optimization and emission reduction gap of China's energy supply side are still substantial. On energy demand side, the final use (direct consumption by residents and government) produces less carbon emissions, while the intermediate use (production by enterprises) produces more than 90% of the total energy carbon emissions. Fossil energy, power sector, heavy industry, chemical industry, and transportation belong to industries with larger carbon emissions and lower carbon emission efficiency, while agriculture, construction, light industry, and service belong to industries with fewer carbon emissions and higher carbon emission efficiency. This means that the optimization of industrial structure is conducive to slowing down the growth of energy carbon emissions on the demand side."
https://openalex.org/W3092478292,"A two-year field trial was conducted in a vineyard (northern Egypt)cultivated with Thompson seedless grapevines to evaluate the effectiveness of four ""alternative"" (biological/chemical) treatments, Bacillus megaterium, boric acid, calcium nitrate and chitosan, against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Mi), compared to that of the nematicide oxamyl. The influence of these treatments on plant nutritional status and fruit yield and quality was also assessed. All treatments significantly inhibited Mi reproduction parameters in both seasons, decreasing the numbers of nematode galls and egg masses (roots) and of second-stage juveniles (soil). Oxamyl application resulted in the highest reductions in Mi-reproduction parameters, followed by boric acid, which also showed the highest relative nematicidal efficacy (respect to oxamyl). In the 1st season, the highest fruit yield (10.34 kg/grapevine) was recorded from boric acid-treated plants, followed by that from oxamyl-treated plants (7.50 kg/grapevine); in the subsequent season (2019), oxamyl use led to the highest yield, followed by boric acid + chitosan use (10.04 and 8.62 kg/grapevine, respectively). In both seasons, application of boric acid alone and combined with chitosan enhanced the total soluble solids (TSS)/total acidity ratio in grape juice. All treatments led to higher nutrient contents (leaf petioles) and chlorophyll levels (leaves) as well as enhanced fruit size and weight. We conclude that the tested treatments can be safely applied for nematode management in Thompson seedless grapevines, with positive effects on fruit yield and quality."

And these early readmissions have serious clinical and socioeconomic consequences. The objective of our study was to determine the rate of readmission within 30 days of discharge and it's predictors among patients treated for acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).A prospective cohort study involving 130 patients (asthma = 59, COPD = 71) was conducted from April-September, 2019, in Jimma Medical Center (JMC), South-West Ethiopia. Socio-demographic, clinical, laboratory, and drug-related data were recorded at admission and during hospital stay. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for readmissions following an AE of asthma and COPD.During the study period, 130 (male, 78(60%)) patients were admitted with AE of asthma and COPD. The median age was 59(IQR, 50-70) years. Of 130 patients, 21(18.10%) had a new AE of asthma and COPD that required hospitalization in the 30 days after discharge. The overall median survival time to 30-day readmission was 20 days (IQR, 16-29). Multivariate analysis revealed prolonged use of oxygen therapy (AHR = 4.972, 95% CI [1.041-23.736] and frequent hospital admissions (AHR = 11.482 [1.308-100.793]) to be independent risk factors for early readmissions.Early hospital readmission rates for AE of asthma and COPD were alarmingly high. Frequent hospital admission and long-term oxygen therapy during hospital stay were independent predictors of 30-day readmission."
https://openalex.org/W3092353735,"Radiolabeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET/CT is the current standard-of-care for lesion detection in patients with biochemically recurrent (BCR) prostate cancer (PCa). However, rigorous verification of detected lesions is not always performed in routine clinical practice. To aid future 18F-radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT interpretation, we aimed to identify clinical/imaging characteristics that increase the likelihood that a PSMA-avid lesion is malignant.262 patients with BCR, who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT, were retrospectively analyzed. The malignant nature of 18F-DCFPyL PET-detected lesions was verified through any of the following metrics: (1) positive histopathological examination; (2) additional positive imaging; (3) a ≥50% decrease in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) following irradiation of the lesion(s).In 226/262 PET scans (86.3%) at least one lesion suspicious for recurrent PCa was detected ('positive scan'). In 84/226 positive scans (37.2%), at least one independent verification metric was available. PSMA PET-detected lesions were most often confirmed to be malignant (PCa) in the presence of a CT-substrate (96.5% vs. 55.6% without CT-substrate), with SUVpeak ≥3.5 (91.4% vs. 60.0% with SUVpeak<3.5), in patients with a PSA-level ≥2.0 ng/mL (83.7% vs. 65.7% in patients with PSA <2.0ng/mL) and in patients with >2 PET-positive lesions (94.1% vs. 64.2% in patients with 1-2 PET-positive lesions; p<0.001-0.03).In this study, the clinical verification of 18F-DCFPyL PET-positive lesions in patients with BCR was performed. Diagnostic certainty of PET-detected lesions increases in the presence of characteristic abnormalities on CT, when SUVpeak is ≥3.5, when PSA-levels exceed 2.0 ng/mL or in patients with more than two PET-positive lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3092027993,"Human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) are a promising therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other inflammatory conditions. While considerable research has focused on paracrine effects and mitochondrial transfer that improve lung fluid balance, hMSCs are well known to have immunomodulatory properties as well. Some of these immunomodulatory properties have been related to previously reported paracrine effectors such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), but these effects cannot fully account for cell-contact dependent immunomodulation. Here, we report that CD40 is upregulated on hMSCs under the same conditions previously reported to induce IDO. Further, CD40 transcription is also upregulated on hMSCs by ARDS pulmonary edema fluid but not by hydrostatic pulmonary edema fluid. Transcription of CD40, as well as paracrine effectors TSG6 and PTGS2 remained significantly upregulated for at least 12 hours after withdrawal of cytokine stimulation. Finally, induction of this immune phenotype altered the transdifferentiation of hMSCs, one of their hallmark properties. CD40 may play an important role in the immunomodulatory effects of hMSCs in ARDS and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3092029926,"Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, which are of great public health importance in Colombia. Aedes control strategies in Colombia rely heavily on the use of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides, providing constant selection pressure and the emergence of resistant populations. In recent years, insecticide use has increased due to the increased incidence of dengue and recent introductions of chikungunya and Zika. In the present study, pyrethroid resistance was studied across six populations of Ae. aegypti from the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Susceptibility to λ-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and permethrin was assessed, and resistance intensity was determined. Activity levels of enzymes associated with resistance were measured, and the frequencies of three kdr alleles (V1016I, F1534C, V410L) were calculated. Results showed variations in pyrethroid susceptibility across Ae. aegypti populations and altered enzyme activity levels were detected. The kdr alleles were detected in all populations, with high variations in frequencies: V1016I (frequency ranging from 0.15-0.70), F1534C (range 0.94-1.00), and V410L (range 0.05-0.72). In assays of phenotyped individuals, associations were observed between the presence of V1016I, F1534C, and V410L alleles and resistance to the evaluated pyrethroids, as well as between the VI1016/CC1534/VL410 tri-locus genotype and λ-cyhalothrin and permethrin resistance. The results of the present study contribute to the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the resistance to key pyrethroids used to control Ae. aegypti along the Caribbean coast of Colombia."
https://openalex.org/W3091929986,"Vascularized lymph node (VLN) transfer is an emerging strategy to re-establish lymphatic drainage in chronic lymphedema. However, the biological processes underlying lymph node integration remain elusive. This study introduces an experimental approach facilitating the analysis of short-term molecular and cellular effects of ischemia/reperfusion on VLN flaps. Lymph node flaps were dissected pedicled on the lateral thoracic vessels in 44 Lewis rats. VLN flaps were exposed to 45 or 120 minutes ischemia by in situ clamping of the vascular pedicle with subsequent reperfusion for 24 hours. Flaps not exposed to ischemia/reperfusion served as controls. Lymph nodes and the perinodal adipose tissue were separately analyzed by Western blot for the expression of lymphangiogenic and angiogenic growth factors. Moreover, morphology, microvessel density, proliferation, apoptosis and immune cell infiltration of VLN flaps were further assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Ischemia for 120 minutes was associated with a markedly reduced cellularity of lymph nodes but not of the perinodal adipose tissue. In line with this, ischemic lymph nodes exhibited a significantly lower microvessel density and an increased expression of VEGF-D and VEGF-A. However, VEGF-C expression was not upregulated. In contrast, analyses of the perinodal adipose tissue revealed a more subtle decrease of microvessel density, while only the expression of VEGF-D was increased. Moreover, after 120 minutes ischemia, lymph nodes but not the perinodal adipose tissue exhibited significantly higher numbers of proliferating and apoptotic cells as well as infiltrated macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes compared with non-ischemic flaps. Taken together, lymph nodes of VLN flaps are highly susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury. In contrast, the perinodal adipose tissue is less prone to ischemia/reperfusion injury."

In this study, a pesticide residue analysis method was optimized for the detection and quantification of broflanilide and its two metabolites, DM-8007 and S(PFH-OH)-8007, in brown rice, soybean, apple, green pepper, mandarin, and kimchi cabbage. Residue samples were extracted from the produce using QuEChERS acetate and citrate buffering methods and were purified by dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) using six different adsorbent compositions with varying amounts of primary secondary amine (PSA), C18, and graphitized carbon black. All the sample preparation methods gave low-to-medium matrix effects, as confirmed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry using standard solutions and matrix-matched standards. In particular, the use of the citrate buffering method, in combination with purification by d-SPE using 25 mg of PSA and a mixture of other adsorbents, consistently gave low matrix effects that in the range from −18.3 to 18.8%. Pesticide recoveries within the valid recovery range 70–120% were obtained both with and without d-SPE purification using 25 mg of PSA and other adsorbents. Thus, the developed residue analysis method is viable for the determination of broflanilide and its metabolites in various crops."
https://openalex.org/W3092154162,"Detecting the ultrastructure of brain tissue in human archaeological remains is a rare event that can offer unique insights into the structure of the ancient central nervous system (CNS). Yet ancient brains reported in the literature show only poor preservation of neuronal structures. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and advanced image processing tools, we describe the direct visualization of neuronal tissue in vitrified brain and spinal cord remains which we discovered in a male victim of the AD 79 eruption in Herculaneum. We show exceptionally well preserved ancient neurons from different regions of the human CNS at unprecedented resolution. This tissue typically consists of organic matter, as detected using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. By means of a self-developed neural image processing network, we also show specific details of the neuronal nanomorphology, like the typical myelin periodicity evidenced in the brain axons. The perfect state of preservation of these structures is due to the unique process of vitrification which occurred at Herculaneum. The discovery of proteins whose genes are expressed in the different region of the human adult brain further agree with the neuronal origin of the unusual archaeological find. The conversion of human tissue into glass is the result of sudden exposure to scorching volcanic ash and the concomitant rapid drop in temperature. The eruptive-induced process of natural vitrification, locking the cellular structure of the CNS, allowed us to study possibly the best known example in archaeology of extraordinarily well-preserved human neuronal tissue from the brain and spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W3092479867,"During inflammation, dysregulated neutrophil behaviour can play a major role in a range of chronic inflammatory diseases, for many of which current treatments are generally ineffective. Recently, specific naturally occurring tanshinones have shown promising anti-inflammatory effects by targeting neutrophils in vivo, yet such tanshinones, and moreover, their isomeric isotanshinone counterparts, are still a largely underexplored class of compounds, both in terms of synthesis and biological effects. To explore the anti-inflammatory effects of isotanshinones, and the tanshinones more generally, a series of substituted tanshinone and isotanshinone analogues was synthesised, alongside other structurally similar molecules. Evaluation of these using a transgenic zebrafish model of neutrophilic inflammation revealed differential anti-inflammatory profiles in vivo, with a number of compounds exhibiting promising effects. Several compounds reduce initial neutrophil recruitment and/or promote resolution of neutrophilic inflammation, of which two also result in increased apoptosis of human neutrophils. In particular, the methoxy-substituted tanshinone 39 specifically accelerates resolution of inflammation without affecting the recruitment of neutrophils to inflammatory sites, making this a particularly attractive candidate for potential pro-resolution therapeutics, as well as a possible lead for future development of functionalised tanshinones as molecular tools and/or chemical probes. The structurally related β-lapachones promote neutrophil recruitment but do not affect resolution. We also observed notable differences in toxicity profiles between compound classes. Overall, we provide new insights into the in vivo anti-inflammatory activities of several novel tanshinones, isotanshinones, and structurally related compounds."

The species is spreading in many areas of the world. The European Union has classified V. velutina as a species of concern because the hornet significantly affects beekeeping activities, mostly by preying honeybees (Apis mellifera) at beehive entrances. No current control method is simultaneously eco-friendly and effective. Here, we aimed to develop a greener technique for destroying V. velutina nests, inspired by a defense behavior used by the eastern honeybee (Apis cerana), the ""heat ball"". In the laboratory, we tested how V. velutina of different sexes, castes, and developmental stages responded to different heat exposure systems employing a range of temperature levels. Overall, the time of death decreased as temperature increased. Hornets died faster when the temperature was gradually increased than when it was instantaneously increased; larvae seemed to be more thermally tolerant. The most promising and potential technique for quickly destroying hornet nests may be steam injection, as the humid airflow system killed all hornets within 13 seconds, and therefore could be a good candidate for a green nest control method."
https://openalex.org/W3092645343,"Introduction Many health organizations have promoted the importance of the health-related benefits of physical fitness and physical activity. Studies have evaluated effective public health practice aiming to understand the cognition of physical activity among youths and adolescents. However, studies investigating the level of cognition and knowledge of physical fitness among Asian adults are lacking. Purpose This study aimed to investigate the self-awareness level of physical fitness and exercise prescription and the demand for physical fitness assessment among Taiwanese adults. Methods In January-July 2019, a cross-sectional anonymous survey was conducted using Research Electronic Data Capture to gather data on demographic data, cognition investigation of physical fitness and exercise prescription, cognitive test of physical fitness and exercise prescription, and demand for physical fitness assessment. Results The questionnaire was answered by 200 respondents. The rating for cognition investigation of physical fitness was 2.63-3.13 (unclear to mostly clear) and for exercise prescription was 2.05-2.76 (unclear) (rated on a 5-point Likert scale). Results show that lack of awareness was highest for health-related physical fitness, exercise prescription, and exercise progress planning. 98% of subjects did not know the latest recommended guidelines for physical activity, despite most agreeing that physical fitness and exercise are good for health. Most subjects (72%) indicated a willingness to accept self-pay service for physical fitness assessments. Conclusions This is the first study to report on the demand for cognition, assessment, and promotion of physical fitness among Taiwanese adults. The study shows that the subjects widely lack knowledge in the cognition of physical fitness and exercise prescription. Furthermore, a self-pay service for the physical fitness assessment and individualized exercise prescription were acceptable to most subjects, especially those undergoing regular health examinations. The findings are encouraging and will aid support for health organizations and professionals in the development and management of promotion strategies on health-related physical fitness in preventive medicine and health promotion."
https://openalex.org/W3091915704,"Atherosclerosis is a systemic process. As the population ages, increasingly more patients who undergo coronary revascularization are complicated with peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, the large body of evidence in this area has not been limited to analysis from trial-based data from younger and relatively uncomplicated patients in Western countries. The impact of PAD on the outcomes can differ by patient characteristics, and integrated analysis of large-scale data is necessary. J-PCI is a universal (all-comer) nationwide registration system in Japan, regulated and audited by professional society that controls national board-certification system. For the present study, we extracted data of 894,014 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) cases performed between 2014 and 2017 (mean age 70.2 years [standard deviation 11.0]). In-hospital outcomes of PAD and Non-PAD patients were compared. PAD was defined as a previous history of stenosis of peripheral arteries or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and multivariable modeling was performed. A total of 66,891 patients (8.1%) had PAD. Crude in-hospital mortality rate was higher in this group (0.99% vs. 0.67% in Non-PAD group). PAD was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.383 [95% confidence interval 1.251-1.528]). However, the impact of PAD differed by kidney condition (OR 1.578 [1.370-1.821] for patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD] and OR 1.234 [1.076-1.416] without CKD: P for interaction 0.005), and by clinical presentation: PAD was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing PCI for silent ischemia (OR 1.211 [0.8701-1.685]: P for interaction 0.002). Presence of PAD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in patients receiving PCI. However, its impact varied substantially by the patient background or indication of the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3092129876,"The value of ecosystem services is affected by increasing human activities. However, the anthropogenic driving mechanisms of ecosystem services are poorly understood. Here, we established a deep learning model to approximate the ecosystem service value (ESV) of Nanjing City using 23 socioeconomic factors. A multi-view analysis was then conducted on feasible impact mechanisms using model disassembly. The results indicated that certain factors had their own significant and independent effects on ESV, such as the proportion of water areas in the land-use structure and the output value of the secondary industry. The proportion of ecological water should be increased as much as possible, whereas the output value of the secondary industry should be reasonably controlled in Nanjing. Other intrinsically related factors were likely to be composited together to affect ESV, such as industrial water consumption and industrial electricity consumption. In Nanjing, simultaneously optimizing socio-economic factors related to city size, resources, and energy use efficiency likely represents an effective management strategy for maintaining and enhancing regional ecological service capabilities. The results of this work suggest that deep learning is an effective method of deepening studies on the prediction of ESV trends and human-driven mechanisms."

This study assesses the current status of AS treatment trends using a nationwide database. This study was conducted using a Korean National Health Insurance System (KNHIS) dataset from 2006 to 2016. We randomly extracted 50% of the total number of patients registered as As patients in the KNHIS. The distribution of the number of patients according to age and gender was analyzed each year. The types and combination methods of drugs used during the study period were estimated yearly. Between 2006 and 2016, the number of AS patients increased linearly by an average of 9% annually, 6372 in 2006 to 15188 in 2016. The study found that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was the most commonly prescribed pharmacological treatment option, followed by disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and then biologics. Biologics such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors increased from 10% to 35% consistently for 10 years. In terms of combination therapy, DMARDs + NSAIDs accounted for almost 90% of treatments in 2006, but decreased by 65% in 2016. The use of biologics and NSAIDs increased from 3% to 28%. Prescriptions for dual therapies and mono therapies largely dominated prescription habits, accounted for up to approximately 80% of treatments. Among 10- to 14-year-old patients, there was no triple therapy, dual and triple therapies decreased gradually for those 60 and older, and the ratio of conservative treatments has increased. This study shows how South Korea reflects changes in AS treatment trends, along with the emergence of TNF-α inhibitors that are effective in treating AS. Research on clinical outcomes for AS treatments will be needed on following these drug changes."

Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. The qualitative data was analyzed using thematic content analytical procedure. The results of the study showed, superstitions, traditional norms and taboo yielded statistically significant effect sizes with pupils' open defaecation behaviour: and superstition: r = 0.728, p< 0.05; traditional norms: r = 0.425, p <0.05; taboos: r = 0.462, p<0.05. The study concluded that superstitions and traditional norm and taboo constituted the key cultural drivers influencing pupils' open defaecation behaviour in the Eastern and Volta Regions. It is recommended that the Ministry of Education should incorporate open defaecation issues into the educational curriculum and develop culturally sensitive educational programs for a massive educational campaign to stop open defaecation in the schools. To ensure that the messaging for these campaigns resonate with target audience, communication campaigns should promote a number of positive emotional and social issues related to improved social status and positive self-esteem, better growth and economic opportunities with toilet use."

In the literature, various studies can be found that have reviewed several clinical and laboratory markers, but none of these variables alone is sufficient to predict the patient's prognosis. In this study, we present a protocol to develop a prognostic model that can predict the clinical response of urticaria patients to antihistamines. This is a protocol for a bidirectional cohort study. Urticaria data will be routinely collected from a population of patients over 18 years old. A full multivariable logistic regression model will be fitted, following five steps: 1) Selection of predictive variables for the model; 2) Evaluation of the quality of the collected data and control of lost data; 3) Data statistical management; 4) Strategies to select the variables to include at the end of the model; 5) Evaluation of the performance of the different possible models (predictive accuracy) and selection of the best model. The performance and internal validation of the model will be assessed. Some clinical and paraclinical variables will be measured for further exploration."

Whilst research indicates that children preferentially direct their prosocial behavior towards members of their own groups, the influence of perceived linguistic group membership on actual helpfulness and cooperation has not been investigated. We presented an experimenter to 4- and 5-year-olds either as a foreigner, who did not speak the local language or as a native person. Children were then given the opportunity to help or cooperate with this experimenter in a series of nonverbal playful tasks. Whilst 4-year-olds helped and cooperated equally with the foreign and the native experimenter, 5-year-olds required significantly more cues and prompts in order to help or cooperate in the foreign condition. We also found that children were overall more reluctant to respond prosocially in the cooperation tasks than in the helping tasks. We tested children in two European countries (France and Hungary) and found the same pattern of responses in the two locations, suggesting that our findings are not specific to the local culture. Our results extend the findings of earlier research that showed selectivity according to the language spoken by the partner for sharing and imitation. Studies that looked at helpfulness or cooperation used the minimal group paradigm to induce group membership (based on arbitrary cues) and used indirect measures of prosociality, such as different forms of reasoning about the partner. In our study, we used language, a natural cue for group membership (versus arbitrary cues or cues based on social conventions) and directly observed children's helpful and cooperative behaviors toward the experimenter. Our results also confirm previous results indicating that with age, children become selective in their prosocial behaviors as they acquire new means of social evaluation and categorization. We conclude that the language associated with a potential social partner is not only a cue for affiliation and shared knowledge but also a cue mediating children's prosocial acts."
https://openalex.org/W3092290290,"In the development of ship anchorage training systems, the problems of low efficiency and poor fidelity exist in the simulation of flexible anchor chains, and a position-based dynamics (PBD) method is proposed to express the chain movement. To satisfy the requirements of simulating anchoring manipulation, the PBD method modifies the position of anchor chain particles by controlling constraints. Using the original distance constraint and bending constraint of the PBD approach, two novel constraints, namely, the long-range attachment (LRA) constraint and pin constraint, are developed to simulate the bending and stretching of the anchor chain. Simulation of ordinary ropes can be achieved using distance and bending constraints. The developed LRA constraint is capable of preventing anchor chain particles from being overstretched. Adoption of the pin constraint is proposed to integrate two particles into one to be calculated as an attempt to simulate the connection between the chain and the anchor. The continuous collision detection (CCD) constraint method considering friction and viscosity is used to detect collisions in the ship anchoring training system. Collision detection covers chain collisions with other objects and chains. Finally, the PBD method is more efficient and robust than the Newton method. Since it has sufficient visual plausibility and can realize real-time visualization, the simulation system developed by the PBD method effective for training crew members."
