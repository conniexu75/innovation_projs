To gain insights into transcriptional regulation of human ES cells, we have identified OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG target genes using genome-scale location analysis. We found, surprisingly, that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG co-occupy a substantial portion of their target genes. These target genes frequently encode transcription factors, many of which are developmentally important homeodomain proteins. Our data also indicate that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG collaborate to form regulatory circuitry consisting of autoregulatory and feedforward loops. These results provide new insights into the transcriptional regulation of stem cells and reveal how OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG contribute to pluripotency and self-renewal.

Mammalian development requires the specification of over 200 unique cell types from a single totipotent cell. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the developing blastocyst and can be propagated in culture in an undifferentiated state while maintaining the capacity to generate any cell type in the body. The recent derivation of human ES cells provides a unique opportunity to study early development and is thought to hold great promise for regenerative medicine (Pera and Trounson, 2004Pera M.F.

An understanding of the transcriptional regulatory circuitry that is responsible for pluripotency and self-renewal in human ES cells is fundamental to understanding human development and realizing the therapeutic potential of these cells. Homeodomain transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved and play key roles in cell-fate specification in many organisms (Hombria and Lovegrove, 2003Hombria J.C. Lovegrove B. Beyond homeosis–HOX function in morphogenesis and organogenesis.Differentiation. 2003; 71: 461-476Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Two such factors, OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG, are essential regulators of early development and ES cell identity (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S.

Several genetic studies in mouse suggest that these regulators have distinct roles but may function in related pathways to maintain the developmental potential of these cells (Chambers, 2004Chambers I. The molecular basis of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Cloning Stem Cells. 2004; 6: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For example, disruption of OCT4 or NANOG results in the inappropriate differentiation of ICM and ES cells to trophectoderm and extra-embryonic endoderm, respectively (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I.

However, overexpression of OCT4 in ES cells leads to a phenotype that is similar to loss of NANOG function (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S.

Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the set of genes regulated by these two transcription factors might reveal why manipulation of OCT4 and NANOG results in these phenotypic consequences. OCT4 is known to interact with other transcription factors to activate and repress gene expression in mouse ES cells (Pesce and Schöler, 2001Pesce M. Schöler H.R. Oct-4: gatekeeper in the beginnings of mammalian development.Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). For example, OCT4, a member of the POU (PIT/OCT/UNC) class of homeodomain proteins, can heterodimerize with the HMG-box transcription factor, SOX2, to affect the expression of several genes in mouse ES cells (Botquin et al., 1998Botquin V.

Developmental-specific activity of the FGF-4 enhancer requires the synergistic action of Sox2 and Oct-3.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The cooperative interaction of POU homeodomain and HMG factors is thought to be a fundamental mechanism for the developmental control of gene expression (Dailey and Basilico, 2001Dailey L. Basilico C. Coevolution of HMG domains and homeodomains and the generation of transcriptional regulation by Sox/POU complexes.J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The extent to which ES cell gene regulation is accomplished by OCT4 through an OCT4/SOX2 complex and whether NANOG has a role in this process are unknown. OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are thought to be central to the transcriptional regulatory hierarchy that specifies ES cell identity because of their unique expression patterns and their essential roles during early development (Avilion et al., 2003Avilion A.A.

Studies in a broad range of eukaryotes have shown that transcriptional regulators that have key roles in cellular processes frequently regulate other regulators associated with that process (Guenther et al., 2005Guenther M.G.

It is likely that the key stem cell regulators bind and regulate genes encoding other transcriptional regulators, which in turn determine the developmental potential of these cells, but we currently lack substantial knowledge of the regulatory circuitry of ES cells and other vertebrate cells. To further our understanding of the means by which OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG control the pluripotency and self-renewal of human ES cells, we have used genome-scale location analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA microarrays) to identify the target genes of all three regulators in vivo. The results reveal that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG co-occupy the promoters of a large population of genes, that many of these target genes encode developmentally important homeodomain transcription factors, and that these regulators contribute to specialized regulatory circuits in ES cells. DNA sequences occupied by OCT4 in human H9 ES cells (NIH code WA09; Supplemental Data) were identified in a replicate set of experiments using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with DNA microarrays (Figure 1A and Supplemental Data). For this purpose, DNA microarrays were designed that contain 60-mer oligonucleotide probes covering the region from −8 kb to +2 kb relative to the transcript start sites for 17,917 annotated human genes. Although some transcription factors are known to regulate genes from distances greater than 8 kb, 98% of known binding sites for human transcription factors occur within 8 kb of target genes (Figure S1). The sites occupied by OCT4 were identified as peaks of ChIP-enriched DNA that span closely neighboring probes (Figure 1B). OCT4 was associated with 623 (3%) of the promoter regions for known protein-coding genes and 5 (3%) of the promoters for known miRNA genes in human ES cells (Table S2). Two lines of evidence suggested that this protein-DNA interaction dataset is of high quality. First, the genes occupied by OCT4 in our analysis included many previously identified or supposed target genes in mouse ES cells or genes whose transcripts are highly enriched in ES cells, including OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LEFTY2/EBAF, CDX2, HAND1, DPPA4, GJA1/CONNEXIN43, FOXO1A, CRIPTO/TDGF1, and ZIC3 (Abeyta et al., 2004Abeyta M.J.

Second, we have used improved protocols and DNA microarray technology in these experiments (Supplemental Data) that should reduce false positive rates relative to those obtained in previous genome-scale experiments (Odom et al., 2004Odom D.T. Zizlsperger N. Gordon D.B. Bell G.W. Rinaldi N.J. Murray H.L. Volkert T.L. Schreiber J. Rolfe P.A. Gifford D.K. et al.Control of pancreas and liver gene expression by HNF transcription factors.Science. 2004; 303: 1378-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). By using this new technology with yeast transcription factors, where considerable prior knowledge of transcription factor binding sites has been established, we estimated that this platform has a false positive rate of <1% and a false negative rate of 20% (Supplemental Data). We next identified, with location analysis, protein-coding and miRNA genes targeted by the stem cell regulators SOX2 and NANOG. SOX2 and NANOG were found associated with 1271 (7%) and 1687 (9%), respectively, of the promoter regions for known protein-coding genes in human ES cells (Tables S2–S4). It was immediately evident that many of the target genes were shared by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (Figure 2A ). Examples of protein-coding genes that are co-occupied by the three regulators are shown in Figure 2B (Table S5). Control experiments showed that the set of promoters bound by the cell-cycle transcription factor E2F4 in these human ES cells did not overlap substantially with those bound by the three stem cell regulators (Tables S2 and S6). We found that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG together occupy at least 353 genes in human ES cells. Previous studies in murine ES cells have shown that SOX2 and OCT4 can interact to synergistically activate transcription of target genes and that this activity is dependent upon the juxtaposition of OCT4 and SOX2 binding sites (Ambrosetti et al., 1997Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Synergistic activation of the fibroblast growth factor 4 enhancer by Sox2 and Oct-3 depends on protein-protein interactions facilitated by a specific spatial arrangement of factor binding sites.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, Remenyi et al., 2004Remenyi A. Schöler H.R. Wilmanns M. Combinatorial control of gene expression.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our results revealed that approximately half of the promoter regions occupied by OCT4 were also bound by SOX2 in human ES cells (Figure 2A; Table S2). It was surprising, however, to find that >90% of promoter regions bound by both OCT4 and SOX2 were also occupied by NANOG. Furthermore, we found that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding sites occurred in close proximity at nearly all of the genes that they co-occupied (Figure 2C). These data suggest that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG function together to regulate a significant proportion of their target genes in human ES cells. A class of small noncoding RNAs known as microRNAs (miRNA) play vital roles in gene regulation, and recent studies indicate that more than a third of mammalian protein-coding genes are conserved miRNA targets (Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P.

ES cells lacking the machinery that processes miRNA transcripts are unable to differentiate (Kanellopoulou et al., 2005Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky K. Dicer-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells are defective in differentiation and centromeric silencing.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that microRNAs play an important role in organismal development through regulation of gene expression (Pasquinelli et al., 2005Pasquinelli A.E. Hunter S. Bracht J. MicroRNAs: a developing story.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG were found associated with 14 miRNA genes and co-occupied the promoters of at least two miRNA genes, mir-137 and mir-301 (Table 1). Our results suggest that miRNA genes are likely regulated by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in human ES cells and are important components of the transcriptional regulatory circuitry in these cells.Table 1miRNA Loci near OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG Bound RegionsTranscription FactormiRNAOCT4SOX2NANOGmir-7-1+mir-10a+mir-22++mir-32++mir-128a+mir-135b++mir-137+++mir-196a-1+mir-196b+mir-204++mir-205++mir-301+++mir-361+mir-448+Proximal binding of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG to miRNAs from the RFAM database.

Developmental-specific activity of the FGF-4 enhancer requires the synergistic action of Sox2 and Oct-3.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), so we sought to identify the transcriptional state of genes occupied by the stem cell regulators. To this end, the set of genes bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG were compared to gene expression datasets generated from multiple ES cell lines (Abeyta et al., 2004Abeyta M.J. Clark A.T. Rodriguez R.T.

The results showed that one or more of the stem cell transcription factors occupied 1303 actively transcribed genes and 957 inactive genes. The importance of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG for early development and ES cell identity led us to focus additional analyses on the set of 353 genes that are co-occupied by these regulators in human ES cells (Table S5). We first identified transcriptionally active genes. Transcripts were consistently detected in ES cells for approximately half of the genes co-bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Among these active genes, several encoding transcription factors (e.g., OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, STAT3, ZIC3) and components of the Tgf-β (e.g., TDGF1, LEFTY2/EBAF) and Wnt (e.g., DKK1, FRAT2) signaling pathways were notable targets. Recent studies have shown that Tgf-β and Wnt signaling play a role in pluripotency and self-renewal in both mouse and human ES cells (James et al., 2005James D. Levine A.J. Besser D. Hemmati-Brivanlou A.

Maintenance of pluripotency in human and mouse embryonic stem cells through activation of Wnt signaling by a pharmacological GSK-3-specific inhibitor.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG promote pluripotency and self-renewal through positive regulation of their own genes and genes encoding components of these key signaling pathways. Among transcriptionally inactive genes co-occupied by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, we noted a striking enrichment for transcription factor genes (p < 10−18; Table S7), many of which have been implicated in developmental processes. These included genes that specify transcription factors important for differentiation into extra-embryonic, endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal lineages (e.g., ESX1l, HOXB1, MEIS1, PAX6, LHX5, LBX1, MYF5, ONECUT1) (Table S5). Moreover, nearly half of the transcription factor genes that were bound by the three regulators and transcriptionally inactive encoded developmentally important homeodomain proteins (Table 2). These results demonstrate that OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG occupy a set of repressed genes that are key to developmental processes.Table 2Examples of Inactive Homeodomain Genes Co-occupied by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOGGene SymbolEntrez Gene IDGene NameATBF1463AT binding transcription factor 1DLX11745distal-less homeobox 1DLX41748distal-less homeobox 4DLX51749distal-less homeobox 5EN12019engrailed homolog 1ESX1L80712extraembryonic, spermatogenesis, homeobox 1-likeGBX22637gastrulation brain homeobox 2GSC145258goosecoidHOP84525homeodomain-only proteinHOXB13211homeobox B1HOXB33213homeobox B3HOXC43221homeobox C4IPF23651insulin promoter factor 2ISL13670ISL1 transcription factor, LIM/homeodomain (islet-1)LBX110660transcription factor similar to D. melanogaster homeodomain protein lady bird lateLHX29355LIM homeobox 2LHX564211LIM homeobox 5MEIS14211myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog (mouse)NKX2-24821NK2 transcription factor related, locus 2 (Drosophila)NKX2-3159296NK2 transcription factor related, locus 3 (Drosophila)ONECUT13175one cut domain, family member 1OTP23440orthopedia homolog (Drosophila)OTX15013orthodenticle homolog 1 (Drosophila)PAX65080paired box gene 6TITF17080thyroid transcription factor 1 Open table in a new tab To determine which of the OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG bound genes were preferentially expressed in ES cells, we compared expression datasets (Abeyta et al., 2004Abeyta M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2027589607,"Obesity-related disorders are associated with the development of ischemic heart disease. Adiponectin is a circulating adipose-derived cytokine that is downregulated in obese individuals and after myocardial infarction. Here, we examine the role of adiponectin in myocardial remodeling in response to acute injury. Ischemia-reperfusion in adiponectin-deficient (APN-KO) mice resulted in increased myocardial infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression compared with wild-type mice. Administration of adiponectin diminished infarct size, apoptosis and TNF-α production in both APN-KO and wild-type mice. In cultured cardiac cells, adiponectin inhibited apoptosis and TNF-α production. Dominant negative AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on apoptosis but had no effect on the suppressive effect of adiponectin on TNF-α production. Adiponectin induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–dependent synthesis of prostaglandin E2 in cardiac cells, and COX-2 inhibition reversed the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on TNF-α production and infarct size. These data suggest that adiponectin protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through both AMPK- and COX-2–dependent mechanisms."

However, the existence of an S1P gradient between lymphoid organs and blood or lymph has not been established. To further define egress requirements, we addressed why treatment with the food colorant 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (THI) induces lymphopenia. We found that S1P abundance in lymphoid tissues of mice is normally low but increases more than 100-fold after THI treatment and that this treatment inhibits the S1P-degrading enzyme S1P lyase. We conclude that lymphocyte egress is mediated by S1P gradients that are established by S1P lyase activity and that the lyase may represent a novel immunosuppressant drug target."

https://openalex.org/W2071307076,"Although people's legs are capable of a broad range of muscle-use and gait patterns, they generally prefer just two. They walk, swinging their body over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run, bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases. Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running feels easiest when going faster. More unusual gaits seem more tiring. Perhaps this is because walking and running use the least energy. Addressing this classic conjecture with experiments requires comparing walking and running with many other strange and unpractised gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy cost by using mechanics-based models. Here we use a minimal model that can describe walking and running as well as an infinite variety of other gaits. We use computer optimization to find which gaits are indeed energetically optimal for this model. At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic inverted-pendulum walk, at high speeds it discovers a bouncing run, even without springs, and at intermediate speeds it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes walking and running as extreme cases."
https://openalex.org/W2010278105,"We have developed the suspended-load backpack, which converts mechanical energy from the vertical movement of carried loads (weighing 20 to 38 kilograms) to electricity during normal walking [generating up to 7.4 watts, or a 300-fold increase over previous shoe devices (20 milliwatts)]. Unexpectedly, little extra metabolic energy (as compared to that expended carrying a rigid backpack) is required during electricity generation. This is probably due to a compensatory change in gait or loading regime, which reduces the metabolic power required for walking. This electricity generation can help give field scientists, explorers, and disaster-relief workers freedom from the heavy weight of replacement batteries and thereby extend their ability to operate in remote areas."
https://openalex.org/W2118001641,"The Trp53 tumor suppressor gene product (p53) functions in the nucleus to regulate proapoptotic genes, whereas cytoplasmic p53 directly activates proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to permeabilize mitochondria and initiate apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that a tripartite nexus between Bcl-xL, cytoplasmic p53, and PUMA coordinates these distinct p53 functions. After genotoxic stress, Bcl-xL sequestered cytoplasmic p53. Nuclear p53 caused expression of PUMA , which then displaced p53 from Bcl-xL, allowing p53 to induce mitochondrial permeabilization. Mutant Bcl-xL that bound p53, but not PUMA, rendered cells resistant to p53-induced apoptosis irrespective of PUMA expression. Thus, PUMA couples the nuclear and cytoplasmic proapoptotic functions of p53."

In the present study we have conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis of affinity-purified GLUT4 vesicles from 3T3-L1 adipocytes to discover potential regulators of GLUT4 trafficking. In addition to previously identified components of GLUT4 storage vesicles including the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase insulin-regulated aminopeptidase and the vesicle soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein (v-SNARE) VAMP2, we have identified three new Rab proteins, Rab10, Rab11, and Rab14, on GLUT4 vesicles. We have also found that the putative Rab GTPase-activating protein AS160 (Akt substrate of 160 kDa) is associated with GLUT4 vesicles in the basal state and dissociates in response to insulin. This association is likely to be mediated by the cytosolic tail of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, which interacted both in vitro and in vivo with AS160. Consistent with an inhibitory role of AS160 in the basal state, reduced expression of AS160 in adipocytes using short hairpin RNA increased plasma membrane levels of GLUT4 in an insulin-independent manner.

The insulin-dependent movement of GLUT4 vesicles to the PM is an Akt-independent process, and this is followed by an Akt-dependent step likely involving the docking and fusion of vesicles with the PM (7van Dam E.M.

However, although these Rab proteins may participate in some aspects of GLUT4 trafficking, no compelling evidence for specific involvement in the insulin-regulated trafficking of GLUT4 has been found.In this study we describe four key findings that add to our understanding of GLUT4 trafficking. Using mass spectrometry we have identified three Rab proteins on GLUT4 vesicles that could potentially be substrates of AS160 and, thus, play an important role in insulin-regulated glucose transport. In addition, we have shown that AS160 is present on GLUT4 vesicles in the basal state and dissociates with insulin. We have gone on to show that the association of AS160 with GLUT4 vesicles is mediated at least in part via a direct interaction with the cytosolic tail of IRAP, and this interaction appears to be insulin-dependent. Furthermore, a decrease in AS160 expression by shRNA leads to increased levels of GLUT4 at the PM in the basal state. Together, these results provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—3T3-L1 murine fibroblasts, C2C12 fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

Martin S. Luen T.B. Hong W. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum or fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/liter penicillin, and 100 μg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C in 10% CO2 and passaged at ∼60% confluence. In the case of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, confluent cells were differentiated into adipocytes and used between days 8 and 10 postdifferentiation and between passages 10 and 20. To establish basal conditions before use, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2.Subcellular Fractionation of Adipocytes—3T3-L1 adipocyte fractionation was carried out as described previously (5Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M.

Briefly, cells were incubated for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose at 37 °C and lysed using 12 passes through a 22-gauge needle followed by 6 passes through a 27-gauge needle in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose pH 7.4) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm ammonium molybdate, 10 mm sodium fluoride) at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and at 10,080 × g for 12 min, 15,750 × g for 17 min, and 175,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C to obtain the PM, mitochondria and nuclei high density microsomal pellet containing the endoplasmic reticulum and large endosomes, and the low density microsomal (LDM) pellet which contained intracellular transport vesicles and the majority of GLUT4 vesicles, respectively. The LDM was then resuspended in PBS-containing inhibitors for use in immunoprecipitations.Cationic Colloidal Silica Plasma Membrane Isolation—Plasma membranes were purified as per Chaney and Jacobson (21Chaney L.K. Jacobson B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 62-72Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, basal or insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and twice in ice-cold coating buffer (20 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 280 mm sorbitol, pH 5.0-5.5). Cationic silica 1% (stored as a 30% stock and diluted to 1% in coating buffer) was added to the cells in coating buffer for 2 min on ice. Excess silica was removed by washing once with ice-cold coating buffer. Sodium polyacrylate (1 mg/ml, pH 6-6.5) was added to the cells in coating buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 2 min. Cells were washed once in ice-cold coating buffer and then washed with modified HES (20 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm zinc chloride, pH 7.4) at 4 °C and lysed as described above. Nycodenz (100%) in modified HES buffer was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 50%. The lysate was layered onto 0.5 ml of 70% Nycodenz in modified HES and centrifuged in a swing-out rotor at 41,545 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of modified HES buffer and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated to 65 °C for 10 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 24 °C, and the supernatant was retained for analysis by immunoblotting.Immuno-isolation of GLUT4 Vesicles and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—GLUT4 vesicles were immuno-isolated using the protocol of Hashiramoto et al. (22Hashiramoto M. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with the exception that either control mouse IgG or the anti-GLUT4 monoclonal 1F8 was covalently coupled to GF-2000 beads according to manufacturer's instructions. LDM (2.5 mg) was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and added to 50 μl of both control mouse IgG and 1F8 beads and incubated overnight with rotation at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin and PBS in a final volume of 250 μl. The beads were then washed 5 times with PBS, and the proteins were eluted with 100% formic acid. The eluate was removed and vacuum-dried. Ammonium bicarbonate (500 mm) was added to adjust the pH to 8 and vacuum-dried again. Urea (10 m) and 5 mm dithiothreitol were then added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cysteines were subsequently alkylated using a 10-fold molar excess of iodoacetamide and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteins were digested by the addition of modified trypsin (12.5 ng/μl) in 100 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 5% formic acid, and peptides were desalted using C18 Stagetips. Peptides were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using a CapLC high performance liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA) by binding to a strong cation exchange cartridge and sequential elution of the peptides using salt steps of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 75, 150, 300, 1000 mm ammonium acetate. After each salt step eluted peptides were desalted on a capillary C18 cartridge and resolved on a 100-mm × 75-μm C18 Magic reverse phase analytical column with a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Peptides were ionized by nanoelectrospray at 2.8 kV from the end of the column, which was pulled to an inner diameter of 5 μm by a P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments Co). Tandem mass spectral analysis was carried out on a Waters (Milford, MA) quadrupole time-of-flight Ultima mass spectrometer. A data-dependent acquisition method was used for all experiments where precursor ions needed to have an intensity higher than 10 counts and be in the +2, +3, or +4 charge state. MS/MS spectra were searched against a metazoan data base generated from Swiss-Prot and Trembl containing 574734 sequences using Sequest (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA). Peptides were counted as valid if in the +2 charge state they had a Xcorr value >2orinthe +3 charge state, an Xcorr >3.5. All peptides also needed a ΔCN value greater than 0.08. One missed cleavage per peptide was tolerated, and peptides could be partially tryptic. Proteins identified by less than two peptides were validated manually.Immunoblotting—All samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on 10% resolving gels according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were loaded for each sample in a single experiment, with 1-10 μg per lane unless otherwise stated. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked with BB (2% nonfat skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), and incubated with primary antibody in BB. After incubation, membranes were washed 3 times in BB and incubated with horseradish peroxidaselabeled secondary antibodies in BB. Proteins were visualized using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate and imaged using a Versadoc 5000 imager (Bio-Rad).Sucrose Gradient Flotation Experiments—LDM (165 μl) obtained from 3T3-L1 adipocytes as described above was mixed with 835 μl of 70% sucrose solution in HES to a final concentration of 60% sucrose (24Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and placed in an 11 × 60-mm centrifuge tube overlaid with 1 ml of 50, 30, and 10% of sucrose and 0.4 ml of 5% sucrose. The sample was then centrifuged for 18 h at 111,132 × g in a Beckman SW61 swing-out rotor. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube by gravitational flow.Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured as described above on glass coverslips. The cells were serum-depleted for 2 h at 37 °C, after which they were incubated in the absence or presence of 200 nm insulin for 20 min. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were washed with PBS, and free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm glycine in PBS. The cells were then processed for immunolabeling by permeabilization and labeling in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 2% bovine serum albumin using standard procedures. Primary antibodies were detected with ALEXA-488 or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. Optical sections were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS SP system. For double labeling, fluorophores were scanned separately and overlaid using Adobe Photoshop software. Images were generated by the maximum projection of a stack sections from the middle of each cell.GLUT4 Recycling Experiments—3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing a control shRNA or the AS160 shRNA and HA-GLUT4 were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin for 20 min. Anti-HA antibody (60 μg/ml) was then added for 10 and 60 min. Subsequently the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with a secondary Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out as described above.Transfection of C2C12 Cells and CHO Cells—C2C12 and CHO cells were transiently transfected with DNA constructs for expression of FLAG-tagged AS160 and the AS160 and control shRNA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's instructions.Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down of FLAG-tagged AS160— FLAG-AS160-expressing CHO cells were lysed in extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min, anti-FLAG antibody and protein G beads were added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with mixing. The beads were then washed extensively and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For GST pull-downs, 100 μg of lysate was incubated with either GST alone or GST-IRAP1-109, GST-IRAP1-58, GST-IRAP1-27, GST-GLUT4466-509, GST-VAMP21-94 coupled to CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed extensively and boiled in sample buffer.Immunoprecipitation of Endogenous AS160 from 3T3-L1 Adipocytes— The LDM fraction from basal or insulin-stimulated cells prepared as described above was resuspended in IP buffer (60 mm β-octylglucoside, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min. An aliquot of the supernatant (200 μg) was incubated with either IgG or anti-AS160 or anti IRAP antibodies coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in IP buffer without β-octylglucoside and twice in PBS and boiled in sample buffer.Retroviral Transfection of shRNA—The shRNA for AS160 was created using standard procedures with the target sequence 5′-TAACGAGGATGCCTTCTAC-3′ as described previously (25Rice R.R. Muirhead A.N. Harrison B.T. Kassianos A.J. Sedlak P.L. Maugeri N.J. Goss P.J. Davey J.R. James D.E. Graham M.W. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 392: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were infected with pBabe-puro-HA-GLUT4 retrovirus as previously described (5Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M. Martin S. Luen T.B. Hong W. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After 24 h cells were subsequently infected using a similar protocol with pBabe-hygro-shRNA-AS160. Doubly infected cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromyocin and 200 μg/ml hygromyocin. The surface HA-GLUT4 was measured in non-permeabilized adipocytes with anti-HA antibody as described previously (26Govers R. Coster A.C.F. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Subsequently the cells were permeabilized and incubated with anti-AS160 antibody. The quantification of fluorescence of single cells infected with retrovirus expressing an shRNA against AS160 and HA-GLUT4 was performed using the Leica confocal software. The confocal images of the different conditions and cells were scanned with exactly the same settings. A region of interest was set around each cell, and the amount of fluorescence per unit area was determined for each channel using the Leica confocal software.RESULTSIdentification of GLUT4 Vesicle-associated Proteins in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To identify proteins that regulate GLUT4 trafficking, we used two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify all of the proteins associated with immuno-isolated GLUT4 vesicles. The immuno-isolation of GLUT4 vesicles was performed using antibodies covalently attached to acrylamide beads (27Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To ensure that we ignored proteins that were isolated non-specifically, we used a subtractive experimental design where we compared the protein composition of eluates from the control IgG versus that obtained with the GLUT4 antibody. Only peptides identified using the GLUT4 antibody and not the control IgG in at least three separate experiments were classified as valid.The consensus of these experiments in 3T3-L1 adipocytes yielded 48 proteins (TABLE ONE), many of which are known to be involved in vesicle trafficking. Details of peptides identified from each protein are given in Supplemental Table 2. The proteins identified fall into five classes; they are previously known GLUT4 vesicle proteins (e.g. sortilin), vesicle transport regulatory proteins (e.g. SNAREs), proteins from the secretory pathway (e.g. cystatin c), recycling membrane proteins (e.g. low density lipoprotein receptor), and proteins with unknown GLUT4 vesicle transport functions (e.g. ubiquitin, V-ATPase). Samples were isolated from basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes to determine whether we could identify additional proteins that associated with GLUT4 vesicles in an insulin-specific manner. However, no additional proteins were identified in samples isolated from insulin-treated cells. We next wanted to determine which of these proteins might play a functional regulatory role in GLUT4 trafficking or indeed determine which proteins may be targeted with GLUT4 into insulin-responsive vesicles. To accomplish this we divided these proteins into integral versus peripheral membrane proteins.TABLE ONESummary of GLUT4 vesicle proteins identified by mass spectrometry from 3T3-L1 adipocytes Proteins shown were the consensus of three separate experiments. -, no significant translocation; +, <2-fold translocation; ++, >2-fold translocation.

Open table in a new tab Characterization of Integral Membrane Proteins Found in GLUT4 Vesicles—It has previously been shown that GLUT4 is found in GSVs, endosomes, and the TGN (28Slot J.W. Geuze H.J.

Therefore, it was not surprising to find a large number of endosomal and TGN-derived proteins in immuno-isolated GLUT4 vesicles. To determine which of these were localized to GSVs, we used two separate criteria. First, we examined insulin-responsive movement to the PM, as this is a distinguishing feature of GSV constituents (31Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we performed co-localization experiments to compare the intracellular distribution of each integral membrane protein with GLUT4.To quantify the insulin-dependent movement of proteins to the PM, we developed a method to isolate highly purified plasma membranes (21Chaney L.K. Jacobson B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 62-72Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).

Paradoxically, under certain circumstances, CDKs such as cyclin E-cdk2 are also required to promote licensing. Here, we show that CDK phosphorylation of the essential licensing factor Cdc6 stabilizes it by preventing its association with the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). APC/C-dependent Cdc6 proteolysis prevents pre-RC assembly in quiescent cells and, when cells reenter the cell cycle from quiescence, CDK-dependent Cdc6 stabilization allows Cdc6 to accumulate before the licensing inhibitors geminin and cyclin A which are also APC/C substrates. This novel mechanism for regulating protein stability establishes a window of time prior to S phase when pre-RCs can assemble which we propose represents a critical function of cyclin E.

This novel mechanism for regulating protein stability establishes a window of time prior to S phase when pre-RCs can assemble which we propose represents a critical function of cyclin E. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells initiates from large numbers of replication origins distributed on multiple chromosomes. A two-step mechanism regulates the initiation of DNA replication, ensuring that the entire genome is precisely duplicated in each cell cycle (Bell and Dutta, 2002Bell S.P. Dutta A. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, Blow and Dutta, 2005Blow J.J. Dutta A.

Regulation of early events in chromosome replication.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the first step, Cdc6 and Cdt1 collaborate with the origin recognition complex (ORC) to load the putative replicative helicase (Mcm2-7) into pre-RCs at replication origins. In the second step, two protein kinases, Cdc7 and the S phase CDKs, convert pre-RCs into bidirectional replisomes at each origin. DNA replication is limited to once per cell cycle because these two steps are temporally segregated: pre-RC assembly can only occur from late mitosis through G1 phase, and once cells enter S phase, pre-RCs can no longer assemble. Thus, origins that have fired once cannot be relicensed until they pass through the following mitosis. In budding yeast, CDKs directly prevent pre-RC assembly by inhibiting the function of all of the pre-RC components thus limiting pre-RC assembly to G1 phase (Diffley, 2004Diffley J.F.X. Regulation of early events in chromosome replication.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (325) Google Scholar). CDKs appear to play a similar role in metazoans: inactivation of the mitotic CDK, cdc2, causes endoreduplication (Itzhaki et al., 1997Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C. Construction by gene targeting in human cells of a “conditional” CDC2 mutant that rereplicates its DNA.Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and treatment of postreplicative cells with a CDK inhibitor induces relicensing (Ballabeni et al., 2004Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K.

Protein kinase inhibition in G2 causes mammalian Mcm proteins to reassociate with chromatin and restores ability to replicate.Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 63-69Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, metazoans also contain an additional licensing inhibitor called geminin (Blow and Dutta, 2005Blow J.J. Dutta A. Preventing re-replication of chromosomal DNA.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, McGarry and Kirschner, 1998McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Geminin, an inhibitor of DNA replication, is degraded during mitosis.Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In human cells, geminin is targeted for proteolysis by the APC/C E3 ubiquitin ligase (McGarry and Kirschner, 1998McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Geminin, an inhibitor of DNA replication, is degraded during mitosis.Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), ensuring that the licensing inhibitors geminin and cyclin A are degraded from late mitosis through G1 phase, allowing pre-RCs to assemble during this period. In addition to targeting licensing inhibitors for proteolysis, the APC/C also targets the essential pre-RC assembly factor, Cdc6, for proteolysis (Petersen et al., 2000Petersen B.O. Wagener C. Marinoni F. Kramer E.R. Melixetian M. Denchi E.L. Gieffers C. Matteucci C. Peters J.M. Helin K. Cell cycle- and cell growth-regulated proteolysis of mammalian CDC6 is dependent on APC-CDH1.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2330-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Coregulation of licensing inhibitors and activators, however, would make it impossible for cells to achieve a state where pre-RC components are all present but licensing inhibitors are absent. Cyclin E can either promote or inhibit pre-RC assembly, depending on context (see Diffley, 2004Diffley J.F.X. Regulation of early events in chromosome replication.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (325) Google Scholar for discussion). Here we show that CDKs, including those containing cyclin E, promote licensing by phosphorylating a regulatory domain of Cdc6, thus preventing its degradation by the APC/C. This allows Cdc6 to accumulate before the licensing inhibitors geminin and cyclin A when quiescent cells re-enter the cell cycle. We propose a simple model to explain the positive role of cyclin E in licensing and discuss how context might also allow cyclin E to be a licensing inhibitor. We noticed that levels of endogenous Cdc6 protein in human tissue culture cells were significantly reduced very quickly after treatment with the CDK inhibitor, roscovitine. Other APC/C substrates including geminin, cyclin A, and cyclin B were unaffected by roscovitine during the same time interval. At the concentrations used, roscovitine should primarily inhibit CDKs (Meijer et al., 1997Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Biochemical and cellular effects of roscovitine, a potent and selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases cdc2, cdk2 and cdk5.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Figure 1B shows that the levels of endogenous Cdc6 were also dramatically reduced after cdk2 levels were reduced using siRNA. The effects of roscovitine on Cdc6 are seen after just 2 hr (Figure 1A), before any significant alteration in cell cycle distribution can occur, and depletion of cdk2 by siRNA did not affect the distribution of cells in the cell cycle (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). To determine whether the reduction in Cdc6 levels is due to changes in protein stability, we examined the rate of Cdc6 disappearance after addition of cycloheximide (CHX) to prevent new Cdc6 synthesis. Endogenous Cdc6 was relatively unstable, with a half-life of approximately 1 hr based on initial rates of disappearance, and became even more unstable after roscovitine treatment, with a half-life significantly less than 1 hr (Figure 1C). A similar decrease in half-life was seen after depletion of either cyclins E1 and E2 or cdk2 (Figure S1B). These experiments indicate that CDK inhibition reduces Cdc6 protein levels at least in part by destabilizing the Cdc6 protein. Overexpression of cyclin E (Figure 1D) or cyclin A (Figure S3A) caused an increase in levels of cotransfected Cdc6 tagged with the HA epitope (HA-Cdc6). This accumulation of Cdc6 was blocked by roscovitine, suggesting that CDK catalytic activity is required for Cdc6 accumulation (Figure 1D). Cyclin E overexpression dramatically stabilized HA-Cdc6, increasing its half-life to far greater than 3 hr (Figure 1E). Because transfected Cdc6 can be regulated differently from the endogenous Cdc6 (Alexandrow and Hamlin, 2004Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. Cdc6 chromatin affinity is unaffected by serine-54 phosphorylation, S-phase progression, and overexpression of cyclin A.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1614-1627Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we cotransfected cells with a cell-surface marker (CD20) which allowed us to specifically purify transfected cells. In these purified cells, endogenous Cdc6 levels were significantly increased after cotransfection with myc-cyclin E (Figure 1F). This effect was enhanced by cotransfection of myc-cyclin E with HA-cdk2. Figure S1A shows that overproduction of cyclin E had little or no effect on cell cycle distribution. As with the roscovitine treatment, myc-cyclin E with or without HA-cdk2 had no effect on levels of other APC/C substrates such as cyclin A or cyclin B (Figure 1F). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the stability of both endogenous and transfected Cdc6 is regulated by cyclin E-cdk2. Stabilization could be due to direct phosphorylation of Cdc6 or to some indirect effect of CDKs. Eukaryotic Cdc6 proteins contain a regulatory N-terminal domain (NTD) that is not directly involved in pre-RC assembly (Drury et al., 1997Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F. The Cdc4/34/53 pathway targets Cdc6p for proteolysis in budding yeast.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cdc6 is a good substrate for cyclin E-, A-, and B-associated CDKs (Herbig et al., 2000Herbig U. Griffith J.W. Fanning E. Mutation of cyclin/cdk phosphorylation sites in HsCdc6 disrupts a late step in initiation of DNA replication in human cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4117-4130Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and indicated in boxes in Figure 2A are three serine residues known to be phosphorylated by CDKs in human cells (Jiang et al., 1999Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Multistep regulation of DNA regulation by Cdk phosphorylation of HsCdc6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 1999Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. Phosphorylation of mammalian CDC6 by Cyclin A/CDK2 regulates its subcellular localization.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Two of these lie in close proximity to conserved APC/C destruction boxes (gray; Petersen et al., 2000Petersen B.O. Wagener C. Marinoni F. Kramer E.R. Melixetian M. Denchi E.L. Gieffers C. Matteucci C. Peters J.M. Helin K. Cell cycle- and cell growth-regulated proteolysis of mammalian CDC6 is dependent on APC-CDH1.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2330-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The first (serine 54) is next to an RXXL-type destruction box while the second (serine 74) is near a KEN-type destruction box. The RXXL motif is found in all of the vertebrate Cdc6 sequences, while the KEN box is present in all of the vertebrate Cdc6 sequences except XlCdc6a, an isoform of Cdc6 specific for early Xenopus embryos (Tikhmyanova and Coleman, 2003Tikhmyanova N. Coleman T.R. Isoform switching of Cdc6 contributes to developmental cell cycle remodeling.Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 362-375Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Xenopus embryos also lack Cdh1 (Littlepage and Ruderman, 2002Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Identification of a new APC/C recognition domain, the A box, which is required for the Cdh1-dependent destruction of the kinase Aurora-A during mitotic exit.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2274-2285Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which is involved in recognizing the KEN box (Pfleger et al., 2001Pfleger C.M. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Substrate recognition by the Cdc20 and Cdh1 components of the anaphase-promoting complex.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2396-2407Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). There are several other potential CDK sites (bold) and an RXL or Cy motif (underlined) which acts as a docking site for cyclins (Figure 2A). We examined the effects of modulating CDK activity on mutant Cdc6 proteins. Overexpression of myc-cyclin E increased the levels of both HA-Cdc6 and endogenous Cdc6 but did not affect the levels of HA-Cdc6ΔNT (Figure 2B), a version of Cdc6 lacking the entire NTD, indicating that the NTD is required for CDKs to modulate Cdc6 stability. We constructed mutant versions of Cdc6 in which the three known CDK-phosphorylated serines were replaced with either alanine (AAA) to mimic the unphosphorylated state or aspartic acid (DDD) to mimic the phosphorylated state. Expression of these mutant proteins had no effect on the distribution of cells in the cell cycle (Figure S2). The DDD mutant was expressed at levels higher than the wild-type protein, while the AAA mutant was expressed at levels lower than the wild-type protein (Figure 2C). The DDD mutant was significantly more stable than the wild-type protein after CHX addition (Figure 2D). Moreover, the levels of both wild-type HA-Cdc6 and endogenous Cdc6 but not the DDD mutant were sensitive to roscovitine treatment (Figure 2E). The unphosphorylatable AAA mutant was destabilized even further, probably because roscovitine activates the APC/C (Listovsky et al., 2000Listovsky T. Zor A. Laronne A. Brandeis M. Cdk1 is essential for mammalian cyclosome/APC regulation.Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 184-191Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, Figure 2F shows that, in contrast to wild-type Cdc6, both the AAA and DDD mutants were unaffected by cyclin E overexpression together, indicating that cyclin E regulates the stability of Cdc6 by direct phosphorylation. CDK phosphorylation sites of the NTD have been previously implicated in causing relocalization of transfected (but not endogenous) Cdc6 protein to the cytoplasm (Alexandrow and Hamlin, 2004Alexandrow M.G. Hamlin J.L. Cdc6 chromatin affinity is unaffected by serine-54 phosphorylation, S-phase progression, and overexpression of cyclin A.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1614-1627Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Jiang et al., 1999Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Multistep regulation of DNA regulation by Cdk phosphorylation of HsCdc6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 1999Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. Phosphorylation of mammalian CDC6 by Cyclin A/CDK2 regulates its subcellular localization.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Although our experiments clearly show that the stability of the endogenous as well as transfected Cdc6 is regulated by CDKs, we wanted to address the possibility that altered subcellular localization might contribute to stabilization of the transfected proteins. Addition of a cassette containing three constitutive nuclear localization sequences (3X-NLS) to the DDD mutant caused it to reside almost entirely in the nucleus. Under these conditions, the Cdc6 DDD protein was still extremely stable (Figure S3). Thus, the effects of CDKs on Cdc6 stability are independent from the effects of CDKs on subcellular localization. Cdc6 has previously been shown to be a substrate for the APC/C (Petersen et al., 2000Petersen B.O. Wagener C. Marinoni F. Kramer E.R. Melixetian M. Denchi E.L. Gieffers C. Matteucci C. Peters J.M. Helin K. Cell cycle- and cell growth-regulated proteolysis of mammalian CDC6 is dependent on APC-CDH1.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2330-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Transfected wild-type and AAA HA-Cdc6 as well as endogenous Cdc6 accumulated to higher levels after treatment with MG132 (Figure 3A ), while the DDD mutant was unaffected by MG132 treatment, indicating that the differences in the stability of the Cdc6 mutants are mediated by the proteasome. Overexpression of the APC/C activator Cdh1 is sufficient to activate the APC/C irrespective of cell cycle position and destabilizes wild-type Cdc6 (Petersen et al., 2000Petersen B.O. Wagener C.

To examine this in more detail, the HA-Cdc6 constructs were cotransfected with tetracycline-inducible myc-Cdh1 constructs. Transfections were adjusted so the initial levels of mutant proteins were similar. After accumulation of the HA-Cdc6 proteins, doxycycline was added to induce myc-Cdh1. This induced rapid degradation of wild-type and the AAA mutant but not the DDD mutant, which remained at high levels after Cdh1 induction (Figure 3C). Even when targeted to the nucleus with the 3XNLS cassette, the DDD mutant was resistant to Cdh1-dependent degradation (Figure S3H). Conversely, reduction of Cdh1 by siRNA significantly stabilized wild-type HA-Cdc6 but had no effect on the already stabilized DDD mutant (Figure 3D). Figure 4A shows that polyubiquitylated forms of the wild-type but not DDD Cdc6 were detected following expression of Cdh1 and His-tagged ubiquitin, indicating that, in contrast to the wild-type protein, the DDD mutant is not polyubiquitylated in vivo. Thus, the wild-type and AAA mutant are APC/C targets, but the DDD mutant is resistant to APC/C -mediated degradation.Figure 4CDK Phosphorylation of Cdc6 Interferes with Its Recognition by APC/CCdh1Show full caption(A) Selective ubiquitination of wt Cdc6 in response to reactivated APC/CCdh1.

Kirschner M.W. Autonomous regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex couples mitosis to S-phase entry.Nature. 2004; 432: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Wild-type Cdc6 was rapidly degraded in these extracts whereas the DDD mutant as well as a construct in which the Cdc6 destruction box was mutated (ΔDB) were considerably stabilized (Figure 4B), indicating that the DDD mutant is resistant to APC/C-dependent proteolysis in vitro. We used affinity-purified APC/C from quiescent cells in a cell-free system (Kramer et al., 2000Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.M. Mitotic regulation of the APC activator proteins CDC20 and CDH1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1555-1569Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar) to examine polyubiquitylation of biotinylated peptides spanning the destruction boxes in Cdc6. Polyubiquitylated forms of the Cdc6 peptide could be readily detected when incubated in the presence of the complete system, and this was greatly reduced when the E2 enzyme (UbcH10) was omitted from the reaction (Figure 4C). However, when the Cdc6 peptide was phosphorylated on Ser54 and Ser74, it was not polyubiquitylated in parallel reactions. Together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of the Cdc6 NTD by CDKs prevents its proteolysis by preventing APC/C-dependent polyubiquitylation. Finally, Cdh1 could be detected in HA immunoprecipitates with either wild-type or AAA HA-Cdc6 but not DDD HA-Cdc6 (Figure 4D). Cdh1 coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type but not AAA HA-Cdc6 always appears as a doublet. The reason for this is currently unknown. We propose the inability of DDD Cdc6 to interact with APC/C accounts for its resistance to APC/C-mediated proteolysis. As shown above, APC/C-dependent proteolysis of Cdc6 is modulated by CDK phosphorylation of the Cdc6 NTD. In trying to understand why this elaborate regulatory mechanism exists, we were struck by the finding that cyclin E plays a positive, essential role in licensing specifically when quiescent cells reenter the cell cycle (Geng et al., 2003Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Schneider J.E. Bhattacharya S. Rideout W.M. Bronson R.T. Gardner H. Sicinski P. Cyclin E ablation in the mouse.Cell. 2003; 114: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and that cyclin E cooperates with Cdc6 to stimulate licensing in vitro (Coverley et al., 2002Coverley D. Laman H. Laskey R.A. Distinct roles for cyclins E and A during DNA replication complex assembly and activation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We considered that phosphorylation of the Cdc6 NTD by cyclin E-cdk2 might promote Cdc6 stabilization prior to the inactivation of the APC/C by cyclin A (Sorensen et al., 2000Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Kramer E.R. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nonperiodic activity of the human anaphase-promoting complex-Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase results in continuous DNA synthesis uncoupled from mitosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7613-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This would ensure that, in cells reentering the cell cycle, Cdc6 would accumulate before the licensing inhibitors geminin and cyclin A. To assess the feasibility of this idea, we examined the reaccumulation of endogenous proteins after serum-starved cells were stimulated to reenter the cell cycle. Cdc6 as well as Cdt1, geminin, Cdc20, and cyclin A were absent after serum starvation (t = 0, Figure 5A ). Endogenous Cdc6 and Cdt1 both appeared approximately 10 hr after serum addition, coincident with the loading of Mcm6 onto chromatin. This was 3–4 hr earlier than the appearance of other APC/C substrates, geminin, cyclin A, and Cdc20, consistent with the hypothesis. Two predictions of this model are that Cdc6 appearance should coincide with appearance of cyclin E kinase activity and that Cdc6 should be quantitatively phosphorylated in the NTD. To test the first prediction, cyclin E and cyclin A immunoprecipitates made from extracts of cells released from quiescence for various times were assayed for histone H1 kinase activity. Although cyclin E protein was present in the serum-starved cells, there was little or no associated H1 kinase activity (Figure 5B), perhaps due to the presence of CDK inhibitors. Cyclin E-associated histone H1 kinase activity first appeared approximately 10 hr after serum stimulation, coinciding with the appearance of Cdc6 protein and preceding the appearance of cyclin A-associated kinase activity by 4 hr. Using a phospho-specific antibody, Figure 5B shows that as soon as Cdc6 appears, phospho-ser54 could be detected. Treatment of extracts with λ phosphatase completely eliminated recognition of endogenous and HA-Cdc6 by the phospho-specific antibody (but not anti-Cdc6 antibody) in both immunoblots and immunoprecipitations (Figure 5C). Figure 5D shows that this phospho-specific antibody can quantitatively deplete Cdc6 from extracts from either exponentially growing cells or serum-starved cells which had been serum stimulated for 10 hr (when Cdc6 first appears). Thus, upon reentry into the cell cycle, Cdc6 accumulates with cyclin E-associated kinase activity and is quantitatively phosphorylated on at least one of the residues implicated in its stabilization. Figure 5E shows that constitutively expressed wild-type HA-Cdc6 accumulates approximately 10 hr after serum stimulation, coincident with the endogenous Cdc6 but before cyclin A (Figure 5E). Accumulation of the AAA mutant was delayed 2–4 hr relative to the endogenous protein and paralleled the appearance of cyclin A, while the DDD mutant accumulated several hours earlier than the endogenous protein. These experiments, taken with previous results, support the idea that Cdc6 is stabilized by cyclin E-cdk2 phosphorylation before other APC/C targets can accumulate upon cell cycle reentry. To determine whether this mechanism can contribute to the ability of Cdc6 to support licensing, we needed to develop licensing assays that would allow us to examine the functionality of Cdc6 mutants in the absence of endogenous Cdc6. We utilized the fact that quiescent T98G cells lack both Cdc6 and Cdt1. Figure 6A shows that wild-type and AAA mutant HA-Cdc6 were unable to accumulate in quiescent cells, while the DDD mutant (as well as the Cdc6 destruction box mutant, ΔDB—Figure 6B) accumulated to high levels, consistent with the idea that the DDD mutant is resistant to APC/C-dependent proteolysis. Wild-type Cdt1 can readily accumulate in quiescent cells (Figure 6C), and overproduction of Cdh1 does not affect Cdt1 levels (Figure S4), indicating that Cdt1 is not an APC/C substrate. The DDD mutant but not wild-type HA-Cdc6 promoted the loading of Mcm6 onto chromatin in quiescent cells when coexpressed with Cdt1 (Figure 6C). Coexpression of Cdt1 was required for this loading in G0 cells (Figure 6D). Our results contrast slightly with previously published work showing that expression of wild-type Cdc6 from an adenovirus expression vector promoted Cdc6 accumulation and Mcm2-7 loading in quiescent cells (Cook et al., 2002Cook J.G. Park C.H. Burke T.W. Leone G. DeGregori J. Engel A. Nevins J.R. Analysis of Cdc6 function in the assembly of mammalian prereplication complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The difference between our results is likely due to higher expression levels from the adenovirus vector. To extend our findings, we serum-stimulated quiescent cells in the presence of roscovitine, which prevents the accumulation of endogenous Cdc6 and Cdt1, presumably in pa"

We cloned ACE from human neuroblastoma cells and showed that it had posttranslational processing and enzymatic activity typical of the endogenous protease. Cellular expression of ACE promoted degradation of naturally secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42, leading to significant clearance of both species. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that both active sites within ACE contribute to Aβ clearance, and an ACE construct bearing mutations in each catalytic domain had no effect on Aβ levels. Pharmacological inhibition of ACE with a widely prescribed drug, captopril, promoted the accumulation of cell-derived Aβ in the media of β-amyloid precursor-protein expressing cells. Together, these results show that ACE can lower the levels of secreted Aβ in living cells and that this effect is blocked by inhibiting the protease's activity with an ACE inhibitor. This work, combined with the genetic studies, supports the hypothesis that ACE may modulate the susceptibility to and progression of AD via degradation of Aβ.

Although no proven disease-modifying treatments are currently available, recent efforts to treat AD have focused on both decreasing the production of Aβ and enhancing its clearance from the brain.

The serine protease plasmin has been implicated in Aβ degradation in vitro (8Tucker H.M. Kihiko M. Caldwell J.N. Wright S. Kawarabayashi T. Price D. Walker D. Scheff S. McGillis J.P. Rydel R.E.

Supporting a role for therapeutic regulation of Aβ-degrading proteases, the overexpression of IDE or NEP in a murine model of AD decreased cerebral Aβ levels and produced significant attenuation of Aβ-associated neuropathology (10Leissring M.A. Farris W.

Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACE has a single transmembrane domain and is cleaved from the cell surface at a low rate, resulting in the secretion of its ectodomain into the media of cultured cells and plasma (12Beldent V. Michaud A. Wei L. Chauvet M.T. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26428-26434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Balyasnikova I.V. Karran E.H. Albrecht II, R.F. Danilov S.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACE has been intensively characterized for its role in the regulation of blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin (14Coates D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This function of ACE is modulated pharmacologically by ACE inhibitors, which bind competitively to the active site zinc to prevent substrate hydrolysis. This commonly prescribed class of drugs is used for the treatment of hypertension and other disorders. In addition to regulating vasoactive peptides, ACE shows a broad substrate specificity, including several neuropeptides, and it is able to metabolize substrates using both exopeptidase and endopeptidase activities (15Skidgel R.A. Erdos E.G. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. A. 1987; 9: 243-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite their homology, the N- and C-domains display differential capacity to degrade some substrates and can be inhibited selectively by certain ACE inhibitors (16Michaud A. Williams T.A. Chauvet M.T. Corvol P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Wei L. Clauser E. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13398-13405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, ACE was found to participate in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signal transduction pathway, apparently independently of its proteolytic function (18Kohlstedt K. Brandes R.P. Muller-Esterl W. Busse R. Fleming I. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).A potential relationship between ACE and AD was first suggested by human genetic studies, which reported that an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism within intron 16 of the ACE gene associates with AD (19Kehoe P.G. Russ C. McIlory S. Williams H. Holmans P. Holmes C. Liolitsa D. Vahidassr D. Powell J. McGleenon B. Liddell M. Plomin R. Dynan K. Williams N. Neal J. Cairns N.J. Wilcock G. Passmore P. Lovestone S. Williams J. Owen M.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 71-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Specifically, the I allele was associated with an increased risk for AD, whereas the D allele was associated with protection (20Elkins J.S. Douglas V.C. Johnston S.C. Neurology. 2004; 62: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Lehmann D.J. Cortina-Borja M. Warden D.R. Smith A.D. Sleegers K. Prince J.A. van Duijn C.M. Kehoe P.G. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2005; 162: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Of potential mechanistic relevance, inheritance of the D allele has been associated with increased plasma ACE levels (22Rigat B. Hubert C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (3504) Google Scholar). Regarding disease specificity, the I allele has been found to associate positively with AD but not with vascular dementia or vascular pathology (23Kolsch H. Jessen F. Freymann N. Kreis M. Hentschel F. Maier W. Heun R. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 377: 37-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Sleegers K. den Heijer T. van Dijk E.J. Hofman A. Bertoli-Avella A.M. Koudstaal P.J. Breteler M.M. van Duijn C.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The I/I genotype has also been linked to smaller volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala (24Sleegers K. den Heijer T. van Dijk E.J. Hofman A. Bertoli-Avella A.M. Koudstaal P.J. Breteler M.M. van Duijn C.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Importantly, post-mortem analyses of AD patients determined that those with the I/I genotype had a trend toward increased brain Aβ42 load compared with the D/D genotype (25Lendon C.L. Thaker U. Harris J.M. McDonagh A.M. Lambert J.C. Chartier-Harlin M.C. Iwatsubo T. Pickering-Brown S.M. Mann D.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 328: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ACE gene have also been shown to associate with AD, and there is a decrease in the prevalence of the AD-susceptible genotype with increased age, consistent with a modulation of longevity (26Katzov H. Bennet A.M. Kehoe P. Wiman B. Gatz M. Blennow K. Lenhard B. Pedersen N.L. de Faire U. Prince J.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2647-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Post-mortem studies of patients with AD have found elevated levels of ACE in the temporal cortex and specifically within pyramidal cortical neurons (27Savaskan E. Hock C. Olivieri G. Bruttel S. Rosenberg C. Hulette C. Muller-Spahn F. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 28Barnes N.M. Cheng C.H. Costall B. Naylor R.J. Williams T.J. Wischik C.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 200: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as well as significantly increased ACE activity in the medial hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, frontal cortex, and caudate nucleus (29Arregui A. Perry E.K. Rossor M. Tomlinson B.E. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1490-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A mechanistic link between ACE and AD was suggested when affinity-purified ACE was shown to degrade synthetic Aβ-(1-40) between the Asp7-Ser8 bond in vitro, producing a truncated 33-residue peptide that exhibited decreased aggregation and cytotoxic potential (30Hu J. Igarashi A. Kamata M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47863-47868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).A plausible interpretation of the above genetic, neuropathological, and biochemical findings is that ACE is implicated in AD via direct proteolysis of the Aβ peptide, modulating Aβ levels within the brain. This hypothesis suggests that reduced ACE activity, either by genetic mechanisms or chronic pharmacological inhibition, could increase cerebral levels of Aβ40 and/or Aβ42 and thus presumably increase the risk of developing AD and/or contribute to its progression. To address this hypothesis in intact, living cells, we cloned and characterized human neural ACE and determined its role in the clearance of secreted Aβ.We demonstrate that ACE promotes the clearance of naturally produced Aβ40 and Aβ42 and leads to secondary degradation of both Aβ species. Further, by using site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the full-length enzyme, we show that both the N- and C-domains of ACE are capable of promoting Aβ degradation with similar capacity. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of Aβ-secreting cells with a commonly prescribed ACE inhibitor prevents ACE-mediated Aβ clearance and results in accumulation of the Aβ peptide.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of ACE and Creation of Active Site Mutants—The 4.0-kb ACE cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of RNA isolated from the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. 5′- and 3′-end primers used to amplify the sequence were (5′-GGAAGCTTGCCGAGCACCGCGCACCGC-3′) and (5′-CAGTGTTCCCATCCCAGTCT-3′), respectively. This coding region contains the full-length ACE protein, including signal peptide, N- and C-catalytic domains, transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic C terminus (Fig. 1B). The neurally derived ACE cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing to be identical to the reported human ACE cDNA sequence. The full-length ACE cDNA was used as the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to generate the catalytically inactive ACE constructs. The two ACE zinc metalloprotease active site glutamates (amino acids 362 in the C-domain and 960 in the N-domain) were changed to aspartates using the following primers: for E362D, 5′-CCACAGTGCACCATGACATGGGCCATATACAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGTATATGGCCCATGTCATGGTGCACTGTGG-3′ (reverse); for E960D, 5′-GGCCCACCACGACATGGGCCACATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGTGGCCCATGTCGTGGTGGGCC-3′ (reverse). Mutant constructs were cloned into pcDNA5/FRT and screened by DNA sequencing to ensure that no other mutations had occurred. Four constructs were thus generated: the N-domain mutant, the C-domain mutant, the combined N- and C-domain mutant, and the wild-type enzyme. All expression plasmids were characterized by both restriction digestion and DNA sequencing of the entire ACE cDNA. The HA-tagged IDE construct in the pcDNA5/FRT vector has been previously described (31Leissring M.A. Farris W. Wu X. Christodoulou D.C. Haigis M.C. Guarente L. Selkoe D.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293 cells stably expressing APP695 bearing the K595N/M596L (“Swedish”) AD-causing mutation (32Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar) were selected in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. CHO cells stably transfected with APP751 with the V717F AD-causing mutation and a pFRT/lacZeo construct enabling Flp-In™ (Invitrogen) competence were grown in 200 μg/ml G418 and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. Once successful genomic recombination of pcDNA5/FRT constructs occurred, the Flp-In host cells lost Zeocin resistance and were selected with 350 μg/ml hygromycin B. Effects of Capoten (captopril; Sigma) were assayed by a 24-h preincubation of cells with the drug, followed by an 18-h conditioning period in which cells were grown in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with captopril.Expression of Cloned Constructs in CHO and HEK293 Cells—Transient transfections in CHO and HEK293 cell lines were performed using GenePorter 2 (GTS), and expression was assayed 24-42 h posttransfection. CHO cell lines stably expressing APP751 with the V717F mutation and either empty vector, ACE, or mutant ACE constructs were generated using the Flp-In™ system (Invitrogen). This allowed stable integration of each construct into the same genomic locus of a single cell line.Immunoblotting—Cells and tissue were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 5 mm EDTA, and the extracts were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid-based assay (Pierce). Samples were then subject to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. ACE was detected using a polyclonal antibody raised to amino acids 1-170 of human ACE (sc-20791; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Full-length human APP was detected using 8E5, reactive to APP-(444-592) of APP695 (gift of P. Seubert). APP C99 and C83 C-terminal fragments were detected using the polyclonal antibody C9, specific for residues 676-695 of APP695. Total cellular IDE was detected using the polyclonal IDE-1 raised to amino acids 62-73 of human IDE (33Vekrellis K. Ye Z. Qiu W.Q. Walsh D. Hartley D. Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HA-tagged IDE was detected using the anti-HA monoclonal 3F10 (Roche Applied Science). Deglycosylation was performed using peptide: N-glycosidase F to remove N-linked sugars and a mixture of the O-deglycosylating enzymes sialidase A, O-glycanase, β(1-4)-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Prozyme). Western blots were probed with anti-mouse, anti-rat, or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or IRdye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals). Blots were detected, and bands were sized and quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR).ACE Activity Assay—ACE proteolytic activity was assayed using the substrate hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine (Hip-His-Leu; Sigma) as described previously (34Santos R.A. Krieger E.M. Greene L.J. Hypertension. 1985; 7: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), with several modifications. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and nuclei and cell debris was pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min. To assay ACE activity, 2.5 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 1 mm Hip-His-Leu in 0.4 m sodium borate buffer (pH 8.3) with 0.3 m NaCl in a total volume of 35 μl for 5-60 min at 37 °C. When assaying samples with captopril, a 15-min preincubation with the drug was performed at 4 °C before substrate addition. Time 0 values were calculated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm prior to the addition of Hip-His-Leu. Enzymatic reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA (10 mm final concentration). Samples were developed first by the addition of 150 μl of 0.34 m NaOH, followed by a 10-min room temperature incubation with 20 μl of 20 mg/ml o-phthaldialdehyde (Sigma). This reaction was terminated by acidification with 50 μl of 3 n HCl. Fluorescence of liberated and o-phthaldialdehyde-modified His-Leu was assayed in a 96-well plate format using a Victor2 multilabel plate reader (excitation, 355; emission, 535) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 100% degradation was defined as the maximal fluorescence signal achieved by digestion of 1 mm Hip-His-Leu with 2.5 μg of ACE-transfected cell lysate for 60 min.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbant Assay—Conditioned medium samples were harvested by removing cellular debris by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min, and protease inhibitors were added (final concentration of 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 5 mm EDTA). ELISAs for Aβ were performed as previously described (35Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. 96-Well ELISA plates (Costar) were coated with 3.5 μg/ml of the capture antibody. Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) were measured by capturing with antibodies specific to the Aβ C-terminal 40 (2G3) or 42 (21F12) residues. Captured Aβ was detected with 0.1 μg/ml biotinylated 3D6, specific to residues 1-5 of the Aβ N terminus. ELISAs measuring X-40 or X-42 forms of Aβ were captured identically with 2G3 or 21F12 and detected with 0.1 μg/ml biotinylated 266, specific to residues 13-28 of Aβ. Total Aβ was measured by capture with antibody 266 and detection with 0.1 μg/ml biotinylated 3D6 (all antibodies gift of Elan Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA). ELISA development was accomplished by incubating the Aβ-bound biotinylated detection antibody with Avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector), followed by tetramethylbenzidine-ELISA (Pierce). Plates were washed three times for 1 min after each incubation with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20.Statistical Analyses—The data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc comparison or a two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc comparison, where appropriate. Calculated comparisons of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSExpression and Characterization of Transfected Human ACE—To determine the regional distribution of ACE within the brain, we first dissected several murine brain and peripheral tissues to assess relative ACE content, particularly in AD-relevant brain regions. As previously reported, we found that ACE was highly expressed in kidney and lung but absent in the liver (36Fuchs S. Xiao H.D. Cole J.M. Adams J.W. Frenzel K. Michaud A. Zhao H. Keshelava G. Capecchi M.R. Corvol P. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15946-15953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the brain, we observed similar expression of ACE protein in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia/brainstem (Fig. 1A). ACE in each of these brain regions was found to electrophorese as two distinct bands, consisting of the typical full-length ∼180-kDa species and a higher molecular weight species, the latter reported to arise from alternative glycosylation of ACE in the brain (37Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).To characterize ACE at a cellular level, we cloned the full-length 4.0-kb cDNA from the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. ACE cDNA was then cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA5/FRT and shown to conform to the reported human ACE sequence by both restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of the ACE construct into CHO and HEK293 cells yielded indistinguishable results in all assays performed (Fig. 2). Neither cell line expressed detectable endogenous levels of ACE protein by Western blotting, although ACE mRNA was detected in HEK293 cells by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown).FIGURE 2Characterization of the processing and enzymatic activity of cloned human ACE. A, lysates from mouse kidney or CHO cells transiently transfected with the ACE cDNA construct were subjected to deglycosylation with enzymes specific to N- or O-linked sugars and subject to Western blot analysis with an ACE-specific antibody. The asterisk indicates the calculated molecular weight of the deglycosylated band. B, conditioned medium from CHO cells transiently transfected with ACE or empty vector was concentrated and analyzed by Western blot, reflecting a low rate of ACE ectodomain secretion (sACE), as previously reported (12Beldent V. Michaud A. Wei L. Chauvet M.T. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26428-26434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C, ACE enzymatic activity was measured by incubating 2.5 μg of lysate from HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated constructs with 1 mm of the substrate Hip-His-Leu for 30 min at 37 °C. 100% degradation was defined as the maximal fluorescence produced by 60 min of substrate incubation with 2.5 μg of lysate from cells transfected with the ACE cDNA. Values in C represent the means ± S.E. obtained from four independent experiments. Each blot in A and B is representative of at least four independent experiments. Deglycosylation, secretion, and enzymatic activity assays were identical for transfected CHO and HEK293 cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ACE is predicted to contain 17 N-type glycosylation sites and no O-type glycosylation sites. To determine whether transfected ACE protein was processed similarly to tissue-derived ACE, we compared glycosylation patterns of mouse kidney tissue ACE and ACE transfected into either CHO or HEK293 cells. As expected, deglycosylation with several enzymes specific to O-linked sugars produced no shift in ACE size, whereas removal of N-linked modifications yielded a shift in the ACE protein from ∼182 to ∼154 kDa (Fig. 2A). ACE is known to be secreted both in vivo and in vitro from the cell surface at low levels in an α-secretase-dependent manner (38Woodman Z.L. Oppong S.Y. Cook S. Hooper N.M. Schwager S.L. Brandt W.F. Ehlers M.R. Sturrock E.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The concentration of conditioned medium from HEK293 and CHO cells transiently transfected with ACE cDNA was found to contain low levels of ACE protein, whereas control cells transfected with the empty vector had no corresponding signal (Fig. 2B).To determine whether the transfected ACE was enzymatically active, we incubated lysates from cells transiently transfected with ACE or empty vector with the commonly used synthetic ACE substrate, Hip-His-Leu, under standard assay conditions (1 mm substrate, 2.5 μg of cell lysate, 0.4 m sodium borate buffer, and 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.3) for 30 min at 37 °C. Lysates from cells transfected with ACE exhibited robust degradation of Hip-His-Leu, and this was completely blocked by a 1 μm concentration of the competitive ACE inhibitor, captopril. In contrast, lysates from cells transfected with empty vector had no detectable ACE activity (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that the cloned and transfected ACE construct is processed similarly to tissue ACE and retains proteolytic activity and sensitivity to ACE inhibitors.Transiently Expressed ACE Promotes Clearance and Secondary Degradation of Aβ—To determine whether ACE can modulate Aβ levels in intact, living cells, we transiently transfected equal DNA amounts of plasmids encoding either empty vector, IDE, or ACE in pcDNA5/FRT into HEK293 cells stably expressing human APP695 bearing the Swedish AD-causing mutation and measured the levels of Aβ in the resulting conditioned medium. Transfection of HA-tagged IDE served as a positive control for Aβ proteolysis, since this has been shown to lower Aβ in cultured cells (6Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Selkoe D.J. Guenette S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 39Farris W. Leissring M.A. Hemming M.L. Chang A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6513-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using an ELISA specific to Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42), IDE was found to reduce cell-derived Aβ levels to 55 and 47%, respectively, of those in control cells transfected with empty vector (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Transfections with ACE yielded similar results, reducing Aβ-(1-42) levels to 70% and Aβ-(1-42) levels to 61% of control (p < 0.05 for Aβ-(1-40) and p < 0.01 for Aβ-(1-42)) (Fig. 3A). Thus, both ACE- and IDE-transfected cells had significantly reduced levels of both principal Aβ species compared with control but were not significantly different from each other.FIGURE 3Transfected human ACE promotes clearance and secondary degradation of cell-derived human Aβ40 and Aβ42.

However, the upstream mechanism is unknown. Here we show that CLA increased (≥6 h) the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 in cultures containing both differentiated adipocytes and stromal vascular (SV) cells, non-differentiated SV cells, and adipose tissue explants. CLA isomer-specific induction of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α was associated with the activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) as evidenced by 1) phosphorylation of IκBα, IκBα kinase, and NFκB p65, 2) IκBα degradation, and 3) nuclear translocation of NFκB. Pretreatment with selective NFκB inhibitors and the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked CLA-mediated IL-6 gene expression. Trans-10, cis-12 CLA suppression of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at 24 h was associated with decreased total and plasma membrane glucose transporter 4 proteins. Inhibition of NFκB activation or depletion of NFκB by RNA interference using small interfering NFκB p65 attenuated CLA suppression of glucose transporter 4 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ proteins and glucose uptake. Collectively, these data demonstrate for the first time that trans-10, cis-12 CLA promotes NFκB activation and subsequent induction of IL-6, which are at least in part responsible for trans-10, cis-12 CLA-mediated suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ target gene expression and insulin sensitivity in mature human adipocytes.

The two predominant isomers of CLA, cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12, are naturally found in dairy products and ruminant meats, with cis-9, trans-11 CLA being the most abundant isomer (e.g. 80% cis-9, trans-11 CLA, 10% trans-10, cis-12 CLA). CLA is also available commercially as a dietary supplement for weight loss, with both isomers reported to be present at equal amounts (e.g. ∼35% each). A great deal of attention has been centered on trans-10, cis-12 CLA due to its reported anti-obesity actions in animal models (for review, see Ref. 1.House R. Cassady J. Eisen E. McIntosh M.K Odle J. Obes. Rev. 2005; 6: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and some humans (for review, see Ref. 2.Larsen T.M. Toubro S. Astrup A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2234-2241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We have reported that trans-10, cis-12 CLA, but not cis-9, trans-11 CLA, inhibited human preadipocyte differentiation (3.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Jensen S.S. Morrison R.F. Storkson J. Lea-Currie R.

Fabiyi O. Morrison R.F. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26735-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). CLA isomer-specific delipidation of adipocytes was due largely to decreased glucose and fatty acid uptake and TG synthesis as opposed to increased oxidation. Interestingly, CLA suppression of glucose and fatty acid uptake was positively correlated with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MEK/ERK) and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and robust secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 after 24 h of treatment. However, the underlying mechanism(s) by which trans-10, cis-12 CLA triggers cytokine production and impairs glucose and fatty acid uptake is unclear. There is growing evidence linking inflammatory cytokines with the development of obesity, insulin resistance (5.Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 6.Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. J. Clin.

Physiol. 2005; 288: 2031-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue plays a central role in this relationship given its ability to both secrete cytokines and act as a substantial target for cytokines. A diverse array of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-6, and IL-8 have been positively associated with obesity and the development of insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue. IL-6 expression can be induced by many transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB), NF-IL6 (nuclear factor for IL-6 expression, a.k.a. CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ)), activator protein-1, and cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) depending on cell type and stimulus (9.Akira S. Int. J. Biochem.

NFκB is a ubiquitous transcription factor regulating the expression of genes promoting inflammation and cell survival. NFκB-dependent transcription normally begins with the phosphorylation of the inhibitory κB proteins (IκBs) and their subsequent degradation. IκB proteins are key regulators of NFκB, sequestering the NFκB dimer in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of IκBα by IκBα kinase (IKK) triggers its polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, thereby releasing NFκB, especially p50/p65, to the nucleus (for review, see Refs. 17.Chen L. Green D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar and 18.Shoelson S.E. Lee J. Yuan M. Int. J.

After phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases such as ERK1/2 and p38 or mitogen and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) (for review, see Refs. 19.Dixit V. Mak T.

CLA TG-lowering actions in human adipocytes are consistent with NFκB activation based on our data (3.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Jensen S.S. Morrison R.F. Storkson J. Lea-Currie R. Pariza M. Mandrup S.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the extent to which NFκB activation was essential for trans-10, cis-12 CLA-induced cytokine expression and impaired glucose uptake in primary human adipocytes. Here we demonstrate for the first time that trans-10, cis-12 CLA promotes NFκB activation before inducing IL-6 expression and insulin resistance in cultures of newly differentiated human adipocytes. The essential role of NFκB in mediating this effect of CLA was demonstrated by using either chemical inhibitors of NFκB or RNA interference targeting NFκB p65. Last, our data suggest that non-adipocytes or stromal vascular (SV) cells secrete a significant amount of cytokines in response to treatment with trans-10, cis-12 CLA.

NUPAGE precast gels, buffers for SDS-PAGE, and gene-specific primers of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) and IL-6 for RT-PCR were purchased from Invitrogen. One-step RT-PCR kits were purchased from Qiagen Inc.

Cell Culture of Primary Human SV Cells—Primary human SV cells were obtained from subcutaneous adipose tissues of non-obese (body mass index <30) females undergoing abdominoplasty with the consent from the Institutional Review Board at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Isolation, culture of SV cells from adipose tissue, and differentiation into adipocytes were performed as previously described (4.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Chung S. Fabiyi O. Morrison R.F. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26735-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) except for the condition that SV cells were pooled from 3∼5 independent human subjects for most experiments. Experimental treatment of cultures containing adipocytes began on ∼day 12 of differentiation unless otherwise indicated. For the preparation of cultures of non-differentiated SV cells, cells were seeded at ∼80% confluent. Fatty Acid Preparation—Both isomers of CLA were complexed to fatty acid-free (>98%) bovine serum albumin (BSA) at a 4:1 molar ratio using 1 mm BSA stocks. [2-3H]Deoxyglucose Uptake—For the 8- and 24-h treatments, newly differentiated cultures of adipocytes were incubated with BSA vehicle or 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA in serum-free, low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1000 mg/liter d-(+)-glucose) in the presence or absence of 20 pm insulin. For the 72 h of treatment, BSA vehicle or 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA were added to adipocyte media for 48 h on day 12. Then, for an additional 24 h, cultures were incubated in 1 ml of serum-free basal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1000 mg/liter d-(+)-glucose with or without 20 pm human insulin in the presence of BSA vehicle or 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA, giving a total of 72 h of exposure to the treatments. After the experimental treatments, [2-3H]deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described previously (4.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Chung S. Fabiyi O. Morrison R.F. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26735-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Plasma Membrane (PM) Isolation and Glut4 Levels—For the detection of Glut4 translocation, PM was fractionated according to Carvalho et al. (23.Carvalho E. Schellhorn S.E. Zabolotny J.M. Martin S. Tozzo E. Peroni O.D. Houseknecht K.L. Mundt A. James D.E. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21598-21605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were washed once with TES buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 225 mm sucrose, pH 7.4 at 20 °C) and then homogenized in ice-chilled TES using a 1-ml Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the solidified surface fat was removed. The resulting pellets (crude membrane) were resuspended in TES and layered on a 1.12 m sucrose cushion in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. PMs at the interface were collected, resuspended in TES, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. PM pellets were resuspended in TES and immunoblotted for Glut4. The abundance of Glut4 was quantified from exposed x-ray film using the KODAK image station 440 (Eastman Kodak Co.). IL-6 and IL-8 Secretion—Differentiated cultures of adipocytes and cultures of non-differentiated SV cells were serum-starved for 20 h before fatty acid treatment. Fatty acid treatment was initiated by adding either BSA vehicle or 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA to the media directly. Conditioned media from above the cell monolayer was collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h, centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris, and kept at -80 °C before analysis. Cultures were washed twice with ice-chilled Hanks' balanced salt solution, and cells were harvested and dedicated for protein determination. IL-6 and IL-8 secretion to the media was quantified using a commercial ELISA (R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's protocol and normalized to the protein content of the monolayer. To measure IL-6 and IL-8 secretion from human subcutaneous adipose tissue explants, 500-mg pieces of adipose tissue obtained per subject were each minced into ∼100 fragments as described by Fried et al. (24.Fried S. Russell C. Grauso N. Brolin E. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Each minced explant was then preincubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin-B at 37 °C overnight. Then explants were transferred to 10 ml of fresh media containing either BSA vehicle or 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA in culture tubes. Subsequently, conditioned media was collected after 8, 24, or 72 h of incubation with treatments and stored at -80 °C until analysis. IL-6 and IL-8 secretion were quantified by ELISA. Relative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol. Relative (semiquantitative) RT-PCR was carried out using One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen Inc) as we described previously (3.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Jensen S.S. Morrison R.F. Storkson J. Lea-Currie R.

Primer sequences for IL-6 were (accession number NM_000600) sense (5′-CCAGCTATGAACTCCTTCTC) and antisense (5′-GCTTGTTCCTCACATCTCTC), and running conditions for IL-6 were 26 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The running conditions for gene-specific primers for TNF-α (Ambion #5345) were 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Phase Contrast Image—Cells were cultured on coverslips for immunofluorescence microscopy and stained as described previously (4.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Chung S.

For phospho-IKK immunostaining, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and then incubated with a 1:10 dilution of rabbit-anti-phospho-IKK overnight at 4 °C. After three vigorous washes, coverslips were incubated with 1:200 dilutions of FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h (Fig. 4C). For NFκB p65 and aP2 double staining (Fig. 5), cells were initially incubated with a 1:10 dilution of NFκB p65 for 12 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. After adequate washing, coverslips were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of aP2 for 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation with a 1:400 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. Fluorescent images were captured with a SPOT digital camera mounted on an Olympus BX160 fluorescence microscope. Cy3-labeled siGLO fluorescent, and phase contrast images were captured without fixation under the Olympus IX60 microscope equipped with a SPOT digital camera (Fig. 8B). For PPARγ immunostaining (Fig. 8E), transfected cells grown on coverslips were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice for 10 min followed by incubating with a 1:10 dilution of mouse-anti-human PPARγ (sc7273) for 16 h at 4 °C and a 1:200 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. 1 μg/ml Hoechst dye was used for nuclei staining (Fig. 8E).FIGURE 5Trans-10, cis-12 CLA promotes NFκB localization to the nucleus in adipocytes and non-adipocytes. Differentiated cultures of human adipocytes were treated with BSA vehicle or 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA for 24 h, and then cells were double-stained for NFκB p65 (red, cy3 conjugated anti-mouse IgG) and aP2 (green, FITC-conjugated, anti-rabbit IgG). TNF-α (100 ng/ml for 1 h) treatment was used as a positive control.

B, transfection efficiency was evaluated by transfection with siGLO, fluorescence (Cy3)-tagged non-targeting siRNA. C, knock-down specificity was analyzed using immunoblotting. Total cell extracts from either untreated (Unt) samples or samples transfected with non-targeting control siRNA (siCon), NFκB p65 siRNA (siP65), and positive control Lamin siRNA (siLa) were immunoblotted with the antibodies targeting NFκB p65, lamin C, NFκB p50, GAPDH, actin, and aP2. D, the impact of CLA on NFκB p65-depleted cultures were examined using immunoblotting. 72 h post-transfection with either non-targeting control siRNA or siP65, cultures were treated with BSA vehicle or a 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA for an additional 24 h. Total cell extracts were immunoblotted with antibodies targeting NFκB p65, PPARγ, Glut4, P-signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), P-ERK1/2, total-STAT3, and GAPDH. The blots for PPARγ and GAPDH were quantified by densitometry, and the amount of PPARγ relative to GAPDH was expressed as a bar graph under the blot. E, cultures were transfected and 72 h later treated with either BSA or 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA for 24 h and then immunostained for PPARγ. Hoechst staining was conducted to identify nuclei.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Separation and Assessment of NFκB p65 DNA Binding—Nuclear and cytosolic cellular fractions were prepared using a commercially available kit from Active Motif, with the following minor modifications. Cells were directly lifted in a 1× hypotonic buffer, gently scraped from the plate, and then treated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Trans-10, cis-12 CLA-treated nuclear extract was used to assess CLA induced-NFκB p65 DNA binding by using the ELISA-based TransAM™ NFκB family transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection with NFκB p65 siRNA—Transfection of newly differentiated human adipocytes with NFκB p65 siRNA was conducted on day 6 of differentiation in 35-mm cell culture plates without detaching the cells. Cells were seeded and differentiated as previously described. On ∼day 6 of differentiation, cultures containing fresh adipocyte media (AM-1, Zen Bio Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) were supplemented with either 25 nm NFκB p65 siRNA or non-targeting siRNA complexed with TransIT-TKO (6 μl/ml), a non-lipid-based transfection reagent from Mirus Corp. Transfection reagent and undelivered siRNA were removed 24 h post-transfection by removing the media and washing the cells twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Transfection efficiency was examined by transfecting the cells with a fluorescent-tagged, RISC-free siRNA obtained from the company. Statistical Analysis—Unless otherwise indicated, data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t tests for each pair for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. All analyses were performed using JMP IN, Version 4.04 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC) software. Trans-10, Cis-12 CLA Reduces Glucose Uptake and the Abundance of Glut4 and IRS-1—We previously demonstrated that trans-10, cis-12 CLA decreased glucose uptake and Glut4 gene expression after 24 or 72 h of treatment (4.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Chung S. Fabiyi O. Morrison R.F. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26735-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, we did not examine the time course of CLA-induced insulin resistance and the extent to which dysregulation of insulin signaling and Glut4 expression played a role in impaired glucose uptake. Therefore, we measured [2-3H]deoxyglucose uptake, phosphorylation of downstream targets of insulin, and Glut4 abundance in cultures of differentiated human adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 1A, insulin-stimulated [2-3H]deoxyglucose uptake was significantly lower in cultures treated with 30 μm trans-10, cis-12 CLA for either 24 or 72 h compared with vehicle (BSA) controls. However, trans-10, cis-12 CLA had minimal effects on insulin signaling as determined by basal- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser-307 or Tyr-891 and on Ser-473 of Akt/protein kinase B (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, trans-10, cis-12 CLA modestly decreased the abundance of total IRS-1 in the absence and presence of insulin as early as 24 h, but more robustly after 72 h (data not shown), which is similar to that reported for IL-6-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16.Rotter V. Nagaev I. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45777-45784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The basal levels of Glut4 were markedly lower in all three cellular fractions from cultures treated with trans-10, cis-12 CLA (Fig. 1C) compared with BSA controls, consistent with CLA-induced reductions in Glut4 gene expression (4.Brown J.M. Boysen M.S. Chung S. Fabiyi O. Morrison R.F. Mandrup S. McIntosh M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26735-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). More importantly, the abundance of Glut4 in the PM fractions of cultures treated with both insulin and trans-10, cis-12 CLA was lower than in cultures treated with insulin and vehicle. The degree to which trans-10, cis-12 CLA decreased [2-3H]deoxyglucose uptake after 24 h of treatment (∼30%, Fig. 1A) was relatively similar to the degree to which it attenuated Glut4 abundance in both membrane fractions (∼35%, Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data suggest that trans-10, cis-12 CLA decreases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by decreasing intracellular pools of key proteins involved i"

PBP1B has been shown to form dimers in vivo. The KD value for PBP1B dimerization was determined by surface plasmon resonance. The effect of the dimerization of PBP1B on its activities was studied with a newly developed in vitro murein synthesis assay with radioactively labeled lipid II precursor as substrate. Under conditions at which PBP1B dimerizes, the enzyme synthesized murein with long glycan strands (>25 disaccharide units) and with almost 50% of the peptides being part of cross-links. PBP1B was also capable of synthesizing trimeric muropeptide structures. Tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptide compounds could serve as acceptors in the PBP1B-catalyzed transpeptidation reaction.

Most bacteria contain a murein (peptidoglycan) sacculus, an exoskeleton that is essential for the osmotic stability of the cell (1Weidel W. Pelzer H. Adv. Enzymol. 1964; 26: 193-232PubMed Google Scholar). Murein has a net-like structure and is composed of glycan strands of alternating β1,4-linked N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues that are cross-linked by short peptides (2Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli is rod-shaped and has a simple cell cycle; a newborn cell elongates with a constant diameter, and when the length of the cell has doubled, the cell divides at mid-cell, forming two new polar caps. Cell growth requires a well coordinated incorporation of the murein precursor, lipid II, into the existing sacculus (3Vollmer W. Höltje J.V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Two reactions are required for murein synthesis. First, disaccharide units of lipid II are oligomerized to murein glycan strands by transglycosylation. Second, peptide cross-links are formed by transpeptidation, the latter reaction being the target of β-lactam antibiotics. Murein synthases have a modular domain structure (4Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Different molecular interactions between certain murein synthases and between murein synthases and hydrolases have been identified, indicating that the enlargement of the sacculus might be achieved by murein synthesis holoenzymes (9Höltje J.V. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PBP1B exists in three isoforms (α, β, and γ) that are encoded by the same gene (ponB) and is a major murein synthase in E. coli (10Kato J. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. Mol. Gen.

The protein has a short cytoplasmic part and is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane via the amino acids 64-88. Most of the enzyme is located in the periplasm (amino acids 89-844), and the periplasmic part contains the transglycosylase (amino acids 198-435) and transpeptidase (amino acids 447-780) domains (13Terrak M. Ghosh T.K. van Heijenoort J. Van Beeumen J. Lampilas M. Aszodi J. Ayala J.A. Ghuysen J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 350-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2970-2972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PBP1B interacts with PBP3 and with the MltA-interacting protein A (MipA), that itself interacts with the murein hydrolase MltA (17Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M. Höltje J.V. J. Biol.

However, the published assays do not directly quantify the muropeptide reaction products by high-resolution techniques such as HPLC, and the yield of the transpeptidation reaction was generally low in the previously published methods (13Terrak M.

In this work, we have established a new HPLC-based assay to determine the reaction products of transglycosylation and transpeptidation of lipid II with PBP1B. We found reaction conditions under which PBP1B dimers produced murein with glycan strands of an average length of more than 25 disaccharide units and with almost 50% cross-linked peptides. PBP1B could also form trimeric structures. Tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptide compounds (l-Ala-d-iGlu-m-A2pm, l-Ala-d-iGlu-m-A2pm-d-Ala, and l-Ala-d-iGlu-m-A2pm-d-Ala-d-Ala, respectively, where iGlu is isoglutamate and A2pm is diaminopimelic acid) could be used as acceptors in PBP1B-catalyzed transpeptidation reactions. Purification of PBP1B—The short γ-form of PBP1B with an N-terminal extension of six amino acids, GSHMASM46-N844, was purified in two chromatography steps. For this, the His-tagged form of PBP1B was isolated from the overproduction strain BL21(DE3) pDML924 (13Terrak M. Ghosh T.K. van Heijenoort J. Van Beeumen J. Lampilas M. Aszodi J. Ayala J.A.

When the optical density at 578 nm reached 0.7, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture, and the cells were grown for 5 more hours. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the membrane extract was prepared as described previously (17Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M. Höltje J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6726-6734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), with the exception that the membrane was extracted with 30 ml of 5 mm Tris/HCl, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, for 1 h at 6°C. The sample was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken, and 15 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) and 8 ml of an aqueous suspension of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Superflow, Qiagen) were added. After an incubation for 18 h at 6 °C, the beads were washed seven times with extraction buffer containing 15 mm imidazole. Then PBP1B was eluted twice by 2 bead volumes of extraction buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. Both elution fractions were combined and dialyzed six times against 1 liter of buffer I (25 mm Tris/HCl, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.5). Then 2 units/ml thrombin (Novagen) were added to the dialysis tube, and dialysis continued for 20 h against buffer I, for 2.5 h against 3 liters of buffer II (10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.02% NaN3, pH 5.0) containing 1 m NaCl, and for 17 h against 5 liters of buffer II containing 300 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein was diluted 2-fold in buffer II containing 100 mm NaCl, dialyzed for 5 h against this buffer and purified on a 5-ml HiTrap SP HP MonoS cation exchange column using an Äkta purifier (Amersham Biosciences) in a 65-ml gradient from buffer II containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.25% Triton X-100 to buffer II containing 2 m NaCl and 0.25% Triton X-100. The fractions containing PBP1B were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.02% NaN3, pH 5.0, and stored at -20 °C. The purified PBP1B was active and bound biotinylated ampicillin (24Dargis M. Malouin F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—A BIAcore™ 2000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) machine and the BIAcore control software version 1.3 were used for surface plasmon resonance studies. PBPs were immobilized on the surface of ampicillin-coated CM5 sensor chips as described previously (17Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M. Höltje J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6726-6734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), with the exception that after protein coupling the excess of ampicillin was digested by an injection of 120 μl of 50 units/ml type II penicillinase from Bacillus cereus (Sigma) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Routinely, one control surface was prepared that was treated in the same way but did not contain immobilized protein. Interaction studies were performed in HBS running buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The analyte was diluted into HBS at different concentrations and was injected with simultaneous recording of the association signal. Then, HBS was injected, and the dissociation was measured. The sensorgrams were evaluated with the software package of the BIAcore™ system for the determination of the kinetic parameters (BIAevaluation version 2.1). A graphical representation of Req (response at equilibrium) divided by the concentration of the injected protein against Req (Scatchard plot) yields a straight line with a slope of -Ka, with Ka = 1/KD (KD, dissociation constant). KD values were determined in seven independent experiments, each with series of injections with certain concentration intervals. Preparation of [14C]GlcNAc-labeled Lipid II—First, lipid I was synthesized and purified essentially as described for lipid II (25Breukink E. van Heusden H.E. Vollmerhaus P.J. Swiezewska E. Brunner L. Walker S. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19898-19903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), with the exception that during the synthesis no UDP-GlcNAc was present and that UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide, which was isolated from Bacillus cereus as described (26Kohlrausch U. Holtje J.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 62: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was used. Lipid I was converted to lipid II using the MurG enzyme that was purified as described previously (27van den Brink-van der Laan E. Boots J.W. Spelbrink R.E. Kool G.M. Breukink E. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3773-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 μmol of lipid I was dissolved in 20 ml of a buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100. Then 10 μCi of [14C]UDP-GlcNAc (10.5 GBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added followed by 70 μg of MurG. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then 5 μmol of “cold” UDP-GlcNAc and another 70 μg of MurG was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at room temperature, which resulted in a complete conversion of lipid I to lipid II, as was determined by TLC (not shown). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 ml of butanol, 6 m pyridine acetate (pH 4.2), and lipid II was purified as described previously (25Breukink E. van Heusden H.E. Vollmerhaus P.J. Swiezewska E. Brunner L. Walker S. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19898-19903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The final pure product had a specific activity of 9180 dpm/nmol and was stored in chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) at a concentration of 0.24 mm at -20 °C until use. Transglycosylation and Transpeptidation Reaction of PBP1B with Lipid II—Lipid II (1.2 nmol, 11,000 dpm) was vacuum-dried and dissolved on ice in 5 μl of 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The reactions were performed in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 3.4% glycerol, 0.18% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl. Unless otherwise stated, PBP1B was present at a concentration of 940 nm, and the total reaction volume was 50 μl. In different experiments, 0.2 mg/ml penicillin G, 0.2 mg/ml moenomycin, 1 mm UDP-MurNAc tripeptide, 1 mm UDP-MurNAc tetrapeptide, or 1 mm UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide was added. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Then the pH was adjusted to 4.8 by the addition of 0.1 n HCl, and 10 μg of cellosyl (kindly provided by Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany) was added followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. The sample was then boiled for 10 min and either directly analyzed by HPLC or reduced prior to HPLC analysis. For reduction, 60 μl of 0.5 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0, containing 10 mg/ml NaBH4 was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Excess of NaBH4 was destroyed by adjustment of the pH to 3-4 with 20% phosphoric acid. Analysis of the Reaction Products—The reduced reaction products were analyzed by HPLC according to a published method (28Glauner B. Höltje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Reduction at pH 9.0 resulted in a loss of ∼5-15% of the phosphates from the monophosphorylated compounds. Therefore, the reduction step was omitted in experiments for quantification of the reaction products. In contrast to the reduced samples, non-reduced muropeptides were separated in a 70-min gradient from 0 to 30% methanol. We aimed to test the effect of dimerization of PBP1B on its in vitro activities. For this, we first determined the KD value for dimerization by surface plasmon resonance. PBP1B was immobilized to the surface of a sensor chip via its active site as described under “Materials and Methods.” The amount of immobilized PBP1B was 1000-1200 resonance units (1 resonance unit corresponds to ∼1 pg of protein/mm2). We chose β-lactoglobulin A from cow milk that has a theoretical pI value of 5.1 as a control protein for the binding to immobilized PBP1B (pI 9.5). Although both proteins have opposite charges at the pH of the running buffer (7.4), there was no binding of β-lactoglobulin A to the PBP1B surface, even if injected at a very high concentration of 1 mm (not shown). When PBP1B was applied to the sensor chip, we could detect a signal for its specific binding to immobilized PBP1B. To determine the affinity constant for the dimerization of PBP1B, a series of PBP1B solutions with concentrations from 20 to 426 nm were applied in HBS buffer. The Scatchard plot (Req/c over Req) gave a straight line with the slope of -1/KD (Fig. 1B). Seven independent experiments resulted in KD values of (1.27 ± 0.96)·10-7 m for the dimerization of PBP1B. To test whether the dimerization of PBP1B has an effect on its enzymatic activities, we developed a new method to monitor in vitro murein synthesis from radioactively labeled lipid II precursor (Fig. 2). Boiling of lipid II for 10 min at a mild acidic pH resulted in the removal of undecaprenyl phosphate and the formation of monophosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide. The monophosphorylated compound can be converted by extended boiling at acidic pH or by treatment with acidic phosphatase from wheat to dephosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide that coelutes (after reduction with NaBH4) in HPLC with authentic disaccharide pentapeptide isolated from E. coli murein (not shown). By reaction of a transglycosylase with lipid II, murein glycan strands are oligomerized with concomitant removal of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, presumably leaving one undecaprenyl pyrophosphate residue at the terminal MurNAc residue of the new glycan strand. Treatment with the muramidase cellosyl followed by boiling for 10 min resulted in the dephosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide from subunits within the glycan chain that were released by cellosyl, the monophosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide from the subunits from the chain end and/or from lipid II molecules that had not been oligomerized, and undecaprenyl phosphate. If transglycosylation is accompanied by transpeptidation, the above treatment additionally yields bis-disaccharide tetrapentapeptide. The murein synthesis reaction products were separated by HPLC and detected by a radioactivity flow-through detector. As expected and because of the presence of the different anomers (29Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), the non-reduced samples gave rise to broad peaks that nonetheless were well separated (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Dependence of product formation on concentration of PBP1B. A, lipid II was incubated with PBP1B followed by digestion with cellosyl, boiling for 10 min, and HPLC analysis of the reaction products. The concentrations of PBP1B were 42 nm (corresponds to one-third of the KD value for dimerization, chromatogram II), 127 nm (corresponds to the KD value for dimerization, chromatogram III), or 940 nm (7.5-fold the KD value for dimerization, chromatogram IV). Chromatogram I shows the control sample without PBP1B. Peak 1, phosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide; peak 2, disaccharide pentapeptide (transglycosylation product); peak 3, bisdisaccharide tetrapentapeptide (transglycosylation-transpeptidation product). B, three independent experiments were performed with different concentrations of PBP1B, and the peaks 1-3 were quantified. Striped bars, peak 1; gray bars, peak 2; black bars, peak 3. The sample numbering I-IV corresponds to the chromatograms I-IV in A. The yields of both reactions, transglycosylation and transpeptidation, were highest at the highest PBP1B concentration at which PBP1B dimers prevail over monomers. At the highest concentration of PBP1B, the in vitro synthesized murein had an average length of the glycan strands of about 20 disaccharide units with close to 50% of the peptides being part of cross-links.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the effects of dimerization on the activity of PBP1B and on the product formation, we applied different PBP1B concentrations to the reaction mixture. Strikingly, the extent of product formation depended strongly on the concentration of PBP1B (Fig. 3). At a concentration corresponding to one-third of the determined KD for dimerization, only about 50% of the lipid II was used in the transglycosylation reaction, and there was no transpeptidation product. At a concentration equal to the KD for dimerization, lipid II was converted to both transglycosylation and transpeptidation products. If PBP1B was present at a concentration of 7.5-fold the KD for dimerization, lipid II was converted to murein with glycan strands of at least 27.8 disaccharide units, as can be calculated from the fraction of 3.6 ± 0.9% of monophosphorylated disaccharide pentapeptide (average from three experiments), that represent glycan chain ends plus non-reacted lipid II. In addition, the in vitro synthesized murein was highly cross-linked; 48.0 ± 2.5% of the material consisted of cross-linked structures that were formed by transpeptidation (average from three experiments). The percentage of cross-linked product obtained in our in vitro murein synthesis reactions showed some day-to-day variation depending (in part) on the batch and on the aging of the PBP1B preparation, but cross-linked products were always produced at percentages between 30 and 50% of the total material at this concentration of PBP1B. To further examine the reaction products of the in vitro murein synthesis assay in more detail, we treated the reaction mixture with NaBH4, resulting in sharper peaks. The reduction step allowed the detection of an additional minor cross-linked trimeric product (Fig. 4A, chromatogram II, peak 4) that presumably represents the trimeric transpeptidation product of PBP1B, the tris-disaccharide tetratetrapentapeptide because (i) it is not present if transpeptidation is blocked by penicillin and (ii) it has the same retention time as the tris-disaccharide tetratetrapenta compound present in isolated E. coli murein (not shown). We have confirmed that the non-phosphorylated, reduced products of the reaction (disaccharide pentapeptide, bis-disaccharide tetrapentapeptide, and tris-disaccharide tetratetrapentapeptide) coeluted with authentic muropeptides isolated from murein of a pentapeptide-rich E. coli strain (not shown). Addition of 200 μg/ml penicillin G completely inhibited the transpeptidation (cross-linking) reaction but had no effect on transglycosylation, whereas the addition of 200 μg/ml moenomycin, a known transglycosylase inhibitor (30Huber G. Nesemann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Van Heijenoort Y. Derrien M. Van Heijenoort J. FEBS Lett. 1978; 89: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), completely inhibited both reactions (not shown), thus validating our results. The specificity of the transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by PBP1B was further studied by adding a 42-fold molar excess (over lipid II) of UDP-MurNAc tripeptide, UDP-MurNAc tetrapeptide, or UDP-Mur-NAc pentapeptide to the reaction (Fig. 4A, chromatograms III-V). All three compounds could act as acceptors in the transpeptidation reaction, as indicated by the formation of novel cross-linked compounds that were separated by HPLC from the normal bis-disaccharide tetrapenta cross-linking product. The proposed structures of the “mixed” dimers (structures 5-7) are shown in Fig. 4C. We also aimed to test whether the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reaction products are produced simultaneously from lipid II or if one reaction precedes the other. The reactions were too fast to measure a time-dependent increase in transglycosylation-transpeptidation products at our standard conditions at the high PBP1B concentration (940 nm) that favors dimerization. Therefore, this experiment was performed at 20 °C (Fig. 5). The reaction was started by the addition of PBP1B, and samples were taken after different reaction times, boiled for 10 min, and digested with cellosyl. Then the samples were reduced with NaBH4 and analyzed by HPLC. The first sample was taken prior to the addition of PBP1B and was used to correct for the dephosphorylation during the reduction step. Within the first 10 min, lipid II was consumed at a rate of ∼2.23 mol/(mol PBP1B·min), which represents the rate of transglycosylation. The monomeric transglycosylation product increased with a rate of ∼1.48 mol/(mol PBP1B·min). The dimeric transglycosylation-transpeptidation product increased with a rate of 0.67 mol/(mol PBP1B·min). In total, the cross-linking reaction occurred at a rate of 0.38 mol/(mol PBP1B·min) (transpeptidation rate). After 10 min of reaction time, the monomeric transglycosylation product did not further increase. In contrast, the dimeric (cross-linked) product continued to increase between 15 and 60 min, albeit with a much lower rate of 3.3·10-2 mol/(mol PBP1B·min). The bifunctional murein synthase PBP1B was shown to form dimers in vivo (14Zijderveld C.A. Aarsman M.E. den Blaauwen T. Nanninga N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5740-5746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Charpentier X. Chalut C. Remy M.H. Masson J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the dimerization does not depend on intramolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (16Chalut C. Remy M.H. Masson J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2970-2972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the dimerization of isolated PBP1B by surface plasmon resonance. At a pH of 7.5, a NaCl concentration of 150 mm, and a Triton X-100 concentration of 0.05%, the dissociation constant was determined as (1.27 ± 0.96)·10-7 m. It is indeed possible that the anchoring of the enzyme in the cytoplasmic membrane contributes to its dimerization in vivo. Purified murein precursor (lipid II) with a radioactive label in the GlcNAc residue was used as substrate for in vitro murein synthesis reactions by PBP1B. For analysis of the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reaction products, we have established an assay that is based on the HPLC method for E. coli muropeptide analysis (28Glauner B. Höltje J.V. Schwarz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The advantage of the new assay is that transglycosylation and transpeptidation products are analyzed directly and simultaneously with high resolution, as compared with previous assays employing paper chromatography (13Terrak M. Ghosh T.K. van Heijenoort J. Van Beeumen J. Lampilas M. Aszodi J. Ayala J.A. Ghuysen J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3549-3557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The buffer conditions used for surface plasmon resonance studies and for in vitro murein synthesis assays were similar with respect to the concentrations of NaCl, Triton X-100, and MgCl2 and to the pH value. The isolated PBP1B showed a significantly higher activity at conditions that favor dimerization (Fig. 3). In particular the transpeptidation reaction is strongly enhanced at PBP1B concentrations well above the determined KD value for dimerization. Such a concentration effect has not been reported before, and PBP1B has been used at lower concentrations in most previous in vitro murein synthesis studies. In contrast to most earlier studies, we have omitted 1-octanol and Me2SO in the assay buffer and used only a non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100, to solubilize PBP1B and lipid II. At high concentrations of PBP1B, almost 50% of the peptides became part of cross-links, i.e. substantially higher than in previous studies. The low percentage (3.6%) of the phosphorylated compounds present after the reaction indicates that the synthesized glycan strands are on average longer than 25 disaccharide units. The transglycosylation and transpeptidation products simultaneously increased within the first 10 min of the reaction (Fig. 5), with the rate of transpeptidation being approximately one-sixth of the rate of transglycosylation, yielding a murein with approximately one-third of the peptides being part of cross-links. At a 12-fold lower rate (as compared with the initial rate), secondary transpeptidation reactions occurred, resulting in a slow increase in transpeptidation products between 15 and 60 min of the reaction. Such a delayed transpeptidation activity has also been observed with recombinant PBP1B from Streptococcus pneumoniae that has been overproduced and purified from E. coli (34Schwartz B. Markwalder J.A. Wang Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11638-11643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the initial cross-linking reaction occurs simultaneously with the transglycosylation of lipid II, whereas the secondary cross-linking occurs at the already oligomerized glycan strands. The new assay allowed the detection of a minor trimeric transpeptidation product, the tris-disaccharide tetratetrapenta muropeptide. In different experiments with high concentrations of PBP1B, the yield of this compound was between 4 and 7%, and it appeared only after 10 min of reaction time (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is likely that transpeptidation occurs to the already formed dimeric compound, yielding the trimer. We have studied the specificity of the transpeptidation reaction by using different artificial substrates, the soluble murein precursors UDP-MurNAc tripeptide, UDP-MurNAc tetrapeptide, and UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide. The normal and mixed dimers could be separated by HPLC. PBP1B could use all UDP-linked substrates as acceptors for the transpeptidation reaction, indicating that the enzyme is not specific for pentapeptides as an acceptor for the cross-linking reaction but can utilize tripeptides and tetrapeptides as well. Interestingly, PBP1B synthesized in vitro murein, that is, with respect to certain structural features, similar to murein formed in vivo and isolated from E. coli cells. In vitro synthesized murein consists of glycan strands of more than 25 disaccharide units (in vivo, 25-35 disaccharide units). In vitro synthesized murein had almost 50% of peptides being part of cross-links (in vivo, 40-50%). In vitro synthesized murein had a small percentage of trimeric compounds (in vivo, about 5%). Despite these similarities, there is a major difference between in vitro murein synthesis by PBP1B and in vivo murein synthesis. In vivo, new material (lipid II or newly synthesized larger murein fragments) is attached to the existing sacculus and is incorporated into the stress-bearing layer, presumably by well controlled activities of bifunctional and monofunctional murein synthases and murein hydrolases, resulting in the enlargement of the existing murein sacculus (2Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vollmer W. Höltje J.V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our results of the in vitro activity of PBP1B point to the possibility that in vivo dimers of the bifunctional murein synthases (PBP1B or PBP1A) produce fragments of cross-linked murein that are then attached to and inserted into the existing murein layer by monofunctional transpeptidases and murein hydrolases. Until now, a murein sacculus enlargement reaction (as it occurs in vivo) could not be observed in vitro. The characterization of the in vitro activities of the different murein synthases, as studied here for PBP1B, is a step forward in understanding their possible roles in murein synthesis in vivo."

Transgenic UGT1 (Tg-UGT1) mice have been created, and it has been demonstrated that tissue-specific and xenobiotic receptor control of the UGT1A genes is influenced through circulating humoral factors. In Tg-UGT1 mice, the UGT1A proteins are differentially expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Gene expression profiles confirmed that all of the UGT1A genes can be targeted for regulation by the pregnane X receptor activator pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile (PCN) or the Ah receptor ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In addition, the selective induction of glucuronidation activity toward lamotrigine, ethinyl estradiol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid by either PCN or TCDD in small intestine from Tg-UGT1 mice corresponded to expression of the locus in this tissue. Induction of UGT1A1 by PCN and TCDD is believed to be highly dependent upon glucocorticoids, because submicromolar concentrations of dexamethasone actively promote PCN and TCDD induction of UGT1A1 in Tg-UGT1 primary hepatocytes.

Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). Located in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum, the UGTs play a vital role in the metabolism and detoxification of steroids, bile acids, hormones, environmental toxicants, carcinogens, and a multitude of drugs (2Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). In humans, the UGT1 and UGT2 gene families encode 19 RNA transcripts that have been identified from human tissues, and in vitro expression of these transcripts in tissue culture has aided in defining the substrate specificities of the UGTs (2Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Although UGT1 and UGT2 proteins are involved in drug metabolism (3King C.D. Rios G.R. Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2000; 1: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), it is believed that the UGT1 proteins are favored in the metabolism of a greater proportion of xenobiotic substrates. Both UGT1 and UGT2 proteins glucuronidate endobiotic substrates, with the UGT1 enzymes showing specificity for estrogens, whereas the UGT2 proteins exhibit a preference for androgens (4Lepine J.

Seven UGT2B genes and three UGT2A genes are encoded as individual structural genes on chromosome 4, and the UGT1 locus encodes nine UGT1A proteins (UGT1A genes) on chromosome 2 (5Tukey R.H.

Located in the 3′ region of the locus are exons 2–5, which encode the conserved 245 amino acids of the carboxyl region. Flanking each of the exon 1 sequences are the necessary structural elements to ensure appropriate transcriptional activation as monitored by expression in human tissue of UGT1A RNA gene transcripts (2Tukey R.H.

Adding to the uniqueness of these expression patterns, regulation of the UGT1 locus is also targeted by a number of xenobiotic and steroid receptors. The xenobiotic receptors pregnenolone X receptor (PXR) (16Xie W. Yeuh M.F. Radominska-Pandya A. Saini S.P. Negishi Y. Bottroff B.S. Cabrera G.Y. Tukey R.H. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15001-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have been shown in tissue culture to regulate UGT1A1 gene expression, promoting UGT1A1 protein induction. In addition, glucocorticoids work in a synergistic fashion to promote PXR and constitutive androstane receptor induction of the UGT1A1 gene (19Sugatani J. Nishitani S. Yamakawa K. Yoshinari K. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Miwa M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), providing support for the theory that circulating hormones may play a crucial role in maintaining appropriate levels of the UGTs in vivo. Exposure to selective environmental toxicants that activate the Ah receptor has been linked to transcriptional regulation of UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 (20Bock K.W. Gschaidmeier H. Heel H. Lehmkoster T.

Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Other recent findings have also demonstrated that human variants of the PXR have been implicated in expression of UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 (23Gardner-Stephen D. Heydel J.M. Goyal A. Lu Y. Xie W. Lindblom T. Mackenzie P. Radominska-Pandya A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ regulate UGT1A9 (50Barbier O. Villeneuve L. Bocher V. Fontaine C. Torra I.P. Duhem C. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Guillemette C. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13975-13983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of the UGT1 locus is believed to be controlled in a tissue-specific manner by hormones, in addition to induction following exposure to xenobiotics. Clearly, a viable animal model to investigate the in vivo events associated with regulation of the UGT1 locus would promote a better understanding of the role of selective xenobiotic receptors on gene control. One of the most important concepts in all of drug metabolism is an understanding of those events that control both infant and maternal drug metabolism during fetal and neonatal development. It is well known that levels of human glucuronidation gradually increase through development, including the weeks and months following birth. Yet it might be anticipated that the dramatic changes in the levels of circulating hormones that occur during pregnancy and lactation (24Neville M.C. McFadden T.B. Forsyth I. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2002; 7: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) may alter the levels of hepatic enzymes in maternal liver. In rodents, several studies indicate that maternal liver glucuronidation activity is lower during pregnancy (25Inoue H. Tsuruta A. Kudo S. Ishii T. Fukushima Y. Iwano H. Yokota H. Kato S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Luquita M.G. Catania V.A. Pozzi E.J. Veggi L.M. Hoffman T. Pellegrino J.M. Ikushiro S. Emi Y. Iyanagi T. Vore M. Mottino A.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 49-56PubMed Google Scholar). However, in humans, selective glucuronidation activities during pregnancy are induced, as evidenced by increased oral clearance of paracetamol (27Miners J.O. Robson R.A. Birkett D.J. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1986; 22: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and lamotrigine (28Gentile S. Arch. Women Ment. Health. 2005; 8: 57-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Tran T.A. Leppik I.E. Blesi K. Sathanandan S.T. Remmel R. Neurology. 2002; 59: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Lamotrigine is a quaternary amine that undergoes N-glucuronidation (30Remmel R.P. Sinz M.W. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 630-636PubMed Google Scholar) by human UGT1A4 (31Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 860-867PubMed Google Scholar), whereas paracetamol is a phenolic compound that can be glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 (32Krishnaswamy S. Hao Q. Al Rohaimi A. Hesse L.M. von Moltke L.L. Greenblatt D.J. Court M.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 313: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Court M.H. Greenblatt D.J. Pharmacogenetics. 2000; 10: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, in an effort to study those events that link homeostatic control of the UGT1 locus with various aspects of human glucuronidation in adults as well as during fetal development and lactation, a mouse UGT transgenic model (Tg-UGT1) has been developed that expresses a bacterial artificial chromosome encoding the entire UGT1 locus. Evidence is presented that each of the nine UGT1A genes is expressed in selective tissues in Tg-UGT1 mice. Expression of the UGT1 locus in transgenic mice provides not only a unique opportunity to examine the regulatory properties that control the tissue-specific and xenobiotic receptor-elicited expression patterns of the individual UGT1A genes but also enriches an understanding of how the UGT1 locus may be regulated at times where changes are apparent in the physiological levels of circulating hormones. Our results illustrate that the transgenic UGT1 mice will allow for investigation of gene control and protein expression and may advance our understanding of how this locus is regulated in humans.

Pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile (PCN), Trizma (Tris base), saccharo-1,4-lactone, dexamethasone, UDP-glucuronic acid, and 1,4-bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) were from Sigma. Lamotrigine was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Ontario, Canada, and the 2-N-glucuronide metabolite was a gift from GlaxoSmithKline. Both ethinyl estradiol-2 and ethinyl estradiol-3-glucuronide were obtained from Steraloids Inc. Solvents for chromatography were HPLC grade from Fisher. Ammonium acetate, HPLC grade, was from J. T.

Human UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and UGT1A6 cDNAs expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells were purchased from BD Biosciences. Generation of the UGT1 Humanized Mouse—A bacterial artificial chromosome encoding the entire human UGT1 locus, described previously (18Yueh M.F. Huang Y.H. Hiller A. Chen S.J. Nguyen N. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15001-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was purified by CsCl banding and dialyzed against microinjection buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 μm spermine, 70 μm spermidine, and 100 mm NaCl). The purified DNA was microinjected into the pronucleus of CB6F1 (an F1 hybrid between BALB/c and C57BL/6N mice) mouse eggs and transplanted into the oviduct of pseudopregnant C57BL/6N mice. All procedures for the generation of the transgenic mice were carried at the University of California, San Diego, Superfund Transgenic Core Facility. For genotyping, DNA was isolated from tail clippings of 46 3-week-old mice, and a 366-bp region in exon 5 of the common region of the human UGT1 locus was identified by PCR in 12 founders using sense (5′-cataaattaatcagccccag-3′, bases 187,423–187,443, GenBank™ accession number AF297093) and antisense (5′-ccttctttaaacacacaagg-3′, bases 187,789–187,809) primers. Each founder was further profiled by PCR using specific primers that encoded a portion of each of the unique exon 1 sequences (11Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Five founders containing the entire UGT1 locus were bred into C57Bl/6N mice from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The transgene UGT1 copy number in each of the Tg-UGT1 mice was determined from tail genomic DNA. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using the QuantiTect™ SYBR® Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the reactions were run in an MX400 Multiplex QPCR machine. Each reaction contained varying concentrations of DNA and 0.2 μm of the UGT1A3 sense 5′-tgttgaacaatatgtctttggtcta-3′ and antisense 5′-ccaatgaagaccatgttgggc-3′ oligonucleotides. PCR was conducted in a 50-μl reaction, and the polymerase was activated at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final cycle of 95 °C for 1 min. In a separate reaction, mouse β-actin primers were used with each sample of DNA, and the corresponding cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to determine the exact loading of DNA. Total molecules of the cloned UGT1 locus in the BAC DNA was determined by generating Ct values over a dilution of BAC DNA from 10 to 200 pg, with each dilution evaluated in 100 ng of wild type mouse DNA. Because the BAC DNA is represented by 2.5 × 105 bases, the generated Ct values from the diluted BAC DNA were calculated to represent 0.5–100 copies of the UGT1 locus. This allowed for a direct comparison of the number of copies of the UGT1 locus per sample of human and mouse transgenic DNA. For these calculations, we assumed that human haploid DNA contains two copies of the UGT1 locus. Preparation of Antibodies to Human UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and UGT1A6—The preparation of polyclonal antisera recognizing residues 29–159 of the human UGT1A1 protein has been described (34Ritter J.K. Kessler F.K. Thompson M.T. Grove A.D. Auyeung D.J. Fisher R.A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Antisera recognizing human UGT1A4 and UGT1A6 were prepared using the same methodologies. Briefly, His6-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain SG13009 (Qiagen) from pQE30 (Qiagen)-based plasmid constructs containing the coding sequence for residues 30–160 of UGT1A4 (construct pQE30-h1A4) or 12–131 of UGT1A6 (construct pQE30-h1A6). Expression of each fusion protein was induced in log phase cultures of transformed bacteria by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After a 4-h induction, the cultures were harvested, and fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose affinity resin (Qiagen). Immunizations were performed using 10 female B6C3F1 mice for each individual form. One week after the final booster injection, animals were anesthetized, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The protocol used for raising antisera followed National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and received the approval of the Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Serum samples for each antisera were pooled and aliquoted (50 μl/tube) prior to storage at –80 °C. Microsomal Protein Isolation from Transgenic Mouse Tissues—Using three animals per group, the liver and small and large intestinal tissues were collected from Tg-UGT1 and wild type mice. For the small and large intestine, the tissue was dissected lengthwise and the luminal surface gently rinsed in 1.15% KCl before freezing on dry ice. Tissue samples from each treatment group were combined and frozen in liquid nitrogen in a porcelain mortar and pulverized under liquid nitrogen. A sample of the pulverized tissue was added to 5 volumes of 1.15% ice-cold KCl, and the tissue was homogenized using a motorized glass Teflon homogenizer. The tissue homogenate was first centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and this resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Immunoblot Analysis—All Western blots were performed using NuPAGE BisTris-polyacrylamide gels as outlined by the supplier (Invitrogen). Protein was heated at 70 °C for 10 min in loading buffer and resolved in 4–12% BisTris gels under denaturing conditions (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris base, pH 7.7, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) prior to transferring the proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry transfer system (Novex). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies (mouse anti-human UGT1A1, UGT1A4, or UGT1A6) in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Each membrane was washed again, and the conjugated horseradish peroxidase was detected using the ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences), and the proteins were detected following exposure to x-ray film. Isolation and Treatment of Mouse Transgenic Primary Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 8- to 12-week old mice. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation. The portal vein was cannulated and perfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free) containing 0.1 mm EGTA and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for 5 m in at the rate of 7 ml/min. As soon as the perfusion was started, the anterior vena cava was cut to allow continuous flow to proceed out of the liver. At this time, the perfusate was changed to a solution containing 20 μg/ml Liberase Blendzymes (Roche Applied Science) that dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution (with Ca2+ and Mg2+), and the perfusion continued for another 5 min. The liver was removed, and the hepatocytes were isolated by mechanical dissection followed by filtration through a sterile 70-μm filter. The cells were immediately collected by centrifugation at 50 × g for 30 s and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's tissue culture media. Cell viability was examined by trypan blue exclusion, and experiments were conducted only if viability exceeded 90%. The hepatocytes were then cultured in 6-well collagen-treated plates (Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA) in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin/streptomycin and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Three hours after plating, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. The hepatocytes were treated with various chemicals 24 h after seeding for further studies. For analysis of proteins by Western blot, hepatocytes were collected and lysed in a buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with a complement of protease and phosphatase mixture inhibitors (Sigma). After incubation of this mixture for 30 min on ice, the solubilized lysate was centrifuged for 20 min in a refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was collected and used directly for Western blot studies. Determination of UGT Catalytic Activity—For the determination of lithocholic acid (LCA)-24 and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)-24 glucuronide, microsomal proteins (10 μg) were incubated in the presence of LCA or CDCA (200 μm) and UDP-glucuronic acid (2 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C in a glucuronidation assay buffer as reported (4Lepine J. Bernard O. Plante M. Tetu B. Pelletier G. Labrie F. Belanger A. Guillemette C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5222-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Assays were ended by adding 100 μl of methanol with 0.02% butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma), and the production of LCA- and CDCA-24G was subsequently ensured by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization coupled to mass spectrometry. Briefly, 25 μl of analytical standards or assays were injected into an Alliance 2690 HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). Analytes were separated on a Synergie RP Hydro 100 × 4.6 mm, 4-μm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a split ratio of 1:4. Initial conditions were 40% water, 1 mm ammonium formate, 60% methanol, 1 mm ammonium formate, followed by a linear gradient to 85% methanol, 1 mm ammonium formate in 3 min. This condition was maintained for 2 min, and the column was flushed with 95% methanol, 1 mm ammonium formate for 2 min and re-equilibrated to initial conditions for an additional 2 min. All analytes were quantified by multiple reactions in monitoring mode with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer API 3000 (Applied Biosystems-Sciex, Concord, Canada) equipped with a turbo ion spray source. Ion pairs detected were m/z 567.5 → 391.5 for CDCA-24G and 551.5 → 375.5 for LCA-24G, and the concentration of glucuronides produced in each assay was obtained by reporting the peak area ratios to the standard curves established with the corresponding purified conjugate. For analysis of lamotrigine and ethinyl estradiol glucuronidation, glucuronidation reactions were started by the addition of 3 mm UDP-glucuronic acid and incubated for 30 min with lamotrigine and 20 min with ethinyl estradiol at 37 °C. Chilled acetonitrile (200 μl) was used to stop the reactions, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was the centrifuged once through 0.2-μm nylon spin filters. The separation of lamotrigine-N-glucuronide was carried out by injecting an aliquot (2 μl) on a Higgins Analytical Haisil C-18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, ChromTech, Apple Valley, MN) at room temperature. The gradient consists of 20–60% acetonitrile in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.67, over a period of 6 min. The percentage of organic was held steady for 2 min before and after the gradient, followed by a 4-min re-equilibration step. The flow rate for the analysis was 0.3 ml/min. Retention time for lamotrigien-N-glucuronide was 5.4 min. Data acquisition was achieved on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry Solution Software® from Shimadzu Inc. Standard curves for lamotrigine-N-glucuronide (added to blank pig liver microsomes) were developed with concentrations of 10–500 μm and showed an R2 ≥ 0.999. The coefficient of variation was <10% at all concentrations of lamotrigine-N-glucuronide. Kinetic analysis was performed with Sigma Plot (Systat, Richmond, CA). The HPLC separation of ethinyl estradiol-glucuronide was carried out by injecting an aliquot (2 μl) on a Higgins Analytical Haisil C-8 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, ChromTech, Apple Valley, MN) at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2087443330,"Glucooligosaccharide oxidase from Acremonium strictum has been screened for potential applications in oligosaccharide acid production and alternative carbohydrate detection, because it catalyzes the oxidation of glucose, maltose, lactose, cellobiose and cello- and maltooligosaccharides. We report the crystal structures of the enzyme and of its complex with an inhibitor, 5-amino-5-deoxy- cellobiono-1,5-lactam at 1.55- and 1.98-Å resolution, respectively. Unexpectedly, the protein structure demonstrates the first known double attachment flavinylation, 6-S-cysteinyl, 8α-N1-histidyl FAD. The FAD cofactor is cross-linked to the enzyme via the C6 atom and the 8α-methyl group of the isoalloxazine ring with Cys130 and His70, respectively. This sugar oxidase possesses an open carbohydrate-binding groove, allowing the accommodation of higher oligosaccharides. The complex structure suggests that this enzyme may prefer a β-d-glucosyl residue at the reducing end with the conserved Tyr429 acting as a general base to abstract the OH1 proton in concert with the H1 hydride transfer to the flavin N5. Finally, a detailed comparison illustrates the structural conservation as well as the divergence between this protein and its related flavoenzymes.

Sugar oxidases and dehydrogenases that catalyze carbohydrate oxidation to the corresponding lactones are of considerable commercial importance as potential diagnostic reagents and industrial biocatalysts. For example, glucose oxidase (GOX) 4The abbreviations used are: GOX, glucose oxidase; GOOX, glucooligosaccharide oxidase; POX, pyranose oxidase; CDH, cellobiose dehydrogenase; F domain, FAD-binding domain; S domain, substrate-binding domain; ABL, 5-amino-5-deoxy-cellobiono-1,5-lactam; NlNEC5, nectarin V from Nicotiana langsdorffii; CcHEOX, a hexose oxidase from Chondrus crispus; HaCHOX, a defense protein from Helianthus annuus with carbohydrate oxidase activity; ZmCKX, Zea mays cytokinin dehydrogenase; BsCOX2, Brevibacterium sterolicum cholesterol oxidase 2; PpPCMH, Pseudomonas putida p-cresol methylhydroxylase; PsVAO, Penicillium simplicissimum vanillyl-alcohol oxidase; EcDLDH, E. coli d-lactate dehydrogenase; EcMurB, E. coli uridine diphospho-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase; OcCODH, Oligotropha carboxidovorans CO dehydrogenase; BtXOX, Bos taurus xanthine oxidase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is widely used in analytical biochemistry and in the food industry (1.Meyer A.S. Isaksen A. Trends Food Sci. Technol. 1995; 6: 300-304Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A search of the BRENDA enzyme data base (2.Schomburg I. Chang A. Ebeling C. Gremse M. Heldt C. Huhn G. Schomburg D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 431-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reveals that most of these enzymes are specific for a variety of mono- and disaccharides, and only a few enzymes are highly selective for oligosaccharides. These include galactose oxidase, cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), and glucooligosaccharide oxidase (GOOX). GOOX from Acremonium strictum was screened with the aim of identifying enzymes with potential applications in oligosaccharide acid production and alternative carbohydrate assays (3.Lin S.F. Yang T.Y. Inukai T. Yamasaki M. Tsai Y.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1118: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is a monomeric glycoprotein with a covalently linked FAD and catalyzes the oxidization of a variety of carbohydrates with the concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. A screening of more than 50 carbohydrates and derivatives showed that d-glucose, maltose, lactose, and cellobiose are good substrates. In addition, this enzyme can react with malto- and cellooligosaccharides, and hence the name of this novel oxidase. The broad substrate specificity of GOOX, particularly toward oligosaccharides, suggests that it may have great potential applicability. To facilitate further characterization and potential industrial use of A. strictum GOOX, we have cloned the encoding gene, which is composed of a 25-residue signal peptide and a 474-residue mature protein (4.Lee, M. H., Lai, W. L., Lin, S. F., Hsu, C. S., Liaw, S. H., and Tsai, Y. C. (2005) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. in pressGoogle Scholar). Although GOOX shows a similar substrate specificity as GOX, CDH, and pyranose oxidase (POX), it shares no sequence similarity with them. However, GOOX displays significant sequence homology to the FAD-binding domain (F domain) of berberine bridge enzyme-like proteins including three other sugar oxidases, a red alga hexose oxidase (CcHEOX), a tobacco nectar protein (nectarin V, NlNEC5), and a sunflower defense protein (HaCHOX) (5.Groen B.W. De Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6.Carter C.J. Thornburg R.W.

Simons B.H. Melchers L.S. Stuiver M.H. Plant J. 2004; 39: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although NlNEC5 catalyzes oxidation of glucose, and GOOX, CcHEOX and HaCHOX catalyze the oxidation of glucose, maltose, lactose, and cellobiose, the protein sequences of their substrate-binding domains (S domains) are quite diverse and apparently lack conserved carbohydrate-interacting residues. Moreover, structural and mutational studies demonstrated a consensus histidine for flavinylation in the F domain of berberine bridge enzyme-like proteins. Unexpectedly, mutation of the putative FAD-linking residue in GOOX, His70, to alanine, serine, cysteine, or tyrosine does not abolish the covalent FAD attachment (4.Lee, M. H., Lai, W. L., Lin, S. F., Hsu, C. S., Liaw, S. H., and Tsai, Y. C. (2005) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. in pressGoogle Scholar). To gain structural insight into the FAD incorporation, substrate specificity, and catalytic mechanism, we have determined the GOOX structure in the absence, or presence of a product analog, 5-amino-5-deoxy-cellobiono-1,5-lactam (ABL). Recombinant protein was expressed using the vector pPICZαA in Pichia pastoris KM71, and then isolated by a Toyopearyl Phenyl-650 column with elution of a gradient of 2.5-0 m ammonium sulfate (4.Lee, M. H., Lai, W. L., Lin, S. F., Hsu, C. S., Liaw, S. H., and Tsai, Y. C. (2005) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. in pressGoogle Scholar). Yellow protein crystals were grown in 25% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550, 10 mm ZnSO4, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), with a combination of 2 μl of reservoir solution and 2 μl of protein solution (35 mg/ml). Crystals appeared and reached their final dimensions in a month at 295 K. Only very few batches of recombinant proteins produce crystals of high quality. The high-resolution datasets were collected using the synchrotron radiation at the beamlines BL12B2 at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and NW12 at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The data were processed using the HKL2000 program (8.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the P212121 space group with 1 monomer/asymmetric unit. Because of a lack of fresh crystals, the frozen native crystals were used for preparation of the ABL derivative by soaking crystals for 30 min in a reservoir solution containing 60 mm ABL. The x-ray data were collected on a RAXIS IV area detector with a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode (MSC). Heavy atom screening yielded one platinum derivative (K2PtI4) and sufficient phase information was derived from single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. Four Pt positions were identified with SHLEXD (9.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) and refined with SOLVE (10.Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The initial phase was improved significantly by direct method phasing refinement using OASIS (11.Wang J.W. Chen J.R. Gu Y.X. Zheng C.D. Jiang F. Fan H.F. Terwilliger T.C. Hao Q. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) before density modification. An initial model with 248 polyalanine residues was built by RESOLVE (10.Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The electron density was improved greatly by fragment extension with OASIS, so that a complete model with side chains was built by ARP/wARP (12.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). The structure then underwent straightforward refinement against native data to 1.55 Å resolution using CNS (13.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The structure of the ABL derivative was solved by molecular replacement using the refined coordinates mentioned above as the initial model. Statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in TABLE ONE. More than 90% of the residues are in the most favored regions of Ramachandran plot, with the remaining in the additional allowed regions except for Thr307 and Arg445, because of hydrogen bond interactions. Crystals with better quality were grown in the presence of 10 mm ZnSO4, and four zinc ions bound to the enzyme were identified by the zinc anomalous data. Three zinc ions were replaced by platinum ions in the K2PtI4 derivative. Figs. 1, 3B, and 4A were generated by MolScript (14.Esnouf R.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The protein is composed of two distinct domains (Fig. 1). The F domain recruits the N-terminal residues 1-206 and the C-terminal residues 421-474 and folds into two (α+β) subdomains. A small subdomain, residues 1-90, comprises a central four β-strands (β1-β4) with the strand order 1, 2, 4, and 3, and with β1 running antiparallel to the other strands. The β-sheet is sandwiched by three helices (αA, αA′ and αB), in which there is one disulfide bond between Cys6 of the αA helix and Cys55 of the αB helix. The second subdomain contains five antiparallel β-strands (β5-β9) with the strand order 5, 6, 9, 7, and 8 and is surrounded by five α-helices (αC, αD, αD′, αJ, and αK). These two subdomains are packed against each other and accommodate the FAD cofactor between them. Furthermore, the S domain (residues 207-420) is composed of a large seven-strand antiparallel β-sheet (β10-β16) with the strand order 13, 10, 12, 11, 15, 16, and 14 and is flanked by five helices (αE-αI). This domain is positioned over the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor and constitutes most of the carbohydrate-binding groove. Two N-glycosylation modifications were detected in the S domain. The electron density showed clearly one ordered sugar residue each linked to Asn305 and Asn341, which was assigned as N-acetyl-d-glucosamine based solely on fitting to the electron density. A Novel Flavinylation—Unexpectedly, the FAD cofactor is cross-linked to the enzyme at two attachment sites (Fig. 2A). One is the Sγ atom of Cys130 bound to the C6 atom of the isoalloxazine ring, whereas the other is the Nδ1 atom of His70 bound to the 8α-methyl group (6-S-cysteinyl, 8α-N1-histidyl FAD). The ADP-ribityl moiety is embedded in the F domain and is completely solvent-inaccessible. The adenine and ribose groups form eight hydrogen bonds with two water molecules and the backbone atoms of Ala65, Gly106, and Val195 (Fig. 2B). The negatively charged pyrophosphate group interacts with a constellation of backbone NH groups of Gly67, Gly68, Gly69, His70, Ser71, Gly134, and Gly137. In addition, the ribityl group makes four hydrogen bonds with one water molecule, the backbone of His70, and the side chains of His138 and Asn. The isoalloxazine ring lies at the juncture of the F and S domains. In addition to the covalent linking to His70 and Cys130, the ring forms five hydrogen bonds with two water molecules, the backbones of Thr129 and Tyr144, and the side chain of Tyr426. Five types of covalent flavinylation have been identified up to the present, and flavinylation has been shown to be an autocatalytic process (18.Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The four types of flavinylation at the 8α-methyl group cross-linking to His (Nδ1 and Nϵ2), Tyr (Oη), and Cys (Sγ), were shown to be involved in modulation of the redox potential of the isoalloxazine ring. Notably and in contradistinction, an unusual 6-S-cysteinyl modification was only observed in the FMN cofactor of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and its homologues, dimethylamine dehydrogenase and histamine dehydrogenase (19.Mewies M. Basran J. Packman L.C. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7162-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20.Fujieda N. Satoh A. Tsuse N. Kano K. Ikeda T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10800-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This unusual 6-S-cysteinyl attachment has been suggested to prevent enzyme inactivation by hydroxylation at the C6 atom. Thus, GOOX possesses a novel form of covalent flavinylation; it is the first example of 6-S-cysteinyl FAD and the first double covalent linkage identified to date. Replacement of His70 with alanine, serine, cysteine, or tyrosine decreased the kcat value 50-600-fold but had little effect on the Km (4.Lee, M. H., Lai, W. L., Lin, S. F., Hsu, C. S., Liaw, S. H., and Tsai, Y. C. (2005) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. in pressGoogle Scholar). These four His70 mutants still contain a covalently linked FAD. These indicate that the covalent attachment via the 8α-methyl group with His70 is able to enhance the oxidative power of the flavin, as has been shown in other covalent flavoenzymes (18.Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the functional role of the 6-S-cysteinyl flavinylation in GOOX is still under investigation. Substrate Specificity—ABL resembles cellobionolactone, the oxidation product of cellobiose, with replacement of the endocyclic O5 with an NH group (Fig. 3). This replacement suppresses the spontaneous hydrolysis of ABL to cellobionic acid. ABL is the only inhibitor against GOOX activity found to date. Approximately 50% of glucose oxidation activity was lost in the presence of 25 mm ABL. In addition, ABL has been shown to be an inhibitor for CDH. The structure of CDH in complex with this inhibitor has been solved and used to delineate a reaction mechanism for CDH (21.Hallberg B.M. Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Vasella A. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7160-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the complex structure presented here, ABL is identified by its strong electron density that correlates well with the shape of d-glucopyranosyl rings, and is firmly embedded on the si face of the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 3A). The lactam moiety of ABL is bound in the -1 subsite. The lactam C1 atom, which corresponds to the site of oxidation in cellobiose, binds in front of the flavin N5 with a distance of 3.35 Å and an angle with the N5-N10 atoms of 105°. It should be noted that like for the CDH complex (21.Hallberg B.M. Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Vasella A. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7160-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the lactam C1 and O1 atoms are almost perfectly aligned with the flavin N5 and C4α, respectively. The lactam O1 atom interacts with Tyr429Oη (2.78 Å) and Gln384Nϵ2 (3.14 Å), and the endocyclic NH makes close contacts with the Tyr72Oη (3.34 Å) (Fig. 3B). The equatorial OH2 group forms hydrogen bonds with Thr129Oγ1 (2.84 Å), Arg245Nη1 (3.13 Å), and the isoalloxazine O4 (3.23 Å), the equatorial OH3 with Arg245Nη2 (3.15 Å) and Gln353Oϵ1 (2.86 Å), and the OH6 with Tyr72Oη (2.88 Å) and Tyr386Oη (3.67 Å). Thus, a total of nine hydrogen bonds are formed at the -1 subsite. In contrast, the -2 glucosyl moiety of ABL forms only one direct protein-carbohydrate hydrogen bond between OH6 and Gln353Oϵ1 (3.30 Å). Additionally, the OH2 and OH6 groups form two and three water-mediated hydrogen bonds, respectively. Tyr300 and Trp351 stack on the pyranose ring with an interplanar distance of 4.2-4.3 Å. This type of stacking interaction is very common in protein-carbohydrate recognition. The ABL binding does not induce any significant conformational change except for the side chain of Glu247. On the basis of the bound ABL molecule described above, a variety of carbohydrate molecules were modeled manually in the carbohydrate-binding groove, and the model was subjected to energy minimization with CNS. d-Glucose is the only monosaccharide substrate for GOOX (3.Lin S.F. Yang T.Y. Inukai T. Yamasaki M. Tsai Y.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1118: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Simulation of the complexes shows that other hexoses and derivatives form either fewer hydrogen bonds or unfavorable contacts with the residues surrounding the substrate-binding groove. The axial OH3 group in allose and the absence of an OH2 in 2-deoxy-d-glucose and of the exocyclic CH2OH in d-xylose would entail a small number of hydrogen bonds. The axial OH2 in mannose, the axial OH4 in galactose, and the equatorial NH2 in glucosamine would cause unfavorable contacts with Gln353, Trp351, and Arg245, respectively. Modification at the C1, C2, and C6 positions such as phosphorylation and N-acetylation would cause steric hindrance because of lack of appropriate space. Like CDH and galactose oxidase (21.Hallberg B.M. Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Vasella A. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7160-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22.Firbank S.J. Rogers M.S. Wilmot C.M. Dooley D.M. Halcrow M.A. Knowles P.F. McPherson M.J. Phillips S.E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12932-12935Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), GOOX possesses an open carbohydrate-binding groove, so that the non-reducing end of the glucose residue can stick out into the solvent and be exposed on the protein surface (Fig. 3C). This explains why the enzyme is able to utilize oligosaccharides as good substrates (4.Lee, M. H., Lai, W. L., Lin, S. F., Hsu, C. S., Liaw, S. H., and Tsai, Y. C. (2005) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. in pressGoogle Scholar). In contradistinction, the crystal structures of GOX and POX have revealed a “size-exclusion mechanism,” in which the shape of the active site cavity is such that the enzyme can only accept monosaccharides (23.Wohlfahrt G. Witt S. Hendle J. Schomburg D. Kalisz H.M. Hecht H.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 24.Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Catalytic Mechanism—Most of the FAD-dependent oxidases and dehydrogenases are proposed to function via a hydride transfer rather than by a carbanion mechanism (25.Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 26.Fitzpatrick P.F. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pH optimum of 10 for GOOX implies that a tyrosine residue may serve as a general base (3.Lin S.F. Yang T.Y. Inukai T. Yamasaki M. Tsai Y.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1118: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on the ABL binding, the substrate cellobiose was modeled into the active site. The reducing end C1 atom of the -1 sugar binds in front of the flavin N5 at a distance of 2.86 Å and an angle with the N5-N10 atoms of 113°. These values are in agreement with those typically observed for flavoenzymes, and appropriate for a direct hydride transfer (25.Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 26.Fitzpatrick P.F. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, no appropriate general base for carbanion formation can be identified. The hemiacetal OH1 group of the β-anomer at the -1 subsite could interact with Tyr429Oη1 (3.11 Å), Gln384Nϵ2 (3.69 Å), and the isoalloxazine O4 (3.11 Å), whereas that of the α anomer may make close contacts with Thr129Oγ (3.17 Å) and the isoalloxazine O4 (3.25 Å). The distance between the reducing end H1 of the β-anomer and the flavin N5 is 2.13 Å, whereas that for C1H of the α to the flavin N5 is 2.64 Å. Therefore, GOOX may preferentially oxidize the β-anomer possessing an equatorial hydroxyl group, with the conserved Tyr429 acting as a general base. As is common for flavoenzymes, the reaction mechanism of GOOX consists of two half-reactions (Scheme 1). The reductive half-reaction is involved in the oxidation of the free reducing end β-d-glucosyl residue to glucono-1,5-lactone by hydride transfer to the N5 atom, probably initiated by proton abstraction from the OH1 group by Tyr429. The lactone product is spontaneously hydrolyzed to gluconic acid. In the oxidative half-reaction, regeneration of the oxidized FAD by molecular oxygen yields hydrogen peroxide. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds between Asp355 and Tyr429 suggest that Asp355 may assist in proton transfer by lowering the pKa value of Tyr429 through a water molecule. Interactions between Gln384 and the reducing end OH1 group suggest that Gln384 may contribute to position the substrate and facilitate proton abstraction by Tyr429. His138, Tyr426, and the backbone NH of Tyr144 may be involved in stabilization of the anionic form of the reduced flavin. A large water-filled channel above the carbohydrate-binding groove and toward the flavin moiety may act as an entry point for the second substrate, molecular oxygen (Fig. 3C). Structural Conservation and Divergence in the PCMH Superfamily—A structural homology search by DALI (27.Dietmann S. Park J. Notredame C. Heger A. Lappe M. Holm L. (2001) Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) revealed that GOOX displays significant structural similarity to Zea mays cytokinin dehydrogenase (ZmCKX), Brevibacterium sterolicum cholesterol oxidase 2 (BsCOX2), Pseudomonas putida p-cresol methylhydroxylase (PpPCMH), Penicillium simplicissimum vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (PsVAO), and Escherichia coli d-lactate dehydrogenase (EcDLDH), with root mean square deviations of 2.8 Å (414 Cα atoms with 16% sequence identity), 3.5 Å (398 Cα atoms with 10% identity), 3.5 Å (398 Cα atoms with 16% identity), 3.4 Å (404 Cα atoms with 13% sequence identity), and 3.6 Å (369 Cα atoms with 12% identity), respectively (28.Malito E.

A. 2000; 97: 9413-9418Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The structural homologies of these flavoproteins seem to suggest a divergent evolutionary relation, and thereby are defined as the PCMH superfamily because the crystal structure of PpPCMH was the first one reported (33.Mathews F.S. Chen Z.W. Bellamy H.D. McIntire W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2338-2347Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the relative orientation between the F and S domains does vary greatly across the different structures. The F domain also shares structural homology to E. coli uridine diphospho-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (EcMurB), Oligotropha carboxidovorans CO dehydrogenase (OcCODH), and Bos taurus xanthine oxidase (BtXOX) (34.Benson T.E. Walsh C.T. Hogle J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35.Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The FAD binding modes are one of the least conserved properties among flavoproteins, and the flavinylation sites are often located in poorly conserved regions (18.Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 37.Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Although these PCMH members share a similar F domain, they contain different FAD binding types. In addition to the novel flavinylation in GOOX (6-S-cysteinyl, 8α-N1-histidyl FAD), the FAD cofactor utilizes its 8α-methyl group cross-linking to His105 in ZmCKX and His121 in BsCOX2 (8α-N1-histidyl FAD), to His422 in PsVAO (8α-N3-histidyl FAD), and to Tyr384 in PpPCMH (8α-O-tyrosyl FAD). The remaining members bind to FAD non-covalently. The F domain is much more superimposable than the S domain, perhaps because of distinct substrate binding but a similar FAD recognition mechanism across the enzymes. The eight β-strands (β2-β9, 60 structurally equivalent residues) of the F domain, overlay within 0.8-1.4 Å root mean square deviations (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, these members utilize many main-chain atoms for the FAD binding, and hence the sequences of the FAD-interacting residues are divergent, whereas their spatial positions are convergent in four regions (Figs. 1 and 4B). The first region is located in the loop between the β3 and β4 strands and shares similar features with the “P-loop,” which is highly conserved in nearly all nucleotide-binding proteins and responsible for interaction with the pyrophosphate group of the cofactor NDP moiety (38.Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second region involves the short αD helix, and the third region is at located the N terminus of the β9 strand. It is worth noting that the hydrogen bonds between the adenine N1 and N6 and the backbone of one residue at the N terminus of the β9 strand (Val195 in GOOX) are strictly conserved, even in EcMurB, OcCODH, and BtXOX. The last region is at the C-terminal tail, and the residues utilize the side chains for the cofactor binding. In contrast, the seven β-strands (β10-β16) of the S domain, particularly the β11 and β14-β16 stands, varies greatly across the different structures. These diverse four β-strands make up the majority of the substrate-binding site (Figs. 1 and 4B) and result in the highly divergent architectures of the substrate-binding site needed for the various different substrates ranging from a small lactate to the bulky cholesterol and long chain oligosaccharides. The closed conformations of ZmCKX, BsCOX2, PpPCMH, and PsVAO, limit the size of the substrate-binding pocket and thus result in a “size-exclusion mechanism” (28.Malito E. Coda A. Bilyeu K.D.

In contradistinction, GOOX has an open carbohydrate-binding groove to accommodate larger oligosaccharides. Convergent and Divergent Evolution in FAD-utilizing Sugar Oxidases—According to the structural fold, flavoenzymes have been classified into many superfamilies (37.Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Interestingly, folding topology does not correlate with enzyme function. For example, GOOX and BsCOX2 belong to the PCMH superfamily, whereas GOX, POX, CDH, and BsCOX1 belong to the glutathione reductase superfamily. Location of the active center at the re face of the isoalloxazine ring is generally conserved within the glutathione reductase superfamily, whereas that of the PCMH members is on the si side. Therefore, these structures provide elegant examples of convergent evolution, where starting from different ancestral folds, the same FAD-assisted glucose (or cholesterol) oxidation is achieved through opposite flavin faces within distinct substrate-binding sites. In addition, members of the PCMH superfamily have a remarkable tendency toward covalent flavinylation at the 8α-methyl group even for different types of flavinylation (18.Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas those of the glutathione reductase superfamily prefer a non-covalent binding mode. This may imply that the former FAD-binding fold facilitates flavinylation to optimize the active site for enhancement of its oxidative power. Interestingly, even starting from a similar structural fold, sugar oxidases evolve some dissimilar residues for interaction with the common substrates. Within the glutathione reductase superfamily, GOX, POX, and CDH catalyze the oxidation of glucose, and share a similar F domain; however, their S domains lack conserved carbohydrate-interacting residues except for the conserved histidine serving as a general base (21.Hallberg B.M.

Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, within the PCMH superfamily, although GOOX resembles NlNEC5, CcHEOX, and HaCHOX in substrate specificity and F domain, the protein sequences of their S domains are quite diverse (Fig. 4B). The sugar-binding resides Tyr72, Arg245, Gln384, and Tyr429 in GOOX, all at the -1 subsite, may also be conserved in NlNEC5, CcHEOX, and HaCHOX. However, the other residues including Thr129, Tyr300, Trp351, and Gln353, apparently are not conserved. Therefore, these sugar oxidases have evolved a similar FAD-assisted oxidation mechanism but different substrate recognition, resulting in distinct binding affinities to the mono- and disaccharides, with Km values ranging from 50 to 30 mm.

https://openalex.org/W2111765713,"During schistosomiasis, parasite-derived glycoconjugates play a key role in manipulation of the host immune response, associated with persistence of the parasite. Among the candidate host receptors that are triggered by glycoconjugates are C-type lectins (CLRs) on dendritic cells (DCs), which in concerted action with Toll-like receptors determine the balance in DCs between induction of immunity versus tolerance. Here we report that the CLR DC-SIGN mediates adhesion of DCs to authentic glycolipids derived from Schistosoma mansoni cercariae and their excretory/secretory products. Structural characterization of the glycolipids, in combination with solid phase and cellular binding studies revealed that DC-SIGN binds to the carbohydrate moieties of both glycosphingolipid species with Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc (LewisX) and Fucα1–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc (pseudo-LewisY) determinants. Importantly, these data indicate that surveying DCs in the skin may encounter schistosome-derived glycolipids immediately after infection. Recent analysis of crystals of the carbohydrate binding domain of DC-SIGN bound to LewisX provided insight into the ability of DC-SIGN to bind fucosylated ligands. Using molecular modeling we showed that the observed binding of the schistosome-specific pseudo-LewisY to DC-SIGN is not directly compatible with the model described. To fit pseudo-LewisY into the model, the orientation of the side chain of Phe313 in the secondary binding site of DC-SIGN was slightly changed, which results in a perfect stacking of Phe313 with the hydrophobic side of the galactose-linked fucose of pseudo-LewisY. We propose that pathogens such as S. mansoni may use the observed flexibility in the secondary binding site of DC-SIGN to target DCs, which may contribute to immune escape.

Schistosomiasis is a human parasitic disease caused by helminths of the genus Schistosoma that affect more than 200 million people worldwide (1Pearce E.J. MacDonald A.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). One of the most striking features of schistosomiasis is that the worms are experts in modulation and evasion of the host immune response, to enable their survival, migration, and development in different host tissues. Schistosomes have a complicated life cycle, requiring both a vertebrate and a snail host. Infection starts when cercariae released by the snail penetrate the host via the skin and transform into schistosomula. Schistosomula migrate to the portal system and develop to mature adult worms that mate and produce eggs. The eggs that become lodged within host tissues are primarily responsible for the development of a strong anti-inflammatory Th2 response that enables parasite survival and induces granuloma formation around the eggs, which is a major cause of pathology (1Pearce E.J. MacDonald A.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar).During infection the immune system is continuously challenged with an array of molecules associated with parasite metabolism and reproduction. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism behind this challenging of host immune responses, nor which cellular receptors are involved. Schistosomal glycoconjugates (glycoproteins and glycolipids) are shown to play important roles in host parasite interactions (2Cummings R.D. Nyame A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which may include evasion mechanisms exploited by the parasites. These glycoconjugates are often developmentally regulated antigens that are expressed during different life cycle stages. Proteins of different schistosoma life cycle stages carry both N- and O-glycans (2Cummings R.D. Nyame A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Hokke C.H. Deelder A.M. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 573-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, schistosomes synthesize highly immunogenic glycosphingolipids, especially in the egg and cercarial stage (4Makaaru C.K. Damian R.T. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The stage-associated synthesis of carbohydrate structures on these glycolipids is paralleled by changes in the ceramide structures during the life cycle (6Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Bickle Q. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Geyer R. Biochim. Biophys.

Schistosome glycosphingolipids have a typical core structure that differs from that in vertebrates. Remarkably, the glucocerebroside is not galactosylated to make lactosylceramide as in vertebrates, but is instead modified by addition of a GalNAc residue to generate GalNAcβ1–4Glcβ1-ceramide, the so-called “schisto-core” (4Makaaru C.K. Damian R.T. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

LeX antigens have been found in glycoconjugates of all life cycle stages, such as membrane-bound glycoproteins of adult schistosomes, secreted egg and gut glycoproteins (15Van Dam G.J. Bergwerff A.A.

Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LeX-containing glycoconjugates are shown to induce proliferation of B-cells from infected animals, which secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and to induce the production of IL-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from schistosome-infected individuals (16Velupillai P.

Immunol. 2000; 61: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In a murine schistosome model, LeX is an effective adjuvant for induction of a Th2 response (18Okano M. Satoskar A.R. Nishizaki K. Harn Jr., D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Recognition of an invading pathogen by cells of the immune system is mediated by receptors on antigen-presenting cells. On dendritic cells (DCs) two receptor families are involved in the recognition of pathogens, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize common pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and C-type lectins (CLRs) that bind to glycan antigens (19Figdor C.G. Van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). DCs express several TLRs, depending on their developmental stage and lineage (20Kadowaki N.

Several studies have shown that bacterial products induce maturation of DCs via TLRs (21Michelsen K.S. Aicher A. Mohaupt M. Hartung T. Dimmeler S. Kirschning C.J. Schumann R.R. J. Biol.

Recently it was shown that the schistosome-specific phosphatidylserine (PS) activates TLR2 and induces mature DCs to activate IL-10-producing regulatory T cells (24Van der Kleij D. Latz E. Brouwers J.F. Kruize Y.C. Schmitz M. Kurt-Jones E.A. Espevik T. de Jong E.C. Kapsenberg M.L. Golenbock D.T. Tielens A.G. Yazdanbakhsh M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48122-48129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). DCs also express a variety of CLRs that recognize glycan antigens in a Ca2+-dependent manner using highly conserved carbohydrate recognition domains (19Figdor C.G. Van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 25Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Several CLRs have been implicated to play a role in the recognition of pathogens. An important question still remaining is whether the principal function of CLRs is to capture pathogens, or to recognize self-antigens and suppress immunity (26Geijtenbeek T.B. Van Vliet S.J. Engering A. Hart B.A. Van Kooyk Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 33-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Current views are that the balance between triggering TLRs and CLRs may fine tune the immune response toward immune activation or tolerance. Recognition of glycans alone by DC lectins may favor immune suppression, whereas pathogen recognition in a situation of “danger” (when TLRs are triggered) induces immune activation (26Geijtenbeek T.B. Van Vliet S.J. Engering A. Hart B.A. Van Kooyk Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 33-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 27Van Kooyk Y. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar).As a first approach to understand the molecular basis of the role of LeX and other schistosome glycan antigens in interactions with their host, we set out to investigate the receptors on antigen-presenting cells that recognize the schistosome glycan antigens. Recently we showed that the DC-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin, CD209) binds to Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA) via LeX, but the actual ligands within SEA have not yet been identified (28Van Die I.

DC-SIGN is a human type II transmembrane CLR that contains only one C-terminal CRD and is abundantly expressed on immature DCs (iDCs). DC-SIGN has affinity for glycoconjugates containing mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and fucose and interacts with many pathogens. Multivalent binding of its ligands is thought to be achieved by the formation of tetramers (29Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol.

Using site-directed mutagenesis, molecular modeling, and docking of different Lewis antigens in the CRD of DC-SIGN we could demonstrate that the amino acid Val351 in DC-SIGN is essential for binding the Fucα1–3/4-GlcNAc moiety of the Lewis antigens LeX, Lea, Leb, and LeY (28Van Die I.

In this study we have demonstrated that DC-SIGN strongly binds to authentic cercarial glycosphingolipids of S. mansoni, but not to egg glycolipids. Structural characterization of the glycan moieties of the glycosphingolipid species revealed that a pentasaccharide containing LeX is one of the main ligands recognized by DC-SIGN. Unexpectedly, we found that DC-SIGN also binds to glycosphingolipid species carrying a hexasaccharide terminating with Fucα1–3Gal(β1–4)(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-R (pseudo-LeY), a glycan antigen that so far only has been found within schistosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Antibodies—iDCs were obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by a CD14 magnetic microbeads isolation (MACS; Miltenyibiotec) (33Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4475) Google Scholar). The obtained CD14+ monocytes were differentiated into iDCs in the presence of IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (500 and 800 units/ml, respectively; Schering-Plough, Belgium). At day 6, the phenotype of the cultured DCs was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. The DCs expressed high levels of major histocompatibility complex class I and II, CD11b, CD11c, and ICAM-1 and low levels of CD80 and CD86. Stable transfectants of K562 cells expressing DC-SIGN (34Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. Van Vliet S.J. Van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R.

The peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG-Fc or goat anti-mouse IgM were both from Jackson, West Grove, PA. The goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR.Glycolipid Purification—Lyophilized S. mansoni cercariae and eggs were kindly provided by Dr. Michael J. Doenhoff (School of Biological Science, University of Wales, Bangor, UK). S. mansoni excretory/secretory (ES) products were kindly provided by Dr. M. de Jong-Brink (FALW, VU University, Amsterdam, NL). The cercarial and egg glycolipids were purified by organic solvent extraction, saponification, desalting, and anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (5Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Neutral glycolipids were separated by HPLC (latrobeads 6RS-8010, 10 μm, 4.6 mm × 500 mm; Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a binary linear gradient from 100% solvent A (chloroform/methanol/water, 83:16:1, by volume) in 60 min to 60% solvent B (chloroform/methanol/water, 10:70:20, by volume) followed by a 20-min elution step with 100% solvent B.Release and Purification of LeX and Pseudo-LeY Oligosaccharides from the Ceramide Moieties—Oligosaccharides were released from cercarial and ES glycolipids by treatment with recombinant endoglycoceramidase II (from Rhodococcus spp., Takara Shuzu Co., Otsu, Shiga, Japan). Released oligosaccharides were separated from ceramide moieties by reversed-phase (RP-) chromatography as described previously (5Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). LeX and pseudo-LeY glycans were fractionated and separated from remaining glycolipid-derived oligosaccharide species by HPLC on a TSK-Amide 80 column (4 mm × 250 mm; Tosoh, Amsterdam, NL) using a linear gradient from 100% solvent A (35% acetic acid, buffered with triethylamine to pH 7.3 and 65% acetonitrile) to 100% solvent B (50% acetic acid, buffered with triethylamine to pH 7.3 and 50% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (500 μl) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and MS/MS.Neoglycolipid Synthesis—Pure glycolipid-derived oligosaccharide fractions containing either LeX or pseudo-LeY glycans (80 μg each) as well as lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII; 100 μg; Dextra Laboratories, Reading, UK) were used for synthesis of neoglycolipids by coupling to 1,2-sn-dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine via reductive amination (36Stoll M.S. Mizuochi T. Childs R.A. Feizi T. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Resulting products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Total egg and cercarial glycolipids were diluted in ethanol on NUNC maxisorb plates (Roskilde, Denmark), and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C to coat the glycolipids to the plate. Plates were blocked with 1% ELISA grade bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid-free; Calbiochem) and incubated with DC-SIGN-Fc (3 μg/ml) (32Geijtenbeek T.B. Van Duijnhoven G.C. Van Vliet S.J.

Binding was detected using a peroxidase-labeled goat antihuman IgG-Fc (Jackson). Separated glycolipid fractions (8.5 ng) and neoglycolipids were coated on polysorb plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and similarly analyzed by ELISA for reactivity with DC-SIGN-Fc (3 μg/ml) using peroxidase-conjugated antihuman IgG (4.6 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). EDTA (10 mm, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added when indicated to investigate whether the binding was calcium-dependent.MALDI-TOF-MS and MS/MS Analysis—MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was performed on an Ultraflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser and a LIFT-MS/MS facility as described previously. 3Geyer, H., Wuhrer, M., Resemann, A., and Geyer, R. (August 31, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M5.5985200 The instrument was operated in the positive-ion reflector mode throughout using 6-aza-2-thiothymine (Sigma-Aldrich) as matrix. About 100–500 spectra were summarized in each case.Cellular Adhesion Assay—96-well plates (NUNC maxisorb) were coated overnight at room temperature with S. mansoni cercarial and egg glycolipids, pseudo-LeY neoglycolipid, LeX neoglycolipid, or globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells labeled with Calceine AM (Molecular Probes), were added for 1.5 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 20 μg/ml mAbs AZN-D1. Non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing. Adherent cells were lysed, and fluorescence was quantified on a Fluostar spectrofluorimeter (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). Results are expressed as the mean percentage of adhesion of triplicate wells.Isolation of Schistosoma mansoni Cercarial ES Products—Free cercariae were obtained from S. mansoni parasitized Biomphalaria glabrata snails by inducing the shedding process basically as described by Sluiters et al. (37Sluiters J.F. Brussaard-Wust C.M. Meuleman E.A. Z. Parasitenkd. 1980; 63: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The free swimming cercariae obtained were transferred to 60 ml of water. After 5 h, the cercariae/schistosomula were removed, and the remaining water containing the ES products was concentrated.Molecular Modeling—The coordinates of the crystal structure of human DC-SIGN interacting with the LeX-containing pentasaccharide LNFPIII (38Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Blixt O. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) (code 1SL5) were taken from the Protein Data Bank (39Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26670) Google Scholar). The structure was edited using Sybyl software (Tripos Inc., St Louis), to contain only one protein monomer together with calcium ions, the LeX trisaccharide, and the two water molecules that play an important role in bridging O4 of galactose to the protein surface. Protein hydrogen atoms were added, the peptide atoms partial charges were calculated using the Pullman procedure, and the calcium ions were given a charge of 2. Atom types and charges for oligosaccharides were defined using the PIM parameters developed for carbohydrates (40Imberty A. Mikros E. Koca J. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Perez S. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Pseudo-LeY was built by adding one fucose on position 3 of the terminal galactose residue. The systematic search procedure of Sybyl was used to vary the two torsion angles at this glycosidic linkage together with the two torsion angles of the Phe313 side chain. Only one conformational family was identified. Subsequent energy minimization was performed using the Tripos force field (41Clark M. Cramer R.D.I. Van den Opdenbosch N.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2796) Google Scholar) with geometry optimization of the sugar and the side chains of amino acids in the binding sites. A distance-dependent dielectric constant was used in the calculations. Energy minimizations were carried out using the Powell procedure until a gradient deviation of 0.05 kcal·mol–1·Å–1 was attained.RESULTSRecognition of S. mansoni Cercarial Glycolipids by DC-SIGN—To investigate their binding to DC-SIGN, authentic glycolipids from S. mansoni cercariae, and eggs were isolated by organic solvent extraction (5Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and assayed by ELISA using soluble DC-SIGN-Fc. In parallel, unrelated glycolipids, such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), Forssman antigen (FA), and bovine gangliosides (BG) were tested together with a synthetic LNFPIII-neoglycolipid to evaluate the binding specificity of DC-SIGN as well as the potential influence of the structure of the lipid moiety in this assay. The results revealed that DC-SIGN-Fc strongly binds cercarial glycosphingolipids and the LNFPIII-neoglycolipid, whereas a weak binding was observed to egg-derived glycolipids. The remaining types of glycolipids were not recognized at all (Fig. 1, A and B). Hence, it can be concluded that recognition by DC-SIGN is mediated by the carbohydrate unit and independent of the lipid part of the respective molecules.Characterization and Fractionation of Total Cercarial Glycolipids—To allow the subsequent analysis of the glycolipid species that bind DC-SIGN, total cercarial glycolipids were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 2). In agreement with previous studies (5Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a complex pattern of different glycolipids was registered mainly because of the high heterogeneity of the present ceramide moieties. Prevailing species exhibited monosaccharide compositions of Hex2HexNAc2dHex1, Hex2HexNAc3dHex1, and Hex2HexNAc2dHex2, thus reflecting ceramide pentahexoside and hexahexoside species with the LeX or pseudo-LeY determinants as described (5Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of major and minor signals was registered which reflected the presence of additional glycolipids with diverging ceramide and carbohydrate compositions. Based on previous studies on the ceramide composition of cercarial glycolipids (7Wuhrer M. Dennis R.D. Doenhoff M.J. Geyer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1524: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) the cluster of ions at m/z 1978.9 can be concluded to comprise species with monosaccharide compositions of Hex1HexNAc3dHex4 and Hex2HexNAc3dHex3, which is corroborated by the detection of the respective free oligosaccharides after endoglycoceramidase treatment (TABLE ONE). To obtain individual glycolipid fractions, cercarial glycolipids were subjected to HPLC separation, and the isolated fractions were analyzed by ELISA for their capacity to bind DC-SIGN (Fig. 3A). The results revealed that DC-SIGN mainly recognized glycolipids that occurred in HPLC fractions 40–50, whereas species with elongated carbohydrate units did not react. Subsequent analysis of fractions 40–50 by MALDI-TOF-MS demonstrated that each fraction comprised a mixture of glycolipids carrying LeX or pseudo-LeY moieties (Fig. 3, B–E). Because of the observed ceramide heterogeneity, a clear separation into fractions containing solely LeX or pseudo-L"
https://openalex.org/W2035174076,"N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critical for neuronal plasticity and survival, whereas their excessive activation produces excitotoxicity and may accelerate neurodegeneration. Here, we report that stimulation of NMDARs in cultured rat hippocampal or cortical neurons and in the adult mouse brain in vivo disinhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) by protein phosphatase 1(PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of GSK3β at the serine 9 residue. NMDA-triggered GSK3β activation was mediated by NMDAR that contained the NR2B subunit. Interestingly, GSK3β inhibition reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of the PP1 inhibitor 2 (I2) and attenuated serine 9 dephosphorylation by PP1. These data suggest existence of a feedback loop between GSK3β and PP1 that results in amplification of PP1 activation by GSK3β. In addition, GSK3β inhibition decreased PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) at the serine 133 residue in NMDA-stimulated neurons. Conversely, overexpression of GSK3β abolished non-NR2B-mediated activation of CRE-driven transcription. These data suggest that cross-talk between GSK3β and PP1 contributes to NR2B NMDAR-induced inhibition of CREB signaling by non-NR2B NMDAR. The excessive activation of NR2B-PP1-GSK3β-PP1 circuitry may contribute to the deficits of CREB-dependent neuronal plasticity in neurodegenerative diseases.

Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In addition to its role in synaptic transmission, glutamate can also induce neuronal plasticity and promote neuronal survival during development.

Whereas the NR2A-containing NMDARs stimulate CRE-driven transcription and enhance neuronal survival, the NR2B NMDARs may inhibit CRE-mediated transcription and trigger excitotoxic cell death (3Hardingham G.E.

For instance, Huntington disease (HD)-associated mutant forms of huntingtin inhibit transcription of CRE-regulated genes, which are required for proper neuronal function and long term neuronal survival (4Nucifora Jr., F.C.

Stimulation of NR2A NMDAR results in increased levels of phospho-Ser133 (pSer133) whereas stimulation of NR2B NMDAR reduces pSer133 (3Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). The latter effect may be because of activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that has been shown to target pSer133 in NMDAR-stimulated hippocampal or cerebellar neurons (9Sala C. Rudolph-Correia S.

For instance, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of a PP1 inhibitor 1 (I1) increases its potency to block PP1 (11Cohen P. Annu. Rev.

This occurred through GSK-mediated increase of I2 phosphorylation, PP1 activation, PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of pSer9, and further activation of GSK3β (26Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N.

As the mechanism of NR2B-mediated inhibition of CRE transcription is not fully understood, we investigated a possibility that CREB dephosphorylation following NR2B stimulation is regulated by GSK3β. We report the NR2B NMDAR-triggered activation of GSK3β that was mediated by PP1. We also show that GSK3β further amplified PP1 activity and enhanced CREB dephosphorylation by PP1.

All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cortical or hippocampal neurons were prepared from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats as described (29Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Culture medium was Basal Medium Eagle (BME) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, Ut), 35 mm glucose, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cell-plating densities were 2 × or 0.8 × 106 per 35-mm plate for cortical or hippocampal neurons, respectively. Cytosine arabinoside (2.5 μm) was added to cultures on the second day after seeding (DIV2) to inhibit the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Additional glucose (4.5 mm) was added at DIV2 and then at DIV6. Cells were used for experiments at DIV6–8. Transient transfections were performed on DIV4 using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) (30Hetman M. Hsuan S.L. Habas A. Higgins M.J. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49577-49584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Drug Treatment—Dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), ifenprodil, Ro-25-6981, NBQX, CNQX, FK506, tautomycin, SB216763, and okadaic acid were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO in the medium was 0.2–0.4%. NMDA and glutamate were dissolved in culture medium. For experiments with tautomycin and SB216763, cells were placed in serum-free culture medium (BME supplemented with 35 mm glucose, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μm cytosine arabinoside). Tautomycin or SB216763 were added 1 or 2 h before NMDA, respectively. All other drug inhibitors were added 30 min before the stimulation of NMDAR with NMDA or glutamate. Injections of Quinolinic Acid—Adult male FVB mice (6–8 weeks old, weighing 20 g) (n = 12) were deeply anesthetized with freshly prepared 4.0 mg of Avertin (tribromoethanol) (31Papaioannou V.E. Fox J.G. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1993; 43: 189-192PubMed Google Scholar) per 10 g of body weight dissolved in 0.2 ml of 1.25% (v/v) 2-methyl-2-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich) in saline. These mice were stereotactically injected using a 10-μl Hamilton syringe with 1 μl of saline containing 0 or 30 nmol of quinolinic acid (cat. P63204, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 coordinates (all from Bregma): for striatal injections 0.7 mm rostral, 1.9 mm lateral (left and right), 2.5 mm ventral, and for hippocampal injections 2.0 mm caudal, 1.5 mm lateral (left and right), 1.6 mm ventral. The injection of quinolinic acid was performed over 2 min, and the injection needle was retained in position for 2 min before and after injection. Mice were decapitated 1 h after injection and dissected on ice. The striata, hippocampi, and cerebellum were isolated, frozen on dry ice, and kept at –80 °C for future protein extraction. GSK3β Kinase Assay—GSK3β activity was quantitated using an immune complex kinase assay as described previously (32Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Analysis and Immunostaining—Western blot analysis were performed as described (29Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z.

To detect the phosphorylation shift of I2 by Western blotting, 15% polyacrylamide gels were used. For all other epitopes, proteins were separated on 10% gels. Promoter Assays—Promoter assays were performed as described (35Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 × 106 cells were plated onto each well of a 24-well plate coated with poly-d-lysine. At DIV4-DIV5, neurons were co-transfected with the CRE-Luc (0.8 μg/4 wells) and EF1αLacZ DNA (0.55 μg/4 wells) with or without GSK3β (0.12–0.2 μg/4 wells) expression plasmid. Three days after transfection neurons were treated with NMDA for 20 h. The luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity that was assayed using a kit from Promega. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of the data was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). NMDAR Stimulation Activates GSK3β—To test the possibility that GSK3β participates in signaling activated by NMDARs, we evaluated the effects of NMDA on GSK3β activity. As others have shown that reduced levels of the inhibitory GSK3β phosphorylation at serine 9 correlate with its activation (22Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 23Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), we measured the levels of phosphoSer9 (pSer9) in NMDA-stimulated neurons. Western blot analysis with an antibody specific for pSer9 revealed decreased levels of this phosphorylation in cultured neurons that were stimulated with NMDA (Fig. 1, A and B). A 60% decrease was evident in both hippocampal and cortical neurons 20 min after addition of 100 μm NMDA (Fig. 1, A and B). The reduced pSer9 levels were observed up to 6 h after initiation of the treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). Dose response experiments showed that the decrease in pSer9 was triggered by NMDA concentrations as low as 10 μm (Fig. 1C). Also, glutamate, a physiological ligand of NMDAR, reduced pSer9 in cortical neurons (Fig. 1D). The glutamate effect was mediated by NMDAR as NMDAR, but not non-NMDA receptor antagonists, prevented the pSer9 decline (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that NMDAR stimulation in cultured cortical or hippocampal neurons reduced the pSer9-dependent inhibition of GSK3β. As it was reported that GSK3β may be activated through the phosphorylation at Tyr216 residue (36Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), we evaluated NMDA effects on pTyr216 levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr216 was not affected by NMDA in cortical or hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1E). This suggests that NMDAR signaling does not involve modulation of pTyr216. To test whether NMDAR stimulation in the adult brain in vivo can also produce a decrease in GSK3β pSer9 levels, we injected a NMDAR agonist, quinolinic acid (QA) into neostriatum and hippocampus of adult mice. Intrastriatal injections of QA produce a pathology with a striking resemblance to HD (37Brouillet E. Conde F. Beal M.F. Hantraye P. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 427-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Intrahippocampal QA injections result in seizures and loss of pyramidal neurons (38Schwarcz R. Brush G.S. Foster A.C. French E.D. Exp. Neurol. 1984; 84: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As a negative control we used cerebellum that is far from the forebrain injection sites. One hour after QA administration, there was a significant decline of pSer9 levels that reached 39 or 51% of control values in striata or hippocampi, respectively (Fig. 2). The cerebellar pSer9 levels in QA-treated mice were similar to those in control animals (Fig. 2). These data indicate that NMDAR stimulation in the adult mouse brain rapidly activates GSK3β by dephosphorylation of pSer9. To verify that the NMDAR-triggered decrease of pSer9 was accompanied by an elevation of GSK3β activity, we performed a GSK3β immunoprecipitation kinase assay. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the kinase activity of GSK3β increased as early as 5 min after 100 μm NMDA treatment (159% increase, p < 0.01, Fig. 3A). The maximal increase of 172% was seen at 20 min after addition of 100 μm NMDA (p < 0.001, Fig. 3A). The elevated GSK activity was still present at 60 min (128%, p < 0.05, Fig. 3A) and declined to control values 3 h after treatment. The reduction of GSK3β activity was despite the persistent dephosphorylation of pSer9 (Fig. 1A). This discrepancy is likely because of decreased levels of the total GSK3β protein observed at 1 and 3 h after NMDA stimulation (Fig. 1A). The reduction of GSK3β levels may be caused by the degradation of this protein during excitotoxicity, which is induced by 100 μm NMDA. 3A. Habas, E. Szatmari, and M. Hetman, unpublished observation. To determine if stimulation of NMDAR increased GSK3β activity in intact neurons, we evaluated the effects of NMDA on Tau phosphorylation at the Ser202 residue. This phosphorylation has been shown to be carried out by GSK3β (39Cross D.A. Culbert A.A. Chalmers K.A. Facci L. Skaper S.D. Reith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In cortical neurons, phospho-Tau levels increased by 42% at 5 min after treatment with 100 μm NMDA (p < 0.01) suggesting GSK3β activation. At later time points, phospho-Tau levels decreased (data not shown), which is consistent with reports that PP2B or PP1/PP2A dephosphorylate Tau after NMDAR stimulation (40Fleming L.M. Johnson G.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 41Adamec E. Mercken M. Beermann M.L. Didier M. Nixon R.A. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of Tau phosphatases may antagonize the effects of GSK3β on Ser202. Together, these data indicate that activation of NMDAR can increase the kinase activity of GSK3β. GSK3β Activation Is a Specific Response to Stimulation of NR2B NMDARs—NMDARs are heterotetramers of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits (1Westbrook G.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Mori H. Mishina M. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1219-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). There is one gene for NR1 subunit and four genes for NR2 subunits including NR2A, -B, -C, and -D. We found that NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C were expressed in cultured cortical or hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4A), whereas NR2D expression was undetectable (data not shown). This suggests that cultured neurons possess diverse NMDARs that may trigger distinct responses to NMDA. Therefore, we determined which NMDARs may mediate GSK3β activation by NMDA in neurons. The NMDA-induced decrease in GSK3β pSer9 levels was abolished by an NR2B-selective NMDAR blockers, ifenprodil or Ro-256981 (Fig. 4, B and C). The effect was present in both hippocampal and cortical neurons and was identical to that of APV, which is a non-selective NMDAR antagonist (Fig. 4, B and C). This suggests that pSer9 dephosphorylation in NMDA-treated neurons is mediated by NMDARs that contain the NR2B subunit. NMDARs act as ion channels, which upon activation increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (42Mori H. Mishina M. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1219-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Because the rising [Ca2+]i is critical for mobilization of NMDAR-activated signaling pathways (42Mori H. Mishina M. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1219-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), we tested whether Ca2+ influx by routes other than NMDAR can reduce pSer9 levels. Treatment with 55 mm KCl in the presence of a NMDAR antagonist, APV (100 μm) increases [Ca2+]i through the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) (43Kudo Y. Ogura A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 89: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Indeed, hippocampal neurons treated for 60 min with KCl plus AVP showed activation of ERK1/2 signaling, indicating a rise in [Ca 2+]i (Fig. 4D). However, this treatment did not significantly affect pSer9 levels (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the NMDA-mediated decrease in pSer9 is a specific response to stimulation of NR2B NMDAR and not a general Ca2+-mediated response. PP1 Mediates NMDAR-induced GSK Activation—The NMDA-triggered decrease in pSer9 levels may be caused either by inhibition of Ser9 kinases or by stimulation of Ser9 phosphatases. As a first step to differentiate between these two possibilities, we examined the activity of Akt, the main GSK3β Ser kinase in cultured neurons (30Hetman M. Hsuan S.L. Habas A. Higgins M.J. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49577-49584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because in some cell types ERK1/2 signaling may increase GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation (25Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 44Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 45Eldar-Finkelman H. Seger R.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we also studied the status of ERK1/2 after NMDA treatment. The activities of Akt and ERK1/2 were monitored by Western blotting with antibodies specifically recognizing the phosphorylated, activated forms of these kinases. NMDAR stimulation did not affect Akt whereas it activated ERK1/2 at 5, 20, or 60 min after treatment (Fig. 5A). However, pSer9 levels were significantly reduced at these time points (Fig. 1A). Therefore, inhibition of Ser9 kinases including Akt or ERK1/2-activated p90RSK is not a likely explanation for GSK3β activation by NMDA. NMDARs activate several protein phosphatases including PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (47Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 48Thiels E. Norman E.D. Barrionuevo G. Klann E. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors OA, tautomycin, and FK506 on the NMDA-triggered pSer9 decline. If applied to cultured cells, 1 μm OA inhibits PP2A and PP1, whereas at the lower concentrations it acts selectively on PP2A (49Sheppeck J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Indeed, OA at concentrations ≥10 nm significantly increased phosphorylation of a recognized PP2A target, ERK1/2 (Ref. 50Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar and Fig. 5B). Similarly, OA applied at the concentrations ≥10 nm increased basal pSer9 levels (Fig. 5, C and D). The increase was concentration-dependent reaching maximal values at 1 μm (10.9- or 5.7-fold of control levels in cortical or hippocampal neurons, respectively; Fig. 5, C and D). These data suggest that under basal conditions, Ser9 dephosphorylation may be carried out by both PP2A and PP1. On the other hand, the NMDA-induced reduction in pSer9 levels was abolished by 1 μm OA but not by lower OA concentrations (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, a PP1-specific inhibitor, tautomycin (51Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) did not affect the basal pSer9 or pERK1/2 levels (Fig. 5E). In contrast, tautomycin prevented pSer9 decline in NMDA-treated neurons (Fig. 5E). PP2B inhibition by FK506 did not affect pSer9 levels in basal conditions or after NMDAR activation (Fig. 5F). These data suggest that a PP1-like phosphatase activity mediates the NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of pSer9 whereas a PP2A-like phosphatase dephosphorylates pSer9 under basal conditions. GSK3β Enhances PP1 Activation in NMDAR-stimulated Neurons—GSK3β can stimulate PP1 activity by phosphorylation of I2 (11Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Goo"

Microscopic analysis revealed that Pma1p moved from the plasma membrane to intracellular punctate regions and finally localized to the vacuole.

The synthetic lipid edelfosine (also known as 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine or ET-18-OCH3) is a prototypical member of the alkylphosphocholine class of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Alkylphosphocholines are effective drugs as they contain ether-linked fatty acids, as opposed to ester-linked fatty acids prevalent in endogenous phospholipids, and thus are much more resistant to cellular degradation by phospholipases (1Arthur G. Bittman R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Zaremberg V. McMaster C.R. J. Biol.

Because of their similarity in structure to phosphatidylcholine (PC), 5The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. the main experimentations to determine a mechanism of action for edelfosine and other alkylphosphocholines have focused on PC metabolism. This course of action was supported by observations that only alkylphospholipids with choline head groups, but not head groups found on other phospholipids such as ethanolamine or serine, were effective antitumor agents (1Arthur G. Bittman R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Edelfosine and other choline-containing alkylphospholipids were found to inhibit PC synthesis and this correlated with inhibition of cell growth in various cancer cell lines (4Boggs K.P. Rock C.O.

Further metabolic labeling demonstrated that alkylphosphocholine drugs can inhibit the synthesis of PC-derived sphingomyelin, and this correlated with increased ceramide mass. Inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis by the addition of the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 decreased ceramide levels and this was associated with increased resistance to alkylphosphocholines (8Wieder T. Orfanos C.E. Geilen C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11025-11031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As ceramide is a lipid second messenger whose accumulation can result in cytostasis or apoptosis (9Kolesnick R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 10Cremesti A.E. Goni F.M. Kolesnick R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), an increase in cellular ceramide-mediated signaling was an alternate hypothesis proposed for alkylphosphocholine-mediated cell death (8Wieder T. Orfanos C.E. Geilen C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11025-11031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of alkylphosphocholine-mediated cytotoxicity we performed a genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to isolate genes that increased edelfosine susceptibility. The genetic screen provided evidence that ceramide structure and sphingolipid metabolism modulate edelfosine sensitivity and implicate lipid rafts as a site of action for edelfosine. Edelfosine addition resulted in the movement of plasma membrane sterols into the cell, suggesting that edelfosine-mediated cytotoxicity is through modification of the biophysical structure of lipid rafts. Analysis of lipid raft protein composition revealed that edelfosine was responsible for the selective partitioning of the plasma membrane lipid raft protein Pma1p from plasma membrane rafts to the vacuole. Yeast defective in endocytosis and vacuolar protease activity prevented edelfosine-mediated sterol movement, Pma1p loss from lipid rafts, and cellular cytotoxicity. Our results indicate a novel mode of action for an antitumor drug through drug insertion into lipid rafts and selective displacement of an essential protein from lipid rafts. These results are consistent with an emerging phenomenon whereby the activity of biological signal processes that assemble on lipid raft scaffolds (9Kolesnick R. J. Clin.

Plasmids and Yeast Strains—Yeast strain W303-1a (MATa ura3-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100) was used for the genetic screen. Other strains used were RH1800 (MATa leu2 his4 ura3-52 bar1), RH3809 (MATa lcb1-100 leu2 his4 ura3 bar1), RH448 (MATa his4 lys2 leu2 ura3 bar1), RH732 (MATa his4 lys2 leu2 ura3 bar1 pep4::URA3), RH2765 (MATa his4 leu2 ura3 lys2 bar1 sla2-3 (end4)), RH2763 (MATa his4 leu2 ura3 bar1 pep4::URA3 sla2-1 (end4)), SEY6210 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3-100 trp1-901 lys2-801 suc2-9), SEY6210-PMA1-dsRFP (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3-100 trp1-901 lys2-801 suc2-9 PMA1::tdimer2 (12)::kanMX4), and BY4741 (MATa his3Δ0 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0). Multicopy PMA1 plasmid pCM10.4 was kindly provided by Dr. Raffael Schaffrath, Martin-Luther University, Germany (48Zink S. Mehlgarten C. Kitamoto H.K. Nagase J. Jablonowski D. Dickson R.C. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The AST1 gene ± 500 bp was amplified with specific primers (AST1-forward, 5′-GACTTAGCAACGCAAGCAGAAAAGAAGGTTTGC-3′, and AST1-reverse, 5′-GCCATATCTTCTCGAGACTCTGAATTCATTTTTGCTGG-3′) using BY4741 genomic DNA as template. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pRS426 (HindIII and NotI sites). Yeast were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise indicated. Yeast Genetic Screens—Yeast cells were transformed with a high copy genomic library and transformants were subsequently replica plated to plates with or without 80 μg/ml edelfosine (the kind gift of Medmark Pharma GmbH). We should note that we and others (11Fyrst H. Oskouian B. Kuypers F.A. Saba J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5864-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have observed that the effect of lipids on cell growth in solid media can be affected by cell density. Plasmids were isolated from yeast cells on the master plates that corresponded to the same yeast strain that did not grow on plates containing edelfosine. The recovered plasmids were transformed into yeast to ensure that edelfosine sensitivity was because of plasmid borne gene(s) using a serial dilution approach. Plasmids from colonies that displayed increased sensitivity to the drug were isolated and their DNA sequence determined. Out of 105 colonies only 2 displayed increased sensitivity to the drug. Plasmids from those colonies were isolated and their DNA sequence was determined. One plasmid contained only one complete gene identified as SCS7, whereas the other plasmid carried three different genes. The specific gene responsible for the phenotype is currently being identified. Yeast lipid biosynthetic protein encoding deletion strains were also screened for edelfosine sensitivity in synthetic minimal medium using isogenic derivatives of BY4741 (MATa his3Δ0 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and included cki1, pct1, cpt1, eki1, ect1, ept1, cho2, opi3, psd1, psd2, faa1-4, gat1, gat2, ayr1, lro1, dpp1, lpp1, ino1, ino2, ino4, opi1, pgs1, crd1, lsb6, sac1, vps34, fab1, tsc3, ypc1, ydc1, lag1, elo2, elo3, scs7, sur2, lcb3, ysr3, lcb4, lcb5, ipt1, dpl1, csg2, and all viable erg mutants including erg2, erg3, erg4, erg5, erg6, and erg24. These strains were obtained from EUROSCARF. Lipid Raft Isolation and Western Blots—Yeast detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) isolation was conducted as described (12Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Log phase growing cultures were incubated with or without the indicated edelfosine concentrations for the indicated times and temperatures in the defined medium. In general, edelfosine had a concentration-dependent effect on cell viability, and induced a decrease in protein content/cell after 5 h. Cells (10-20 optical density units as 600 nm) were washed in cold 1 m sorbitol containing 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm NaF and stored at -20 °C. Cells were lysed in 350 μl of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin) by vortexing with glass beads eight times for 30 s with 30-s intervals on ice. The lysate was cleared of unbroken cells and debris by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Protein mass was determined and 300-600 μg of protein in 500 μl of TNE buffer was incubated with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) for 30 min on ice. The lysate was subsequently adjusted to 40% Optiprep (Nycomed) by adding 1 ml of 60% Optiprep solution, overlaid with 2.4 ml of 30% Optiprep in TXNE (TNE with 0.1% Triton X-100), and then with 400 μl of TXNE. The samples were centrifuged at 166,000 × g for 2 h in a swinging bucket TLS55 rotor (Beckman) and 7-10 fractions of equal volume were collected from the top of the gradient. The interface between the 0 and 30% Optiprep contained the DRMs and was easily identified optically and collected as fraction 2. From each gradient fraction 30 μl was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in Laemmli buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blots were incubated with antibodies to Pma1p, Gas1p (the kind gifts of Ramón Serrano, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia and Howard Riezman, University of Geneva, respectively), or Pgk1p (Molecular Probes) and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence. The effect of edelfosine on Pma1p, Gas1p, and Pgk1p DRM fractionation was consistently observed in 10 separate experiments. DRMs were also isolated as described (13Kubler E. Dohlman H.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32975-32980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) except total crude membranes instead of the whole cell extract were used for the detergent extraction analysis. Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase, and an amount of cells equivalent to 50 A600 units was untreated or incubated in the presence of 20 μg/ml edelfosine for the indicated times. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and once with 1 m sorbitol containing 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm NaF, and the cell pellet was stored at -20 °C. Cells were resuspended in 350 μl of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)), and broken with the aid of Fastprep (four 15-s pulses, 5.5 speed) in the presence of glass beads at 4 °C. Unbroken cells were removed by a 500 × g spin for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant, total cell lysate, was centrifuged for 3 h at 4 °C in an SW40 rotor at 35,000 rpm (218,000 × g) to pellet cellular crude membranes. The pellet was resuspended in Mes-buffered saline (MBS; 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) including 60% sucrose, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. After 1 h at 4°C, membranes were further disrupted with several strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. Then, 350 μl of the extracted membranes were mixed with 2.27 ml of 60% sucrose in MBS, placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with a sucrose step gradient from 5 to 50% sucrose in MBS (0.89 ml at 5%, 0.89 ml at 30%, 1.78 ml at 40%, 1.78 ml at 45%, and 3.54 ml at 50%). Sucrose gradients were centrifuged in an SW40 rotor at 38,000 rpm (257,000 × g) for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima LE-80K ultracentrifuge, and then 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and 20 μl of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. For incorporation of edelfosine in lipid rafts, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml [3H]edelfosine (5.3 × 105 dpm/μmol) for the indicated times and subjected to lipid raft isolation as above. Microscopy—Cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy for the localization of Pma1p as described (14Howe A.G. Zaremberg V. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44100-44107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope fitted with a plan-neofluor ×100 oil immersion objective lens. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Cam HR and using Zeiss Axiovision 3.1 or 4.1 software. Adobe Photoshop 7.0 was used for image alignment and labeling. Cells carrying a genomic PMA1 gene fused to double-stranded RFP (15Malinska K. Malinsky J. Opekarova M. Tanner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4427-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) were viewed using an LSM510-Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a ×100 PlanApochromat objective (numerical aperture 1.4). Fluorescence signals of RFP (excitation 543 nm, HeNe laser) were detected using long-pass 585-nm emission filters. Zeiss LSM 5 Image Browser and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 were used for image alignment and labeling of confocal images. Quinacrine (Sigma) was freshly prepared as a 2 mm stock in YPD8 (phosphate-buffered YPD, pH 8.0). One A600 of late log control cells (BY4741) or cells treated with 20 μg/ml edelfosine in YPD for 20 min at 30 °C were centrifuged and resuspended in YPD8 ± edelfosine containing 50 μm quinacrine for 5 min. Cells were imaged live using the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel of a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope fitted with a plan-neofluor ×100 oil immersion objective lens within 5 min of quinacrine addition. Filipin (Sigma) was freshly prepared as a 1 mg/ml stock in ethanol. Filipin was added to live cells at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were then concentrated by brief centrifugation and imaged live in the UV channel within 5 min of filipin addition (16Takeda T. Kawate T. Chang F. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To avoid vibration of the cells for acquisition of stacks used in deconvoluted images, cells were placed in slabs of solid medium made as described (17Tatchell K. Robinson L.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 661-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling—Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase and treated with the indicated edelfosine concentrations for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with 10 μm [14C]choline (1 × 104 dpm/nmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals). Subsequent to incubation with radiolabel the cells were concentrated by centrifugation and washed twice with cold 1 m sorbitol containing 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm NaF. Labeled metabolites were extracted, analyzed, and quantitated as described (2Zaremberg V. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39035-39044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). [3H]Edelfosine (5.3 × 105 dpm/μmol) was used for both drug uptake and lipid raft incorporation. In both cases, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml [3H]edelfosine for the indicated times, and after washing 3-5 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin to wash off cell surface-bound edelfosine, drug uptake was determined in the cell pellet by radioactivity counting as previously described (18Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Edelfosine was synthesized by tritation of the 9-octadecenyl derivative (Amersham Buchler). Pulse-Chase Assays—Exponential cultures of cells growing at 30 °C in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine and cysteine were concentrated and resuspended in fresh medium and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Cells were then pulse labeled with 50 μCi per A600 Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min and chased with subsequent addition of methionine and cysteine at a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) each. Aliquots of cells (A600 of 3) were taken at different times and transferred to tubes containing ice-cold 10 mm NaF/NaN3 in 1 m sorbitol. Isolation of DRMs was conducted as described above with loading of the gradient fractions with equal radiolabel between time points. DRM containing fractions were analyzed by either direct SDS-PAGE separation (30 μl aliquots) or immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation analysis aliquots (200 μl) were incubated with 1% SDS at 55 °C for 5 min and diluted to a final concentration of 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% SDS. After clearing with Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem), Pma1p was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using a Pma1p-specific polyclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a Molecular Imager FX system using Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad). Mass Spectrometry—Following separation by SDS-PAGE the protein was digested in situ with trypsin in the gel slice using a Genomics Solutions ProGest robot and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Briefly, extracted peptides (10% of total sample in 3 μl) were separated on a Dionex LC Packings Ultimate gradient system and PepMap C18 reversed-phase column (15 cm × 75 μm). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on-line using a Q-TRAP mass spectrometer fitted with a Nanospray source (Applied Biosystems/Sciex). Proteins were identified from mass spectrometry data collected in the information-dependent acquisition mode by searching the SWISS-PROT data base using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Sciences). Lipid and Protein Mass Determinations—Free sterols were quantified as previously described (31Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using the Amplex red cholesterol assay kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, exponential cultures of cells growing at 30 °C in YPD medium were treated with 20 μg/ml edelfosine. Control and treated samples were removed after 1- and 3-h treatments. Total lipid extraction was performed as described above. Free sterols were quantified after resuspending dried lipids corresponding to 1, 0.5, and 0.25 nmol of lipid phosphate in 1× reaction buffer. Measurements were performed in duplicates. Lipid phosphorus was determined as described by Ames and Dubin (19Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein mass using the Lowry protocol (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometry of protein bands from silver-stained gels was performed using a Model 3000 VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). The Role of PC Synthesis in Edelfosine-mediated Toxicity in Yeast—To analyze if the effect of edelfosine on wild type yeast cells was cytostatic or cytotoxic a test for viability after incubation with various concentrations of edelfosine was performed. Viability declined with increasing concentrations of edelfosine indicating that edelfosine was cytotoxic to yeast cells (Fig. 1A), with yeast cells susceptible to edelfosine at concentrations similar to those observed for mammalian cells (7Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2169-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Van der Luit A.H. Budde M. Ruurs P. Verheij M. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39541-39547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Using 20 μg/ml edelfosine we determined that yeast cells were viable for up to 60 min of drug exposure followed by a rapid decline in viability to 20% at 90 min and 3% after 3 h (Fig. 1, B and C). It was previously observed in mammalian cells that edelfosine inhibited the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-catalyzed rate-limiting step of the CDP-choline pathway for PC synthesis. One hypothesis for the cytotoxic effect of edelfosine is through inhibition of PC synthesis. Upon the addition of edelfosine we observed a 90% decrease in the incorporation of radiolabeled choline into PC (Fig. 2A). There was also very little radiolabel found in the PC turnover product glycerophosphocholine, consistent with edelfosine inhibiting PC synthesis in vivo. In addition, the inhibition of PC synthesis corresponded with a concomitant accumulation of phosphocholine indicative of a block at the CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase step (Fig. 2B). Yeast cells containing a genetically inactivated CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (pct1Δ) showed no difference in their sensitivity to edelfosine in comparison to isogenic wild type cells (Fig. 2C). Unlike most mammalian cells, yeast cells are able to live without a functional CDP-choline pathway for PC synthesis because of the presence of a methylation pathway that allows for the synthesis of PC from phosphatidylethanolamine (22Howe A.G. McMaster C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As we observed that edelfosine-mediated toxicity was similar in wild type yeast versus those lacking a functional CDP-choline pathway, it is clear that edelfosine is targeting other gene products beyond Pct1p to kill yeast cells. Sphingolipid and Sterol Synthesis Mediate Edelfosine Toxicity—To aid in establishing a mode of action for edelfosine we screened a high copy number yeast genomic library as an unbiased approach to identify genes whose increased expression resulted in sensitivity to edelfosine. A high copy number plasmid that consistently resulted in increased sensitivity to edelfosine was isolated and found to contain the SCS7 gene (Fig. 3A). Yeast Scs7p is required for α hydroxylation of the fatty acyl chain of yeast ceramide (23Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether edelfosine sensitivity was due alterations in ceramide hydroxylation specifically, or if perturbations in sphingolipid synthesis per se affected edelfosine cytotoxicity, we assessed edelfosine sensitivity of yeast containing a defective LCB1 gene. The LCB1 gene encodes an essential serine palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the first step in sphingolipid synthesis. The lcb1-100 allele is defective in serine palmitoyltransferase at 25 °C, such that the rate of sphingolipid synthesis proceeds at only 38% that of wild type at this temperature (24Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We observed that the lcb1-100 strain was very sensitive to edelfosine at 25 °C (Fig. 3B). Thus, altering either the dose of a hydroxylase, Scs7p, that would alter the biophysical properties of downstream sphingolipids (23Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), or decreasing the rate of sphingolipid synthesis, resulted in increased edelfosine sensitivity. To investigate if alterations in membrane synthesis in general could alter edelfosine toxicity we evaluated the relative edelfosine sensitivity of a set of viable isogenic yeast strains containing individual deletions of each known lipid biosynthetic gene. We observed that strains defective in either Elo2p or Elo3p, the long chain fatty acid synthases responsible for the unique long chain fatty acid composition of sphingolipids, as well as cells lacking Erg3p, a sterol C-5 desaturase involved in the final steps of ergosterol synthesis, were by far the most sensitive (Fig. 3, C and D). As inactivation of genes involved in sphingolipid and ergosterol synthesis increased edelfosine sensitivity this indicated a specific role for these two lipid pathways, as opposed to alterations in lipid synthesis in general, as effectors of cellular sensitivity to edelfosine. Edelfosine Selectively Alters Lipid Raft Protein Composition—Sphingolipids and sterols are thought to self-associate at the plasma membrane into specific microdomains referred to as lipid rafts (28Zurzolo C. van Meer G. Mayor S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). In human leukemia cells edelfosine was found to partition the Fas death receptor/CD95 into lipid rafts resulting in the recruitment of pro-apoptotic molecules and subsequent cell death (30Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E. Acuna A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Geijo E. Santos-Beneit A.M. Veldman R.J. Mollinedo F. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are analyzed in vitro through their isolation as DRM fractions on density gradients. To assess if edelfosine altered lipid raft protein composition we isolated DRMs (28Zurzolo C. van Meer G. Mayor S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Brown D.A.

In each strain, there was a specific loss of a predominant 100-kDa band after cells had been exposed to edelfosine (Fig. 4A). Previous studies had determined that a major 100-kDa yeast lipid raft protein was Pma1p (12Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2078932350,"Human acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (hACAT1) esterifies cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We had previously reported that hACAT1 contains seven transmembrane domains (TMD) (Lin, S., Cheng, D., Liu, M. S., Chen, J., and Chang, T. Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 23276-23285) and nine cysteines. The Cys near the N-terminal is located at the cytoplasm; the two cysteines near the C-terminal form a disulfide bond and are located in the ER lumen.

In the current study, we show that the conserved His-460 is a key active site residue for hACAT1. We next performed Cys-scanning mutagenesis within the region of amino acids 354-493, expressed these mutants in Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking ACAT1, and prepared microsomes from transfected cells.

At the physiological level, it contributes cholesteryl esters as part of the neutral lipid cargo, to be packaged into the cores of very low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons. Under pathophysiological condition, in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, ACAT converts excess cholesterol into cholesteryl esters. This action reduces the amount of cholesterol available from the macrophage cell surface for efflux and converts the macrophages to foam cells, which are the hallmark of early lesions of the disease atherosclerosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). For these reasons, ACAT has been a drug target for pharmaceutical intervention of diseases, including atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia. In mammals, two ACAT genes exist that encode for two similar but different proteins, ACAT1 and ACAT2. Available evidence suggests that ACAT1 and ACAT2 may function in distinct and complementary manners in various tissues (reviewed in Refs. 2Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lin S. Yu C. Li B.L. Miyazaki A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and 3Rudel L. Lee R. Cockman T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Unlike many other enzymes/proteins involved in cellular cholesterol metabolism, neither ACAT1 nor ACAT2 is regulated at the transcription level by the cholesterol-dependent SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)/sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway. Instead, available evidence suggests that ACAT1 may contain a distinct regulatory site that specifically recognizes cholesterol as its activator (4Zhang Y. Yu C. Liu J. Spencer T.A. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11642-11647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Liu J. Chang C.C.Y. Westover E.J. Covey D.F. Chang T.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 390Google Scholar). This mechanism allows ACAT1 to be up-regulated rapidly (within minutes) by cholesterol that builds up at the ER. The enzymological and biochemical characteristics of ACAT2 significantly diverge from those of ACAT1 in several ways; however, ACAT2 may also be allosterically regulated by cholesterol (5Liu J. Chang C.C.Y. Westover E.J. Covey D.F. Chang T.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 390Google Scholar, 6Chang C.C.Y. Sakashita N. Ornvold K. Lee O. Chang E. Dong R. Lin S. Lee C.Y.G. Strom S. Kashyap R. Fung J.

Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided the opportunity to study its biochemical properties. The recombinant hACAT1 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells can be purified to homogeneity (8Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, due to the low quantities of protein derived from the purification process, current efforts in our laboratory focus on studies at the enzymological and cell biological levels, but not at the structural biology level. ACAT1 is homotetrameric in vitro and in intact cells (9Yu C. Chen J. Lin S. Liu J. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36139-36145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The region near the N-terminal contains a dimerization motif. Deleting the N-terminal region converts the enzyme into a homodimer; the dimeric enzyme is fully active catalytically, and remains to be allosterically regulated by cholesterol (10Yu C. Zhang Y. Lu X.H. Chen J. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ACAT1 contains multiple transmembrane domains (TMDs). To deduce its membrane topology, we had previously inserted the nine-amino acid HA tag at various hydrophilic regions of the protein, then expressed the tagged proteins in the ACAT-deficient AC29 cells by transfection. The cells were fixed and treated with digitonin, a cholesterol binder, or with saponin, a weak detergent. Digitonin causes the plasma membranes to become permeable, allowing antibodies to gain access to the cell cytosol, including the cytoplasmic side of the ER membranes. In contrast, saponin (or other mild detergents such as Triton X-100) causes both the plasma membranes and the ER membranes to become permeable, allowing the antibodies to gain access to both the cytoplasmic and the luminal sides of the ER membranes. After selective permeabilization, immunostainings using antibodies against the HA tag were performed, and the signals were monitored under a fluorescence microscope. This method enabled us to determine the sidedness of the HA tag along the ER membranes. The results obtained, summarized below in Fig. 1A, suggested that hACAT1 contains at least seven TMDs, with the N-terminal region located in the cytoplasmic side of the ER, and the C-terminal region located in the ER lumen (11Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The region near the C-terminal half is very hydrophobic and may contain additional membrane embedded segment(s) (11Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). hACAT1 contains nine cysteines. None of the cysteines is required for catalysis (12Lu X.H. Lin S. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 711-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). mPEG5000-maleimide (PEG-mal) is a large, hydrophilic and membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl-specific reagent. The PEG attachment causes an easily detectable shift of ACAT1 band on SDS-PAGE and Western blot (13Guo Z.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lu X. Chen J. Li B.-L. Chang T.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6537-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We used PEG-mal to map the disulfide linkage and to probe the environment of the free sulfhydryls of the enzyme. The results show that a disulfide bond, formed between Cys-528 and Cys-546, is located in the lumen of the ER membranes. Cys-92 is at the cytoplasmic side of the membranes. All the other remaining free cysteines (Cys-333, Cys-345, Cys-365, Cys-387, Cys-467, and Cys-516) are not accessible to PEG-mal under native condition; thus, they are either buried within the ER membranes, or are folded within various regions of the ACAT1 protein itself (13Guo Z.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lu X. Chen J. Li B.-L. Chang T.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6537-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a modified, 7-TMD model for ACAT1, as summarized in Fig. 1C. In contrast, Joyce and colleagues had proposed a 5-TMD model for ACAT1 (25Joyce C.W. Shelness G.S. Davis M.A. Lee R.G. Skinner K. Anderson R.A. Rudel L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3675-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 5-TMD model, summarized as Fig. 1B, was deduced by monitoring the sidedness of the tag at the end of the C-terminal of the protein, after successive deletions from the ACAT1 C-terminal to produce various truncated ACAT1s. Similar to the 7-TMD model (Fig. 1, A and C), the 5-TMD model also proposes the existence of the first four TMDs near the N-terminal half, and the last TMD near the C-terminal. However, it predicts that no other TMD exists, and that all of the followings cysteines: Cys-333, Cys-345, Cys-365, Cys-387, and Cys-467, are located at the cytoplasmic side the ER membranes. These predictions are incompatible with the PEG-mal modification data (13Guo Z.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lu X. Chen J. Li B.-L. Chang T.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6537-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In results not shown, we had found that even modest truncation(s) from the C-terminal of ACAT1 led to total inactivation in ACAT enzyme activity. Thus, it is possible that truncation(s) from the C-terminal of ACAT1 might have caused major structural alteration(s) within the ACAT1 polypeptide. In addition to the experimentally derived 7-TMD model and the 5-TMD model, there is at least one TMD algorithm, called TMbase (28Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar), which predicts that the hydrophobic segments (aa 354-493), depicted as a long red bar in Fig. 1C, contain regions of high helical propensity, and may form two additional TMDs; this prediction is summarized as Fig. 1D. The possible existence of these additional TMDs, depicted as TMD6 and #7 in Fig. 1D, could not be ascertained by methodologies previously employed. ACAT1 is the prototypic member of a multimembrane-spanning acyltransferase family with more than 20 members that include ACAT1, ACAT2, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1. Within this family, an invariant His residue (His-460 in hACAT1) exists and may constitute as part of the active site of the enzyme (14Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory showed that His-434, the equivalent of His-460 in hACAT1, is essential for hACAT2 catalysis (15Lin S. Lu X. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2447-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, chemical modification by using PEG-mal together with Cys-scanning mutagenesis has been used successfully to investigate the membrane topology of various membrane proteins (16Lu J. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13288-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Kosolapov A. Deutsch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 287: 4305-4313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Katzen F. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10471-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the current work, we first performed site-specific mutagenesis experiments to test if the conserved His-460 is a key active site residue for hACAT1. We next re-investigated the membrane topology of hACAT1 by performing Cys-scanning mutagenesis at regions of interest, and probed the environment of the engineered cysteines by using PEG-mal and three other small, ER membrane-permeant maleimide derivatives (NEM, AMS, and NPM) with different hydrophobicity. The results led us to construct a revised, 9-TMD model in which the active site His-460 is located in a hydrophobic environment, within a newly disclosed TMD, between Arg-443 and Tyr-462. A portion of these results described herein has been published previously in abstract form (19Lu X. Lin S. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. The 3rd AHA National Conference on Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology.Salt Lake City, UT (Abstract). 2002; Google Scholar). Materials—PEG-mal was from Watershears; N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), N-phenylmaleimide (NPM), and iodoacetamide (IA) were from Sigma; 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was from Molecular Probes. For modification under non-denaturing condition, stock solutions (PEG-mal at 40 mm, NEM and AMS at 100 mm) were freshly prepared in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). NPM was not soluble in water, so it was dissolved in Me2SO as a 100 mm stock solution. For modification under denatured condition, PEG-mal or IA was prepared as a fresh stock solution in Lysate Buffer (10% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.7). 2-Mercaptoethanol was from Sigma. FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent was from Roche Molecular Biology. [9,10-3H]Oleic acid was from Amersham Biosciences. PVDF membrane (Immobilon P) was from Millipore. Mouse anti-BiP antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies (DM10) generated against the N-terminal fragment (1-131) of hACAT1 were described previously (20Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S.

Goat anti-rabbit IgG(L+H)-HRP conjugate and Goat anti-mouse IgG(L+H)-HRP conjugate were from Bio-Rad. The SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate was from Pierce. Cell Culture—The CHO cells were cultured in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (50:50) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The ACAT1-deficient CHO cell line AC29 (21Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to express the N-terminal His6-tagged hACAT1 (His-hACAT1) or its various engineered mutants. For transfections, the AC29 cells were cultured in 6-well plates to 70-80% confluency and transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3 vectors encoding His-hACAT1 or its mutants, using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols. On the second day, the cells were trypsinized, divided equally into three wells, and grown for 2 days in G-418 containing medium for ACAT enzyme activity and protein expression studies (22Yang L. Lee O. Chen J. Chen J. Chang C.C. Zhou P. Wang Z.Z. Ma H.H. Sha H.F. Feng J.X. Wang Y. Yang X.Y. Wang L. Dong R. Ornvold K. Li B.L. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46253-46262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Alternatively, for chemical modification studies, on the second day after transfection, the cells were trypsinized; cells from 2 to 3 wells were pooled to a single 90 mm dish, and grown for 2 days at 37 °C, with G418 (0.3 mg/ml) present in the growth medium. Cells were then harvested for chemical modification studies. Recombinant DNA Technology—All of the ACAT1 mutants were prepared using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's manual. For mutants based on His-hACAT1 or [C92A]His-ACAT1 as the template, the DNA constructs pGEM-7Z(-)/His-hACAT1 or pGEM-7Z(-)/[C92A]His-hACAT1 were used as the mutagenesis template (13Guo Z.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lu X. Chen J. Li B.-L. Chang T.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6537-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All of the expected mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated ACAT1 gene was transferred from pGEM-7Z(-) vector to pcDNA3 vector as follows: The 1.7-kb DNA fragment encoding ACAT1 mutants was released from the pGEM-7Z(-) vector by HindIII cleavage, filled in by T4 DNA polymerase, and then cleaved with EcoRI. Subsequently, the 1.7-kb DNA fragment was ligated into the pcDNA3 vector pretreated with EcoRI and EcoRV. For the mutants based on [C2 (528/546)]His-hACAT1 as the template (12Lu X.H. Lin S. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 711-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Guo Z.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lu X. Chen J. Li B.-L. Chang T.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6537-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the construct pcDNA3/[C2 (528/546)]His-hACAT1 was used as the mutagenesis template, and the expected mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the mutants based on hACAT1-HA6, containing a HA tag (with an amino acid sequence of YPYDVPDYA) between Tyr-404 and Lys-405, the construct pcDNA3/ACAT1-HA6 (11Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used as the mutagenesis template. The Cys-92 residue in ACAT1-HA6 was mutated to Ala-92 by replacing the DNA fragment (cut by KpnI and Eco47III) with the same fragment released from pcDNA3/[C92A]His-ACAT1. ACAT Activity Assay in Intact Cells—This method measures the rate of [3H]cholesteryl oleate synthesis in intact cells (23Chang C.C.Y. Doolittle G.M. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The transiently transfected AC29 cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 37 °C as described above. The cells were given a fresh media change (1 ml/well) 2 h before the assay. Then, 20 μl of 10 mm [3H]oleate in 10% bovine serum albumin was added to the media at 37 °C for 30 min. ACAT1 Protein Content Analysis after Transfection—The cells in 6-well plates were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by 240 μl of Lysate Buffer containing 10 mm IA. The cell lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, 60 μl/tube of SDS-PAGE Loading Buffer (10% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) was added, and the samples were mixed well by vigorous vortexing. Then, 60 μl of the sample mixture were loaded onto a 9% SDS-gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the ACAT1 protein bands were visualized by Western blot using DM10 as the primary antibodies. The relative amount of the hACAT1 mutants versus that of the WT hACAT1 was analyzed by densitometry. Permeability Analysis of Microsomal Vesicles—The AC29 cells that stably express hACAT1 were cultured in 90-mm dishes and lysed by hypotonic shock followed by scraping according to the previously published procedure (24Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. Chang C.C.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min) to remove the unbroken cells and nuclei, the whole cell homogenates underwent ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min) at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation the pellets that contain microsomal vesicles were gently resuspended in the cold buffer A. Then, the microsomal vesicles were treated with or without saponin, and/or with or without PEG-mal as indicated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then 2-mercaptoethanol (from a freshly prepared 100 mm stock solution in Buffer A) was added to the final concentration of 10 mm (to react with the excess amount of PEG-mal). The samples underwent ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h) at 4 °C to collect the microsomal vesicles. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatants were carefully removed, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at the same volume as the supernatants. Then, Lysate buffers containing 40 mm IA were added to the supernatants and the pellets at a volume equal to that of the supernatants and the pellets. The reactions were incubated at room temp for 30 min. Next, SDS-PAGE loading buffer at 1/4 volume of the sample mixtures were added. The final supernatant and the pellet modification mixtures were loaded in equal amounts onto a SDS-gel (9%) for SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the BiP and ACAT1 protein bands were visualized by Western blot using anti-BiP and anti-ACAT1 antibodies, respectively. PEG-mal Modification under Non-denaturing Condition—The AC29 cells transiently expressing His-hACAT1 mutants were cultured in 90-mm dishes. The whole cell homogenates were prepared by the same method as described earlier. Then, the 40 mm stock PEG-mal solution dissolved in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) was added to the cell lysates, in the absence or presence of saponin (which permeabilizes the microsomal membranes) (15Lin S. Lu X. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2447-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Guo Z.-Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lu X. Chen J. Li B.-L. Chang T.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6537-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The final concentration of PEG-mal was 4 mm, and the final concentration of saponin was 5 mg/ml. The modification reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 1.5 h. After incubation, 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the final concentration of 10 mm (to react with the excess amount of PEG-mal). The reactions were carried out at 4 °C for an additional 30 min. Subsequently, 40 mm IA in Lysate Buffer at volumes equal to the sample volume was added (to modify the remaining unreacted thiol groups of hACAT1 under denatured condition). Finally, one-half to one-fourth of the total modification mixtures were used for analysis by SDS-PAGE; the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane after electrophoresis. The ACAT1 bands were visualized by Western blot using DM10 as the primary antibodies. NEM, AMS, and NPM Modifications under Nondenaturing Condition—The whole cell homogenates of AC29 cells that transiently express ACAT1 mutants based on [C2 (528/546)]His-ACAT1 were prepared by the same method as described earlier. The 800 × g supernatants that contain the microsomes were treated with NEM, or AMS, or NPM as indicated at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The final concentration of NEM, AMS, or NPM was 4 mm. For parallel NEM/AMS modifications, the reactions were carried out in Buffer A; for parallel NPM/NEM modifications, because NPM is relatively insoluble in buffer A, the modifications with NEM or with NPM were carried out in buffer A containing 4% Me2SO. After incubation, the modification mixture was diluted 40-fold and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min (to quench the reactions between free cysteines in ACAT1 and the maleimides). For parallel NEM/AMS modification mixtures, Buffer A was used for dilution; for parallel NPM/NEM modification mixtures, Buffer A containing 4% Me2SO was used for dilution. Afterward, the microsomes in the modification mixtures were separated from the maleimide used by ultracentrifuge (100,000 × g, 30 min) at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer A. Then, 50 μl of Lysate Buffer containing 10 mm PEG-mal was added per sample at room temperature for 30 min (to modify the residual free cysteines that did not react with NEM or with AMS). Finally, the modification mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane after electrophoresis. The ACAT1 bands were visualized by Western blot using DM10 as the primary antibodies. Determining the Importance of the Conserved His-460 and the Conserved Ser-269 in hACAT1—Bioinformatic analysis suggested that for the membrane-bound O-acyl transferase superfamily, the absolutely conserved His residue (His-460 in hACAT1), located within a long stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues, might constitute the active site (14Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In contrast, Joyce and colleagues (25Joyce C.W. Shelness G.S. Davis M.A. Lee R.G. Skinner K. Anderson R.A. Rudel L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3675-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) proposed that a Ser residue (Ser-269 in hACAT1), conserved within ACAT1, ACAT2, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, might be the active site. The proposal by Joyce and colleagues was based on the fact that when the mutant ACAT1 with Leu replacing Ser-269 was expressed in AC29 cells, it provided no measurable ACAT enzyme activity. These investigators did not report the protein expression level of the S269L ACAT1 mutant. In principle, it is possible that either Ser-269 or His-460, or both, may serve as the active site of ACAT1. For example, carnitine acyltransferase utilizes a His residue as the catalytic site (26Gogl G. Hsiao Y.-S. Tong L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1033: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase utilizes a Ser residue as part of the Ser/His/Asp catalytic triad (27Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of Ser-269 and His-460, we replaced His-460 and Ser-269 individually with different amino acids by site-specific mutagenesis, expressed the mutants in AC29 cells by transient transfections, and analyzed the activities and the protein expression levels of the individual mutant enzymes. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 6 and 7), when His-460 was replaced by Ala or by Asn, the mutant enzymes retained nearly normal protein expression levels, but they completely lost enzymatic activity. However, when Ser-269 was replaced by Ala or by Thr (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5), the mutant retained nearly normal enzyme activity as well as nearly normal protein expression levels. Interestingly, when Ser-269 was replaced by Leu (Fig. 2, lane 4), the mutant had no detectable enzymatic activity, nor did it exhibit any detectable protein expression. Therefore, the loss of activity of the S269L mutant was likely caused by the loss of ACAT1 protein expression in CHO cells. In results not shown, we found that the S269L mutant hACAT1 could be expressed in insect cells, and it still retained ∼70% of the activity expressed by the wild-type hACAT1. Therefore, we conclude that His-460 is the active site of hACAT1. Ser-269 is not the active site, but it may play important role(s) in maintaining the structural integrity/protein stability of ACAT1 in mammalian cells. These results are consistent with our earlier findings in hACAT2: mutation in the conserved His-434 led to complete loss in enzyme activity without significant loss in protein expression, whereas mutating the conserved Ser-245 to Leu led to significant loss in protein expression in CHO cells (15Lin S. Lu X. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2447-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Rationale for Developing a New Strategy to Study the ACAT1 Membrane Topology—We aimed at developing a new strategy to resolve the ACAT1 topology that covers the uncertainty region aa 354-493. We"

https://openalex.org/W2055100443,"Membrane phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), are signaling molecules that can directly modulate the activity of ion channels, including the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Whereas PI(3,4,5)P3 directly activates ENaC, its binding site within the channel has not been identified. We identify here a region of γ-mENaC just following the second trans-membrane domain (residues 569–583) important to PI(3,4,5)P3 binding and regulation. Deletion of this track decreases activity of ENaC heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. K-Ras and its first effector phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3-K), as well as RhoA and its effector phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase increase ENaC activity. Whereas the former, via generation of PI(3,4,5)P3, increases ENaC open probability, the latter increases activity by increasing membrane levels of the channel. Deletion of the region just distal to the second trans-membrane domain disrupted regulation by K-Ras and PI3-K but not RhoA and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase. Moreover, PI(3,4,5)P3 binds ENaC with deletion of the region following the second transmembrane domain disrupting this interaction and disrupting direct activation of the channel by PI(3,4,5)P3. Mutation analysis revealed the importance of conserved positive and negative charged residues as well as bulky amino acids within this region to modulation of ENaC by PI3-K. The current results identify the region just distal to the second trans-membrane domain within γ-mENaC as being part of a functional PI(3,4,5)P3 binding site that directly impacts ENaC activity. Phospholipid binding to this site is probably mediated by the positively charged amino acids within this track, with negatively charged and bulky residues also influencing specificity of interactions. Membrane phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), are signaling molecules that can directly modulate the activity of ion channels, including the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Whereas PI(3,4,5)P3 directly activates ENaC, its binding site within the channel has not been identified. We identify here a region of γ-mENaC just following the second trans-membrane domain (residues 569–583) important to PI(3,4,5)P3 binding and regulation. Deletion of this track decreases activity of ENaC heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

Direct regulation of ion channel activity by phospholipid signaling molecules is becoming widely appreciated (reviewed in Ref. 1Hilgemann D. Feng S. Nasuhoglu C. Sci.

Each subunit has an amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain separated by two trans-membrane domains and a large extracellular region. ENaC serves an essential physiological function, since its activity is limiting for Na+ absorption across many epithelia, including that in the distal renal nephron (reviewed in Refs. 17Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 18Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Thus, ENaC is well positioned to influence system Na+ balance and blood pressure. Indeed, gain and loss of function mutations in ENaC lead to inheritable forms of hypertension and hypotension, respectively, associated with inappropriate salt conservation and wasting at the kidney (20Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 21Hummler E. Horisberger J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G567-G571PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ENaC plays a critical role in hydration and fluid reabsorption across many mucosal membranes. Deletion and overexpression of ENaC correspondingly lead to excessively wet and dry air spaces with associated disease (21Hummler E. Horisberger J.D. Am. J.

Channel-phospolipid interactions are electrostatic in nature, where the negatively charged phosphate groups of anionic phospholipids interact with positively charged residues within the cytosolic domains of the channel. Moreover, the typical phospholipid binding site includes several regions/residues spread across the cystosolic domain(s) of the polypeptide (6Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahj T. Logothetis D.E. Nat.

Importantly, the cystosolic domains just following trans-membrane domains, which often are rich in positively charged residues, appear to be particularly involved in phospholipid binding (6Zhang H.

Once bound, phospholipids exert either an allosteric effect, changing the conformation of the channel, or change the free energy requirement for open and/or closed state transition to affect channel gating/open probability. Compared with PI(4,5)P2 binding sites, much less is known about putative PI(3,4,5)P3 binding sites. This becomes particularly important when considering issues of specificity, because the former phospholipid is much more abundant in the plasma membrane than the latter. Recall, however, that aldosterone increases PI(3,4,5)P3 levels (29Blazer-Yost B.L. Paunescu T.G. Helman S.I. Lee K.D. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C531-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since ENaC is directly modulated by PI(3,4,5)P3 with this phospholipid increasing channel open probability, it serves as a good model to define domains and residues involved in PI(3,4,5)P3 binding and regulation of ion channels. We demonstrate here that the region just distal to the second trans-membrane domain in γ-ENaC is involved in regulation of the channel by signaling cascades which activate ENaC via PI(3,4,5)P3. Moreover, deletion of this region disrupted ENaC association with PI(3,4,5)P3 and direct activation of the channel by PI(3,4,5)P3. Thus, the current results argue strongly that the conserved, positively charged residues immediately following the second membrane-spanning domain in γ-ENaC play a functional role in mediating PI(3,4,5)P3 actions on ENaC activity and are involved in binding of this phospholipid to the channel.

In brief, current through ENaC was the inward, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current with a bath solution of 160 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and a pipette solution of 120 mm CsCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.0 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm GTP. In some experiments, 2 mm GDPβS replaced the 0.1 mm GTP in the pipette solution. Current recordings were acquired with either an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) or a PC-505B (Warner Instruments) patch clamp amplifier interfaced via a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) to a PC running the pClamp 9.2 suite of software (Axon Instruments). For whole cell recording, cells were held at 40 mV with voltage ramps (500 ms) from 60 down to –100 mV used to elicit current. ENaC activity is reported as the amiloride-sensitive current density at –80 mV. Whole cell capacitance was routinely compensated and was ∼9 pF for CHO cells. Series resistances, on average 2–4 megohms, were also compensated. For excised patches, gap-free current recordings were made at 0 mV with inward Na+ current downwards. Data were digitized at 500 Hz and filtered at 100 Hz. Displayed data were subsequently software-filtered at 20 Hz. Channel activity was expressed as NPo = I/i, where I represents mean current in a patch, and i is unitary current as determined by all point histograms. Open probability (Po) was established by normalizing NPo for channel number. Water-soluble, short-chain, dioctanoyl phospholipids were from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Aqueous phospholipid stocks were prepared at 1 mm by sonication for 30 min and stored at –70 °C. For outside-out experiments, stock phospholipids were mixed just prior to use with an equal volume of a carrier solution containing histone H1 (0.2 mm; Echelon Biosciences Inc.) and sonicated again for 10 min. Biochemistry—Experiments testing precipitation of ENaC with phospholipids were performed using standard biochemical methods (40Tong Q. Stockand J.D. Am. J.

In brief, CHO cells expressing all three Myc-tagged ENaC subunits were extracted with gentle lysis buffer (76 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 2 mm EGTA plus 1% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase (0.1 mm NaPPi, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na2MoO4, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 0.04 mm Na3VO4) inhibitors. After standardizing total protein concentration, 40 μl of 10 nm PIP beads were added to 400 μg of whole cell lysate with a final volume of 400 μl and incubated together overnight at 4 °C. Precipitants were then washed three times with 400 μl of a 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) solution, resuspended in sample buffer (0.005% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 77 mm Tris-HCl, and 20 mm dithiothreitol), and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Precipitated proteins were separated by standard SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Myc antibody in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Negative controls for these experiments included transfecting cells with only enhanced green fluorescence protein and incubating lysate containing ENaC with agarose beads lacking conjugated PIPs. Specific precipitation of Akt, which is known to interact with PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, by PI(3,4,5)P3/PI(3,4)P2 beads served as a positive control. Statistics—All patch clamp data are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were compared using Student's t test, with p ≤ 0.05 considered significant.

This region is similar to that found in many other intrinsic membrane proteins, particularly to the portion of the polypeptide exiting the plasma membrane at the intracellular face of the lipid bilayer. Fig. 1A shows a sequence alignment of the region just distal to the second trans-membrane domain in γ-ENaC from several different mammalian species. Investigation of this alignment reveals several well conserved positive charged residues.

GH exerts its action via the GH receptor (GHR), a transmembrane protein of the cytokine receptor superfamily that activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including the STAT, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase C pathways (1Piwien-Pilipuk G.

Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Upon binding of ligand, the dimeric GHR undergoes a conformational change (3Wan Y. McDevitt A. Shen B. Smythe M.L. Waters M.J.

Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA response elements upstream of GH target genes and activate gene transcription (7Herrington J. Smit L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2585-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 8Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar).Many physiological responses to GH are dependent on the temporal pattern of plasma GH stimulation, which is sex-dependent and subject to neuroendocrine control. In the rat model, the adult male plasma GH pattern is characterized by regular pulses of hormone every ∼3.5–4 h, separated by well defined GH-free intervals, whereas a more continuous plasma GH profile is associated with adult females (9Jansson J.-O. Ekberg S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). These sex-dependent plasma GH profiles dictate the sex-dependent expression of a large number of liver gene products, including various plasma proteins, enzymes of steroid and foreign compound metabolism, receptors, and other signaling molecules (10Ahluwalia A. Clodfelter K.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 747-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Targeted gene disruption studies show that the sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression in males requires STAT5b (11Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), but not the closely related protein STAT5a (12Teglund S. McKay C.

STAT5b is repeatedly activated by each successive plasma GH pulse in male rats, whereas in females, the nearly continuous plasma GH profile down-regulates GHR-JAK2-STAT5b signaling (14Waxman D.J.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4599-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This down-regulation by continuous GH is associated with more rapid deactivation of the GHR·JAK2 signaling complex by a proteasome-dependent process (17Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that may be linked to GHR internalization and/or degradation.Factors that regulate GHR internalization and degradation are likely to contribute to down-regulation of GHR signaling (18Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 197: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Kuhn E.R. Vleurick L. Edery M. Decuypere E. Darras V.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 132: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This down-regulation is linked to GH-induced GHR internalization and degradation via the proteasome and requires an intact ubiquitination system (20van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The pathway by which GHR is internalized from the cell surface is not well understood. GHR has been reported to be internalized via clathrin-coated pits (21Sachse M. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Klumperman J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3943-3952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sachse M. Urbe S. Oorschot V. Strous G.J. Klumperman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1313-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), but also may use caveolae, formed by caveolin and dependent on membrane cholesterol, as another pathway (23Yang N. Huang Y. Jiang J. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20898-20905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Lobie P.E. Sadir R. Graichen R. Mertani H.C. Morel G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 leads to accumulation of non-ubiquitinated GHR on the cell surface (25Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which suggests that GHR ubiquitination and internalization are related. GHR degradation is dependent on cellular ubiquitination activity; however, the ubiquitination of GHR itself is not required for GHR to be targeted for degradation (27Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that yet unidentified proteins facilitate internalization of GHR, perhaps by acting as endocytic adaptors that are tagged by ubiquitination.GH-induced JAK-STAT signaling is negatively regulated by proteins belonging to the SOCS family (28Greenhalgh C.J. Alexander W.S. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2004; 14: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The protein CIS (29Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), a member of the SOCS family, inhibits liver GHR signaling to STAT5b by competing with STAT5b for common GHR phosphotyrosine-binding sites and by a second mechanism that involves proteasomal action (30Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39487-39496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The CIS gene is activated by GH via a STAT-dependent transcriptional mechanism (31Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CIS protein levels are up-regulated in association with persistent GH stimulation in the case of mice transgenic for GH-releasing hormone or bovine GH (32Gonzalez L. Miquet J.G. Sotelo A.I. Bartke A. Turyn D. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Miquet J.G. Sotelo A.I. Bartke A. Turyn D. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2824-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In primary rat hepatocytes continuously stimulated with GH, CIS mRNA is induced within 2 h and is sustained at elevated levels for at least 24 h (34Tollet-Egnell P. Flores-Morales A. Stavreus-Evers A. Sahlin L. Norstedt G. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the SOCS/CIS family, CIS contains a short N-terminal domain, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal SOCS box (35Nicola N.A. Greenhalgh C.J. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 1105-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SOCS box-containing proteins can act as adaptor molecules that recruit activated signaling proteins to the proteasome (36Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). SOCS proteins associate, via their SOCS box, with elongins B and C (elongin BC complex) and cullin-2 and may thereby contribute to formation of a putative ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) complex that targets SOCS-associated proteins for proteasomal degradation (36Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). CIS can be monoubiquitinated and accumulates in this form in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (37Verdier F. Chretien S. Muller O. Varlet P. Yoshimura A. Gisselbrecht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28185-28190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of CIS on GH signaling can be blocked by proteasome inhibitors (30Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39487-39496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the finding that CIS binds, via its SH2 domain, to tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR (38Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 39Du L. Frick G.P. Tai L.R. Yoshimura A. Goodman H.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggest that CIS may negatively regulate GH signaling by acting as an adaptor molecule that targets GHR to the proteasomal degradation pathway.In this study, we investigated the cellular localization and trafficking of GHR and the role of CIS in receptor internalization following GH stimulation. Using the GH-responsive rat liver-derived cell line CWSV-1 (40Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol.

Isom H.C. Greene F.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was maintained and passaged in RPCD medium with the addition of a trace element mixture (“complete RPCD medium”) (40Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out as described previously (30Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Twenty-four h after the addition of the FuGENE 6/DNA mixture to the cells, cells were stimulated with GH as specified in each experiment.Protein Extraction and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared from cells grown in 10-cm dishes. Cells were placed on ice, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated on ice for 30 min in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cells were scrapped, and cell extracts were passed through a 27-gange needle and centrifuged. Supernatant fractions were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Endogenous GHR protein was precipitated from the cell lysates using anti-GHR pAb 2941. Cell lysates adjusted to 1 mg of total protein/ml of immunoprecipitation buffer were incubated overnight at 4 °C with pAb 2941 (1:500 dilution). Forty μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in immunoprecipitation buffer was added, and the samples were incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C on a shaker. The immune complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and precipitated proteins were released from the protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205973) Google Scholar) for 10 min, followed by Western blot analysis as described below.Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in blocking solution as follows. For detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween (TBST buffer; 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and then immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (1:1000 dilution) or PY99 (1:1000 dilution) diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer. For detection of total GHR and STAT5b, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer and probed overnight at 4 °C with pAb 2941 (1:6000 dilution) or anti-STAT5b pAb (1:3000 dilution), respectively, diluted in 5% milk in TBST buffer. Membranes were washed (3 × 5 min) with TBST buffer and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2% SDS, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 60 °C; washed (4 × 10 min) with TBST buffer; blocked in the appropriate blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature; and reprobed with primary antibody as required.Deglycosylation Reactions—CWSV-1 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of fusion lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture). Supernatants prepared from the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with pAb 2941. Immune complexes were boiled for 10 min in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 1 mm PMSF. Eluted proteins were collected and digested overnight at 37 °C with 1000 units of peptide N-glycosidase F or 1000 units of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) in the reaction buffers provided by the manufacturer and supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6× Laemmli sample buffer, followed by boiling for 10 min. Digested products were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting.Cell-surface Biotinylation—Cell-surface biotinylation was performed on CWSV-1 cells grown in 10-cm dishes in serum-free complete RPCD medium. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0) and incubated for 30 min on ice with 5 ml of biotinylation reagent (0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce) freshly dissolved in PBS (pH 8.0)) with gentle shaking every 5 min. The biotinylation reagent was removed by aspiration, and the reaction was quenched by incubating cells for 15 min on ice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl, followed by a 5-min wash with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0). The cells were then lysed in 1 ml of fusion lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture. Biotinylated proteins were extracted from cell lysates by incubation with 40 μl of 50% (v/v) streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4°C, followed by three washes of the beads with fusion lysis buffer. Proteins were recovered from the streptavidin-Sepharose beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer for 10 min, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—CWSV-1 cells were seeded at 50% confluence in 2-well (2 cm2/well) chamber slides (catalog no. 154461, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) in complete RPCD medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum and allowed to adhere overnight. The medium was then replaced with fresh serum-free complete RPCD medium for at least 4 h, after which the cells were transfected for 24 h with 400 ng of FLAG-GHR alone or together with 800 ng of CIS-R107K expression plasmid. Typically, 5–10% of the cells were transfected with GHR under these conditions (compare the percent of brightly fluorescent cells indicated at time = 0 in Figs. 3A, 5A, and 6A). The percentage of brightly fluorescent cells indicated in individual experiments was determined by counting at least 15 fields, typically containing 180–300 cells. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with GH as specified in each figure, washed three times with PBS, and fixed as follows. For detection of GHR, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 4 min where indicated, washed with PBS, and blocked by incubation in PBS containing 10% goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% goat serum was then added for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody dilutions were as follows: anti-rat GH antibody, 1:1000; anti-GHR pAb 2941, 1:1000; anti-GHR mAb 263, 1:500; and anti-FLAG mAb, 1:500. The samples were washed (3 × 5 min) with PBS containing 1% goat serum and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green fluorescence) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 1% goat serum. Cells were washed (2 × 5 min) with 1% goat serum in PBS and then washed (1 × 5 min) with PBS alone and stained with 500 μl of 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to visualize the nuclei (red fluorescence). Cells were washed twice with PBS and covered with a glass coverslip using Fluoroguard anti-fade reagent (Bio-Rad). To detect STAT5b, cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 20 min at –20 °C; washed with PBS; blocked with PBS containing 3% calf serum for 1 h at room temperature; and incubated with anti-STAT5b pAb or anti-phospho-Tyr694 STAT5 mAb as described (49Park S.H. Yamashita H. Rui H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2157-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except that anti-STAT5b pAb (1:500 dilution) incubations were for 1 h at room temperature and anti-phospho-Tyr694 STAT5 mAb (1:500 dilution) incubations were overnight at 4 °C in a humidified environment to minimize nonspecific binding. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody was used as described above.FIGURE 5Wild-type CIS reverses the inhibitory effect of CIS-R107K on GH-induced GHR internalization. CWSV-1 cells were transfected with 400 ng of FLAG-GHR alone or in combination with CIS-R107K (800 ng), wild-type CIS (CIS-wt; 800 ng), and/or SOCS6 (800 ng) as indicated. Cells were treated with GH (200 ng/ml), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde without detergent permeabilization, and immunostained with anti-FLAG mAb (A) or permeabilized with Triton X-100 and immunostained with anti-GH antibody (B). In control experiments (not shown), no immunofluorescence was observed in cells transfected with FLAG-tagged CIS-R107K either alone or in combination with non-FLAG-tagged GHR. Thus, the fluorescence seen in this figure is that of FLAG-GHR. Shown are optical z sections through the middle of the cells.

https://openalex.org/W2044380932,"Cell-associated heparan sulfate (HS) is endowed with the remarkable ability to bind numerous proteins. As such, it represents a unique system that integrates signaling from circulating ligands with cellular receptors. This polysaccharide is extraordinary complex, and examples that define the structure-function relationship of HS are limited. In particular, it remains difficult to understand the structures by which HS interact with proteins. Among them, interferon-γ (IFNγ), a dimeric cytokine, binds to a complex oligosaccharide motif encompassing a N-acetylated glucosamine-rich domain and two highly sulfated sequences, each of which binds to one IFNγ monomer. Based on this template, we have synthesized a set of glycoconjugate mimetics and evaluated their ability to interact with IFNγ. One of these molecules, composed of two authentic N-sulfated octasaccharides linked to each other through a 50-Å-long spacer termed 2O10, displays high affinity for the cytokine and inhibits IFNγ-HS binding with an IC50 of 35–40 nm. Interestingly, this molecule also inhibits the binding of IFNγ to its cellular receptor. Thus, in addition to its ability to delocalize the cytokine from cell surface-associated HS, this compound has direct anti-IFNγ activity. Altogether, our results represent the first synthetic HS-like molecule that targets a cytokine, strongly validating the HS structural determinants for IFNγ recognition, providing a new strategy to inhibit IFNγ in a number of diseases in which the cytokine has been identified as a target, and reinforcing the view that it is possible to create”tailor-made“sequences based on the HS template to isolate therapeutic activities.

Mechanistically, this extensive functional repertoire often relies on the ability of HS to recognize diverse proteins, the conformation, stability, local concentration, or biological activities of which are modified by the interaction (3Tumova S.

It is composed of strongly anionic domains enriched in N-sulfated glucosamines and iduronic acids, typically 3–8 disaccharides long (referred to as NS or heparin-like domains), that bear a variable number of O-sulfate moieties and are hypervariable in sequence. These domains are separated by relatively regular regions encompassing a larger area that contain predominantly N-acetylated glucosamine and glucuronic acid domains (NA domains) and mixed NA/NS regions that make the transition between NA and NS domains (8Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been thought that specific information for protein recognition resided within the NS domains in HS and, indeed, a large number of “heparin-binding proteins” interact with such structures. These include, for example, fibroblast growth factors (9Faham S. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (10Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol.

Thunberg L. Leder I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6551-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, of the large number of heparin-protein complexes that can be experimentally demonstrated, the latter (heparin-antithrombin III) is the only one to date for which a specific sequence has been formally defined (13Petitou M. Casu B. Lindahl U. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and reproduced by chemical synthesis (14Petitou M. van Boeckel C.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 3118-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Importantly, this achievement led to the development of an approved drug against deep venous thrombosis. Interferon-γ (IFNγ), a multifunctional T cell-secreted cytokine (15Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 16Schroder K. Hertzog P.J. Ravasi T. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar), has been identified as a heparin-binding protein some years ago (17Lortat-Jacob H. Kleinman H.K. Grimaud J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). IFNγ and growth factors (such as fibroblast growth factors) belong to distinct groups in regard to their regulation by HS. In particular, HS does not promote IFNγ association to its cell surface receptor (IFNγR), and IFNγR does not bind to HS. 3S. Sarrazin, D. Bonnaffé, A. Lubineau, and H. Lortat-Jacob, unpublished observation. 3S. Sarrazin, D. Bonnaffé, A. Lubineau, and H. Lortat-Jacob, unpublished observation. IFNγ binding to HS was found to control the blood clearance, subsequent tissue targeting, and local accumulation of the cytokine. It also regulates IFNγ activity by a unique mechanism involving a controlled processing of the carboxyl-terminal peptide (18Lortat-Jacob H. Baltzer F. Grimaud J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16139-16143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Sadir R. Forest E. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10919-10925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above mentioned heparin-binding proteins, IFNγ does not interact with isolated NS domains. The binding requires a larger sequence that encompasses an internal NA domain flanked at both sides by two NS domains (20Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In such a structure the two external NS regions are believed to interact with the two carboxyl-terminal sequences of an IFNγ dimer and bridge the two IFNγ monomers by virtue of the internal domain (Fig. 1). Because of the structural heterogeneity of HS, such complex binding motif is obviously impossible to obtain in pure form and in a large quantity from natural sources. We thus used a chemical approach that has been recently developed (21Lubineau A. Lortat-Jacob H. Gavard O. Sarrazin S. Bonnaffe D. Chemistry. 2004; 10: 4265-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to obtain compounds that would mimic the IFNγ binding site with the goal of validating the model of the IFNγ-HS complex initially proposed and obtaining material in homogeneous form and a large amount. A set of compounds in which authentic NS domains, ranging from tetrasaccharides to octasaccharides, linked to poly(ethylene glycol)-based spacers of different lengths that would mimic the internal NA domain was produced by chemical synthesis, and the ability of the compounds to interact with IFNγ was analyzed. One of these molecules inhibited the IFNγ/heparin interaction with an IC50 of 35–40 nm. Importantly, this compound also inhibited the binding of IFNγ to IFNγR and, consequently, the biological activity of the cytokine. These results provide a new strategy to inhibit IFNγ in a number of diseases in which this cytokine has been identified as a target and strongly validate the model proposed for the IFNγ-HS complex. IFNγ Production and Characterization—Human IFNγ cDNA was cloned into a pET11a expression vector (Novagen) and used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star DE3 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Purification from inclusion bodies was performed as described (22Haelewyn J. De Ley M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 1163-1171PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl, and the protein was refolded by dilution to 0.2 mg/ml into 50 mm phosphate buffer and 0.5 m guanidine HCl, pH 7. IFNγ was purified by ion exchange (Mono S HR 5/5 column) and gel filtration (Superdex 75 column) chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and stored frozen in 10 mm Tris and 10 mg/ml mannitol, pH 6.8. Purified material was characterized by mass spectrometry and amino-terminal sequencing and quantified by amino acid analysis. Biological activities of IFNγ (antiviral activity and up-regulation of HLA-DR antigen; see below) were found to be identical to that of commercially available IFNγ (Promega), and both samples were used in this study. Synthesis of Oligosaccharides and Glycoconjugates—The general approach used to synthesize HS oligosaccharides and glycoconjugate mimetics is illustrated in Fig. 2 and briefly described here (a fully detailed description of each synthetic step can be found in Ref. 21Lubineau A. Lortat-Jacob H. Gavard O. Sarrazin S. Bonnaffe D. Chemistry. 2004; 10: 4265-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A disaccharide building block with orthogonal allyl and para-methoxybenzyl protecting groups on the anomeric and 4′ position, respectively, was first prepared as described (23Gavard O. Hersant Y. Alais J. Duverger V. Dilhas A. Bascou A. Bonnaffé D. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 18: 3603-3620Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Dilhas A. Bonnaffé D. Tetrahedron Lett. 2004; 45: 3643-3645Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The allyl group was cleaved (25Oltvoort J.J. van Boeckel C.A.A. Koning J.H. van Boom J.H. Synthesis. 1981; 1981: 305-308Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar) followed by the activation of the anomeric position in the form of a trichloroacetimidate derivative to obtain a disaccharide donor (88% yield). Treatment of the same building block with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone gave rise to a disaccharide acceptor (83% yield). Donor and acceptor were then condensed in dichloromethane at –40 °C, using tert-butyldimethylsilyl triflate as promotor, to yield the desired tetrasaccharide with total α stereoselectivity in 90% isolated yield. Using the same procedure, the tetrasaccharide was converted into tetrasaccharide acceptors and donors with respective yields of 81 and 87%. Hexasaccharides and octasaccharides were then obtained, using a 2 + 4 or 4 + 4 oligomerization strategy with total α stereoselectivity. Oligosaccharides were then deacetylated, the azido groups were reduced, the resulting amino groups were sulfated along with the free hydroxyl groups, and the methyl esters were saponified. Hydrogenolysis of the oligosaccharides benzyl groups gave the non-conjugated tetrasaccharides, hexasaccharides, and octasaccharides in 85% to quantitative yields. To obtain mimetics of the IFNγ binding site, oligosaccharides were conjugated, before hydrogenolysis, with bis-thio-poly(ethylene glycol) under UV light irradiation (360 nm) as described (26Lubineau A. Escher S. Alais J. Bonnaffé D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 4087-4090Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The benzyl protecting groups were then removed by hydrogenolysis after oxidation of the thioether linkages using pH 7 buffered oxone (27Trost B.M. Curran D.P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981; 22: 1287-1290Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar), giving rise to the glycoconjugates 2Tn, 2Hn, and 2On (where T, H, and O stand for tetrasaccharide, hexasaccharide, and octasaccharide, respectively, and 2 indicates that two oligosaccharides are linked through a spacer having n equal to 5, 10, or 32 ethylene glycol repeats). All samples were sterilized by filtration through 0.22-μm filters, quantified as described (28Bitter T. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5120) Google Scholar), and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (29Vives R.R. Goodger S. Pye D.A. Biochem.

Size-defined, heparin-derived oligosaccharides were also obtained by enzymatic depolymerization of pig intestinal mucosa heparin as described (10Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of Heparin and Biacore-based Binding Assay—Heparin, 1 mm in phosphate-buffered saline, was reacted for 24 h at room temperature with 10 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide. The mixture was extensively dialyzed against water to remove unreacted biotin and freeze-dried (10Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Two flow cells of CM3 or CM4 sensor chips were activated with 50 μlof 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, after which 50 μl of streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, was injected. Remaining activated groups were blocked with 50 μl of ethanolamine (1 m), pH 8.5. Typically, this procedure allowed coupling 2000–2500 resonance units (RU) of streptavidin on both flow cells. Biotinylated heparin (5 μg/ml) was captured to a level of 50 RU on one surface, and the other one was left untreated and served as negative control. Before use, the chip was submitted to several injections of Hepes-buffered saline containing 1.25 m NaCl and then washed by continuous flow of HBS-P buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% P20 detergent, pH 7.4). For binding assays, IFNγ, either alone or in combination with oligosaccharides, was simultaneously injected over both negative control and heparin surfaces for 5 min at 25 °C and 50 μl/min. The heparin surface was regenerated with a 250 μl pulse of 1.25 m NaCl. Biotinylation of Soluble IFNγ Receptor and Biacore Base Binding Assay—Soluble IFNγR (R&D Systems) at 250 μg/ml in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6, was reacted for 20 min in the dark at 4 °C, with 10 mm sodium periodate to oxidize glycans of the molecule. The reaction was quenched with 15 mm glycerol, and the sample was dialyzed against the 20 mm phosphate buffer. Biotin-LC-hydrazide was then added to a concentration of 5 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4°C. Ethanolamine (100 mm final) was then added to the sample, which was then extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Biotinylated soluble IFNγR (40 μg/ml) was captured on top of a streptavidin sensor chip (prepared as described above) to a level of 150–200 RU. Before use, the surface was conditioned with 10 2-min pulses of 10 mm HCl. For binding assay, samples (IFNγ either alone or in combination with oligosaccharides) diluted in HBS-P buffer maintained at 25 °C were injected over the IFNγR surface at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 5 min. The IFNγR surface was regenerated with 10 mm HCl. IFNγ Bioassays—Antiviral activity was determined in triplicate with a standard microtiter inhibition of cytopathic effect assay against the vesicular stomatitis virus on monolayers of WISH cells essentially as described (30Berg K. Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. APMIS. 1990; 98: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An IFNγ-induced HLA-DR antigen was measured with an enzyme-linked bio-immunoassay (31Gibson U.E. Kramer S.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 125: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For that purpose, Colo 205 cells seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate were treated with IFNγ during a 4-h period. After 72 h of additional culture, cells were fixed with ice-cold ethanol, and HLA-DR antigen was detected with an anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2500; Amersham Biosciences), both in Hanks' buffer sodium salt containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Design, Synthesis, and Characterization of the Glycoconjugates—Our previous studies (20Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggested that in the IFNγ-HS complex two NS domains directly interact with two IFNγ carboxyl termini and bridge the two cytokine monomers through an internal NA domain (Fig. 1). Although the atomic structure of IFNγ has been solved by x-ray crystallography, the organization of the carboxyl termini, which are believed to be intrinsically disordered, is unknown downstream of the residue Ala-123 (32Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L. Lundell D.J. Lunn C.A. Zauodny P.J. Narula S.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Because the exact distance that spans the two heparin binding domains is thus not defined, we prepared synthetic glycoconjugates in which poly(ethylene glycol)-based spacers of different lengths were used to link chemically obtained NS domains. For that purpose, a disaccharide building block was first prepared and converted into either a disaccharide donor or a disaccharide acceptor, which were condensed together (2 + 2) to give a tetrasaccharide (T). A similar strategy (2 + 4 or 4 + 4) was used to prepare hexasaccharides and octasaccharides (Fig. 2A). The glycoconjugates 2T5, 2T10, 2T32, 2H5, 2H10, 2H32, 2O5, 2O10, and 2O32 were obtained through conjugation of the oligosaccharides onto α,ω-bis-thio-poly(ethylene glycol) spacers of different lengths (Fig. 2B). 1H NMR and heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra were in accordance with the expected structures (data not shown). PAGE analysis (Fig. 3) showed that synthetic tetrasaccharides, hexasaccharides, and octasaccharides (lanes 2, 4, and 6) have the same migration pattern as the corresponding heparin-derived oligosaccharides (lanes 1, 3, and 5) but, in contrast to the natural size-purified mixtures, are homogenous. Conjugation to poly(ethylene glycol) linkers was clearly evidenced by the shift in migration observed for 2O5 (Fig. 3, lane 7), 2O10 (lane 8), and 2O32 (lane 9), each of which migrated at the position of natural octadecasaccharides and larger. Similar migration changes were observed for tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide conjugation (data not shown). In some case, conjugated oligosaccharides migrated as apparent doublets on the gel. However, because NMR analyses of these molecules were consistent with single structures, this result should not be caused by sample heterogeneity (see supplemental data, available in the on-line version of this article). Inhibition of the IFNγ-Heparin Interaction by the Glycoconjugates— To investigate the ability of the 12 different synthetic compounds to interact with IFNγ, an inhibition assay was set up in which the cytokine, either alone or coincubated with each of the 12 molecules (at 37.5, 75, or 150 nm) to be analyzed, was injected over both a heparin-functionalized sensor chip and a streptavidin sensor chip used as a control surface. Injection of IFNγ over the heparin surface produced at equilibrium a binding response of 180 RU, whereas a response of 5 RU was observed over the streptavidin surface (data not shown). Results showed (Fig. 4) that whereas the tetrasaccharides and hexasaccharides were completely inactive, the octasaccharide slightly prevented the IFNγ-heparin binding (no more than 20% inhibition was observed with the highest dose of octasaccharide), indicating that by themselves these oligosaccharides did not display significant affinity for the cytokine. Conjugation of tetrasaccharides or hexasaccharides to the different poly(ethylene glycol) linkers did not lead to significant inhibition activity (25–30% of inhibition at 150 nm; Fig. 4C). In contrast, octasaccharides conjugated to spacers with 5, 10, or 32 poly(ethylene glycol) repeats (2O5, 2O10, or 2O32) clearly inhibited the binding of IFNγ to heparin, the most active molecule (2O10) displaying a 50% inhibition at ∼35–40 nm (Fig. 4A). These results strongly suggest that the glycoconjugates function by bridging the two IFNγ monomers and that proper spacing of the oligosaccharides are important for the binding process. Similar experiments performed with 15- and 5-kDa heparin indicated that 20 and 130 nm were required, respectively, to produce 50% inhibition (data not shown). The Glycoconjugates Inhibit the IFNγ-IFNγR Interaction—A number of studies demonstrated that the IFNγ carboxyl termini are critical for bioactivity (33Lundell D.L. Narula S.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been suggested that residues 128–132 (Lys-Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser) within this domain of the cytokine are required for receptor binding, and a model has been proposed where this basic cluster is located near an acidic patch of the IFNγR (32Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L. Lundell D.J. Lunn C.A. Zauodny P.J. Narula S.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether the synthetic oligosaccharides would inhibit the binding of the cytokine to its receptor. For that purpose, we immobilized the ectodomain of the IFNγR on a Biacore sensor chip and analyzed the ability of the synthetic oligosaccharides to inhibit the IFNγ-IFNγR interaction. IFNγ was preincubated with increasing concentrations of the different molecules to be analyzed and then injected over the IFNγR surface (Fig. 5). The first two sets of sensorgrams show that unconjugated oligosaccharides (Fig. 5A) and conjugated tetrasaccharides (Fig. 5B) had no or minimal effect on the IFNγ-IFNγR interaction. Conjugated hexasaccharides (2H5, 2H10, and 2H32) yielded a modest inhibition (Fig. 5C) as did the conjugated octasaccharides 2O5 and 2O32 (Fig. 5, D and E), whereas the 2O10 had a marked effect on the binding process (Fig. 5F). The 2O10 compound activity is similar to that of a 6-kDa heparin fragment. The 2O10 Glycoconjugate Displays Anti-IFNγ Activity—In view of the above data, we investigated whether 2O10 would inhibit IFNγ activity. We thus measured the ability of 2O10 to prevent the induction of the HLA-DR antigen by IFNγ, using Colo 205 cells. We found that optimum HLA-DR antigen was observed 72 h after the initial stimulation with 5 ng/ml of IFNγ, and these conditions were used in the following experiments. Cells were treated with IFNγ that was preincubated with a range of concentration of 2O10 (0–25 μg/ml), and HLA-DR expression was quantified 72 h later. Our data (Fig. 6A) showed that 2O10 clearly displayed anti-IFNγ activity, with an IC50 close to 1.5 μg/ml (250 nm). Analysis of all the other glycoconjugates demonstrated that their anti-IFNγ activity closely match their ability to inhibit the IFNγ-IFNγR interaction (Fig. 6B). Structural heterogeneity of HS is the basis of the many functions these molecules fulfill, in particular through their unique ability to interact with a large array of proteins (34Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Despite increased interest in the field, progress has been hampered by the extraordinary complexity of HS. In particular, the characterization of the protein-HS interface and the isolation of the corresponding binding domains are very difficult, an aspect particularly prominent in the case of IFNγ, the binding site of which is not simply contained within a single structural domain of the polysaccharide (20Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this context, we chose a chemical strategy to investigate the general motif organization that IFNγ recognizes on HS. According to the model of the IFNγ-HS complex (see Fig. 1) that was used as a working hypothesis, different heparin-like oligosaccharides were synthesized and linked to each other using molecular spacers of distinct lengths. Binding studies first pointed out that properly spaced interacting sequences acted in a concerted manner to form a functional unit, because none of the unconjugated oligosaccharides displayed efficient binding activity. Optimal activity was observed when a spacer of 10 poly(ethylene glycol) repeats (∼50-Å-long) was introduced between the two NS domains. Interestingly, the last two defined residues (Ala-123) in the IFNγ crystallographic structure are at a distance of 23 Å. The 50-Å spacer should thus function by optimally presenting the two binding NS domains to the IFNγ basic clusters (see Fig. 1), in contrast to the 5 and 32 poly(ethylene glycol) repeats that are 33- and 114-Å-long, respectively, and presumably might impose accommodations to meet an appropriate binding conformation. Our results also clearly demonstrated the importance of the oligosaccharide size for the binding, because the glycoconjugates containing tetra-NS or hexa-NS domains, although linked with the optimal spacer, were unable to significantly interact with IFNγ. The 2O10 molecule (two octasaccharides linked with the 10 poly(ethylene glycol) repeat spacer) thus appears to be the best mimic of the IFNγ binding domain. Because its central domain is not HS derived, the 2O10 molecule is much less charged than the natural equivalent molecule. However, its binding activity and its ability to inhibit IFNγ are identical to that of heparin, demonstrating that it represents a fully functional binding unit. The C2 symmetry of this compound may also contribute to its binding activity by fitting the symmetry of the IFNγ dimer better than a natural single HS chain. The achievement of such a molecule has considerable interests for different purposes. First, in contrast to natural derived compounds, this molecule is homogeneous and large amounts of it can be prepared. A possibility that arises from this quality is the development of structural studies of the cytokine in complex with the glycoconjugate, a point that was not possible before. Like many disordered segments, the carboxyl-terminal peptide of IFNγ may fold on binding to its target (35Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) and thus might be characterized by x-ray crystallography. Because this part of the protein is a critical regulatory element of the cytokine activity (33Lundell D.L. Narula S.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), resolving its structure is an important issue. Secondly, the 2O10 molecule is clearly a prototype with considerable potential for refinement. In particular, we have not yet addressed the importance of the sulfation profile within the NS octasaccharides. Combinatorial synthesis is a possible tool to generate distinct sulfo forms and/or an iduronic/glucuronic pattern (23Gavard O. Hersant Y. Alais J. Duverger V. Dilhas A. Bascou A. Bonnaffé D. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 18: 3603-3620Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and should give rise to molecules with better defined and specific oligosaccharide sequences, a point that can now be investigated in the context of the 2O10 scaffold. Another important aspect of the present work is the observation that, once bound to the 2O10 molecule, IFNγ did not interact anymore with its cell surface receptor and, consequently, is biologically inactive. The importance of the IFNγ carboxyl-terminal domain for receptor binding has been investigated by carboxyl-terminal deletions and site-directed mutagenesis (33Lundell D.L. Narula S.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies all point out that preservation of the Lys-Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser sequence is critical for activity. Our data are thus consistent with the view that 2O10 directly interacts with this sequence and blocks binding to both HS and IFNγR. The fact that a carboxyl-terminal region of the cytokine can bind to two such unrelated molecules as 2O10 and IFNγR could be somewhat surprising. However, this part of the molecule is disordered, a feature that has been recently recognized as frequently involved in regulatory functions and that confers functional advantages to the protein, including the ability to bind in different conformations to different targets (35Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). IFNγ is a key cytokine involved in the development and maintenance of the Th1 arm of the immune system (16Schroder K. Hertzog P.J. Ravasi T. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). However, aside from normal functions in host defense, IFNγ production may also contribute to a number of diseases characterized by pro-inflammatory and autoaggressive Th1 response (36Billiau A. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 61-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, and alopecia areata (37Skurkovich B. Skurkovich S. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2003; 5: 52-57PubMed Google Scholar) or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (38Bouma G. Strober W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). IFNγ is also a key contributor to hyperoxia-induced lung injury (39Yamada M. Kubo H. Kobayashi S. Ishizawa K. Sasaki H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L1042-L1047Google Scholar) and, because of its ability to induce a major histocompatibility complex in many tissues, is associated with graft rejection (40Hidalgo L.G. Halloran P.F. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 22: 317-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cytokine is thus considered as an attractive target for the treatment of such diseases, and strategies have been developed to antagonize its biological activity. So far these strategies have focused on the use of soluble IFNγR (41Ozmen L. Roman D. Fountoulakis M. Schmid G. Ryffel B. Garotta G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 42Nicoletti F. Zaccone P. Di Marco R. Di Mauro M. Magro G. Grasso S. Mughini L. Meroni P. Garotta G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5567-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or neutralizing antibodies, and in some cases these were found to offer substantial clinical benefits (37Skurkovich B. Skurkovich S. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2003; 5: 52-57PubMed Google Scholar, 43Froyen G. Billiau A. Biotherapy. 1997; 10: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Humanized anti-IFNγ is also currently evaluated in Crohn disease (44Lim W.C. Hanauer S.B. Rev. Gastroenterol. Disord. 2004; 4: 66-85PubMed Google Scholar). On the other side, administration of a HS binding cationic peptide (derived from the IFNγ carboxyl terminus) has delayed the time of rejection in a mouse model of allogenic skin flap transplantation (45Fernandez-Botran R. Gorantla V. Sun X. Ren X. Perez-Abadia G. Crespo F.A. Oliver R. Orhun H.I. Quan E.E. Maldonado C. Ray M. Barker J.H. Transplantation. 2002; 74: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the 2O10 molecule described here inhibits the binding of IFNγ to both HS and IFNγR, the two known ligands of the cytokine. Such a molecule should thus inhibit both bioactivity and local concentration within tissue and therefore should compare very favorably with neutralizing antibodies that have been selected for their ability to inhibit IFNγ bioactivity but not binding to HS. There is enormous potential for the development of heparin-like structures as drugs for a range of diseases in addition to the current antithrombotic target (46Lever R. Page C.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 47Coombe D.R. Kett W.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on the 2O10 scaffold, our future work will investigate whether such type of molecules could be of some interest in pathologies for which IFNγ has been identified as a target.

As a result, factors that modulate these processes are of great interest for the potential treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Here, we present evidence that the heterotrimeric G protein Gz and its effectors, including some previously thought to be confined in expression to neuronal cells, are present in pancreatic β-cells, the largest cellular constituent of the islets of Langerhans. Furthermore, signaling pathways upon which Gαz impacts are intact in β-cells, and Gαz activation inhibits both cAMP production and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the Ins-1(832/13) β-cell-derived line. Inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by prostaglandin E (PGE1) is pertussis-toxin insensitive, indicating that other Gαi family members are not involved in this process in this β-cell line. Indeed, overexpression of a selective deactivator of Gαz, the RGS domain of RGSZ1, blocks the inhibitory effect of PGE1 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Finally, the inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by PGE1 is substantially blunted by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Gαz expression. Taken together, these data strongly imply that the endogenous E prostanoid receptor in the Ins-1(832/13) β-cell line couples to Gz predominantly and perhaps even exclusively. These data provide the first evidence for Gz signaling in pancreatic β-cells, and identify an endogenous receptor-mediated signaling process in β-cells that is dependent on Gαz function.

Pancreatic islet β-cells are the sole producers of insulin in the body and thus play an important homeostatic role in the secretion of insulin in response to glucose and other secretagogues. Normally, the release of insulin from β-cells induces the peripheral tissues to take up available glucose from the plasma. Disregulation of this process can lead to the development of Type 2 diabetes, wherein the β-cells are unable to compensate for peripheral tissue insulin resistance, either through inadequate β-cell function and/or a decrease in β-cell mass (1Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Certain hormones such as norepinephrine, somatostatin, galanin, and E prostaglandins decrease the secretion of insulin from β-cells in response to glucose (2Sharp G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of pancreatic islet preparations with pertussis toxin (PTX) 1The abbreviations used are: PTX, pertussis toxin; PGE, prostaglandin E; QL, designating mutationally activated form of a Gα subunit; HA, hemagglutinin; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HBSS, Hepes-buffered saline solution; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. alleviates the inhibitory effects of some of these hormones, leading to the original description of PTX as islet-activating protein (3Katada T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 469-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTX catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of a cysteine residue near the C terminus of nearly all Gα subunits of the Gαi subfamily (4Moss J. Vaughan M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 303-379PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is mediated by Gαi proteins. However, several reports indicate a lack of effect, or only a partial effect, of PTX pretreatment on inhibition of insulin secretion in islets (5Hillaire-Buys D. Gross R. Roye M. Ribes G. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 218: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 6Seaquist E.R. Neal A.R. Shoger K.D. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P.

Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This phenomenon of PTX insensitivity has been suggested to be because of insufficient PTX or too short a period of exposure (2Sharp G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although an alternative explanation is that certain GPCRs are coupled to a PTX-insensitive G protein. The finding that the PTX-insensitive Gαi family member Gαz (9Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) might be expressed in pancreatic islet cells (10Skoglund G. Basmaciogullari A. Rouot B. Marie J.C. Rosselin G. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) opened the possibility that such signaling pathways exists in β-cells. Clues to potential unique functions of Gαz have emerged from yeast two-hybrid screens that identified proteins that selectively interact with constitutively active Gαz (11Fan X. Brass L.F. Poncz M. Spitz F. Maire P. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized Gαz effectors is Rap1GAP, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for a member of the Ras family of small G proteins, Rap1. The physical interaction between Gαz and Rap1GAP blocks both the ability of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins to stimulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Gαz and the ability of activated Gαz to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (12Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36663-36669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In cell-based studies, activated Gαz is able to recruit Rap1GAP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Through this process, activation of Gαz inhibits Rap1 activation and accompanying ERK phosphorylation and differentiation of PC12 cells that is normally induced by treatment with either a cAMP analogue or nerve growth factor (15Meng J.

Based on these findings, a model has been proposed in which receptor-mediated activation of Gz results in recruitment of Rap1GAP to the plasma membrane, where it can effectively down-regulate Rap1 signaling processes (15Meng J. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other effectors of Gαz that were discovered through yeast two-hybrid screens include RGSZ1, a Gαz-selective RGS protein (13Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and the transcriptional cofactor Eya2 (11Fan X. Brass L.F. Poncz M. Spitz F. Maire P. Manning D.R. J.

In the present study we demonstrated that Gαz and members of a unique Gαz signaling axis are expressed in pancreatic β-cells and β-cell-derived lines. In addition, utilizing three separate methods to perturb Gα signaling, we establish that Gαz is required for PGE1-mediated inhibition of GSIS. These data strongly suggest that Gz has a physiological role in important facets of β-cell biology. Materials—Anti-GFP, Gα12, Rap1, myc-tag, HA-tag, and Gαz primary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Gαz antibody P-961 (16Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also used in certain experiments, as indicated in the respective figure legends. Anti-Rap1GAP was a gift of Paul Polakis, Genentech, anti-pan-Gαi was a gift of Tom Gettys, Pennington Biomedical Research Institute, and anti-RGSZ1 was a gift of Elliot Ross, UT-Southwestern. siRNA oligonucleotides used were a control luciferase plasmid sequence (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) and rat Gαz-specific oligonucleotides (Ambion, Austin, TX) as stated in the figure legends. Cell Culture—The rat insulinoma line Ins-1 and the selected glucose-responsive Ins-1(832/13) subline were obtained from Chistopher Newgard at the Sarah W. Stedman Nutrition and Metabolism Center at Duke University. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The mouse insulinoma line, Min6, was obtained from Dr. J. Miyazaki (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Min6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The rat pancreatic exocrine line Panc-1 was obtained from the Cell Culture Facility at the Duke University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Panc-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 and passaged after reaching 80–90% confluence. Immunohistochemistry—Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then processed into paraffin blocks using standard protocols (17Werner M. Von Wasielewski R. Komminoth P. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5-μm sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were placed on positively charged slides and permitted to dry, followed by removal of paraffin. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched, and sections were then hydrated, followed by incubation with a 5% goat serum solution. Sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval (17Werner M. Von Wasielewski R. Komminoth P. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) by steaming in 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0. Sections were next incubated with Background Buster® (Innovex Biosciences, Richmond, CA) to reduce background staining and then with anti-glucagon, anti-insulin, or anti-Gαz antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antisera (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) followed by RTU Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and finally by horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove Park, PA). Visualization of bound immune complex was performed by using an horseradish peroxidase substrate. Hematoxylin counterstain (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was used, followed by traditional dehydration, clearing, and mounting. Immunoblot Analysis—Adherent cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping with a rubber policeman and sonicating in a Tris-EDTA solution. In some cases, cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation for 5 min at 200,000 × g. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad Protein Assay, Bio-Rad). Unless otherwise indicated, 40 μg of total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, followed by incubation with an anti-rabbitor anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase was detected using Western Lightning® chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer). Generation of Recombinant Retroviruses and Selection of Stable Cell Lines—The cDNA encoding wild-type Gαz was obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource Center (University of Missouri, Rolla, MO). The Gαz coding region was subcloned into the EcoRI-NotI sites of the retroviral shuttle vector pLPCX (Clontech). pLPCX-Gαz and pVSV-G were cotransfected into the pantropic packaging cell line GP2 293 using cesium chloride precipitation according to manufacturer's protocol. Viral medium was filtered and concentrated 48 h after transfection. Concentrated viral medium was mixed with 5 μg/ml Polybrene and used to infect Ins-1(832/13) cells. The infection medium was removed after 24 h and replaced with growth medium. Stable transformants were selected 24 h later with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 14 days. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses and Infection of Ins-1(832/13) Cells—cDNAs encoding Gαz(QL), Gαi2(QL), Gα12(QL), RGS2, p115 RhoGAP, and RGSZ1 were obtained from the UMR cDNA resource center. The respective coding regions were subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pAdTrack-CMV constructs were linearized with PmeI and electroporated into BJ5183-AD-1 cells (Stratagene). Recombinant adenoviral plasmids were purified from isolated colonies and transfected into HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Viral plaques formed between 7–10 days posttransfection, and viral lysates were used to serially infect HEK 293 cells for large scale viral preparations. Ins-1(832/13) cells were plated at 2.5–3 × 105 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were infected for 1 h with an empirical titer of virus that resulted in nearly 100% infection as determined by GFP expression. Cells were assayed for cAMP generation and/or insulin secretion 24 h postinfection. Cyclic AMP Immunoassay—Ins-1(832/13) cells were grown to 100% confluence in 12-well tissue culture plates. On the day of the assay the cells were washed once with a 3 mm glucose-containing Hepes-buffered saline solution (HBSS) (114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4,20mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 25.5 mm NaHCO3,10mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) and then preincubated for 2 h in fresh 3 mm glucose-HBSS. Next, 1 ml of 3 mm glucose- or 15 mm glucose-HBSS was added to each well for 2 h. All wells were treated with 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 20 min prior to and during the stimulation period. At the end of the stimulation time, the HBSS was removed, the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed in 300 μl of lysis reagent (cAMP Biotrack® Enzymeimmunoassay System, Amersham Biosciences). Determinations of cAMP in each sample were performed in duplicate according to manufacturer's protocol. Protein content was used to normalize the cAMP assay results. Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion Assays—Ins-1(832/13) cells were grown to 100% confluence in 12-well tissue culture plates. The day before the GSIS assay, selected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PTX (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) or infected with recombinant adenoviruses as noted in the figure legends. Confluent Ins-1(832/13) cells were preincubated in 3 mm glucose-HBSS as described above for cAMP assays. Next, 1 ml of 3 mm glucose- or 15 mm glucose-HBSS was added to each well for 2 h. In certain cases GPCR agonists UK14,304 (Sigma-Aldrich) or PGE1 (EMD Biosciences) were added during the stimulation period. Following stimulation, the secretion medium was removed and assayed for insulin content (Coat-A-Count® [125I]insulin radioimmunoassay, Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). The remaining cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping and sonicating in Tris-EDTA buffer. The protein concentration was used to normalize the insulin assay results. Insulin secretion was represented as fold stimulation, which is the ratio of insulin secretion in 15 mm to that in 3 mm glucose. siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing—Ins-1(832/13) cells were grown to 50–75% confluence in 10-cm dishes. Cells were trypsinized, and 5 × 106 cells were electroporated with 200 pmol of annealed siRNA oligonucleotide using the Amaxa Nucleofector® (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), solution T, program T20. Each reaction was split between 4 wells of a 12-well plate. The GSIS assay was performed 48 h postelectroporation. Statistical Analyses—Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v4 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Data are given as the mean ± S.E. and compared by one- or two-way analysis of variance, followed by the relevant post-test to determine p values. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant. There are two reports of Gαz protein expression in rat pancreatic islets of Langerhans (10Skoglund G. Basmaciogullari A. Rouot B. Marie J.C. Rosselin G. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Zigman J.M. Westermark G.T. LaMendola J. Steiner D.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but neither the specificity nor the relevance of this expression was determined. To confirm that Gαz is expressed in islets and to delineate its expression pattern, an immunohistochemical study was undertaken. Mouse pancreases were formalin-fixed and immunostained for Gαz, glucagon (to identify the α-cells), or insulin (to identify the β-cells). Confirming the previous report (10Skoglund G. Basmaciogullari A. Rouot B. Marie J.C. Rosselin G. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), Gαz is expressed in both the periphery and interior of the islet (Fig. 1A), suggesting expression in both the α-cells and β-cells, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). In a separate immunohistochemical experiment, we sought to demonstrate the specificity of Gαz expression in islets. Again, Gαz expression was readily detected in the periphery and interior of the islet (Fig. 1D), but all staining was lost when the Gαz antibody was preincubated with the Gαz-specific peptide to which the antibody was raised (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, Gαz expression was readily detected by immunoblot analysis of isolated rat islets (Fig. 1F). We next sought to confirm that Gαz is expressed in β-cell-derived lines that are often used to assess β-cell function in vitro. We obtained several β-cell-derived lines, including Min6, Ins-1, and Ins-1(832/13). Although Min6 and Ins-1 cells are established β-cell lines, each has a fairly low GSIS response compared with intact islets (20Ulrich A.B. Schmied B.M. Standop J. Schneider M.B. Pour P.M. Pancreas. 2002; 24: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ins-1(832/13) cells are a derivative of the Ins-1 cell line with robust GSIS of a magnitude similar to that of normal islets (7–10-fold responses to stimulatory glucose) (21Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 22Schisler J.C. Jensen P.B. Taylor D.G. Becker T.C. Knop F.K.

Lysates from each cell type were normalized for protein content and analyzed by immunoblotting for the members of the best described Gαz-specific signaling pathway: Gαz, Rap1GAP, and Rap1 (12Meng J. Glick J.L. Polakis P. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36663-36669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Meng J. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Gαz and Rap1GAP were expressed in β-cell-derived lines and in isolated islets but not the exocrine pancreatic Panc-1 cells (Fig. 1F). These findings are consistent with specific Gαz expression in the cells of the pancreatic islet. Activation of Gi subfamily members by a number of GPCR ligands can inhibit various β-cell functions, including glucose-stimulated cAMP production and insulin secretion (24Robertson R.P. Seaquist E.R. Walseth T.F. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To assess a potential role for Gz in these processes, we first measured glucose-stimulated cAMP production in Ins-1(832/13) infected with mutationally active (QL (25Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15467-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) forms of Gαz, Gαi2, or Gα12 (Fig. 2A). Expression of Gαz(QL) and Gαi2(QL) significantly inhibited cAMP production, whereas, as expected, expression of Gα12(QL) had no effect (Fig. 2B). We next assessed the ability of Gz to impact GSIS. As was seen with cAMP production, both Gαz(QL) and Gαi2(QL) significantly inhibited GSIS in Ins-1(832/13) cells, whereas Gα12(QL) had no effect (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that Gαz can function to inhibit adenylyl cyclase in β-cells similar to other Gαi proteins (24Robertson R.P. Seaquist E.R. Walseth T.F. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As noted above, members of a unique Gαz signaling axis, Gαz, Rap1GAP, and Rap1, are present in pancreatic islet β-cells. To initially assess whether this signaling axis is functional in β-cells, we expressed Gαz(QL) in Ins-1(832/13) cells and tested its ability to cause a translocation of Rap1GAP from the cytosol to the membrane, a function that is specific to activated Gαz, and not other Gαi subfamily members (15Meng J. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells expressing either Gαz(QL) or Gαi2(QL) (Fig. 3A) were disrupted and subjected to ultracentrifugation to obtain membrane and cytosol fractions and then immunoblotted for Rap1GAP. Importantly, Gαz(QL) but not Gαi2(QL) caused a significant translocation of Rap1GAP from the cytosol to the membrane fraction of Ins-1(832/13) cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the Gαz-Rap1GAP axis is intact in this β-cell line. We next assessed whether endogenous GPCRs in In-1(832/13) cells could in fact transmit signals through Gz. The α2A-adrenergic receptor has already been shown to be capable of signaling through Gz in other cell types (15Meng J. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and has a clear role in the inhibition of GSIS (5Hillaire-Buys D. Gross R. Roye M. Ribes G. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Another possible candidate for an endogenous Gz-coupled receptor in β-cells is the E prostanoid receptor because of the reported PTX-insensitive inhibition of β-cell function by PGE1 and PGE2 (8Sjoholm A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of Ins-1(832/13) expressing wild-type Gαz with either the α2A-adrenoreceptor agonist UK14,304 or the E prostanoid receptor agonist PGE1 resulted an increase of Rap1GAP in the membrane fraction of the cells (Fig. 3C). Because Rap1GAP translocation is a function that is attributed to activated Gαz but not Gαi2 ((15Meng J. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2B), these results provided the impetus to study the effects of these GPCR pathways in a biologically relevant model. To discern possible Gz-specific effects on β-cell biology, Ins-1(832/13) cells were treated with PTX to irreversibly inactivate all other Gαi subfamily members save Gαz (data not shown). Following PTX treatment, GSIS assays were performed with and without UK14,304 or PGE1 addition. Although UK14,304 strongly inhibited GSIS, this inhibition was significantly PTX-sensitive (Fig. 4A), suggesting that although the α2A-adrenoreceptor can couple to Gz in Ins-1(832/13) cells (Fig. 3B) it may predominantly signal through other Gαi subfamily members. Strikingly, however, the inhibition of GSIS by PGE1 was completely insensitive to PTX pretreatment (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the E prostanoid receptor in Ins-1(832/13) cells signals predominantly though Gz. To test the hypothesis that the PGE1 receptor signals predominantly through Gz, we made use of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, which can be used to selectively inhibit specific subtypes of heterotrimeric G proteins (31Kozasa T. Ye R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 153-167PubMed Google Scholar). Ins-1(832/13) cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding the RGS domains of RGSZ1, RGS2, or p115 RhoGEF, which selectively inhibit the PTX-insensitive Gz (13Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A.

A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and G12 proteins (34Arai K. Maruyama Y. Nishida M. Tanabe S. Takagahara S. Kozasa T. Mori Y. Nagao T. Kurose H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Meigs T.E. Juneja J. Demarco C.T. Stemmle L.N. Kaplan D.D. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18049-18055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), respectively. GSIS was measured in Ins-1(832/13) cells expressing these RGS proteins in the absence or presence of PGE1. Only the RGS domain of RGSZ1 attenuated the ability of PGE1 to inhibit GSIS (Fig. 4B), strongly implicating a Gz-specific signaling pathway from the E prostanoid receptor to the secretion apparatus. To confirm the requirement for Gαz in PGE1-mediated inhibition of GSIS, we employed a RNA interference approach targeting Gαz expression. siRNA oligonucleotides targeting the Gαz transcript or a control luciferase sequence were introduced into Ins-1(832/13) cells. This strategy resulted in a decrease in Gαz expression of ∼90% after 48 h (Fig. 4C, inset). This knock-down of Gαz expression significantly attenuated the ability of PGE1 to inhibit GSIS (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the PTX insensitivity of the PGE1 effect on GSIS, the ability of the RGS domain of RGSZ1 to completely block the inhibition of GSIS by PGE1, and the effect of knockdown of Gαz expression demonstrate that the endogenous receptor for PGE1 in the Ins-1(832/13) β-cell line is coupled predominantly, if not solely, to Gz. Gαz, the PTX-insensitive member of the Gαi subfamily of heterotrimeric G protein α-subunits, was first identified in 1988 (36Matsuoka M. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5384-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Fong H.K. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3066-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), yet still relatively little is known about its function in vivo. Functional roles for Gαz have been demonstrated in the nervous system and platelets (9Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that Gαz is expressed and/or functional in other tissues (10Skoglund G. Basmaciogullari A. Rouot B. Marie J.C. Rosselin G. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Maghazachi A.A. Al-Aoukaty A. Naper C. Torgersen K.M. Rolstad B. J.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but many of these results are still preliminary. In this study, we provide the first compelling evidence that Gαz is both present and functional in pancreatic β-cells. Furthermore, although receptor coupling to Gz has been previously studied in reconstituted systems or in Gαz-null mice (9Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), direct evidence for endogenous receptor coupling to this G protein has remained elusive. Hence, the finding in this study that endogenous Gz can couple to the endogenous E prostanoid receptor in a pancreatic β-cell line to inhibit GSIS is an important advance in our understanding of the potential physiological roles of this unique member of the Gi subfamily. The α2A-adrenoreceptor was previously shown to couple to Gz in neuronal model PC12 cells (15Meng J. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and in platelets (26Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α2A-adrenoreceptor stimulation causes an increase in membrane-localized Rap1GAP in Ins-1(832/13) cells expressing wild-type Gαz (Fig. 3B). However, the inhibition of GSIS by the α2A-adrenoreceptor agonist UK14,304 is PTX-sensitive in Ins-1(832/13) cells, suggesting that the endogenous receptor predominantly couples to other Gi subfamily members (Fig. 4A). This data is supported by the PTX-sensitive inhibition of GSIS by other α2-adrenoreceptor agonists in isolated islets or β-cell-derived lines (43Lang J. Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Regazzi R. Kiraly C. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 44Laychock S.G. Bilgin S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 218: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and emphasizes the caution that must be used when interpreting experiments studying coupling of receptors to G proteins in reconstituted systems. The results described in our experiments from three different modes of perturbing Gα signaling, PTX treatment, RGS overexpression, and siRNA-mediated knock-down, lead to a single conclusion: that the endogenous E prostanoid receptor in Ins-1(832/13) cells selectively couples to Gz. E prostanoids, along with norepinephrine, somatostatin, and galanin, are classic physiological inhibitors of GSIS (45Cheng H. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E287-E294Google Scholar). Exogenous PGE1 and PGE2 inhibit the acute insulin response, i.e. the spike in insulin following a glucose challenge (46Robertson R.P. Annu. Rev. Med. 1983; 34: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). E prostanoids also have a physiological role in islet homeostasis. PGE2 is produced by the cyclooxygenase-catalyzed metabolism of arachidonic acid in normal pancreatic islets and acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to modulate cell growth and hormone secretion (47Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are cyclooxygenase inhibitors, tend to improve the acute insulin response in diabetics (46Robertson R.P. Annu. Rev. Med. 1983; 34: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 48Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As EP2 and EP4 receptors mainly couple to Gs, whereas EP1 receptors couple to Gq subfamily members (49Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), an EP3 receptor splice variant is the most likely link between E prostanoids and Gz. Supporting this, the EP3 mRNA is the predominant mRNA subtype expressed in rat islets (48Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31245-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There exists a tendency to classify Gαz as simply a Gαi subfamily member that is insensitive to PTX. However, although the similarities between Gαz and other Gαi proteins cannot be ignored, the limited tissue distribution of Gαz (9Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), its unusual biochemical properties (16Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the identification of Gαz-specific effectors such as Rap1GAP, RGSZ1, and Eya2 support a unique role for Gαz. Our results have led to the first described role(s) for Gz signaling in pancreatic β-cells and provide a greater understanding of the importance that individual G proteins play in β-cell functions.

A smooth transition from cryogenic-like to solution phase properties can be obtained by using a combination of sol-gel encapsulation, addition of glycerol as a bathing medium, and temperature tuning (-15 → 65 °C). This approach was applied to a series of double mutants, myoglobin CO (H64L/V68X, where X = Ala, Val, Leu, Asn, and Phe), which were designed to examine the contributions of the position 68(E11) side chain to the appearance and disappearance of internal rebinding phases in the absence of steric and polar interactions with the distal histidine. Based on the effects of viscosity, temperature, and the stereochemistry of the E11 side chain, the three major phases, B → A, C → A, and D → A, can be assigned, respectively, to ligand rebinding from the following: (i) the distal heme pocket, (ii) the xenon cavities prior to large amplitude side chain conformational relaxation, and (iii) the xenon cavities after significant conformational relaxation of the position 68(E11) side chain. The relative amplitudes of the B → A and C → A phases depend markedly on the size and shape of the E11 side chain, which regulates sterically both ligand return to the heme iron atom and ligand migration to the xenon cavities. The internal xenon cavities provide a transient docking site that allows side chain relaxations and the entry of water into the vacated distal pocket, which in turn slows ligand recombination markedly.

Proteins are inherently complex materials, and even their simplest reactions exhibit layers of complexity that were not anticipated a few decades ago (1.Frauenfelder H. Sligar S.G. Wolynes P.G.

Much of the work on Mb has been directed toward understanding the biophysical principles associated with both bimolecular and internal ligand rebinding after photolysis of the Fe-CO bond. Key issues include the following: (i) the roles of distal and proximal heme pocket amino acids; (ii) the roles of internal water molecules near the active site; (iii) the roles of local and global conformational relaxations that are modulated by solvent; and (iv) the roles of pre-existing internal cavities associated with xenon binding.

At ambient temperatures, most vertebrate MbCOs exhibit very small amplitudes for the internal rebinding after laser photolysis. Consequently, geminate CO rebinding is usually examined at low temperatures or high viscosity where bimolecular rebinding from the solvent is effectively zero, and ligand escape from the protein is slowed greatly. O2 and NO complexes are typically used to examine recombination phases in low viscosity solvents at room temperature because of their much higher intrinsic reactivity with the heme iron atom, which enhances the rate of iron-ligand bond formation 10-1,000-fold (10.Draghi F.

However, in contrast to the stable CO complex, the NO and O2 derivatives pose difficulties because of autoxidation of the equilibrium ligand-bound A state. Over the past several years, we have developed the use of sol-gels and glycerol solutions that enhance geminate recombination by blocking ligand escape to the solvent. These conditions provide a method to follow the evolution of the multiple kinetic phases for MbCO complexes and other hemeproteins by viscosity tuning at room temperatures in nonfrozen states (28.Doster W. Kleinert T. Post F. Settles M. Gregory R.B. Protein-Solvent Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1993: 375Google Scholar, 30.Agmon N. Doster W. Post F. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 717-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study, we have focused on a set of Mb double mutants that allow direct determination of the role of the position 68(E11) side chain in partitioning photodissociated CO between the distal heme pocket and the xenon cavities. In each protein the distal histidine (E7) was replaced with leucine (H64L) to prevent water from entering the distal heme pocket and hydrogen bonding to the imidazole side chain after photodissociation of bound CO (41.Cao W. Christian J.F. Champion P.M. Rosca F. Sage J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5728-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Leu(E7) side chain in H64L Mb does not shift position after ligand dissociation (42.Quillin M.L. Arduini R.M. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, right panel). After ligand dissociation in wild-type Mb, the imidazole side chain of His64 swings inward, occupies a position closer to the iron atom, inhibits internal rebinding, and eventually binds an internal water molecule in the equilibrium unliganded state, markedly inhibiting bimolecular rebinding from the solvent phase (Fig. 1, left panel). In contrast, the Leu64 side chain does not inhibit geminate rebinding and increases the overall second-order rate of association, k′CO, ∼60-fold (TABLE ONE). Thus, when the H64L mutation is coupled to mutations at position 68(E11), all of the observed differences can be assigned to the size and stereochemistry of the E11 side chain.TABLE ONECO binding parameters at pH 7.0, 20 °C, in 0.1 m phosphate bufferMbk′COkCOKCOFgemkgemμm−1 s−1s−1μm−1μs−1WT(H64/V68)0.510.019270.03aParameters were taken from Carver et al.

The E11 Ala, Val, Leu, and Phe series examines the effect of side chain size on ligand movement from the distal pocket to the remote xenon cavities and on access to the heme iron atom (Fig. 2). The E11 Leu and Asn pair allows an examination of the effects of side chain polarity and flexibility on both ligand recombination and migration. The crystal structures of Leu68 deoxy-Mb and MbCO show that the isobutyl side chain rotates away from the iron atom and has multiple conformations after CO is bound (Fig. 2). The reverse of these changes occurs after photolysis of bound CO, and thus extensive conformational relaxation is expected in the H64L/V68L double mutant. In contrast, the side chain of Asn68 is less free to rotate because of the planar configuration of the amide group (50.Sugimoto T. Unno M. Shiro Y. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2188-2194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All of the myoglobin mutants were encapsulated in porous sol-gels, and glycerol was added as a bathing medium. The observed ligand and protein conformational dynamics were followed over a wide range of viscosities (∼1 → 103 cP) by varying the temperature of the samples from 257 to 337 K (-15 to 65 °C). This approach both eliminates complications associated with “glass transitions” that occur at more cryogenic temperatures and avoids the limitations of trehalose matrices that act like glasses precluding smooth transitions from intermediate to low viscosity at room temperature. In the sol-gel/glycerol matrix, solvent-coupled phenomena can be selectively enhanced or suppressed, allowing more direct determination of solvent-decoupled kinetic processes. This viscosity “tuning” approach complements the cryogenic temperature derivative spectroscopy methods utilized by the Nienhaus group (8.Lamb D.C. Nienhaus K. Arcovito A. Draghi F. Miele A.E.

In the sol-gel work with glycerol as the bathing medium, high viscosity kinetic patterns are seen at temperatures in the range from -15 to 0 °C and change smoothly to the low viscosity pattern upon elevation to 45 and 65 °C. Horse heart Mb was commercially obtained from Sigma and used without further purification other than centrifugation to eliminate particulates. Mutant Mbs were produced using an expression system originally developed by Springer and Sligar (54.Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overall association time courses for CO binding to the H64L mutants were measured after photolysis of MbCO samples under pseudo first-order conditions, using a 300-ns excitation pulse from a Phase-R model 2100B dye laser. The transmittance signals were collected using a Tektronix TDS 220 100-MHz digital oscilloscope and IGOR data collection software (Fig. 3B) (14.Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5518-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Time courses for geminate recombination at 20 °C in simple phosphate buffer (Fig. 3A) were observed after excitation with a 9-ns Lumonics (Northville, MI) YM600 YAG laser. In this case, transmittance signals were obtained using a high speed Hamamatsu photomultiplier and a Tektronix TDS 3052 500-MHz digital oscilloscope (Beaverton, OR). A pulsed xenon arc lamp (Applied Photophysics models 04-122 and 03-412, Leatherhead, Surrey, UK) was used to increase the source light intensity during the time required for geminate rebinding (∼500 μs). CO dissociation time courses were measured in a conventional Gibson-Dionex stopped flow apparatus by mixing MbCO samples in 100 μm CO with buffer containing 2,000 μm NO (1 atm). Under these conditions, the observed replacement rate is directly equal to the overall rate constant for CO dissociation, kCO. Geminate recombination measurements in sol-gel and glycerol solutions were carried out using 8-ns 532-nm pulses at 1 Hz from a Nd:YAG laser (Minilite, Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) as a photodissociation source and a greatly attenuated continuous wave 442-nm probe beam from a He:Cd laser to monitor time-dependent changes in absorption. Details of the apparatus, data collection, and data display can be found in a previous publications and the citations therein (32.Dantsker D. Samuni U. Friedman A.J. Yang M. Ray A. Friedman J.M. J.

The kinetic traces are displayed on a log-log plot of normalized absorbance (proportional to fraction of deoxy-Mb photoproduct remaining) versus time. The use of the log-log plot helps expose multiple phases. Exponential rebinding originating from a single barrier and rate constant is seen as a near vertical line intersecting the time axis at a point that is roughly the inverse of the first-order rate constant. Kinetic phases originating from a continuous distribution of rates appear as a linear curve on the log-log plot, with a much smaller slope. Kinetic measurements were carried out on solution samples in standard 10- or 1-mm stoppered cuvettes placed in a custom-built dry N2 purged variable temperature cuvette holder (-15 to + 65 °C). Sol-gel-encapsulated samples were prepared as a thin layer lining the bottom portion of either 5- or 10-mm diameter NMR tubes as described previously (55.Samuni U. Dantsker D. Khan I. Friedman A.J.

Kinetic traces were deconvoluted using the maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis as a visual means of distinguishing kinetic phases and following their evolution as a function of viscosity/temperature. The MEM analysis was performed using an algorithm described previously (57.Siemiarczuk A. Ware W.R. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 7609-7618Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 58.Siemiarczuk A.

Chem. 1990; 94: 1661-1666Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar) that is now part of a commercially available package contained within the analysis module in Felix 3.2 software (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Kinetic data were usually analyzed using a maximum number of anticipated lifetimes and limiting the χ2 value to 1. Center points of the reported distributions are mean values for the Gaussian peaks. Estimates of the noise ranged from 5 to 10%, depending on the range of the original data. The results of the MEM analysis are presented as the reciprocal of the rates in order to have the distribution displayed on the same axis as the kinetic traces. To a first approximation, the MEM peak position corresponds to the reciprocal of the rebinding rate constant for a given phase, and the peak width provides an estimate of the distribution of rate constants, which presumably represent first-order rebinding in closely related protein-ligand conformations. A single exponential process involving only two conformations and one rebinding process would yield a single, very sharp peak, whereas a large distribution of rates within a given kinetic phase would be reflected in a broad band corresponding to a stretched exponential. Internal and Bimolecular CO Recombination in Solution—Time courses for both geminate and bimolecular rebinding to the H64L MbCO mutants at pH 7, 20 °C in low viscosity phosphate buffer are shown in Fig. 3 as conventional plots of fraction Mb versus time. The time courses for bimolecular rebinding from the solvent are monophasic and fit to simple, single exponential expressions with kobs = k′CO [CO] (Fig. 3A). Time courses for complete CO replacement by NO were also monophasic, and the observed rate constants equals kCO. Complete sets of overall association and dissociation rate constants are given in TABLES ONE and TWO, and the CO association equilibrium constants were calculated from the ratio k′CO/kCO.TABLE TWOCO binding parameters at pH 7.0, 20 °C, in 0.1 m phosphate bufferMbk′SBkBSKSBkBAkABKBAμm−1 s−1μs−1m−1μs−1s−1× 10−6WT(H64/V68)174.93.50.200.0207.7H64L/V68A1405.227230.024940H64L(V68)131149.55.60.037154H64L/V68L≤180aFitted geminate rate constants approaching the sp"

These proteins are used by developing neurons as extracellular cues in axonal growth and guidance. HB-GAM was recently reported to enhance differentiation of neural stem cells. Based on the solution structure of HB-GAM, we have recently shown that HB-GAM consists of two β-sheet domains flanked by flexible lysine-rich N- and C-terminal tails with no apparent structure. These domains are homologous to thrombospondin type I repeats present in numerous extracellular proteins that interact with the cell surface. Our findings showed that the two β-sheet domains fold independently. We showed that the domains (but not the lysine-rich tails) in HB-GAM are required and sufficient for interaction with hippocampal neurons. The individual domains bind heparan sulfate weakly and fail to produce significant biological effects in neurite outgrowth and long term potentiation assays. The amino acids in the linker region joining the two domains may be replaced with glycines with no effect on protein function. These results suggest a co-operative action of the two β-sheet domains in the biologically relevant interaction with neuron surface heparan sulfate.

The formation of neuronal connections in the developing brain is regulated by interactions of the cell surface with extracellular matrix molecules, soluble growth factors, and cell surface adhesion molecules. Similar mechanisms are implicated in the control of plastic changes in the adult nervous system. Heparan sulfate (HS)-mediated interactions of growing neuronal processes with proteins of the extracellular matrix are involved in axonal path finding during development and plasticity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of heparin/HS binding by these proteins is therefore of key importance in molecular neurobiology.HB-GAM 3The abbreviations used are: HB-GAMheparin-binding growth-associated moleculeTSRthrombospondin type 1 repeatPBSphosphate-buffered salinefEPSPfield excitatory postsynaptic potentialLTPlong term potentiationBSAbovine serum albuminHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceHSheparan sulfate.3The abbreviations used are: HB-GAMheparin-binding growth-associated moleculeTSRthrombospondin type 1 repeatPBSphosphate-buffered salinefEPSPfield excitatory postsynaptic potentialLTPlong term potentiationBSAbovine serum albuminHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceHSheparan sulfate. has been described as a heparin-binding protein expressed at the extracellular matrix of axonal tracts in the developing brain (1Rauvala H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Neurite outgrowth and osteoblast migration induced by HB-GAM depend on the neuronal cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan N-syndecan, also designated as syndecan-3 (6Imai S. Kaksonen M. Raulo E.

Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).We have suggested in our previous work (10Kilpeläinen I. Kaksonen M. Avikainen H. Fath M. Linhardt R.J. Raulo E. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13564-13570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that HB-GAM and mid-gestation kidney protein MK are structurally similar heparin-binding proteins homologous to the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) (Fig. 1). The TSR repeat is found in a larger superfamily of extracellular matrix-associated and cell surface proteins, such as thrombospondins 1 and 2, F-spondin, mindin, semaphorins F and G, and TRAP (thrombospondin-related anonymous protein from malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum) (for review, see Ref. 11Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A common feature for proteins in this superfamily is the function in cell surface and matrix binding that is dependent on heparin-type polysaccharides. Indeed, HB-GAM has been shown to bind the cell surface receptor N-syndecan via the heparan sulfate side chains of N-syndecan (7Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol.

This interaction leads to signaling by N-syndecan to cortactin/Src kinase pathway and reorganization of the cytoskeletal network resulting in the neuronal growth cone and osteoblast migration (6Imai S.

Similarly, mid-gestation kidney protein MK has been shown to interact with syndecans 1 and 4 earlier in development (13Kojima T. Katsumi A. Yamazaki T. Muramatsu T. Nagasaka T. Ohsumi K. Saito H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5914-5920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition to N-syndecan, HB-GAM interacts with the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTPβ/ζ at the cell surface (14Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol.

We have recently shown that HB-GAM inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. These activities of HB-GAM are proposed to occur through competition with fibroblast growth factor-2 for binding to cell surface heparan sulfate (17Hienola A. Pekkanen M. Raulo E. Vanttola P. Rauvala H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The present paper shows that the TSR domains in HB-GAM fold independently, and they do not interact with each other in solution conditions. Individual TSR domains derived from HB-GAM bind weakly to heparin/HS and fail to influence neurite outgrowth and plasticity. The domain structure of HB-GAM, in which both TSR domains are present, is required for heparin/HS binding and interaction with hippocampal neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPCR Mutagenesis of TSR Domain Proteins—The TSR domains of HB-GAM as individual recombinant proteins and as a di-domain polypeptide (TABLE ONE) were produced in Escherichia coli using the glutathione S-transferase fusion vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (10Kilpeläinen I.

The domain boundaries were predicted from previous NMR structural data (10Kilpeläinen I. Kaksonen M. Avikainen H. Fath M. Linhardt R.J. Raulo E. Rauvala H. J. Biol.

The single domain spans were as follows: N-terminal domain, amino acids Ser13-Asn58; C-terminal domain, amino acids Ala65-Gly110. The di-domain construct spanned amino acids Ser13-Gly110. Mismatch primers were used to generate differentially truncated forms of rat HB-GAM cDNA coding region as presented in TABLE ONE. To study the contribution of the linker region between the two TSR domains in heparin binding and biological activity constructs, G-linked di-TSR, TSR-N+Linker, and TSR-C+Linker were generated. All DNA constructs were sequenced to exclude PCR-born mutations.TABLE ONEMutants produced by PCR mutagenesis Open table in a new tab Heparin Affinity Chromatography of HB-GAM Domains—The bacterial lysates were subjected to heparin affinity chromatography. A linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 2 m in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was used to compare the elution profiles of separate domains with the intact HB-GAM produced similarly in E. coli. All recombinant products described above were purified by this method and verified for >90% homogeneity on SDS-PAGE. The proteins were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy to verify molecular weight before they were used in the subsequent studies. The 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled protein samples for NMR were produced by growing the bacteria in a minimal media as described previously (10Kilpeläinen I. Kaksonen M. Avikainen H. Fath M. Linhardt R.J. Raulo E. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13564-13570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), followed by normal workup.NMR Measurements of HB-GAM-derived TSR Domains—All the spectra were acquired at 30 °C on Varian Inova 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers using protein concentrations of 0.2-1 mm. The spectra were processed with Vnmr (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed manually with Felix 97 software (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). The backbone assignments for the individual domains were carried out by recording a typical set of triple resonance spectra (CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCA and HN(CO)CA, (19Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.J. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press Limited, London1968: 478-518Google Scholar)) followed by normal spectral interpretation/analysis. The possible interaction of the individual domains was followed by titrating a 15N-labeled N-terminal domain sample (1 mm, residues 13-58) to a 5-fold excess of unlabeled C-domain (residues 65-110), and vice versa. The heparin interaction experiments were carried out by titrating the protein samples with a purified 14-meric heparan sulfate preparate (20Fath M. VanderNoot V. Kilpelainen I. Kinnunen T. Rauvala H. Linhardt R.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Ligand-binding Assays—HB-GAM domain binding to heparin was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using the IAsys instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation). Heparin-derivatized surfaces were prepared by immobilizing heparin-BSA (Sigma) to one cell of the double-well planar aminosilane cuvette according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.2 mg/ml heparin-BSA in 15 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, was coupled via amino groups to the aminosilane surface activated with polymerized glutaraldehyde, resulting in an immobilization level of ∼0.9 ng of heparin-BSA/mm2 planar surface. The second cell was coated with BSA alone to generate a control surface. Unbound molecules were removed by washing the cuvettes with the immobilizing buffer and 2 m NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Remaining activated sites were blocked with β-casein. The binding data for each ligand were obtained by successive additions of increasing ligand concentrations in PBS and measuring the equilibrium response after each addition. Between the measurements for different ligands, the cuvette was regenerated by washing with 2 m NaCl in PBS. All ligands displayed low or negligible binding to the control BSA surface, as was monitored simultaneously in the control cell. The response in the control cell was subtracted from the value measured in the heparinized cell to obtain the specific response R, which was used to calculate the dissociation constant Kd by fitting in the equation r = Rmax[L]/(Kd + [L]), where [L] is the ligand concentration and Rmax corresponds to the R value at saturation.Binding to Heparan Sulfate—Recombinant rat N-syndecan ectodomain was expressed as an Fc-fusion protein in 293T cells using the pIG expression vector (21Simmons D.C. Cellular Interactions in Development: a Practical Approach. 1993; (Hartley, D. A., ed) pp., Oxford University Press, Oxford: 93-127Google Scholar). The construct was transfected to semiconfluent 293T cells using FuGENE® transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany). Three days post-transfection the medium was harvested. The medium was centrifuged to remove debris and used as a reagent in binding assays. As a control, a mock medium transfected with FuGENE® alone was prepared. Wells of Nunc maxisorb plates were coated with 1 μg/ml protein A (Amersham Biosciences) and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Conditioned medium from transfected 293T cells was added to the wells. After washing three times with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, biotinylated di-TSR was added with or without competing unlabeled ligands. The level of biotin bound to the wells was monitored with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin using the ortho-phenylenediamine chromogenic substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). To control the binding through heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans, heparinase II (Sigma) was used. 0-2 IU/ml heparinase II was added in the assay medium to cleave heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan side chains of the recombinant N-syndecan-Fc-fusion protein.Heparin-binding Assay—96-well Nunc maxisorb plates were coated with 100 μl of 1 μg/ml HB-GAM for an hour. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. After washing the wells three times with the blocking buffer, 0.1 μg/ml biotin-BSA-heparin (Sigma) with 20 μg/ml competing unlabeled ligands in 0.1% BSA in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 was incubated in the wells for 1 h at +4 °C. The level of biotin bound to the wells after three washing steps was monitored with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin using the ortho-phenylenediamine chromogenic substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma).Cells and Neurite Outgrowth Assays—Hippocampal primary cultures were prepared essentially as described previously (22Brewer G.J. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1989; 494: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). For neurite outgrowth assays, neurons were plated at 12,500/well density in microwells coated with recombinant HB-GAM and different TSR domains. For the counting of neurite outgrowth, images were taken from living cells using randomly selected microscopic fields, and the extensions exceeding 10 μm in length were considered as neurites. The induction of neurite outgrowth was calculated as percentage of cells growing neurites in the 48-h assay.The ability of different TSR domains to inhibit neurite outgrowth on HB-GAM-coated wells when presented as soluble factors was monitored as described previously (23Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated at 12,500/well density in microwells coated with HB-GAM (1 μg/ml). The cells were grown for 48 h in assay medium containing different concentrations of soluble domains and analyzed for neurite outgrowth.Transfilter Migration Assays—Migration assays were performed with NMRI mice strain embryonic day 14-15 forebrain neurons prepared as described previously (24Rauvala H. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Korkolainen M. Huhtala M.L. Panula P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2293-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at the density of 150,000 cells/well on 12-mm COSTAR transfilter plates with a 12-μm pore size. The outer surfaces of the filters were precoated with 1 mm HB-GAM. Because the di-TSR polypeptide was apparently unable to coat the wells, we performed the assay in the presence of 1 mm HB-GAM or di-TSR as soluble competitors in the assay medium (BSA at 10 mg/ml, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The inhibitory effect on migration after 16 h was followed.In Vitro Electrophysiology—Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm thick) from adult Wistar rats (1.5-2 months old) were cut using Vibratome 3000 Plus for in vitro electrophysiological experiments.

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were elicited by stimulating Schaffer collaterals with a bipolar stimulation electrode. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to gain a half-maximal fEPSP amplitude. Base-line synaptic transmission was monitored at 0.05 Hz, pulse length 0.1 ms. The slope of fEPSP was used as an indicator of synaptic efficacy and was calculated between 20 and 80% of the maximal amplitude. Long term potentiation (LTP) was induced by high frequency stimulation (100 Hz/1 s), during which the pulse length was doubled. TSR domains were dissolved in PBS (0.1 mm NaHPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. Because of the limited amounts of TSR domains, they were pressure-injected (∼0.2 μl) into the dendritic area of the hippocampal CA1 region close to the recording site 10 min before LTP induction (as described in Ref. 4Lauri S.E. Rauvala H. Kaila K. Taira T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Control experiments with PBS injections of the same volume were carried out to ensure that the procedure did not interfere with the base-line synaptic response or induction of LTP.LTP program, version 230d (25Anderson W.W.

Student's t test was used for statistical analysis of the data. Changes were considered to be significant at p values <0.05.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTSR Domains of HB-GAM Fold Independently—The 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the isolated domains coincide with the corresponding spectrum of full-length HB-GAM (Fig. 2). Only very minor changes are observed in the chemical shifts, indicating that the structures of the isolated domains are similar to those in the native protein. Also the di-TSR 1H-15N HSQC spectrum coincides fully with the spectrum of the whole protein (data not shown), indicating a proper fold.FIGURE 21H-15N HSQC spectrum (750 MHz) of HB-GAM (purple) and the N-terminal (green) and C-terminal (blue) TSR domain overlaid. The spectra of the individual TSR domains essentially align with the residues in HB-GAM spectra. This indicates that the domains fold independently and do not interact with each other in the intact protein. ppm, parts/million.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Domain-domain titration experiments were carried out to gain information on possible domain-domain interactions. In these titrations, a sample of the 15N-labeled domain was titrated with an unlabeled second domain. The titrations were carried out in both ways, i.e. the N-terminal domain was titrated with the C-domain, and vice versa. However, no changes in chemical shifts were observed in either case. Therefore, it is evident that the two domains fold independently and they do not have domain-domain interactions in solution state.Binding of Heparin to HB-GAM as Followed by NMR Spectroscopy—We have previously shown (10Kilpeläinen I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13564-13570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that during the titration of full-length HB-GAM with heparin, the 1H-15N HSQC resonances of the structural areas of the protein (i.e. N- and C-terminal domain) gradually disappear from the spectrum, but the resonances of the non-structural, lysine-rich tails (residues 1-12 and 111-136) remain in the spectrum with high intensity and show no significant changes in their chemical shifts. In this respect, the di-TSR (Gly13-Ser110) protein behaves in an exactly similar way as the full-length protein. During the titration with heparin, the 1H-15N resonances of the protein gradually broaden under the detection limit (data not shown).The individual N- and C-terminal domains interact with heparin in fast exchange in the NMR timescale, as shown in Fig. 3A for the N-terminal domain (spectral data for C-terminal not shown). The titration data, as a function of amino acid sequence for the isolated domains, are presented in Fig. 3, B and C. The binding data show that individual domains bind the 14-meric heparin fragment with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The Kd values for the separate N- and C-terminal domains were 53 and 20 μm, respectively, as calculated from the chemical shift changes during the titration. In the heparin titration experiments, residues 14-18, 39-43, and 52-54 in the N-terminal domain and residues 66-69 and 89-93 in the C-terminal domain show significant changes in their chemical shifts, indicating that these residues are playing a role in the interaction with heparin. However, these findings should be confirmed with mutation experiments.FIGURE 3A, an expansion of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the N-terminal domain of HB-GAM during heparin titration (600 MHz).

However, the interaction of heparin with the two domains appears in intermediate exchange in the NMR timescale (not slow, as in the case of the intact protein). The titration was carried out by first titrating a sample of the 15N-enriched N-terminal domain with 15N-enriched C-terminal domain to a ratio of 1:1, followed by titration with heparin 14-mer and observing changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. During the course of titration with heparin, the original signals from the domains in solution gradually disappear from the spectrum. With an excess of heparin, a part of the signals becomes visible, but a large number of signals remains below detection limit, even in the presence of a large excess of heparin. Further, a good number of signals are just weakly visible at the end of the titration. Thus, it was not possible to obtain reliable assignments for the (TSR-N·TSR-C·heparin) complex. Similar results were obtained with commercial low molecular weight heparin. The disappearance of the signals of the structural domains of the protein when both domains are present in the solution cannot solely be explained by the molecular weight of the complex. It seems that HB-GAM undergoes a conformational change in the complex form, which causes the broadening of the signals. This is in agreement with the circular dichroism spectroscopy data described previously (10Kilpeläinen I. Kaksonen M. Avikainen H. Fath M. Linhardt R.J. Raulo E. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13564-13570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The NMR titration data shows that the N- and C-terminal domains interact with heparin in a co-operative manner. The domains do not interact with each other in the absence of heparin, but the timescale of the heparin interaction changes when both domains are present, even when as separate domains.Both TSR Domains Are Required for High Affinity Interaction with Heparin/HS—The affinity of different HB-GAM domains for heparin was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a heparin-BSA-coated cuvette. The dissociation constants were determined by equilibrium titration (TABLE TWO). Intact HB-GAM displayed high affinity for heparin (Kd of 176 ± 37 nm). Removal of the lysine-rich tails had no effect on heparin binding of HB-GAM, as the Kd for the di-TSR remained nearly identical (153 ± 40 nm). However, a dramatic change was observed for the individual TSR domains. The C-terminal domain of HB-GAM displayed affinity for heparin (Kd of 13.0 ± 2.5 μm) that was two orders of magnitude lower than that of the intact protein. The N-terminal domain of HB-GAM bound heparin even more weakly. At the concentrations used in our assay, the saturation could not be reached, indicating a Kd value >70 μm. This would indicate that, although the individual domains of HB-GAM can interact with heparin, cooperation between the N-terminal and C-terminal domain results in the optimal heparin binding. The lysine-rich tails do not appear to be directly involved in the HB-GAM interaction with heparin.TABLE TWODissociation constants for ligand binding to immobilized heparin-BSA determined by equilibrium titrationIntact HB-GAMDi-TSRTSR-NTSR-Cnmnmμmμm176 ± 37153 ± 40>7013.0 ± 2.5"

This is mediated in part by the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Tat protein, which is secreted by virally infected cells and taken up by uninfected cells and CD178 gene expression, which is critically involved in T cell apoptosis. The differing ability of HIV strains to induce death of infected and uninfected cells may play a role in the clinical and biological differences displayed by HIV strains. We chemically synthesized the 86-residue truncated short variant of Tat and its full-length form. We show that the trans-activation ability of Tat at the long terminal repeat does not correlate with T cell apoptosis but that the ability of Tat to up-regulate CD178 mRNA expression and induce apoptosis in T cells is critically dependent on the C terminus of Tat. Moreover, the greater 86-residue Tat-induced apoptosis is via the extrinsic pathway of CD95-CD178.

The CD95/CD178 (Fas/Fas ligand) system also has a well known role in mediating apoptosis and has been shown to play a possible role of variable significance in the induction of apoptosis in bystander cells in in vitro HIV systems (7.Alimonti J.B.

CD95-mediated apoptosis is irreversible and is, thus, tightly regulated both pre- and post-CD95 engagement (9.Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). For T cells, one of the major forms of regulation is exerted at the level of CD178 expression. CD178 mRNA is not expressed in resting T cells but is induced shortly after an activating stimulus (10.Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). In HIV-infected individuals, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are more susceptible to CD178-induced apoptosis, and this is related to the regulation of surface levels of both CD95 and CD178. It has been shown that T cells from HIV-infected individuals overexpress CD178 (11.Silvestris F. Cafforio P. Frassanito M.A. Tucci M. Romito A. Nagata S. Dammacco F.

However, it has also been shown that Tat does not require the CD178-CD95 interaction to induce apoptosis and that Tat binds to tubulin and LIS1, perturbing microtubule dynamics, leading to apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (19.Chen D.

However, current estimates of Tat concentrations are thought to be an underestimation as Tat is rapidly taken up by cells, local concentrations of Tat in lymphoid tissues might be higher, the antibody used for detection has weak avidity, and Tat in vivo might be sequestered by endogenous anti-Tat antibody and/or by glycosaminoglycans (28.Xiao H. Neuveut C. Tiffany H.L. Benkirane M. Rich E.A. Murphy P.M. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11466-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Extracellular Tat has a variety of effects on a number of different cell types (for review, see Ref. 29.Huigen M.C. Kamp W. Nottet H.S. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 34: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The viral mRNA for Tat is composed of two exons (30.Arya S.K. Guo C. Josephs S.F. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1985; 229: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The first exon codes for 72 amino acids (residues 1-72) and contains three important functional regions; they are the cysteine-rich region (amino acids 22-37), the basic region (amino acids 49-57), and the glutamine-rich region (amino acids 58-72). The second exon codes for a variable number of amino acids (residues 14-31) that contribute to viral infectivity and other functions (31.Rana T.M. Jeang K.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Two different forms of Tat are found in clinical isolates; they are an 86-residue form and a longer, more predominant 101-residue form (32.Jeang K.T. Human Retroviruses and AIDS: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1996: III-3-III-18Google Scholar). In research to date, the most widely used form of Tat is Tat HXB2 (86), which is a truncated 86-residue form from a laboratory-passaged subtype B viral strain (32.Jeang K.T. Human Retroviruses and AIDS: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1996: III-3-III-18Google Scholar, 33.Ratner L.

Chang N.T. Gallo R.C. Wongstaal F. Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). Indeed, a single nucleotide change at the putative residue 87 allows the translation of the full-length 101-amino acid form (HXB2 (100)). Therefore, the extreme C terminus of Tat has not been frequently considered in research even though it has been shown to be significant in several biological assays (34.Xiao H. Neuveut C. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35.Ott M. Emiliani S. Van Lint C. Herbein G. Lovett J. Chirmule N. McCloskey T.

In this study we compared the ability of these two forms of Tat to trans-activate the HIV-1 LTR and assessed their ability to induce apoptosis in T cells. We show that the last 14 residues at the C terminus of Tat present in the full-length 100-amino acid form are implicated in both a greater trans-activation ability and in a reduced ability to up-regulate CD178 expression and induce apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization—The Tat proteins were synthesized in solid phase using Fast Fmoc chemistry according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (37.Barany G.

Briefly, 2 × 105 cells/well were incubated in 24-well flat-bottomed plates (Falcon) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml neomycin (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tat protein was dissolved in phosphate buffer at pH 6 (to avoid precipitation that occurs at neutral pH) and was directly mixed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) protamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and added to the cells. After 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 cells were washed with PBS, lysed, the β-galactosidase content was measured with a commercially available antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (β-galactosidase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Roche Diagnostics), and absorbance values (B) were measured at 405 nm. Results were normalized using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). B0 corresponds to the background β-galactosidase expressed by HeLa P4 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) protamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) without Tat. Concentrations of Tat used are noted in Fig. 1.Entry of Tat into the Cells—HeLa P4 cells were cultured and treated with Tat as for the trans-activation assay. After treatment with Tat, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) without BSA. We obtained a cytoplasmic supernatant and a pellet corresponding to the nuclear extract by centrifuging the lysates at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. All supernatants were stored at -80 °C. After a brief sonication, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, and protein content was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 40 μg/sample was then heated at 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing reducing agent, separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto Protran® nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific sites were blocked by 1 h of incubation at room temperature with PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10% (w/v) dried nonfat milk (10% MPBS). Membranes were then incubated with anti-HXB2 (100) and anti-HXB2 (86) rabbit sera raised as previously described (39.Opi S. Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Esquieu D. Watkins J. Campbell G. de Mareuil J. Jeang K.T. Yirrell D.L. Kaleebu P. Loret E.P. Vaccine. 2004; 22: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) at 1:500 dilution in 10% MPBS overnight, washed 4 times, and incubated with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody at 1:1000 dilution) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature in 10% MPBS. The bound horseradish peroxidase was revealed with H2O2, 0.1% (w/v) diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS as substrate. The intensity of immunoblot bands was analyzed by densitometric imaging using the freely available Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) on a personal computer.Apoptosis Assay—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood of healthy donors by using density centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences). After 2 washes with PBS supplemented with 10% (v/v) autologous serum and 2 mm EDTA (Sigma Aldrich). CD4+ cells were then isolated using the CD4+ isolation kit using MidiMACs with LS columns (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) and cultured in AIM-V® medium with human serum albumin (Invitrogen) until used.The Jurkat clone I9.2 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (all from Invitrogen). The Jurkat I9.2 cell line is a clone that is functionally defective for Fas-associated death domain and is completely resistant to both caspase-8- and CD178-induced apoptosis (41.Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).To induce apoptosis cells were cultured in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) 0.1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma Aldrich) for 19 h without sera in the presence or not of Tat. Tat was prepared as for the trans-activation assay.To differentiate between early apoptosis and late apoptosis/necrosis, cells were harvested at 19 h post-treatment and immediately stained with annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (BD Pharmingen). The harvest and staining took 1 h, and then stained cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences).To determine cellular caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity, cells were harvested at 14 h post-treatment and immediately stained with the caspase-8 specific detection kit (Red-IETD-fluoromethyl ketone (FMK)) and the caspase-9-specific detection kit (fluorescein isothiocyanate ((FITC)-LEHD-FMK) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem). Positive controls were carried out in the presence of 40 μm ceramide analogue C2-ceramide (Calbiochem) initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The harvest and staining took 1.5 h, and then stained cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Cytogram analysis was performed with Cell Quest Pro® software (BD Bioscience).Real-time PCR—CD178 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells was measured by real time PCR. 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated in 24-well flat-bottomed plates (Falcon) at 37 °C with 2 μm Tat for 14 h. Total cellular RNA was prepared with the RNeasy Mini kit in accordance with the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 1 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with random primers. CD178 mRNA expression in relation to β2 microglobulin expression (internal standard) was determined using the LightCycler System and the FastStart DNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). PCR reactions were carried out in a 20-μl mixture composed of 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm concentrations of each primer, a 5-μl sample, and 1-fold LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I. Primers used were as follows: CD178 sense, 5′-GTAGGATTGGGCCTGGGGAT-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGTTGGACTTGCCTGTTAAA-3′; β2 microglobulin sense, 5′-CCGACATTGAAGTTGACTTAC-3′, and antisense 5′-ATCTTCAAACCTCCATGATG-3′. The reaction mixture was initially incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to denature the cDNA. Amplification was performed for 45 cycles, with the following cycle parameters: 10 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 10 s of primer annealing at 65 °C, and 15 s of fragment elongation at 72 °C. Quantification and melting curve were analyzed with LightCycler analysis software, RelQuant (Roche Diagnostics). All results were expressed as the ratio between the copy number of the target gene and the copy number of β2 microglobulin and normalized so that CD178 expression in the non-treated cells equals 1.00.Statistics—All p values correspond to two-sample t tests assuming unequal variances, unless indicated otherwise.RESULTSFull-length HXB2 Has a Higher Trans-activation Activity than the Truncated 86-Residue Form—In this study we have used the full-length form of Tat HXB2 (HXB2 (100)) as described by Jeang (32.Jeang K.T. Human Retroviruses and AIDS: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1996: III-3-III-18Google Scholar) and the 86-residue-truncated form of Tat HXB2 (Tat HXB2 (86)). Both proteins were obtained using Fast Fmoc chemistry and, after purification using HPLC, gave a good HPLC homogeneity (Fig. 1A), and the expected mass was observed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B).We assessed the ability of these Tat variants to cross the cell membrane of HeLa P4 cells and trans-activate the stably transfected HIV-1 LTR in these cells as used previously by ourselves and others (18.Campbell G.R.

Initially, HeLa P4 cells were incubated with 1 μm extracellular synthetic Tat that was added to the culture medium. This is the minimum amount of Tat that can be used due to the avidity of the two specific anti-Tat antibodies used. After immunoblotting, we analyzed the blot using Scion Image. We compared the densitometric ratio between T:C and T:N (T, Tat; C, cytoplasmic fraction; N, nucleic fraction) for each Tat. Using this semiquantitative methodology, we found that both the truncated and the full-length form were taken up in equivalent quantities by the transfected cells and were found predominantly in the cytoplasmic region. Only a small portion of either Tat reached the nucleus to activate transcription, which agrees with previous data (18.Campbell G.R. Pasquier E. Watkins J. Bourgarel-Rey V. Peyrot V. Esquieu D.

Importantly, both the truncated and the full-length form demonstrated a similar efficiency in their cytoplasmic and nuclear uptake. Thus, the C terminus does not play a role in the cellular uptake of Tat, which is again in agreement with previous data (47.Vivès E. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Trans-activation assay with HeLa P4 cells transfected with the HIV-1 long terminal repeat lacZ construct (40.Clavel F.

HeLa P4 cells were incubated with 1 μm Tat. Whole cell lysates were prepared 4 h post-treatment and analyzed by anti-Tat immunoblotting. This blot is representative of three independent experiments. T, 10 ng Tat; C, Cytoplasmic fraction; N, nucleic fraction. The analysis of this blot is discussed in the text. B, trans-activation was measured with the different Tat variants at six concentrations. HXB2 (100) is represented by the light gray bars, and HXB2 (86) is represented by the dark gray bars. Without Tat,β-galactosidase was expressed at a basal level, which was used as a control (white bar). B, absorbance values measured at 405 nm; B0, background β-galactosidase expressed by HeLa P4 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) protamine and 0.1% (w/v) BSA without Tat. HXB2 (100) had higher trans-activation activity at all concentrations. p values are displayed above each pairing and are the result of three independent experiments carried out in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When we tested for the trans-activation activity of the two variants, we found that at almost all concentrations tested there was a significant difference, with HXB2 (100) having significantly more trans-activation activity than HXB2 (86) (Fig. 2B), which agrees with previously published data (45.Opi S. Péloponèse Jr., J.M. Esquieu D. Campbell G. de Mareuil J. Walburger A. Solomiac M. Gregoire C. Bouveret E. Yirrell D.L. Loret E.P. J. Biol.

Only at 2 μm was there no statistical difference, but this could be due to a saturation of this system (p = 0.065). We also observed a dose-dependent response in the levels of β-galactosidase being quantified.Tat HXB2 (100) Induces Less Apoptosis than Tat HXB2 (86)—It is known that the addition of extracellular recombinant Tat HXB2 (86) to cultures of both primary CD4+ T cells and Jurkat T cell lines induces apoptosis and increases their sensitivity to apoptotic signals, thus contributing in part to the progressive loss of T cells associated with HIV-1 infection (17.Westendorp M.O.

We investigated the ability of Tat HXB2 (100) and Tat HXB2 (86) to induce apoptosis in primary CD4+ T cells. We used an assay in which primary CD4+ T cells were incubated with the Tat proteins at 2 μm, and the apoptotic effects were evaluated by flow cytometry after labeling the cells with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Fig. 3). Compared with the control, both HXB2 (100) and HXB2 (86) induced a significant level of apoptosis in these cells (p = 0.0005 and 0.0001, respectively) (Fig. 3B). There was also a significant difference between t"

https://openalex.org/W2052936234,"V-ATPases are multisubunit membrane proteins that use ATP binding and hydrolysis to transport protons across membranes against a concentration gradient. Although some cell types express plasma membrane forms of these transporters, all eukaryotes require V-ATPases to maintain an acidic pH in membrane-bound compartments of endocytic and secretory networks to facilitate protein trafficking and processing. Mammalian cells that completely lack V-ATPases are not viable; yet, the abundance of V-ATPases can differ among cell types by an order of magnitude or more, requiring precise control of their expression. We previously showed that mRNA stability appears to play a major role in regulating overall abundance of V-ATPases. In this report, we demonstrate that the stability of V-ATPase mRNA is regulated through AU-rich elements in 3′-untranslated regions. Unlike some mRNAs that are short-lived due to the presence of these elements, V-ATPase mRNAs have half-lives of hours to days. However, during stress induced by ATP depletion, AU-rich elements are necessary to maintain stability of these transcripts and their presence in the cytoplasm. HuR, an RNA-binding protein that interacts with and stabilizes AU-rich mRNAs, shows increased binding to some V-ATPase mRNAs during ATP depletion. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HuR results in diminished V-ATPase expression. These results indicate that AU-rich elements and associated proteins can play a role in regulation of even very stable mRNAs by protecting against loss during cellular stress.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are required for cell survival because of their role in acidification of intracellular compartments, including the endocytic network and components of the secretory pathway. Mammalian cells are not viable in the total absence of V-ATPases (2Inoue H. Noumi T. Nagata M. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. Biochim. Biophys.

Mammalian V-ATPases are composed of thirteen different subunits, including a, c, c″, d, and e in the membrane-bound, or V0, sector, and A-H in the cytosolic, or V1, sector. Most subunits can be expressed as tissue-restricted isoforms that are generated from distinct genes. The subunit isoforms encoded by unique genes include A, B1-2, C1-2, D, E1-2, F, G1-3, H, a1-4, d1-2, c, c″, and e. (For a summary of the mammalian V-ATPase gene nomenclature, see Ref. 19Smith A.N. Lovering R.C. Futai M. Takeda J. Brown D. Karet F.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 801-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to the variation created by mixing and matching of subunit isoforms, V-ATPases also vary in overall cellular expression levels. Cells that require high levels of these transporters for normal cellular function, such as kidney epithelia, osteoclasts, and macrophages, can express V-ATPases at levels an order of magnitude higher than cells lacking specific requirements for high levels of proton transport. One of our interests has been in the mechanisms by which V-ATPase levels are regulated. We previously showed that macrophages express higher levels of V-ATPase than fibroblasts due to increased mRNA stability (20Wang S.P. Krits I. Bai S. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8827-8834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and have since extended this conclusion to kidney epithelial cells, which also express high V-ATPase levels. Here we define stability elements in the mRNA transcript of the ubiquitously expressed E1 subunit and find that AU-rich elements are critical for this control. AU-rich elements (AREs) are the best-studied regulator sequences of mRNA stability. Originally defined in short-lived mRNAs such as those encoding lymphokines, cytokines (21Caput D. Beutler B.

Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), they consist of U-rich runs, often containing AUUUA cores (24Lopez de Silanes I. Zhan M. Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl.

Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). These sequences are bound by a multiplicity of regulatory proteins that can stabilize or destabilize the transcript, or affect its translatability (26Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Bevilacqua A. Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S. Nicolin A. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 195: 356-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Among the most widely expressed ARE-binding proteins are the RNA-stabilizing protein HuR (HuA), the destabilizer hnRNP D (AUF-1), and TIAR and TIA-1, which are involved in translational regulation (reviewed in Ref. 26Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, other ARE-binding proteins, including several with homology to HuR, have been identified in specific cell types such as neural cells and lymphocytes. ARE-containing mRNAs are known to be stabilized during various forms of cellular stress, including heat shock (28Andrews G.K. Harding M.A. Calvet J.P. Adamson E.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 3452-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), UV irradiation (29Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol.

Because kidney epithelia, particularly proximal tubules cells, are susceptible to damage by ischemic injury (33Padanilam B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F608-F627Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and because high V-ATPase levels are critical to kidney cell function, we investigated whether V-ATPase mRNA expression in these cells might be affected by stress. We chose to examine the consequences of ATP depletion in the porcine proximal tubule cell line LLC-PK1, a well studied model that mimics many of the effects of ischemic injury produced in whole animal systems (34Canfield P.E. Geerdes A.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen J. Wagner M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F619-F627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fish E.M.

We found that AREs in V-ATPase mRNAs are required for maintained stability and cytoplasmic expression of these transcripts under conditions of ATP depletion, and that the RNA-binding protein HuR mediates this stabilization. These results show that even very long-lived mRNAs can possess functional AREs that act primarily not as destabilizing moieties, but as positive regulators of expression during cell stress events. Cell Culture—LLC-PK1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. When LLC-PK1 cells were confluent the medium was replenished and incubated overnight. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and the culture medium was then replaced with pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium base supplemented with l-glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 μm antimycin A for 0-4 h. Mock treated cells underwent the same procedure, but the culture medium was replaced with normal growth medium. In some experiments, ATP-depleted cells were allowed to recover by replacing the depletion medium with normal growth medium. Using this system, cellular ATP levels dropped to <1% of normal levels within 1 h of culture in ATP depletion medium and remained very low until normal growth medium was added. Four hours of recovery in normal growth medium resulted in ATP levels at ∼75% of original levels. 3S. Jeyaraj, D. Dakhlallah, S. R. Hill, and B. S. Lee, manuscript in preparation. This result is consistent with other studies of renal epithelia in which the rebound of ATP levels is incomplete with only a few hours of recovery (34Canfield P.E. Geerdes A.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar, 38van Why S.K. Kim S. Geibel J. Seebach F.A. Kashgarian M. Siegel N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F227-F234PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection—For transient transfection, human E1 V-ATPase cDNAs in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) were transfected singly or pairwise at 70% confluence using Lipofectamine with Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection for analysis. For creation of stably transfected cells, after 48 h of transfection as described above, the medium was replaced with normal growth medium supplemented with G418 (Invitrogen). Colonies were selected and expression confirmed with Northern blot analysis. For RNA interference studies, three siRNAs against porcine HuR were derived by, and purchased from, Ambion (Austin, TX). All three siRNAs knocked down HuR RNA levels at 50 nm concentrations, but only one was considered for further study, and was used at 10-50 nm. Transfection of siRNA into LLC-PK1 cells was performed using Lipofectamine with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and transfecting the cells when 50% confluent. cDNAs and Antibodies—A human E1 V-ATPase cDNA containing 84 bp of 5′-UTR and the entire coding and 3′-untranslated regions was subcloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Deletions of the 3′-UTR were created by excising specific sequences at convenient restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). AUUUA core sequences were mutagenized to ACTAGT to create new SpeI sites for convenient screening of mutants. The porcine E1 and HuR sequences were determined by amplifying selected regions from LLC-PK1 cells using RT-PCR and subcloning the products into a TOPO-TA vector from Invitrogen. Reverse transcription was performed using the Superscript First-strand Synthesis System, and PCR was performed using Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase High-Fidelity (both from Invitrogen). All constructs were sequenced by the Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility at The Ohio State University. For detection of E1, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the mouse E1 C-terminal residues PEVRGALFGANANRKFLD was created and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Peptide synthesis, conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and development of rabbit polyclonal antisera were performed by Invitrogen. For detection of HuR, a mouse monoclonal antibody (3A2) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-hnRNP D (T-10) was a goat polyclonal antibody also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RNA and Protein Detection Procedures—RNA blots (Northern blots) were performed using standard conditions. Total RNA was prepared using RNA Bee (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX), and 10 μg of each sample was analyzed in a formaldehyde agarose gel as previously described (39Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and fixed using a Stratalinker UV Cross-linker (Stratagene). To detect the exogenously expressed human E1 subunit mRNA, an XhoI-KpnI fragment containing 38 bp of 5′-UTR and 335 bp of coding region was labeled using the DECAprime labeling system (Ambion, Austin, TX). This probe did not cross-react with the endogenous porcine form under our conditions. For immunoblots (Westerns), 10 μg of whole cell lysates from LLC-PK1 cells were run in a 12.5% acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) under standard conditions. Proteins were transferred to Hybond P membrane (GE Health-care/Amersham Biosciences) and probed with antisera at a 1:500 (3A2) or 1:1000 (E1) dilution. Primary antibodies were detected using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For competitive RT-PCR of the endogenous LLC-PK1 E1 subunit, primers were created to correspond to sequences within the porcine coding region. The sense primer was of the sequence 5′-GCTTGTGCAAACCCAAAGACTG-3′, and the antisense primer was of the sequence 5′-TATGTCTTCAGGCAGGTAGGCC-3′. For an internal standard, a cDNA was created that corresponded to the expected RT-PCR product using the primers above but contained an internal deletion of 15%, a T7 promoter element, and a tail of 15 adenosines, as previously described (40Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This product was transcribed in vitro using the MAXIscript system (Ambion), and 1 pg of the resulting RNA (the internal standard) was added to 1 μg of LLC-PK1 total RNA prior to reverse transcription and PCR. Reverse transcription was performed using the Superscript First-strand Synthesis System and TaqDNA Polymerase, both from Invitrogen. One-fifth of the PCR products were run in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Immunohistochemistry and in Situ Hybridization—For immunolocalization of HuR, 3 × 104 LLC-PK1 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and grown to confluence, at which time the cells were given fresh medium and cultured overnight prior to use. Following the necessary treatments, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 2% formaldehyde in stabilization buffer (41Zeng Q. Lagunoff D. Masaracchia R. Goeckeler Z. Cote G. Wysolmerski R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then probed with anti-HuR antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Alexa 488- or Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cells were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse 80i epifluorescent microscope with SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI), or with a Zeiss 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope at the Campus Microscopy and Imaging Facility at The Ohio State University. For in situ hybridization of exogenously expressed human E1, an antisense probe was transcribed in vitro using the MAXIscript system (Ambion). The XhoI-KpnI fragment used for Northern analysis was subcloned into pBluescript and an antisense probe was made by linearizing the plasmid with BamHI and performing transcription using T3 RNA polymerase. BODIPY-TR-labeled UTP (Molecular Probes) replaced unlabeled UTP in this reaction. A probe corresponding to the porcine E1 subunit was PCR-amplified using the degenerate sense primer (5′-CGSTTGTGCAAACSCAAAG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CACCAGCTATNTCYTCAGGCAS-3′). This fragment was cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Linearizing the plasmid with XhoI and performing transcription using T3 RNA polymerase created an antisense probe for endogenous porcine E1. BODIPY-TR-labeled UTP (Molecular Probes) replaced unlabeled UTP in this reaction. A probe against the c subunit was previously described (40Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The hybridization procedures were essentially as previously described (40Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the human E1 probe used to detect exogenous V-ATPase expression was hybridized at 42 °C, rather than 37 °C, so it would not bind to the endogenous, porcine sequence. Protein-RNA Binding Assays—Immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR was performed essentially as described before (42Yeap B.B. Voon D.C. Vivian J.P. McCulloch R.K. Thomson A.M. Giles K.M. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furneaux H. Wilce M.C. Wilce J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27183-27192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were washed 2× in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in CEB buffer containing Halt Protease Inhibitor (Pierce) and RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) for 40 min. Cells were scraped and centrifuged for 10 min to remove cell debris. Ten micrograms of the HuR antisera (3A2) or anti-hnRNP D (T-10) were added to the supernatant and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Five micrograms each of protein A and protein G were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was then gently centrifuged, and the supernatant removed. The precipitate was washed five times with CEB buffer, and RNA was extracted using RNA Bee reagent (Tel-Test Inc.). For detection of the E1 subunit mRNA, the primers were identical to those used for competitive RT-PCR. Because the sequence for the porcine c subunit is unknown, this mRNA was detected by creating degenerate primers that were capable of binding both human and mouse sequences. The sense primer was of the sequence 5′-TCCATCATCCCRGTGGTCATGG-3′, and the antisense primer was of the sequence 5′-ACTTTGTGGAGAGGATRAGGGC-3′. V-ATPase mRNAs Contain AU-rich Elements—To define sequences within V-ATPase mRNAs that regulate stability, we performed deletion/mutation analyses of the ubiquitously expressed E1 (ATP6V1E1) subunit transcript. The human cDNA was subcloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1, and sequentially larger portions of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) were deleted, as shown in Fig. 1A. Construct 1 contained the full-length 3′-UTR, whereas constructs 2-4 were shortened at convenient restriction sites as shown. Construct 2 lacked 143 bp of the 3′-UTR, whereas constructs 3 and 4 lacked 328 bp and 456 bp, respectively. To determine relative stabilities of the resulting mRNAs, expression constructs were transfected in equal amounts into LLC-PK1 cells, both singly and pairwise, and levels of the expressed mRNAs were compared by Northern analysis. Lanes 2-5 of Fig. 1B show the mRNA products of cells singly transfected with each construct. Lanes 6-8 of this figure demonstrate expression levels of the products when co-transfected pairwise. Because the co-transfected constructs were transcribed via the same cytomegalovirus promoter, any differences in expression levels between them necessarily were due to differences in transcript stability. In lanes 6-8, the full-length cDNA (construct 1) was co-transfected individually with each deleted construct. These results demonstrate that expression from construct 1 (1. 27 kb) was found to be much lower than expression from constructs 2, 3, or 4. These data, as well as those from similar co-transfection experiments, suggested that the full-length E1 mRNA is less stable than mRNA expressed from the deletion mutants, apparently due to sequences within its 3′ 143 bases. Examination of the nucleotide sequence within this region revealed a highly conserved 50-base AU-rich element, with two canonical AUUUA core sequences, as shown in Fig. 1C. This element resides 9 bases 5′ to the poly-A tail, as indicated in Fig. 1A. To determine whether this ARE was involved in regulation of E1 mRNA stability, the AUUUA core elements were mutated individually in the full-length cDNA and tested by Northern analysis in co-transfection experiments similar to those in Fig. 1B. Fig. 1D shows the results of multiple experiments in which these mutated constructs, as well as the deleted constructs in Fig. 1A, were co-transfected pairwise into LLC-PK1 cells with construct 4, and the relative expression levels (as assayed by Northern blots) were determined by densitometric methods. These data show that constructs 2, 3, and 4 produced mRNAs with stabilities ∼2.5-fold greater than the full-length mRNA. In addition, mutation of the upstream AUUUA core (mutA) resulted in a 2.5-fold stabilization of mRNA, whereas mutation of the downstream AUUUA core (mutB) did not. This lack of effect is not entirely unexpected, because the downstream AUUUA overlaps the polyadenylation signal, and is likely to be involved in that process, rather than binding of ARE-specific RNA-stabilizing proteins. Data from these experiments, as well as other pairwise combinations not shown, strongly suggest that the ARE destabilizes E1 transcripts. Because deletion or mutation of this ARE caused the E1 transcript to become more stable, we surmised that the mRNA must be associated with a destabilizing protein under normal growth conditions. A good candidate for this is hnRNP D (or AUF-1), a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds AREs and can destabilize its associated mRNAs. hnRNP D is expressed as four protein isoforms generated from a single mRNA transcript (43Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As will be shown below in Fig. 5, we found that E1 mRNA binds to this destabilizing protein under normal growth conditions, thus accounting for the increased stability caused by loss of the ARE. AREs Are Required for V-ATPase mRNA Stability during the Stress of ATP Depletion—LLC-PK1 cells are a kidney proximal tubule cell line that have been investigated extensively as models for ischemic injury in native kidney (34Canfield P.E. Geerdes A.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen J. Wagner M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F619-F627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fish E.M.

The injuries to proximal tubule epithelia resulting from renal ischemia are mirrored by those in LLC-PK1 cells subjected to transient ATP depletion. Because ARE-containing mRNAs can be stabilized under conditions of cellular stress such as heat shock or UV-irradiation, we tested whether E1 is stabilized by the presence of AREs during ATP depletion. Stably transfected cell lines were created that contained some of the individual constructs described in Fig. 1. These lines were subjected to2hofATP depletion, and the exogenously expressed E1 mRNAs were assayed by Northern analysis. Fig. 2A (top panel) shows that intact AREs were required for maintenance of normal expression levels during this cellular stress; all mRNAs with either wholesale deletions or mutations of the upstream AUUUA core (constructs 2, 3, and mutA) showed diminished mRNA levels upon energy depletion, whereas the ARE-containing mRNA"
https://openalex.org/W2017824514,"Neurite polarity is a morphological characteristic of dentate gyrus granule cells, which extend axons to the hilar region and dendrites in the opposite direction, i.e. to the molecular layer. This remarkable polarity must require a differential system for axon and dendrite guidance. Here, we report that the axon and dendrites of a granule cell are differentially responsive to cAMP. In developing cultures of dispersed granule cells, dendritic growth cones were increased in number after pharmacological activation of cAMP signaling and decreased after blockade of cAMP signaling. Activation of cAMP signaling antagonized dendritic collapse induced by the potent repellents Sema3F and glutamate. In contrast to dendrites, axons were protected from Sema3F-induced collapse when cAMP signaling was inhibited. Axonal and dendritic growth cones both expressed type 1 adenylyl cyclase, but only axons showed a cAMP increase in response to Sema3F, and the elevated cAMP was sufficient to collapse axonal growth cones. Thus, the axons and dendrites of dentate granule cells differ in the regulation of cAMP levels as well as responsiveness to cAMP. cAMP may be crucial for shaping the information flow polarity in the dentate gyrus circuit.

Thus, the axons and dendrites of dentate granule cells differ in the regulation of cAMP levels as well as responsiveness to cAMP. cAMP may be crucial for shaping the information flow polarity in the dentate gyrus circuit. The dentate granule cells (neurons present most abundantly in the hippocampal formation) have distinctive morphology, including axodendritic polarity. They project the axons to the CA3 stratum lucidum through the dentate hilus to synapse with CA3/hilar neurons, whereas they elongate all the dendrites to the molecular layer to receive cortical synaptic inputs therein, i.e. the axons and dendrites are completely opposite in direction (1Desmond N.L. Levy W.B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1982; 212: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Claiborne B.J. Amaral D.G. Cowan W.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 302: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Such striking polarization is not found in other cortical neurons (for example, the pyramidal cells extend the axons and basal dendrites in the same direction); and therefore, they provide a unique opportunity to examine the formation of neuronal polarity.Our previous study suggests that local environmental cues present in stratum granulosum are essential for proper neurite polarization of dentate granule cells (3Kim J-A. Koyama R. Yamada R.X. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 1358-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but little is known about the intracellular mechanisms. We focused this study on the influence of cAMP on the behavior of axonal and dendritic growth cones (lamellipodial structures protruding from the tips of growing neurites) because the cAMP signaling pathway is well known to modulate axonal outgrowth of various neuronal types. In Xenopus spinal neuron axons, netrin-1 (4Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. McKerracher L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (5Song H.J. Ming G.L. Poo M.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) work as attractive cues and myelin-associated glycoprotein (4Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. McKerracher L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) as a repulsive cue under normal conditions. However, if the intracellular cAMP level is lowered, netrin-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor become repulsive. If the cAMP level is increased, myelin-associated glycoprotein becomes attractive (4Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. McKerracher L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Activation of cAMP signaling blocks Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons (6Dontchev V.D. Letourneau P.C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6659-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but has no significant effect in Xenopus spinal neurons (4Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. McKerracher L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) and retinal neurons (7Campbell D.S. Regan A.G. Lopez J.S. Tannahill D. Harris W.A. Holt C.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reports show that cyclic nucleotides modulate the neurite responses to guidance cues, but that this modulation depends on the types of guidance cues and neurons. We have demonstrated that cAMP signaling regulates pathfinding and target selection by hippocampal mossy fibers, axons of granule cells (8Mizuhashi S. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6181-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether cAMP affects dendrites as well. Using dispersed cultures of granule cells, we report, for the first time, the markedly contrasting effects of cAMP on axonal and dendritic outgrowth.The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate regulates the dynamics of both dendritic and axonal filopodia (9McKinney R.A. Capogna M. Durr R. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 10Wong W.T. Wong R.O. Curr. Opin.

In the adult dentate gyrus, glutamate is used as a neurotransmitter at synapses from entorhinal afferents to dendrites of granule cells and from granule cell axons to CA3 pyramidal cells (16Storm-Mathisen J. Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol. 1981; 27: 43-55PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bekenstein J.W. Bennett J.P. Wooten G.F. Lothman E.W.

Neurogenesis of granule cells, which occurs in the subgranular zone of the adult dentate gyrus, persists throughout life (22Altman J. Das G.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1965; 124: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 23Kaplan M.S. Hinds J.W. Science. 1977; 197: 1092-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 24Kuhn H.G. Dickinson-Anson H. Gage F.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2027-2033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and newborn neurons are functionally incorporated into mature dentate networks (25van Praag H. Schinder A.F. Christie B.R. Toni N. Palmer T.D. Gage F.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar), which means that neurite guidance of granule cells also persists in adults. Therefore, it is plausible that extrasynaptic spillover of glutamate (26Kullmann D.M. Asztely F. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 8-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) from “pre-existing” synapses affects neurite pathfinding by dentate granule cells. Indeed, we have shown that glutamate mediates the guidance of mossy fiber axons (27Koyama R. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 157-162Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether glutamate participates in the formation of the axonal and dendritic pathways.Finally, we examined the effect of Sema3F, a member of the family of class 3 semaphorins that have a conserved ∼500-amino acid semaphorin domain at their N termini (28Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar). Sema3F binds and activates a neuropilin-plexin receptor complex (29Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F.

However, the downstream signaling of plexin A3 remains to be clarified. Sema3F is expressed in the dentate gyrus as well as in the hippocampus (32Chedotal A. Del Rio J.A. Ruiz M. He Z.

Sema3F seems to play a role in stereotyped pruning of infrapyramidal mossy fibers, as assessed in mutant mice lacking Sema3F, neuropilin-2, and plexin A3 (34Chen H. Bagri A. Zupicich J.A. Zou Y.

We report that Sema3F collapses growth cones of axons and dendrites with a similar potency, but we also found that cAMP contributes differentially to Sema3F signaling in axonal and dendritic responses. Such contrasting actions of cAMP could underlie the opposing extension of axons and dendrites of dentate granule cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSPharmacological Agents—Forskolin, SQ 22,536 (9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine), and KT 5720 were purchased from Sigma. 8-Bromo (8-Br) 2The abbreviations used are: 8-Br, 8-bromo; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor; ACPD, (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; MCPG, (RS)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein-2; ANOVA, analysis of variance. -cAMP (sodium salt) and myristoylated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (PKI)-(14-22)-amide were obtained from Calbio-chem. (1S,3R)-1-Aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) and (RS)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) were from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK).Dispersed Cultures of Granule Cells—Postnatal day 3 Wistar/ST rats (Japan SLC, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were deeply anesthetized by hypothermia, and the hippocampal formation was dissected out and placed in ice-cold Gey's balanced salt solution. After removal of the subicular complex and the Ammon horn, the remaining part, i.e. the dentate gyrus, was trypsinized and gently triturated. Isolated cells were plated at a density of 5.0 × 103 cells/cm2 onto 13-mm coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and cultivated in 50% Neurobasal/B-27 medium (Invitrogen) and 50% astrocyte-conditioned medium (8Mizuhashi S. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6181-6194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere. The culture medium was changed to conditioned medium-free Neurobasal/B-27 medium supplemented with 2 μm cytosine d-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) 24 and 72 h after plating. These procedures consistently allowed us to prepare granule cell cultures with high purity (>75%) (3Kim J-A. Koyama R. Yamada R.X. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 1358-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 37Baba A. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Conditioned Medium from Sema3F-transfected COS-7 Cells—pEF-Sema3F-Myc (mouse) and pEF-Myc (control) were provided by Dr. Atsushi Tamada (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). The COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 24 h after plating. Transfection into cells was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After another 72 h, the supernatants obtained by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C were collected and stored at -80 °C after filtration through filters with a 0.20-μm pore size. Once thawed, the conditioned medium was used within 12 h. For every preparation, Sema3F-Myc content was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody (see below), which revealed that almost the same amount of Sema3F was consistently obtained in the conditioned medium. Unless specified otherwise, the medium was used at a 1:32 dilution in assays. Preliminary experiments showed that a 10-min treatment with the Sema3F-containing medium caused a 75% decrease in sympathetic neuron growth cones prepared from embryonic day 17-18 Wistar/ST rats compared with the control medium, indicating that the expressed Sema3F-Myc was functional (data not shown).Growth Cone Collapse Assay—Treatment with drugs was carried out at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere. Four days after plating, primary cultures of dentate granule cells were treated with glutamate or ACPD together with MCPG or 8-Br-cAMP for 30 min and immediately fixed to perform immunocytochemical analysis. To test the effect of Sema3F, cells were pretreated with cAMP-related reagents or peptides, including forskolin (20 min), 8-Br-cAMP (30 min), KT 5720 (40 min), SQ 22,536 (30 min), and myristoylated PKI (60 min), and subsequently treated with conditioned medium prepared from Sema3F-transfected COS-7 cells (10 min) in the presence of the same drugs or peptides. To evaluate the synergic effect of forskolin and Sema3F, we treated cells with either or both of them for 10 min. In some experiments, cultures were maintained in the control conditioned medium for 10 min before fixation. The cultures were treated for 20 min at 37 °C with fixative consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.), 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μm Taxol (Sigma), and 1.3 μm phalloidin (Sigma) in 60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.9) (39Dent E.W. Kalil K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9757-9769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Quantification of Growth Cones—Fixed cultures were treated with 2% goat serum for 60 min and overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-tau-1 monoclonal (1:2000 dilution; catalog no. MAB3420, Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and rabbit anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2; 1:1000 dilution; catalog no. AB5622, Chemicon International, Inc.) primary antibodies. They were then treated with Alexa 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution; catalog no. A-11001, Molecular Probes, Inc.) and Alexa 350-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:400 dilution; catalog no. A-11046, Molecular Probes, Inc.) secondary antibodies in the presence of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:40 dilution; catalog no. R415, Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 5 h at room temperature. Immunohistological images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA II cooled CCD camera and a ×40 objective equipped with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope and analyzed with an Aqua-Cosmos system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). We selected cells that were spatially isolated from other cells and that had round (granule-like) somata: one tau-1-positive and MAP-2-negative neurite (referred here to as an axon) and some tau-1-negative and MAP-2-positive neurites (dendrites) (40Craig A.M. Banker G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 267-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 41Lamoureux P. Ruthel G. Buxbaum R.E. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). According to these criteria, ∼57% of the cells were discarded before data analysis. Phalloidin specifically detects F-actin, which is expressed in a large amount in growth cones, so we defined the growth cone as a phalloidin-positive protrusion with at least 10 μm2 of lamellipodia and visible filopodia (42Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 43Fan J. Mansfield S.G. Redmond T. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Raper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For dendritic protrusions, we counted only growth cones that did not overlap neighboring protrusions. For each neuron, collapsed and uncollapsed growth cones were counted, and the data are presented as the percentage of collapsed growth cones to the total number of protrusions. The numbers of cells and experiments are given in the figure legends.Immunocytochemistry for Adenylyl Cyclase—Cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and blocked with 2% goat serum for 60 min. They were treated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies against tau-1 (1:2000 dilution) and rabbit pan adenylyl cyclase (1:400 dilution; catalog no. sc-1701, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit type 1 adenylyl cyclase (1:400 dilution; catalog no. sc-586, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and then with Alexa 350-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution) and Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:400 dilution) secondary antibodies in the presence of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:40 dilution) for 3 h at room temperature. Fluorescent images were collected as described above.cAMP Immunoassay—We adopted the methods introduced by Chemicon International, Inc., as described previously (44Trousse F. Marti E. Gruss P. Torres M. Bovolenta P. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3927-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 days in culture, cells were treated with the control medium, forskolin (100 μm forskolin + control medium), or Sema3F (Sema3F-containing medium); fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C; and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 containing 3% goat serum for 30 min. They were incubated with anti-tau-1 (1:2000 dilution) and rabbit anti-cAMP (1:1000 dilution; catalog no. AB306, Chemicon International, Inc.) primary antibodies in the presence of 1% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated with Alexa 350-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution) and Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:400 dilution) secondary antibodies in the presence of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:40 dilution) for 3 h at room temperature. Fluorescent images were collected as described above.Digital Quantification of Fluorescence Intensity in Growth Cones—The contour of a growth cone was manually traced on its rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin image. The fluorescence intensity of anti-adenylyl cyclase and anti-cAMP antibodies was measured within the contour and normalized to unit area. For each growth cone, the background fluorescence was obtained from three adjacent 4 × 4-μm2 areas, which were >1 μm apart from the growth cone and positioned in the 0°, 90°, and 270° angles from the growth cone stem axis. These three background values were averaged, and the immunosignal is expressed as (growth cone value - background level)/background level.Measurement of Area and Volume of Growth Cones—Four days after plating, primary cultures of granule cells were incubated with prewarmed (37 °C) Neurobasal/B-27 medium containing 10 μm Cell-Tracker Green (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Molecular Probes, Inc.). After 30 min at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with fresh prewarmed medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were immediately washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100, and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:40 dilution) for 3 h at room temperature. Each growth cone was analyzed three-dimensionally with a z axis interval of 0.5 μm using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal system with a ×60 objective. CellTracker-positive areas in confocal xy planes were integrated across the z axis and calculated as the volume of the growth cone. Phalloidin-positive areas in the same field were stacked in a single layer and calculated as the areas of the growth cones. As a result, we found that the volume of the growth cone was linearly correlated with the area, presumably because the thickness of the lamellipodia was almost even in the space of a culture plate. Therefore, the growth cone volume can be replaced with its phalloidin-positive area, a parameter that is easy to record, to evaluate the cAMP concentration in the growth cone (see above).Sema3F Pre-absorption—Protein G-Sepharose (12.5 μl; Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) was incubated with 12.5 μg of a monoclonal antibody (9E10) against a C-terminal Myc epitope tag (45Yamaguchi N. Takanezawa Y. Koizumi H. Umezu-Goto M. Aoki J. Arai H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 566: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in immunoprecipitation buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed two times with 50 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer and three times with 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated with 600 μl of Sema3F-conditioned medium or control medium at 4 °C for 2 h, and the supernatants were harvested as absorbed Sema3F or absorbed control, respectively. As a control without antibody (non-absorbed Sema3F), the beads were incubated with 25 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (instead of the antibody) for 2 h and then with 600 μl of Sema3F-conditioned medium for 2 h after washing.Western Blot Analysis—The conditioned medium from COS-7 cells was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skimmed milk and then treated overnight with anti-Myc antibody (1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C. The membranes were washed for 15 min and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins bound to the antibody were visualized with an ECL Plus enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Myc antibody specifically detected one band with a molecular mass of ∼88.5 kDa, which corresponds to the combined size of Sema3F and c-Myc.Data Analysis and Statistics—Imaging and quantification were performed by two independent people in a blind manner to avoid bias. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. and were statistically analyzed with one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey's test for multiple pairwise comparisons.RESULTSGranule cells were prepared from postnatal rat dentate gyri and used in experiments at day 4 in culture when each neuron consistently developed the longest tau-1-positive neurite and several tau-1-negative neurites (Fig. 1A) (40Craig A.M. Banker G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 267-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The tau-1-positive neurites were always MAP-2-negative, whereas other tau-1-negative neurites were MAP-2-positive (data not shown) (46Koyama R. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the tau-1-positive neurites as growing axons and the other shorter ones as growing dendrites. We regarded growth cones as “uncollapsed” protrusions from neurites; specifically, they were defined as phalloidin-positive lamellipodia (>10 μm2) with few visible filopodia. On average, individual neurons extended one axon and 5.1 ± 0.1 dendrites and bore 4.0 ± 0.3 protrusions from the axons and 7.7 ± 0.3 protrusions from the dendrites per cell, out of which 38.21 ± 3.29% (axons) and 35.88 ± 2.16% (dendrites) formed growth cones under basal conditions (n = 86 cells).cAMP Protects Dendritic Growth Cones against Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Activation-induced Collapse—We have previously shown that the neurotransmitter glutamate regulates guidance of hippocampal mossy fibers in hippocampal slice cultures (27Koyama R. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 157-162Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In a first series of experiments, we therefore sought to determine how glutamate affects the behavior of growth cones of axons and dendrites.We treated granule cell cultures with 50 μm glutamate for 30 min. This induced a decrease in the number of both axonal and dendritic growth cones (Fig. 1, A and B). Glutamate-induced collapse of dendritic growth cones was prevented by 300 μm MCPG (47Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), an antagonist of group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors, whereas this antagonist was ineffective in axons (Fig. 1, A and B). 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 μm), an antagonist of non-N-methyl d-aspartate glutamate receptors, completely blocked axonal collapse (data not shown). Neither MCPG nor 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione alone affected growth cones of axons or dendrites (Fig. 1B) (data not shown). Thus, glutamate recruits different intracellular mechanisms in axons and dendrites. This notion was supported by a differential action of ACPD (47Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), an agonist of group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors; ACPD induced growth cone collapse only in dendrites (Fig. 1, A and C).Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors are linked to inhibition of cAMP signaling via Gi/o protein activation (47Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, 300 μm 8-Br-cAMP (48Hei Y.J. MacDonell K.L. McNeill J.H. Diamond J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar), a membrane-permeable analog of cAMP, canceled ACPD-induced collapse of dendritic growth cones (Fig. 1, A and C). Interestingly, blockade of cAMP signaling by a 40-min treatment with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22,536 (49Fabbri E. Brighenti L. Ottolenghi C. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1991; 5: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) alone led to growth cone collapse in dendrites (Fig. 2A). A similar effect was obtained with KT 5720 (50Huang Y.Y. Martin K.C. Kandel E.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6317-6325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of PKA (Fig. 2B). To examine whether blockade of cAMP/PKA signaling induces growth cone collapse as well as changes the number or morphology of neurites, we simultaneously monitored the length of axons, the number of primary dendrites, and the number of terminal protrusions per axon and dendrite (TABLE ONE). None of these parameters was unaffected by the cAMP/PKA inhibitors. Therefore, inhibition of the cAMP/PKA pathway is sufficient to collapse dendritic growth cones; in other words, dendritic growth cones are ma"
