https://openalex.org/W2012913493,"The gene for interleukin-2 was isolated from the Jurkat cell line and from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and, when inserted in Escherichia coli, was expressed at high concentrations. This interleukin-2 was purified to apparent homogeneity and tested for biological activity in a variety of assays in vitro and in vivo. The recombinant lymphokine supports the growth of murine and human interleukin-2 dependent cell lines, enhances the generation of murine and human cytolytic cells in vitro, and generates lymphokine activated killer cells from murine and human lymphocytes. It has a serum half-life of 2 to 3 minutes in the mouse and significantly enhances the generation of cytolytic cells in vivo after alloimmunization. No functional differences between native and the recombinant interleukin-2 molecules have been detected."

The natural history of the disease after diagnosis includes partial remission in most patients, but only about 3 percent achieve transient insulin independence. beta Cell function, as indicated by the plasma concentration of C-peptide, is lost over 6 to 30 months and islet cell antibodies disappeared over 1 to 2 years. This article describes a pilot study in which 41 patients were treated with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine for 2 to 12 months. Of 30 patients treated within 6 weeks of diagnosis, 16 became insulin independent with concentrations of plasma C-peptide in the normal range and decreasing titers of islet cell antibodies. Of 11 patients who entered the study 8 to 44 weeks after diagnosis, two achieved this state. These results indicate that a controlled trial of the effects of cyclosporine in type I diabetes should be conducted."

https://openalex.org/W2060578134,"Our previous deletion experiments have shown that a short region of yeast nuclear gene introns containing the conserved sequence 5'-TACTAACA-3' is essential for splicing. In this report we show that the chemically synthesized decanucleotide 5'-TGTACTAACA-3', when introduced into a hybrid gene forming unspliceable RNA molecules, results in the generation of spliceable transcripts. Single A----C transversions in the fourth or eighth position of this sequence eliminated its intron-generating capacity. The C----T transition in the fifth position, generated by sodium bisulphite mutagenesis, did not affect the efficiency and accuracy of splicing. These results clearly demonstrate the biological significance of this conserved intron sequence and shed further light on its possible functioning."
https://openalex.org/W1603612324,"Cytochrome b562-o complex, a terminal oxidase in the respiratory chain of aerobically grown Escherichia coli K12, was isolated in a highly purified form. The purified oxidase is composed of equimolar amounts of two polypeptides, with Mr = 33,000 and 55,000, determined by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It contains 19.5 nmol of heme and 16.8 nmol of copper/mg of protein, but no detectable nonheme iron, phospholipid, ubiquinone, or menaquinone. In the difference spectrum at room temperature, the oxidase shows a single alpha absorption peak at 560 nm and at 77 K it shows two alpha absorption peaks at 555 and 562 nm. This oxidase combines with CO and the CO difference spectrum at room temperature has a peak at 416 nm and a trough at 430 nm in the Soret region. Its oxidation-reduction potential is estimated to be 125 mV (pH 7.4) and it is pH-dependent (-60 mV/pH) in medium of pH 6.0 to 7.4. It catalyzes electron transport to oxygen via ubiquinol and ascorbate in the presence of phenazine methosulfate or N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. This oxidase activity depends on phospholipids and is sensitive to respiratory inhibitors, such as 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, piericidin A, KCN and NaN3. The divalent cations Zn2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ inhibit the oxidase activity extensively. The oxidase activity of the cytochrome b562-o complex was inhibited by photoinactivation with rose bengal, suggesting that the inhibition by zinc ion results from modification of a histidine residue of cytochrome o."

In vitro mutagenesis of cloned genes followed by their reintroduction into yeast for functional analysis has allowed the identification of ca Laughon and Gesteland, PNAS 79, 6827-6831, 1982). ga14 negative mutations are epistatic to other galactose regulatory mutations, suggesting that the GAL4 product is a direct activator of transcription. Similarly, transcriptional induction of the CYC7 gene (encoding iso-I-cytochrome c) by heme, the CYC7 inducer, is diminished by recessive mutations in the locus HAP7 (Guarente et al., Cell 36, 503-511, 1984). Thus it is suggested that HAP7 encodes an activator whose activity or synthesis depends upon the cytochrome cofactor, heme. Derepression of transcription of the HIS3 and HIS4 genes (encoding enzymes involved in histidine biosynthesis) is eliminated by mutations in the locus AAS (Hinnebusch and Fink, PNAS 80, 5374-5378, 1983). Derepression of these and other genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis is normally elicited when cells are starved for histidine or other amino acids (general control). aas mutations are epistatic to other regulatory mutations affecting general control (ibid.). Positive Control Sites The figure indicates regulatory sites in cis to some of the above genes. mRNA initiation sites (i) may be single or multiple and, in all cases, are preceded by one or more TA-T-A boxes (T)-canonical sequences found in many eucaryotic promoters recognized by RNA polymerase Il.

https://openalex.org/W1526381231,"Autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor was studied using a glycoprotein fraction solubilized and purified partially from the rat hepatoma cell line, Fao. Incubation of this receptor preparation with [gamma-32P] ATP, Mn2+, and insulin yielded a single insulin-stimulated phosphoprotein of Mr = 95,000 which corresponds to the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor. At 22 degrees C, incorporation of 32P was half-maximal at 30 s and about 90% complete after 2 min. At steady state, about 200 pmol of 32P were incorporated per mg of protein; this value corresponded to about 2 molecules of phosphate per insulin binding site estimated from Scatchard plots. Insulin increased the Vmax for autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor kinase nearly 20-fold with no effect on the Km for ATP. Mn2+ stimulated autophosphorylation by decreasing the Km of the kinase for ATP, whereas Mg2+ had no effect. Dilution of the insulin receptor over a 10-fold concentration range did not decrease the rate of autophosphorylation suggesting that it may occur by an intramolecular mechanism. When the phosphorylated beta-subunit of the insulin receptor was digested with trypsin, at least 5 phosphopeptides could be separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a mu Bondapak C18 reverse-phase column. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of all sites. These phosphate acceptor sites varied in their rate and degree of phosphorylation. Phosphopeptides pp4 and pp5 were phosphorylated very rapidly and reached steady state within 20 s, whereas phosphorylation of pp1 and pp2 required several minutes to reach steady state."
https://openalex.org/W1553310373,"Changes in the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i), membrane potential, and immunoreactive insulin release were measured in suspensions of RINm5F cells. [Ca2+]i was monitored with the intracellularly trapped fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin 2. Changes in membrane potential were assessed with the fluorescent probe bisoxonol. The effects of depolarizing K+ concentrations and of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin were compared with those of the metabolizable stimuli glyceraldehyde and alanine. The mean resting [Ca2+]i was 105 nM +/- 6, n = 35. Of the substances tested, ionomycin caused the most marked increases of [Ca2+]i and insulin release. Membrane depolarization was evoked by K+, glyceraldehyde, or alanine and the agent stimulated insulin release and [Ca2+]i to a similar degree. However, the mechanism by which glyceraldehyde, on the one hand, and K+ and alanine, on the other, elevate [Ca2+]i appears different. Thus, verapamil, a blocker of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, almost abolished the effects of K+ and alanine on [Ca2+]i and insulin release, whereas the responses to glyceraldehyde were only blocked by approximately 50%. Glyceraldehyde may thus, in addition to opening voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, alter cellular Ca2+ handling at another step. The present findings provide direct experimental evidence that secretagogue-induced insulin release is accompanied by a rise in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1520047313,"A derivative of pBR322 has been constructed that contains both a unique EcoRI restriction site right at the beginning of the signal codons of the beta-lactamase (bla) gene and a unique BstEII site just at the end of the bla signal codons. Although the signal peptide encoded by the new plasmid differs from the wild type (pBR322) by 2 amino acid residues (Ser 2 to Arg 2 and Ala 23 to Gly 23), the synthesis, transport, and processing of the beta-lactamase remain unchanged in Escherichia coli. Two deletion mutants, in which the bla signal codons have been almost completely excised, have also been constructed. Bacteria containing either of these plasmids produce, but do not secrete, an active beta-lactamase. Last, the bla signal codons have been precisely joined to the cDNA version of the triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) gene from chicken. Expression of this fusion gene in E. coli gives a hybrid protein that is neither secreted into the periplasm nor proteolytically processed. This result supports the view that there are characteristics of the mature protein that are necessary for the secretion across the inner membrane of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1553433472,"Abstract A form of cytochrome P-450 catalyzing lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylation (tentatively called P-450(14)DM) was purified from microsomes of semi-anaerobically grown cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to gel electrophoretic homogeneity. An apparent monomeric Mr = 58,000 was estimated for the purified cytochrome by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both optical and EPR spectra of oxidized P-450(14)DM are characteristic of low spin ferric heme proteins, and its reduced CO complex showed a Soret absorption peak at 447 nm. As in the case of hepatic microsomal cytochromes P-450, the ethyl isocyanide complex of reduced P-450(14)DM was in a pH-dependent equilibrium between two states having Soret peaks at 429 and 453 nm, the equilibrium being considerably shifted toward the 453-nm state. Oxidized P-450(14)DM was peculiar in that in its CD spectrum there was a negative shoulder at 425 nm and the 350- and 414-nm troughs possessed larger and relatively smaller [theta] values, respectively, than those reported for other low spin ferric cytochromes P-450. Lanosterol was the only compound which caused a Type I spectral change in oxidized P-450(14)DM. The lanosterol-induced low to high spin state change was, however, only slight even at saturating concentrations of the sterol, indicating that the lanosterol-P-450(14)DM adduct was in a spin state equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2064506592,"Extreme altitude presents an enormous physiological challenge to the human body because of severe oxygen deprivation. The American Medical Research Expedition to Everest was specifically designed to study man under these conditions, and successfully obtained physiological data above 8000 meters, including a few measurements on the summit itself. The results show that man can tolerate the extreme hypoxia only by an enormous increase in ventilation, which results in an alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 7.5 torr on the summit and an arterial pH of over 7.7. Even so, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen is apparently less than 30 torr, and maximum oxygen uptake is about 1 liter per minute. Additional measurements of ventilation, blood physiology, and metabolic and psychometric changes clarified how man responds to this hostile environment."

(1983) Nucleic Acids Res., 11, 3873-3889) we examined the effect of guanosine 3'-diphosphate, 5'-diphosphate (ppGpp), the chemical mediator of stringent control, on transcription of various Escherichia coli DNA fragments, each carrying a single specific promoter. We found that ppGpp inhibits transcription of stringently controlled genes, rrnE, rpsA, and rplJ, coding for ribosomal RNA, ribosomal protein S1 and L10, respectively, but not that of trp (tryptophan) and lacUV5 (lactose) genes. Among the multiple promoters of the rrnE and rpsA operons, the upstream promoters, rrnEp1 and rpsAp1, are subject to repression by ppGpp but the downstream promoters, rrnEp2 and rpsAp3, are insensitive. Taking these facts and the intrinsic strength of the respective promoters together, we suggest that the multiple promoters within the single and same operons play different physiological roles and are regulated by independent mechanisms. The inhibition by ppGpp takes place even after formation of open complexes, suggesting that the RNA polymerase bound to the sensitive promoters is accessible for interaction with ppGpp leading to rapid decay of the open complexes. During this study, we noticed that some promoters including recAp are activated in the presence of ppGpp, raising a possibility that ppGpp has dual effects on the promoter function."
https://openalex.org/W1586899185,"Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies that react with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) core proteins have been isolated by immunizing BALB/c mice with RNP particles isolated from chicken and screening the fusion products with mouse RNP complexes. The antibodies show varying affinities for the hnRNP core proteins that have been blotted onto nitrocellulose. The majority of the immunoglobulins react with all the core group proteins although several recognize subsets of the hnRNP polypeptides. The clones are specific for different antigenic determinants as shown by their inability to compete with one another for binding sites. A mild proteolytic digestion of hnRNP proteins generates fragments that have uniformly lost 12 kDa and contain the antigenic determinants recognized by several of the monoclonal antibodies. Thus, it appears the core proteins comprise a family of related polypeptides possessing underlying structural similarities. Polypeptides similar in number and molecular weights that have antigenic determinants cross-reactive with those of mouse RNP have been found in a number of organisms, thereby emphasizing their possible common structure and function in higher eukaryotes. No difference in the distribution within the cell of individual or groups of core proteins has so far been detected by indirect immunofluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1520267908,"The ssb-113 (formerly lexC113) gene encoding a mutant single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) has been cloned into plasmid pSC101 resulting in 5- to 10-fold more mutant protein than strains carrying only one (chromosomal) copy of the gene. Analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of the mutant protein by high pressure liquid chromatography and solid phase protein sequencing has shown that the ssb-113 mutation results in the substitution of serine for proline at residue 176 of SSB. This change could only occur in one step by a C leads to T transition in the DNA sequence. Physicochemical studies of the homogeneous mutant protein have shown that it binds as well as wild type SSB to single-stranded DNA and that it is a slightly better helix-destabilizing protein than wild type SSB as measured by its ability to lower the thermal melting transition of poly[d(A-T)]. In vivo studies of ssb-113 strains carrying the cloned ssb-113 gene in pSC101 have shown that overproduction of the mutant protein does not complement the temperature-sensitive conditional lethality caused by the ssb-113 mutation when present in single gene copy in contrast to effects recently observed in ssb-1 strains overproducing the ssb-1 encoded protein (Chase, J. W., Murphy, J. B., Whittier, R. F., Lorensen, E., and Sninsky, J. J. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 164, 193-211). Also noted in this report are two corrections to the DNA sequence of wild type SSB, one of which places glycine (codon GGC) at residue 133 rather than serine as previously reported (Sancar, A., Williams, K. R., Chase, J. W., and Rupp, W. D. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 4274-4278). The second correction to the DNA sequence is in the serine 39 codon, previously reported to be TCA and now correctly shown to be TCC."
https://openalex.org/W1974216104,"Leader peptidase typifies a group of proteins of the plasma membrane of E. coli which span the membrane and are synthesized without a cleaved amino-terminal leader (signal) sequence. The membrane assembly properties of these proteins have not been previously reported. We find that the membrane electrochemical potential is necessary for the insertion of a large domain of leader peptidase across the membrane. In the absence of potential, the peptidase accumulates inside the cell in tight association with the plasma membrane. Upon restoration of the potential, accumulated peptidase inserts across the membrane, indicating that this insertion is not mechanistically coupled to polypeptide chain growth. The normal, trans-bilayer peptidase and that which accumulates in the absence of potential have different conformations, as shown by the relative resistance of the trans-bilayer enzyme to digestion by trypsin or chymotrypsin in cell lysates. Membrane insertion is accompanied by this conformational change. This assembly reaction has several features predicted by the hypothesis of membrane-triggered folding."
https://openalex.org/W1594429603,"Modification of bovine adrenodoxin with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) dramatically inhibited the reaction with adrenodoxin reductase (EC 1.18.1.2). The modification did not cause any change in the visible spectrum of adrenodoxin, indicating that the iron-sulfur center was not perturbed. Furthermore, the anomalous fluorescence of Tyr 82 was not changed in either intensity or wavelength. The inhibition was accompanied by the covalent incorporation of 14C-labeled EDC into adrenodoxin. The sites modified by EDC were determined by hydrolyzing adrenodoxin with either trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus protease and separating the resulting peptides by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The major carboxyl groups modified were found to be at Glu 74, Asp 79, and Asp 86, which are located in a sequence containing a high negative charge density. We propose that the conversion of negatively charged carboxylate groups at these residues to bulky, positively charged EDC-carboxyl groups inhibits the reaction with the reductase. EDC was also found to cross-link adrenodoxin to cytochrome c in yields up to 90%. The cross-links were found to involve the formation of amide linkages between carboxyl groups on adrenodoxin and the lysine amino groups surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W1643143589,"Two types of trypsin-like proteases, spermosin and acrosin, have been highly purified from spermatozoa of the ascidian (Prochordata) Halocynthia roretzi by a procedure including diethylaminoethylcellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, and soybean trypsin inhibitor-immobilized Sepharose 4B chromatography. Each purified preparation was judged to be homogeneous on the basis of chromatographic analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of spermosin and acrosin were estimated to be 27,000 and 32,000-34,000, respectively, by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The isoelectric point of the former was 6.5, while that of the latter was 5.5. Non-ionic detergents, e.g. Brij 35, showed marked stabilizing effects on the purified enzymes. Both of these enzymes had pH optima between 8.5 and 9.0, and their activities were enhanced by the addition of calcium chloride. The enzymes were inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, ovomucoid, valyl-prolyl-arginyl-chloromethane, glycyl-valyl-arginyl-chloromethane, p-aminobenzamidine, benzamidine, zinc chloride, and mercuric chloride. Lima bean trypsin inhibitor and tosyl-lysyl-chloromethane strongly inhibited acrosin, but not spermosin. While the substrate specificity of acrosin was rather broad, that of spermosin was very narrow; the latter enzyme hydrolyzed only t-butyloxycarbonyl-valyl-prolyl-arginine 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide among 12 peptidyl-arginine (or lysine) 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amides tested. Thus, the ascidian spermatozoa possess at least two proteases, acrosin and spermosin; the former shows the properties closely related to those of mammalian acrosin (EC 3.4.21.10), but the latter is a unique type of acrosin-like enzyme in respect to the substrate specificity and inhibitor susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1501577595,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae temperature-sensitive lethal mutant alg1-1, has been previously shown to lack the activity necessary for the addition of the first mannose residue in the synthesis of lipid-linked precursor oligosaccharide. The gene ALG1 has been cloned by complementation of the temperature-sensitive mutation alg1-1 with a total genomic DNA library. The original DNA fragment isolated was 11,300 base pairs and has been subcloned to a 1,500-base pair fragment which is still capable of complementing alg1-1. The gene ALG1 has been mapped on chromosome II at a distance of 2.1 map units from LYS2. The ALG1 gene product has been shown to catalyze the transfer of a mannosyl residue from GDP-mannose to the lipid-linked acceptor GlcNAc2, yielding Man beta 1-4GlcNAc2-lipid, in lysates from Escherichia coli transformants. This result proves that ALG1 is the structural gene for the first mannosyltransferase in lipid-linked oligosaccharide assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1509179202,"The mechanism of insulin-induced down-regulation of surface membrane insulin receptors was studied in the muscle cell line BC3H-1. Down-regulation for the differentiated myocytes is dose- and time-dependent with a half-maximum response at 0.5 nM insulin and a maximum decrease of 50% in the number of surface insulin receptors following exposure to 20 nM insulin for 18 h at 37 degrees C, as confirmed by Scatchard analysis. These receptors were fully recoverable upon lysis of the down-regulated myocyte with Triton X-100, demonstrating that down-regulation is mediated solely by insulin-induced receptor internalization without detectable receptor degradation. Phospholipase C treatment of intact down-regulated cells and Triton X-100 treatment after subcellular fractionation showed that no cryptic or masked receptors were detectable within the plasma membrane. Insulin-induced receptor internalization was dependent upon cellular energy production, protein synthesis, and endocytosis, but was insensitive to agents which primarily affect lysosomal, cytoskeletal, or transglutaminase activities. The magnitude of insulin-induced down-regulation and the kinetics of down-regulation and recovery of cell surface receptors indicate that the surface and internal receptor pools are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. The kinetic data are accommodated by separate internalization rate constants for the unoccupied (0.01 h-1) and occupied (0.11 h-1) surface receptors and a single recycling rate constant (0.11 h-1) for the internalized receptors. This model also explains the previous apparently paradoxical finding in several other systems that down-regulation is more sensitive to hormone than hormone-receptor binding under physiologic conditions. Down-regulation in BC3H-1 myocytes, therefore, appears to be mediated solely by an insulin-induced increase in the receptor internalization rate constant and a consequent shift in the dynamic equilibrium between the surface and internalized receptor pools, resulting in a 50% decrease in the number of cell surface receptors. In other systems where the internalized hormone receptor is a substrate for rapid degradation, the essential role of this shift in mediating the down-regulation process may be obscured."
https://openalex.org/W1495227714,"2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductases, enzymes of the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids which were purified from bovine liver and oleate-induced cells of Escherichia coli, revealed very similar substrate specificities but distinctly different molecular properties. The subunit molecular weights, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 32,000 and 73,000 for the mammalian and the bacterial enzyme, respectively. The native molecular weights, calculated from sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii yielded 124,000 for the bovine liver and 70,000 for the bacterial enzyme. Thus, bovine liver 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is a tetramer consisting of four identical subunits. The E. coli 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, however, possesses a monomeric structure. The latter enzyme contains 1 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme, whereas the former reductase is not a flavoprotein. The bovine liver reductase reduced 2-trans, 4-cis- and 2-trans,4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA to 3-trans-decenoyl-CoA. The E. coli reductase catalyzed the reduction of the same two substrates but in contrast yielded 2-trans-decenoyl-CoA as reaction product. Certain other properties of the two 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductases are also presented. The localization of the reductase step within the degradation pathway of 4-cis-decenoyl-CoA, a metabolite of linoleic acid, is discussed."

The sedimentation coefficient has been determined to be s0(20,w) = 13.6 S. The diffusion constant has been found to be 3.9 X 10(-7) cm2s-1, and the calculated partial specific volume was v = 0.663 cm3/g. From these data, a molecular weight of 252,000 was calculated. Electrophoresis on gel slabs, with a linear concentration gradient of polyacrylamide (4-30%), showed size heterogeneity of the native enzyme preparation and indicated an apparent molecular weight in the range of 170,000 to 360,000. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the molecular weight was in the range of 82,000 to 165,000, indicating dimeric structure of the native enzyme, which was confirmed by cross-linking experiments. Isoelectric focusing demonstrated charge heterogeneity of enzyme preparation. From CD spectrum it was calculated that the enzyme contains about 29% of alpha-helical structure. Excitation at 278 nm gave an emission fluorescence spectrum with a maximum at 340 nm. Amino acid analysis revealed a high content of aspartic acid, serine, and threonine. Glycine is found as the NH2-terminal amino acid. Initial velocity dependence on substrate concentration, as well as on pH, and thermostability studies indicated the presence of at least two enzyme forms in the preparation."

Using recently developed culture techniques, adenosine deaminase-deficient human erythrocytes were infected in vitro with the major human pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Adenosine deaminase activity was undetectable in the uninfected host red cells, but increased by 2-fold over normal levels in these cells with an 8% parasitemia. The enzyme in these cells appeared unique in that its activity was markedly elevated over that of other parasite purine enzymes, was not cross-reactive with antibody against human erythrocyte adenosine deaminase, and though inhibited competitively by deoxycoformycin was relatively insensitive to erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine. The use of adenosine deaminase-deficient erythrocytes for the in vitro cultivation of Plasmodium provides a unique system for the study of parasite enzyme and allows further insight into the purine metabolism of the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1566175363,"An enzyme was discovered which incorporates hypoxanthine into mature tRNA macromolecules. This enzyme is postulated to be similar to tRNA-guanine ribosyltransferase which inserts 7-(3,4-trans-4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-ylaminomethyl )-7-deazaguanine into the first position of the anticodon of four tRNAs. The hypoxanthine-incorporating enzyme has been assayed in extracts of rat liver and cultured human leukemia cells and it has been resolved from tRNA-guanine ribosyltransferase by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The enzyme assay is based on the incorporation of radiolabeled hypoxanthine into unfractionated heterologous tRNA and the reaction rate is proportional to the amount of added enzyme extract. Hydrolysis of the radiolabeled tRNA and analysis of the nucleoside composition yields inosine (the nucleoside of hypoxanthine) as the only radiolabeled product. It is proposed that the enzyme, a tRNA-hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase, is responsible for the biosynthesis of inosine in the anticodon wobble position of specific tRNAs, resulting in greatly expanded codon recognition by these tRNAs."

The purified enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Stokes radius of the enzyme was determined from its elution volume on a Sephacryl S300 column and its sedimentation constant from sucrose density gradient centrifugation. These were 35 A and 4.7 (S20,w), respectively. The enzyme consists of two subunits each with a mass of 31,000 daltons, as determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tetrahydrodipicolinate succinylase was shown to be a sulfhydryl enzyme. It has a pH optimum of 8.2. The equilibrium lies predominantly in favor of product formation but the reverse reaction can be demonstrated in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1550966800,"An Mr = 16,000 receptor-binding fragment of colicin E1 has been obtained by cyanogen bromide digestion of colicin E1. The purified 16-kDa fragment shows binding properties similar to those of an Mr = 38,000 colicin E1 receptor-binding fragment generated by thermolysin treatment. Treatment of the 38-kDa fragment with cyanogen bromide also yields the 16-kDa fragment. By comparing the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 16-kDa fragment with the known colicin E1 sequence, the receptor-binding fragment can be shown to occupy the central region of the colicin molecule, extending from residue 231 to 370. It is inferred that the 16-kDa fragment binds efficiently to the colicin receptor because it is able to protect sensitive cells against the lethal effects of colicins E1 and E2 and, when pre-adsorbed to the cell, to physically displace colicin E1. Unlike the 38-kDa receptor-binding fragment, the 16-kDa fragment was found to be devoid of channel-forming ability previously shown to be associated with the COOH-terminal region of the colicin E1 polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1554080519,"Acyl carrier protein is an essential cofactor in fatty acid biosynthesis, and in contrast to the stability of the protein moiety during growth, its 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group is metabolically active. The biosynthetic incorporation of deuterium into nonexchangeable positions of acyl carrier protein was found to enhance the sensitivity of the protein to pH-induced hydrodynamic expansion. This constitutional isotope effect was exploited to separate deuterated from normal acyl carrier protein by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis, thus providing the analytical framework for separating pre-existing (deuterated) from newly synthesized acyl carrier protein in pulse-chase experiments. The rate of acyl carrier protein prosthetic group turnover was found to depend on the intracellular concentration of coenzyme A. At low coenzyme A levels, prosthetic group turnover was four times faster than the rate of new acyl carrier protein biosynthesis but at the higher coenzyme A concentrations characteristic of logarithmic growth, turnover was an order of magnitude slower, amounting to approximately 25% of the acyl carrier protein pool per generation. These observations suggest that the acyl carrier protein prosthetic group turnover cycle may be related to coenzyme A metabolism rather than to lipid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1546756405,"Cytochrome P-450 can metabolize arachidonic (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic) acid to four epoxides. One of them, cis-5(6)oxido-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, has been reported to possess biological activity. To ascertain whether this epoxide could be a substrate for the enzyme fatty acid cyclooxygenase, synthetic 3H-labeled cis-5(6)-oxido-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid was incubated with microsomes of ram seminal vesicles and incubated with microsomes of ram seminal vesicles and the products were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The substrate was enzymatically transformed into products, which were more polar than 5,6-dihydroxy-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid. The biosynthesis was strongly inhibited by indomethacin or diclofenac sodium, two inhibitors of fatty acid cyclooxygenase. Two of the major metabolites could be identified by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as two stereoisomers of 5-hydroxyprostaglandin I1, viz. (5R,6R)-5-hydroxyprostaglandin I1 and (5S,6S)-5-hydroxyprostaglandin I1. The structures were established by comparison with the mass spectra of authentic material and by the retention time on capillary gas chromatography using deuterated internal standards. The two stereoisomers were presumably formed nonenzymatically from the intermediate 5(6)oxidoprostaglandin endoperoxides or from 5(6)oxidoprostaglandin F1 alpha during the isolation procedure."
https://openalex.org/W1565271895,"Nuclear magnetic resonance studies were performed to investigate the effect of DNA template on the interaction of initiating nucleotide ATP with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RPase) in which one of the two intrinsic Zn ions was substituted with a Co(II) (Co-Zn RPase) or Mn(II) (Mn-Zn RPase) ion. This intrinsic metal ion is located at the initiation site in the beta subunit of RPase. The paramagnetic effects of Co-Zn and Mn-Zn RPases on the relaxation rates of 1H- and 31P-nuclei of ATP were used to determine the distances from the intrinsic metal to various atoms of ATP bound at the initiation sites in the presence of DNA. The distances from the metal to H2, H8, H1', alpha-P, beta-P, and gamma-P atoms were estimated to be 6.7 +/- 0.9, 4.1 +/- 0.6, 6.0 +/- 1.2, 7.5 +/- 0.8, 9.4 +/- 1.0, and 9.8 +/- 1.0 A, respectively. These distances were compared with those measured in the absence of DNA (Chatterji, D., and Wu, F. Y.-H. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 4657). In both the presence and absence of DNA, the close proximity between the intrinsic metal and the H8 atom strongly indicates that the metal is coordinated directly to the base moiety of ATP. Such a coordination may provide a structural basis for the selection of a purine nucleotide during the initiation process. The presence of DNA causes the H2 atom to move away (greater than 2 A) from the intrinsic metal, whereas all three phosphorus atoms shift closer (greater than 3 A) toward the metal. The possible mechanistic implications of the conformational alteration of ATP at the initiation site induced by the DNA template is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2122291638,"Abstract During infection of Escherichia coli by bacteriophage T7, E. coli RNA polymerase utilizes only three promoters (A1, A2, and A3). In vitro, the A promoters predominate at very low polymerase concentration, but at higher polymerase concentration the minor B, C, D, and E promoters are used with equal efficiency. The binding constant for the initial association of polymerase with promoters and the forward rate of isomerization to an complex capable of initiation have been measured for the A1, A3, C, and D promoters using the abortive initiation reaction. At 80 mM KCl, 37 degrees C, both major and minor promoters isomerize rapidly (t1/2 = 10 to 30 s). In contrast, initial binding to the minor promoters (KI = 10(7) ) is at least 10-fold weaker than binding to major promoters KI greater than or equal to 10(8) ), suggesting promoter selectivity in the T7 system occurs at the point of initial binding. Association kinetics of the A1 and C promoters on intact T7 were the same as measured on restriction fragments of length greater than or equal to 500 base pairs. All open complexes dissociated with half-lives longer than 1 h. Overall equilibrium binding constants estimated from kinetic measurements ranged from 10(10) to greater than or equal to 10(11) M-1 for minor and major promoters, respectively. Data on heparin attack and abortive initiation turnover rates indicate open complex polymerase conformation may be different at the A1 and A3 promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1637341546,"We have tested a putative base-paired interaction between the conserved GT psi C sequence of tRNA and the conserved GAAC47 sequence of 5 S ribosomal RNA by in vitro protein synthesis using ribosomes containing deletions in this region of 5 S rRNA. Ribosomes reconstituted with 5 S rRNA possessing a single break between residues 41 and 42, deletion of residues 42-46, or deletion of residues 42-52 were tested for their ability to translate phage MS2 RNA. Initiator tRNA binding, aminoacyl-tRNA binding, ppGpp synthesis, and miscoding were also tested. All of the measured functions could be carried out by ribosomes carrying the deleted 5 S rRNAs. The sizes and relative amounts of the polypeptides synthesized by MS2 RNA-programmed ribosomes were identical whether or not the 5 S RNA contained deletions. Aminoacyl-tRNA binding and miscoding were essentially unaffected. Significant reduction in ApUpG (but not poly(A,U,G) or MS2 RNA)-directed fMet-tRNA binding and ppGpp synthesis were observed, particularly in the case of the larger (residues 42-52) deletion. We conclude that if tRNA and 5 S rRNA interact in this fashion, it is not an obligatory step in protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1571721431,"Inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by 3-bromopyruvate is thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent. Inactivation with 2-14C- or 3-14C-labeled 3-bromopyruvate results in TPP-dependent covalent labeling of more than 60 sites in the complex, all of which are associated with the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component. Inactivation by 3-bromo[1-14C]pyruvate labels up to 20 sites associated with dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, also with TPP dependence. Systemic chemical degradation of the complex inactivated by 3-bromo[2-14C]pyruvate under conditions that would convert lipoyl groups to S,S,-biscarboxymethyl dihydrolipoic acid produces S,S,-bis[14C]carboxymethyl dihydrolipoic acid. It is concluded that 3-bromopyruvate inactivates this complex by initially undergoing the first two steps of the usual catalytic pathway, TPP-dependent decarboxylation followed by reductive bromoacetylation of lipoyl moieties. The sulfhydryl groups of S-bromoacetyl dihydrolipoyl moieties generated by reductive bromoacetylation are then alkylated by 3-bromopyruvate as well as by bromoacetyl thioester groups associated with the complex."

In this report insulin is shown to be effective in delivering enzyme-albumin conjugates to cells and tissues rich in insulin receptors. The complex is transported into cells by a process that resembles receptor-mediated endocytosis and can be identified in a lysosomal fraction. The enzyme-albumin-insulin complex retains its enzymatic activity and its ability to bind antibodies to insulin. It also has a hypoglycemic effect; however, plasma glucose concentrations can be maintained by glucose administration."
https://openalex.org/W1549766496,"The flavin prosthetic group (FAD) of thioredoxin reductase has been replaced by 1-deazaFAD (carbon substituted for nitrogen at position 1). Reduction of 1-deazaFAD-thioredoxin reductase by four electrons proceeds in two stages having midpoint potentials that are separated by 0.063 V. Two-electron reduced 1-deazaFAD-thioredoxin reductase (EH2) has spectral characteristics that are different from both the fully oxidized and fully reduced enzyme. The fluorescence of the 2-electron reduced enzyme shows a mixture of two EH2 species. The spectrum of one EH2 species has a single absorption peak (lambda max, 414 nm; epsilon 414, 8750 M-1 cm-1) which is similar to the spectrum of 1-deazaFAD-C-4a adducts (referred to as the 414-nm absorbing species). In the other EH2 species the electrons are in the dithiol, and it has an oxidized 1-deazaFAD spectrum (referred to as the 550-nm EH2 species). The equilibrium between the two EH2 species of 1-deazaFAD-thioredoxin reductase is pH dependent, forming more of the 414-nm absorbing species as the pH is lowered. The pH dependence suggests the presence of an active center base having a pK of 7.41 on the 414-nm EH2 species and a thiol of pK 6.73 on the 550-nm EH2 species. These pK values are similar to the pK values determined for native enzyme having a disulfide or a dithiol (7.59 and 6.98, respectively). Thus, the pH dependence of the equilibrium between the two EH2 species of 1-deazaFAD-thioredoxin reductase is further evidence for an active site base with an ionization behavior that is linked to the chemical state of the active site disulfide moiety. The nature of the linked ionization is consistent with a thiol base ion pair formed upon disulfide reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1602508226,Mutations in the xylose-H+ transport activity of Escherichia coli K12 were isolated using Mud(ApRlac). The initial selection was for simultaneous acquisition of ampicillin and xylose resistance in an fda background. Colonies were then screened for xylose-inducible beta-galactosidase and for growth on xylose of their fda+ derivatives. Two of the xylose-positive derivatives were shown to be impaired in xylose-H+ symport in whole cells and in xylose transport into subcellular vesicles. Their xylose transport in whole cells showed increased sensitivity to arsenate. The site of prophage insertion was mapped to 91.4 min on the E. coli genome between pgi and malB. It is proposed that the gene for the xylose-H+ symport system be called xylE.
https://openalex.org/W1598870595,"Pyridine nucleotide metabolism has been studied in vivo in a prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and a eukaryotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) system cultured in a medium containing carbon-13-labeled nicotinic acid, followed by NMR detection of the labeled organisms. Chemical exchange between oxidized and reduced nucleotides is found to be sufficiently slow on the NMR time scale to permit the observation of separate resonances corresponding to each redox state. The possibility of significant exchange broadening of reduced pyridine nucleotide resonances under some conditions was further evaluated based on comparative NMR studies utilizing organisms cultured in the presence of either [2-13C]nicotinate or [5-13C]nicotinate. Based on these experiments, it was concluded that broadening as a consequence of intermediate exchange is not significant. Although it was initially anticipated that the carbon-13 resonances arising from the di- and triphosphopyridine nucleotide pools could not be distinguished, the absence of observable resonances corresponding to reduced nucleotides in oxygenated yeast and E. coli cells suggests that the NMR method is fairly specific for determining the redox status of the diphosphopyridine nucleotide pool. Studies of the effects of a variety of perturbations including variation of the oxygen supply, addition of ethanol, and addition of the oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler dinitrophenol have been carried out. Dramatic differences in the response of the catabolic reduction charge, CRC = [NADH]/[NADH] + [NAD+], between the yeast and E. coli cells are observed. The CRC values for the yeast undergo large changes in response to these perturbations which are not observed for the bacterial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1607577187,"A new intermediate (apolipoprotein) in the synthesis of the major lipoprotein of the Escherichia coli outer membrane has been identified. The accumulation of this new form of the lipoprotein was observed when excessive production of lipoprotein was induced or when the membrane fraction containing the prolipoprotein accumulated in the presence of globomycin was incubated at 60 degrees C. The new form of the lipoprotein could be chased into the mature lipoprotein. In addition, from sequential analysis of this new protein by Edman degradation, the NH2 terminus was found to be cysteine, containing a free unmodified amino group and a glyceride-modified sulfhydryl group. These results indicate that this protein is an intermediate in the conversion of glyceride-modified prolipoprotein to the mature lipoprotein. It is believed that the lipoprotein signal peptidase directly cleaves the lipoprotein signal peptide at the peptide bond between the glycine residue at position 20 and the cysteine residue at position 21 of the prolipoprotein. The resulting intermediate, designated here as apolipoprotein, is subsequently acylated at its free amino group to yield the final mature lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1520825768,"Rat M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNA was enriched from total polysomes isolated from AH-130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells, which contain a very high concentration of the M2-type enzyme, by immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody and Staphylococcus aureus cells. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized from the enriched mRNA was inserted into the PstI site of pBR322, and the resultant recombinant DNA molecules were used to transform Escherichia coli. Three clones containing DNA complementary to M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNA were identified by colony hybridization, hybrid-arrested translation, and hybrid-selected translation. A partial restriction map was constructed covering about 1.44 kilobase pairs. The cloned region of the M2-type mRNA showed a high degree of sequence homology with the M1-type mRNA and some homology with the L-type mRNA as determined by dot blot hybridization. The molecular size of the M2-type mRNA, which was estimated to be 2.35-2.65 kilobases on denaturing gel, was the same as that of the M1-type mRNA. The level of hepatic M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNA measured by hybridization assay using cloned cDNA as a probe was increased 2.5-fold 1 day and 3.9-fold 2 days after partial hepatectomy and then started to decrease. This induction was followed by similar changes in the enzyme activity. AH-130 hepatoma cells contained 100-150 times more M2-type isozyme mRNA than regenerating liver. These results suggest that the increased levels of M2-type isozyme in regenerating liver and hepatoma cells are primarily due to elevation of hybridizable M2-type mRNA concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1579525534,"Rat cardiac ventricular myosins and RNA were prepared from normal, diabetic, insulin-treated diabetic, hypothyroid, and 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine-treated hypothyroid rats. Myosin heavy chains isolated from purified myosin or synthesized in vitro from cardiac RNAs were subjected to partial protease digestion during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was found that peptide maps obtained from cardiac myosin heavy chains of hypothyroid and diabetic rats were identical but differed from the maps of myosin heavy chain from control and hormone-treated animals. The same results were obtained, whether the heavy chains were isolated from purified myosin synthesized in the intact heart or from translation products coded for by cardiac RNAs added to the modified reticulocyte lysate. These results indicate that the myosin heavy chain RNA species present in the hypothyroid heart is also expressed during insulin deficiency but differs from the species expressed in normal animals. The expression of the two myosin heavy chain RNA species found in the rat cardiac ventricle appears to be independently regulated by these two hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1520979842,"The stereochemical course of phospho transfer in the reaction catalyzed by adenylosuccinate synthetase from rat muscle has been determined with chiral [gamma-17O,18O]GTP gamma S as a substrate. The stereochemical configuration of the product, inorganic thiophosphate, was determined by 31P NMR after the compound was stereospecifically incorporated into ATP beta S. The reaction goes with net inversion of configuration, which is the course for a single phospho transfer, even though 6-phospho-IMP is probably an intermediate on the normal reaction pathway (Liebermann, I. (1956) J. Biol. Chem. 223, 327-339). The breakdown of this intermediate goes by C-O bond cleavage and so is not a true phospho transfer step. Thus, inversion of configuration during the course of this ligase reaction is consistent with a single phospho transfer step in the overall reaction, the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1508554430,"Growth of Escherichia coli K12 under relatively anaerobic conditions in a medium containing casein hydrolysate, 0.8% glycerol, and 0.8% hydroxyacetone has been found to induce the level of D-1-amino-2-propanol oxidoreductase activity 50- to 100-fold over that in cells grown in casein hydrolysate alone or with 0.8% glycerol added. A large molecular weight form of this oxidoreductase (designated Form L) has been purified to apparent homogeneity in good yield by three simple steps designed to obviate its conversion to a smaller species. The molecular weight of native Form L and its basic subunit are 417,000 +/- 20,700 and 50,500 +/- 2,770, respectively; hence Form L would appear to consist of eight identical subunits. The pH activity profile for Form L shows one optimum in the range of 8.3 to 8.6 and another at pH 10.0 to 10.2. This form of the oxidoreductase has no apparent requirement for added metal ions (rather, numerous divalent transition metal ions are strongly inhibitory) or thiol compounds; it catalyzes the oxidation of several vic-glycols but is completely stereospecific for the D-isomer of 1-amino-2-propanol, utilizes only NAD+ as cosubstrate in the oxidation reaction (Km for NAD+ with DL-1-amino-2-propanol = 1.23 mM), but both NADH and NADPH serve as cosubstrate in the reduction of hydroxyacetone. Oxidoreductase activity of Form L is highly sensitive to inhibition by Hg2+, p-mercuribenzoate, or dithiodipyridine; inhibition by the latter two compounds is completely reversed by adding a thiol in excess."
https://openalex.org/W1525060853,"The hypothesis that Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase functions by a cooperative alternating sites mechanism is based largely on the results of [18O]phosphate exchange experiments (Bild, G. S., Janson, C. A., and Boyer, P. D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8109-8115). In those experiments, [18O]Pi----succinate (predominantly) exchange appeared to proceed at greater rates (relative to the apparent amount of succinyl-CoA released from the enzyme) at low ATP in incubations containing ATP, CoA, succinate, [18O]Pi, 0.48 M hydroxylamine (as a succinyl-CoA trap), and a pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase ADP trap. The conclusion arrived at was that succinyl-CoA binding at one was inversely related to ATP binding at the second site. Thus, the residence time of succinyl-CoA binding at a would be longer at lower ATP concentrations. Our experiments show that, under the incubation conditions described by Bild et al. (Bild, G. S., Janson, C. A., and Boyer, P. D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8109-8115), succinyl-CoA is not efficiently trapped. Thus, at ATP concentrations from 3.6 to 150 microM, concentrations of succinyl-CoA from 13 to 78 microM were observed. Succinate----succinyl-CoA exchange reactions carried out in this range of ATP and subsaturating succinyl-CoA concentrations were found to be markedly inhibited by the addition of the ADP trap. This inhibition was more pronounced at higher ATP levels. At a saturating succinyl-CoA concentration (1.5 mM), addition of the ADP trap actually stimulated succinate----succinyl-CoA exchange. Under these conditions, ATP----Pi exchange was greatly depressed. These results are interpreted as follows. ADP is required for optimal binding of succinyl-CoA, but only when the latter is present at subsaturating concentrations; thus, the ADP trap inhibits the reaction. ATP exerts its stimulatory action on succinate---- succinyl-CoA exchange through an site effect, i.e. in binding to the noncatalytic of succinyl-CoA synthetase, it facilitates binding and release of succinyl-CoA at the catalytic site. ATP may also exert negative effects by inhibiting other binding of ATP or by interfering with same succinyl-CoA binding at subsaturating concentrations of the latter. These data support the notion that a half-sites mechanism applies to succinyl-CoA synthetase, but suggest that the [18O]Pi----succinate exchange data which have been instrumental in development of the cooperative alternating sites hypothesis should be re-evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1541472565,"Abstract The interaction of 3-acetylpyridine-adenine dinucleotide phosphate, a structural analog of NADPH, with aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase has been studied by fluorescence and activity measurements. This analog binds to the same site and with the same affinity as does the natural coenzyme. Also, the binding of homoserine to the dehydrogenase site or that of threonine to the regulatory site is the same whether NADPH or its analog is bound to the enzyme. So NADPH and its analog appear as equivalent in the formation of various stable enzyme-ligand(s) complexes. The analog resembles NADPH enough so that it is a substrate that the enzyme can use to reduce aspartate semialdehyde; the maximum velocity of this dehydrogenase reaction is however reduced by 90% as compared to that with NADPH. It seems as if one of the catalytic steps is affected by the replacement of a--CONH2 group by--COCH3. Another difference between the two coenzymes is that the reaction with the analog is insensitive to threonine, whereas that with NADPH is inhibited. The lack of inhibition is not due to a lack of binding, but rather to a difference in the ternary complexes composed of enzyme, coenzyme, and substrate. A possible relationship between the inhibition by threonine and the mechanism of the dehydrogenase reaction is thus suggested by this comparison between NADPH and its analog."
