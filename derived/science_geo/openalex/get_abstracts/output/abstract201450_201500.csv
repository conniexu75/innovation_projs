https://openalex.org/W1995993782,A number of drugs that are metabolized through the action of enzymes present in liver microsomes in the adult rabbit are not metabolized in livers of newborn rabbits. The development of metabolic pathways during a period of 4 weeks is presented. Evidence is given for the presence in livers of baby rabbits of inhibitors of some of these drug-enzyme systems.

https://openalex.org/W2098651583,phenylhydrazine and hydrogen peroxide were prepared fresh as needed for the various experimental procedures. The hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by titration with a standardized permanganate solution. Horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Nutritional Biochemicals Corporation. Diethylaminoethyl cellulose1 was prepared from Solka-Floe as described by Peterson and Sober (8). Titration curves of the lyophilized preparation showed the presence of 0.9 m.eq. of ionizing groups per gm. of dry material. Methods-All spectrophotometric measurements were made with a model DU Beckman spectrophotometer. Optical density readings at 270 rnp were used as a routine measure of the protein concentration in eluent fractions. The optical density readings at 270 rnp of a solution of the purified enzyme preparation were correlated with the protein nitrogen content of this same sample by a nitrogen analysis carried out by the Kjeldahl procedure (9). Catalase activity was measured by the method of Feinstein (10).
https://openalex.org/W1625475748,"The Pasteur and Crabtree effects demonstrate that changes at the beginning of the metabolic sequence for glucose metabolism give rise to effects at the end, and vice versa. We have presented here three additional responses of the ascites tumor cell suspensions, and presumably more will be uncovered. Each one of these responses is a manifestation of factors in the underlying mechanism that are in the nature of chemical feedback of a linear or nonlinear nature. The metabolic reactions are sufficiently complex that it is unlikely that any single component or step need control metabolism in different types of cells or under all conditions for a particular cell. However, it is due to a favorable circumstance that, in an appropriate type of cell and with the use of a direct intracellular indicator for changes in ADP concentration, we can state that the respiratory metabolism of the ascites tumor cell suspension, as freshly withdrawn from the mouse abdomen, is limited by the intracellular ADP concentration, and that this is why these cells show a predominance of glycolytic over respiratory activity. The response of the metabolism to small and large additions of glucose illustrates aspects of the metabolic mechanism which involve control of endogenous metabolism and compartmentalization of ATP formed in oxidative phosphorylation, the net result being a depression of the respiratory activity. The results of this approach emphasize the importance of chemical assays of localized portions of the living cell in its physiological state (61)."

https://openalex.org/W2046575779,"A hypothesis, suggested previously by morphological studies, for impulse conduction from the sarcolemma to the contractile material via the sarcoplasmic reticulum is discussed. The relation of reticulum morphology and cell size to speed of contraction in smooth and striated muscle agrees with the hypothesis and thus supports it. Additional support comes from evidence concerning an unusual morphological relationship between the sarcolemma and contractile fibrils in striated muscle of amphioxus."
https://openalex.org/W1977880955,Experimental evidence shows that the odor trail of the fire ant Solenopsis saevissima (Fr. Smith) is produced as a secretion of the accessory gland of the poison apparatus and released through the extruded sting. Preliminary studies suggest that this substance may be chemically allied to or even identical with the toxic principle of the venom.

https://openalex.org/W1995656775,Delaying the return of a speaker's vocal output to his ears (the auditory feedback) radically changes his speech (1). The present report concerns the effect of delayed auditory feedback on simple key-tapping tasks. Evidence is presented which indicates that changes in speech and key tapping under delayed auditory feedback are analogous.
https://openalex.org/W2000047722,"In contrast to the findings of Zeller et al. ( 1 ), schizophrenic patients did not differ from normal control subjects in the rate of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion either before or after oral administration of l-tryptophan. The excretion of 5-HIAA may be directly related to dietary tryptophan since feeding-problem schizophrenic patients excreated less 5-HIAA than either of the well-fed groups. This was not related to pyridoxin deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1979821595,"Gibberellic acid promotes doubling, early flowering, and fruiting directly in Impatiens. It also lengthens the stem, probably through a neutralization of auxin inhibitors. Such a mechanism would leave the growth-promoting auxins unchecked to produce the increased elongation characteristic of gibberellin application. It seems that application of additional auxin produces a rapid build-up of the auxin inhibitor(s) in the plant."
https://openalex.org/W2074754179,Ultraviolet radiation-induced mutants of the soft rot bacterium Pseudomonas marginalis were selected for loss of pathogenicity for lettuce and witloof chicory. The avirulent mutants differed from the parent pathogen in their inability to synthesize pectolytic enzymes in culture or to ferment sodium pectate or sodium polygalacturonate as the sole carbon source in media.
