https://openalex.org/W1546552389,"Here we studied cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) collected from subjects with advanced lung cancer whose tumors had developed resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AZD9291. We first performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1619537825,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 have mediated dramatic antitumor responses in hematologic malignancies, but tumor regression has rarely occurred using CARs targeting other antigens. It remains unknown whether the impressive effects of CD19 CARs relate to greater susceptibility of hematologic malignancies to CAR therapies, or superior functionality of the CD19 CAR itself. We show that tonic CAR CD3-ζ phosphorylation, triggered by antigen-independent clustering of CAR single-chain variable fragments, can induce early exhaustion of CAR T cells that limits antitumor efficacy. Such activation is present to varying degrees in all CARs studied, except the highly effective CD19 CAR. We further determine that CD28 costimulation augments, whereas 4-1BB costimulation reduces, exhaustion induced by persistent CAR signaling. Our results provide biological explanations for the antitumor effects of CD19 CARs and for the observations that CD19 CAR T cells incorporating the 4-1BB costimulatory domain are more persistent than those incorporating CD28 in clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W1483951471,"Jean-Luc Battini, Giovanni Coppola and colleagues identify XPR1 mutations in several families with primary brain calcification. They further show that these mutations alter phosphate export activity, implicating defective phosphate homeostasis in the etiology of this disease. Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a neurological disease characterized by calcium phosphate deposits in the basal ganglia and other brain regions and has thus far been associated with SLC20A2, PDGFB or PDGFRB mutations. We identified in multiple families with PFBC mutations in XPR1, a gene encoding a retroviral receptor with phosphate export function. These mutations alter phosphate export, implicating XPR1 and phosphate homeostasis in PFBC."
https://openalex.org/W1523304533,"The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a critical regulator of protein synthesis. The best studied targets of mTORC1 in translation are the eukaryotic initiation factor-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). In this study, we identify the La-related protein 1 (LARP1) as a key novel target of mTORC1 with a fundamental role in terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA translation. Recent genome-wide studies indicate that TOP and TOP-like mRNAs compose a large portion of the mTORC1 translatome, but the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation is incompletely understood. Here, we report that LARP1 functions as a key repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1. Our data show the following: (i) LARP1 associates with mTORC1 via RAPTOR; (ii) LARP1 interacts with TOP mRNAs in an mTORC1-dependent manner; (iii) LARP1 binds the 5′TOP motif to repress TOP mRNA translation; and (iv) LARP1 competes with the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G for TOP mRNA binding. Importantly, from a drug resistance standpoint, our data also show that reducing LARP1 protein levels by RNA interference attenuates the inhibitory effect of rapamycin, Torin1, and amino acid deprivation on TOP mRNA translation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that LARP1 functions as an important repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1."
https://openalex.org/W1805101691,"The intestinal microbiota is vital for shaping the local intestinal environment as well as host immunity and metabolism. At the same time, epidemiological and experimental evidence suggest an important role for parasitic worm infections in maintaining the inflammatory and regulatory balance of the immune system. In line with this, the prevalence of persistent worm infections is inversely correlated with the incidence of immune-associated diseases, prompting the use of controlled parasite infections for therapeutic purposes. Despite this, the impact of parasite infection on the intestinal microbiota, as well as potential downstream effects on the immune system, remain largely unknown. We have assessed the influence of chronic infection with the large-intestinal nematode Trichuris muris, a close relative of the human pathogen Trichuris trichiura, on the composition of the murine intestinal microbiota by 16S ribosomal-RNA gene-based sequencing. Our results demonstrate that persistent T. muris infection dramatically affects the large-intestinal microbiota, most notably with a drop in the diversity of bacterial communities, as well as a marked increase in the relative abundance of the Lactobacillus genus. In parallel, chronic T. muris infection resulted in a significant shift in the balance between regulatory and inflammatory T cells in the intestinal adaptive immune system, in favour of inflammatory cells. Together, these data demonstrate that chronic parasite infection strongly influences the intestinal microbiota and the adaptive immune system. Our results illustrate the complex interactions between these factors in the intestinal tract, and contribute to furthering the understanding of this interplay, which is of crucial importance considering that 500 million people globally are suffering from these infections and their potential use for therapeutic purposes."

https://openalex.org/W398308359,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has become a powerful tool for the detection of and sequence characterization of microRNAs (miRNA) and other small RNAs (sRNA). Unfortunately, the use of HTS data to determine the relative quantity of different miRNAs in a sample has been shown to be inconsistent with quantitative PCR and Northern Blot results. Several recent studies have concluded that the major contributor to this inconsistency is bias introduced during the construction of sRNA libraries for HTS and that the bias is primarily derived from the adaptor ligation steps, specifically where single stranded adaptors are sequentially ligated to the 3' and 5'-end of sRNAs using T4 RNA ligases. In this study we investigated the effects of ligation bias by using a pool of randomized ligation substrates, defined mixtures of miRNA sequences and several combinations of adaptors in HTS library construction. We show that like the 3' adaptor ligation step, the 5' adaptor ligation is also biased, not because of primary sequence, but instead due to secondary structures of the two ligation substrates. We find that multiple secondary structural factors influence final representation in HTS results. Our results provide insight about the nature of ligation bias and allowed us to design adaptors that reduce ligation bias and produce HTS results that more accurately reflect the actual concentrations of miRNAs in the defined starting material."
https://openalex.org/W1559296648,"William Evans and colleagues find that the proinflammatory genes CASP1 and NLRP3 are expressed at higher levels in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells that are resistant than in those that are sensitive to glucocorticoid treatment. They find that CASP1 mediates glucocorticoid resistance through cleavage of the glucocorticoid receptor. Glucocorticoids are universally used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and resistance to glucocorticoids in leukemia cells confers poor prognosis. To elucidate mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance, we determined the prednisolone sensitivity of primary leukemia cells from 444 patients newly diagnosed with ALL and found significantly higher expression of CASP1 (encoding caspase 1) and its activator NLRP3 in glucocorticoid-resistant leukemia cells, resulting from significantly lower somatic methylation of the CASP1 and NLRP3 promoters. Overexpression of CASP1 resulted in cleavage of the glucocorticoid receptor, diminished the glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional response and increased glucocorticoid resistance. Knockdown or inhibition of CASP1 significantly increased glucocorticoid receptor levels and mitigated glucocorticoid resistance in CASP1-overexpressing ALL. Our findings establish a new mechanism by which the NLRP3-CASP1 inflammasome modulates cellular levels of the glucocorticoid receptor and diminishes cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids. The broad impact on the glucocorticoid transcriptional response suggests that this mechanism could also modify glucocorticoid effects in other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1808025664,"Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders may arise from anomalies in long-range neuronal connectivity downstream of pathologies in dendritic spines. However, the mechanisms that may link spine pathology to circuit abnormalities relevant to atypical behavior remain unknown. Using a mouse model to conditionally disrupt a critical regulator of the dendritic spine cytoskeleton, the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3), we report here a molecular mechanism that unexpectedly reveals the inter-relationship of progressive spine pruning, elevated frontal cortical excitation of pyramidal neurons and striatal hyperdopaminergia in a cortical-to-midbrain circuit abnormality. The main symptomatic manifestations of this circuit abnormality are psychomotor agitation and stereotypical behaviors, which are relieved by antipsychotics. Moreover, this antipsychotic-responsive locomotion can be mimicked in wild-type mice by optogenetic activation of this circuit. Collectively these results reveal molecular and neural-circuit mechanisms, illustrating how diverse pathologies may converge to drive behaviors relevant to psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W322846541,"Given the shortage of skilled healthcare providers in Nigeria, frontline community health extension workers (CHEWs) are commonly tasked with providing maternal and child health services at primary health centers. In 2012, we introduced a mobile case management and decision support application in twenty primary health centers in northern Nigeria, and conducted a pre-test/post-test study to assess whether the introduction of the app had an effect on the quality of antenatal care services provided by this lower-level cadre.Using the CommCare mobile platform, the app dynamically guides CHEWs through antenatal care protocols and collects client data in real time. Thirteen health education audio clips are also embedded in the app for improving and standardizing client counseling. To detect changes in quality, we developed an evidence-based quality score consisting of 25 indicators, and conducted a total of 266 client exit interviews. We analyzed baseline and endline data to assess changes in the overall quality score as well as changes in the provision of key elements of antenatal care.Overall, the quality score increased from 13.3 at baseline to 17.2 at endline (p<0.0001), out of a total possible score of 25, with the most significant improvements related to health counseling, technical services provided, and quality of health education.These study results suggest that the introduction of a low-cost mobile case management and decision support application can spur behavior change and improve the quality of services provided by a lower level cadre of healthcare workers. Future research should employ a more rigorous experimental design to explore potential longer-term effects on client health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1579005511,"There have been a few studies on the ganglioside expression in human glioma tissues. However, the role of these gangliosides such as GD3 and GD2 has not been well understood. In this study we employed a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma to clarify the functions of GD3 in gliomas. Forced expression of platelet-derived growth factor B in cultured astrocytes derived from p53-deficient mice resulted in the expression of GD3 and GD2. GD3-positive astrocytes exhibited increased cell growth and invasion activities along with elevated phosphorylation of Akt and Yes kinase. By enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources reaction and mass spectrometry, we identified PDGF receptor α (PDGFRα) as a GD3-associated molecule. GD3-positive astrocytes showed a significant amount of PDGFRα in glycolipid-enriched microdomains/rafts compared with GD3-negative cells. Src kinase family Yes was co-precipitated with PDGFRα, and its pivotal role in the increased cell invasion of GD3-positive astrocytes was demonstrated by silencing with anti-Yes siRNA. Direct association between PDGFRα and GD3 was also shown, suggesting that GD3 forms ternary complex with PDGFRα and Yes. The fact that GD3, PDGFRα, and activated Yes were colocalized in lamellipodia and the edge of tumors in cultured cells and glioma tissues, respectively, suggests that GD3 induced by platelet-derived growth factor B enhances PDGF signals in glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts, leading to the promotion of malignant phenotypes such as cell proliferation and invasion in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2105458859,"The problem of drug shortages has been reported worldwide, gaining prominence in multiple domains and several countries in recent years. The aim of the study was to analyze, characterise and assess this problem in Belgium and France, while also adopting a wider perspective from the European Union. A qualitative methodological approach was employed, including semi-structured interviews with the representatives of respective national health authorities, pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers, as well as hospital and community pharmacists. The research was conducted in early 2014. Four themes, which were identified through the interviews, were addressed in the paper, i.e. a) defining drug shortages, b) their dynamics and perception, c) their determinants, d) the role of the European and national institutions in coping with the problem. Three groups of determinants of drug shortages were identified throughout this study: manufacturing problems, distribution and supply problems, and problems related to economic aspects. Currently, the Member States of the European Union are striving to resolve the problem very much on their own, although a far more focused and dedicated collaboration may well prove instrumental in coping with drug shortages throughout Europe more effectively. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to investigate the characteristics, key determinants, and the problem drivers of drug shortages, focusing on this particular group of countries, while also adopting the European Union's perspective."
https://openalex.org/W266903640,"Benthic cyanobacterial mats (BCMs) are impacting coral reefs worldwide. However, the factors and mechanisms driving their proliferation are unclear. We conducted a multi-year survey around the Caribbean island of Curaçao, which revealed highest BCM abundance on sheltered reefs close to urbanised areas. Reefs with high BCM abundance were also characterised by high benthic cover of macroalgae and low cover of corals. Nutrient concentrations in the water-column were consistently low, but markedly increased just above substrata (both sandy and hard) covered with BCMs. This was true for sites with both high and low BCM coverage, suggesting that BCM growth is stimulated by a localised, substrate-linked release of nutrients from the microbial degradation of organic matter. This hypothesis was supported by a higher organic content in sediments on reefs with high BCM coverage, and by an in situ experiment which showed that BCMs grew within days on sediments enriched with organic matter (Spirulina). We propose that nutrient runoff from urbanised areas stimulates phototrophic blooms and enhances organic matter concentrations on the reef. This organic matter is transported by currents and settles on the seabed at sites with low hydrodynamics. Subsequently, nutrients released from the organic matter degradation fuel the growth of BCMs. Improved management of nutrients generated on land should lower organic loading of sediments and other benthos (e.g. turf and macroalgae) to reduce BCM proliferation on coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W1563389132,"The yellow octocoral Eunicella cavolini is one of the most common gorgonians thriving in Mediterranean hard-bottom communities. However, information regarding its distribution and ecology in several parts of the Mediterranean is lacking, while population trends and conservation status remain largely unknown. We investigated 19 populations of E. cavolini over three representative geographic regions: the NW Mediterranean, CE Adriatic, and N Aegean. Focusing on the upper bathymetric range of the species (<40 m), data were collected on the populations' upper depth limit, density, colony height, and extent of injury. A three-level hierarchical sampling design was applied to assess the existence of spatial patterns, using: a) regions (located thousands of km apart), b) localities within regions (tens to hundreds of km apart), and c) sites within localities (hundreds of m to a few km apart). In the NW Mediterranean and CE Adriatic, the upper distribution limit was at depths ≤15 m, whereas in the N Aegean most populations were found deeper than 30 m. Population density ranged between 4.46-62 colonies per m2, while mean colony height was 15.6±8.9 SD cm with a maximum of 62 cm. The NW Mediterranean sites were characterized by dense populations dominated by small colonies (<20 cm), periodic recruitment, and low proportion of large gorgonians (>30 cm). The CE Adriatic displayed intermediate densities, with well-structured populations, and continuous recruitment. In the N Aegean, most populations presented low densities, high proportion of large colonies, but low number of small colonies, signifying limited recruitment. Disturbance levels, as a function of extent and type of injury, are discussed in relation to past or present human-induced threats. This work represents geographically the most wide ranging demographic study of a Mediterranean octocoral to date. The quantitative information obtained provides a basis for future monitoring at a Mediterranean scale."
https://openalex.org/W2199445414,"Transcutaneous electrical stimulation can depolarize nerve or muscle cells applying impulses through electrodes attached on the skin. For these applications, the electrode-skin impedance is an important factor which influences effectiveness. Various models describe the interface using constant or current-depending resistive-capacitive equivalent circuit. Here, we develop a dynamic impedance model valid for a wide range stimulation intensities. The model considers electroporation and charge-dependent effects to describe the impedance variation, which allows to describe high-charge pulses. The parameters were adjusted based on rectangular, biphasic stimulation pulses generated by a stimulator, providing optionally current or voltage-controlled impulses, and applied through electrodes of different sizes. Both control methods deliver a different electrical field to the tissue, which is constant throughout the impulse duration for current-controlled mode or have a very current peak for voltage-controlled. The results show a predominant dependence in the current intensity in the case of both stimulation techniques that allows to keep a simple model. A verification simulation using the proposed dynamic model shows coefficient of determination of around 0.99 in both stimulation types. The presented method for fitting electrode-skin impedance can be simple extended to other stimulation waveforms and electrode configuration. Therefore, it can be embedded in optimization algorithms for designing electrical stimulation applications even for pulses with high charges and high current spikes."
https://openalex.org/W248801103,"While healthcare costs for rotavirus gastroenteritis requiring hospitalization may be burdensome on households in Malaysia, exploration on the distribution and catastrophic impact of these expenses on households are lacking.We assessed the economic burden, levels and distribution of catastrophic healthcare expenditure, the poverty impact on households and inequities related to healthcare payments for acute gastroenteritis requiring hospitalization in Malaysia.A two-year prospective, hospital-based study was conducted from 2008 to 2010 in an urban (Kuala Lumpur) and rural (Kuala Terengganu) setting in Malaysia. All children under the age of 5 years admitted for acute gastroenteritis were included. Patients were screened for rotavirus and information on healthcare expenditure was obtained.Of the 658 stool samples collected at both centers, 248 (38%) were positive for rotavirus. Direct and indirect costs incurred were significantly higher in Kuala Lumpur compared with Kuala Terengganu (US$222 Vs. US$45; p<0.001). The mean direct and indirect costs for rotavirus gastroenteritis consisted 20% of monthly household income in Kuala Lumpur, as compared with only 5% in Kuala Terengganu. Direct medical costs paid out-of-pocket caused 141 (33%) households in Kuala Lumpur to experience catastrophic expenditure and 11 (3%) households to incur poverty. However in Kuala Terengganu, only one household (0.5%) experienced catastrophic healthcare expenditure and none were impoverished. The lowest income quintile in Kuala Lumpur was more likely to experience catastrophic payments compared to the highest quintile (87% vs 8%). The concentration index for out-of-pocket healthcare payments was closer to zero at Kuala Lumpur (0.03) than at Kuala Terengganu (0.24).While urban households were wealthier, healthcare expenditure due to gastroenteritis had more catastrophic and poverty impact on the urban poor. Universal rotavirus vaccination would reduce both disease burden and health inequities in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W261846688,"Curcumin has been shown to mitigate cancer phenotypes such as invasive migration, proliferation, and survival by disrupting numerous signaling pathways. Our previous studies showed that curcumin inhibits integrin β4 (ITG β4)-dependent migration by blocking interaction of this integrin with growth factor receptors in lipid rafts. In the current study, we investigated the possibility that curcumin inhibits ITG β4 palmitoylation, a post-translational modification required for its lipid raft localization and signaling activity. We found that the levels of ITG β4 palmitoylation correlated with the invasive potential of breast cancer cells, and that curcumin effectively reduced the levels of ITG β4 palmitoylation in invasive breast cancer cells. Through studies of ITG β4 palmitoylation kinetics, we concluded curcumin suppressed palmitoylation independent of growth factor-induced phosphorylation of key ITG β4 Ser and Tyr residues. Rather, curcumin blocked autoacylation of the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3 that is responsible for ITG β4 palmitoylation. Moreover, these data reveal that curcumin is able to prevent the palmitoylation of a subset of proteins, but not indiscriminately bind to and block all cysteines from modifications. Our studies reveal a novel paradigm for curcumin to account for much of its biological activity, and specifically, how it is able to suppress the signaling function of ITG β4 in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W423936964,"Expression of Caveolin-1 (Cav1), a key component of cell surface caveolae, is elevated in prostate cancer (PCa) and associated with PCa metastasis and a poor prognosis for PCa patients. Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor (PTRF)/cavin-1 is a cytoplasmic protein required for Cav1-dependent formation of caveolae. Expression of PTRF reduces the motility of PC3 cells, a metastatic prostate cancer cell line that endogenously expresses abundant Cav1 but no PTRF and no caveolae, suggesting a role for non-caveolar Cav1 domains, or Cav1 scaffolds, in PCa cell migration. Tyrosine phosphorylated Cav1 (pCav1) functions in concert with Galectin-3 (Gal3) and the galectin lattice to stabilize focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within focal adhesions (FAs) and promote cancer cell motility. However, whether PTRF regulation of Cav1 function in PCa cell migration is related to Gal3 expression and functionality has yet to be determined. Here we show that PTRF expression in PC3 cells reduces FAK stabilization in focal adhesions and reduces cell motility without affecting pCav1 levels. Exogenous Gal3 stabilized FAK in focal adhesions of PTRF-expressing cells and restored cell motility of PTRF-expressing PC3 cells to levels of PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an optimal concentration of 2 µg/ml. Exogenous Gal3 stabilized FAK in focal adhesions of Gal3 knockdown PC3 cells but not in Cav1 knockdown PC3 cells. Cav1 knockdown also prevented Gal3 rescue of FA-associated FAK stabilization in PTRF-expressing PC3 cells. Our data support a role for PTRF/cavin-1, through caveolae formation, as an attenuator of the non-caveolar functionality of Cav1 in Gal3-Cav1 signalling and regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W268758349,"Our previous study showed that chromium malate improved the regulation of blood glucose in mice with alloxan-induced diabetes. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of chromium malate on glycometabolism, glycometabolism-related enzymes and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats. Our results showed that fasting blood glucose, serum insulin level, insulin resistance index and C-peptide level in the high dose group had a significant downward trend when compared with the model group, chromium picolinate group and chromium trichloride group. The hepatic glycogen, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucokinase, Glut4, phosphor-AMPKβ1 and Akt levels in the high dose group were significantly higher than those of the model, chromium picolinate and chromium trichloride groups. Chromium malate in a high dose group can significantly increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol level while decreasing the total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with chromium picolinate and chromium trichloride. The serum chromium content in chromium malate and chromium picolinate group is significantly higher than that of the chromium trichloride group. The results indicated that the curative effects of chromium malate on glycometabolism, glycometabolism-related enzymes and lipid metabolism changes are better than those of chromium picolinate and chromium trichloride. Chromium malate contributes to glucose uptake and transport in order to improved glycometabolism and glycometabolism-related enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2150736824,"Electroporation-based treatments rely on increasing the permeability of the cell membrane by high voltage electric pulses applied to tissue via electrodes. To ensure that the whole tumor is covered with sufficiently high electric field, accurate numerical models are built based on individual patient anatomy. Extraction of patient's anatomy through segmentation of medical images inevitably produces some errors. In order to ensure the robustness of treatment planning, it is necessary to evaluate the potential effect of such errors on the electric field distribution. In this work we focus on determining the effect of errors in automatic segmentation of hepatic vessels on the electric field distribution in electroporation-based treatments in the liver. First, a numerical analysis was performed on a simple 'sphere and cylinder' model for tumors and vessels of different sizes and relative positions. Second, an analysis of two models extracted from medical images of real patients in which we introduced variations of an error of the automatic vessel segmentation method was performed. The results obtained from a simple model indicate that ignoring the vessels when calculating the electric field distribution can cause insufficient coverage of the tumor with electric fields. Results of this study indicate that this effect happens for small (10 mm) and medium-sized (30 mm) tumors, especially in the absence of a central electrode inserted in the tumor. The results obtained from the real-case models also show higher negative impact of automatic vessel segmentation errors on the electric field distribution when the central electrode is absent. However, the average error of the automatic vessel segmentation did not have an impact on the electric field distribution if the central electrode was present. This suggests the algorithm is robust enough to be used in creating a model for treatment parameter optimization, but with a central electrode."
https://openalex.org/W1618426011,"Bacterial flagellin triggers inflammatory responses. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulate the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that are induced by extrinsic antigens, but the function of mTORC1 in flagellin-induced inflammatory response is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the role and the mechanism of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in flagellin-induced cytokine expression in mouse macrophages. We observed that flagellin upregulated TNF-α time- and dose-dependently. Flagellin stimulated rapid (<15 min) PI3K/Akt/mTOR phosphorylation that was mediated by TLR5. Inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 and wortmannin, and of mTORC1 with rapamycin decreased flagellin-induced TNF-α and IL-6 expression and cell proliferation. The activation of NF-κB p65 and STAT3 was regulated by mTORC1 via degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to flagellin, respectively. Thus, the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway regulates the innate immune response to bacterial flagellin. Rapamycin is potential therapy that can regulate host defense against pathogenic infections."
https://openalex.org/W344031042,"The relative importance of risk factor reduction in healthy people (primary prevention) versus that in patients with coronary heart disease (secondary prevention) has been debated. We aimed to quantify the contribution of the two.We used the previously validated IMPACT model to estimate contributions from primary prevention (reducing risk factors in the population, particularly smoking, cholesterol and systolic blood pressure) and from secondary prevention (reducing risk factors in coronary heart disease patients) in the Swedish population.Between 1986 and 2002, about 8,690 fewer deaths were related to changes in the three major risk factors. Population cholesterol fell by 0.64 mmol/L, with approximately 5,210 fewer deaths attributable to diet changes (4,470 in healthy people740 in patients.) plus 810 to statin treatment (200 in healthy people, 610 in patients). Overall smoking prevalence decreased by 10.3%, resulting in 1,195 fewer deaths, attributable to smoking cessation (595 in healthy people, 600 in patients). Mean population systolic blood pressure fell by 2.6 mmHg, resulting in 900 fewer deaths (865 in healthy people, 35 in patients), plus 575 fewer deaths attributable to antihypertensive medication in healthy people. The majority of falls in deaths attributable to risk factors occurred in people without known heart disease: 6,705 fewer deaths compared with 1,985 fewer deaths in patients (secondary prevention), emphasizing the importance of promoting health interventions in the general population.The largest effects on mortality came from primary prevention, giving markedly larger mortality reductions than secondary prevention."
https://openalex.org/W334114548,"During late summer and early autumn, temperate bats migrate from their summering sites to swarming sites, where mating likely occurs. However, the extent to which individuals of a single summering site migrate to the same swarming site, and vice versa, is not known. We examined the migratory connectivity between summering and swarming sites in two temperate, North American, bat species, the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis). Using mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers, we examined population structuring within and among summering and swarming sites. Both species exhibited moderate degrees of mitochondrial DNA differentiation (little brown bat: FST(SUMMER) = 0.093, FST(SWARMING) = 0.052; northern long-eared bat: FST(SUMMER) = 0.117, FST(SWARMING) = 0.043) and little microsatellite DNA differentiation among summering and among swarming sites[corrected]. Haplotype diversity was significantly higher at swarming sites than summering sites, supporting the idea that swarming sites are comprised of individuals from various summering sites. Further, pairwise analyses suggest that swarming sites are not necessarily comprised of only individuals from the most proximal summering colonies."
https://openalex.org/W1583000718,"Beliefs about the state of the world are an important influence on both normal behavior and psychopathology. However, understanding of the neural basis of belief processing remains incomplete, and several aspects of belief processing have only recently been explored. Specifically, different types of beliefs may involve fundamentally different inferential processes and thus recruit distinct brain regions. Additionally, neural processing of truth and falsity may differ from processing of certainty and uncertainty. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neural underpinnings of assessment of testable and non-testable propositions in terms of truth or falsity and the level of certainty in a belief. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study 14 adults while they rated propositions as true or false and also rated the level of certainty in their judgments. Each proposition was classified as testable or non-testable. Testable propositions activated the DLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex, while non-testable statements activated areas including inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and an anterior region of the superior frontal gyrus. No areas were more active when a proposition was accepted, while the dorsal anterior cingulate was activated when a proposition was rejected. Regardless of whether a proposition was testable or not, certainty that the proposition was true or false activated a common network of regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, caudate, posterior cingulate, and a region of middle temporal gyrus near the temporo-parietal junction. Certainty in the truth or falsity of a non-testable proposition (a strong belief without empirical evidence) activated the insula. The results suggest that different brain regions contribute to the assessment of propositions based on the type of content, while a common network may mediate the influence of beliefs on motivation and behavior based on the level of certainty in the belief."
https://openalex.org/W437171863,"Objective The aim of this study was to examine the influence of various time intervals on the composition of the supragingival plaque microbiome, especially the dynamic core microbiome, and to find a suitable observation interval for further studies on oral microbiota. Methods and Materials Eight qualified volunteers whose respective age ranges from 25 to 28 years participated in the present study. The supragingival plaque was collected from the buccogingival surface of the maxillary first molar at eight time slots with different intervals (day 0, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months). Bioinformatic analyses was performed based on 16S rDNA pyrosequencing (454 sequencing platform) targeting at the hypervariable V4–V5 region, in order to assess the diversity and variation of the supragingival plaque microbiome. Results A total of 359,565 qualified reads for 64 samples were generated for subsequent analyses, which represents 8,452 operational taxonomic units identified at 3% dissimilarity. The dynamic core microbiome detected in the current study included five phyla, 12 genera and 13 species. At the genus level, the relative abundance of bacterial communities under the “1 day,” “1 month,” and “3 months” intervals was clustered into sub-category. At the species level, the number of overlapping species remained stable between the “1 month” and “3 months” intervals, whereas the number of dynamic core species became stable within only 1 week. Conclusions This study emphasized the impact of different time intervals (days, weeks and months) on the composition, commonality and diversity of the supragingival microbiome. The analyses found that for various types of studies, the time interval of a month is more suitable for observing the general composition of the supragingival microbiome, and that a week is better for observing the dynamic core microbiome."

In this report, we identified DP1 as a direct interacting factor for Kbtbd5 using a yeast two-hybrid screen and in vitro binding assays. Our studies demonstrate that Kbtbd5 interacts and regulates the cytoplasmic localization of DP1. GST pulldown assays demonstrate that the dimerization domain of DP1 interacts with all three of the Kbtbd5 domains. We further show that Kbtbd5 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of DP1, thereby inhibiting E2F1-DP1 activity. To investigate the in vivo function of Kbtbd5, we used gene disruption technology and engineered Kbtbd5 null mice. Targeted deletion of Kbtbd5 resulted in postnatal lethality. Histological studies reveal that the Kbtbd5 null mice have smaller muscle fibers, a disorganized sarcomeric structure, increased extracellular matrix, and decreased numbers of mitochondria compared with wild-type controls. RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analyses demonstrate the up-regulation of E2F1 target apoptotic genes (Bnip3 and p53inp1) in Kbtbd5 null skeletal muscle. Consistent with these observations, the cellular apoptosis in Kbtbd5 null mice was increased. Breeding of Kbtbd5 null mouse into the E2F1 null background rescues the lethal phenotype of the Kbtbd5 null mice but not the growth defect. The expression of Bnip3 and p53inp1 in Kbtbd5 mutant skeletal muscle are also restored to control levels in the E2F1 null background. In summary, our studies demonstrate that Kbtbd5 regulates skeletal muscle myogenesis through the regulation of E2F1-DP1 activity.

The first Kelch protein (Kel) was identified as a regulator of cytoplasmic flow between cells in the ring canal of Drosophila (1.Xue F. Cooley L. Kelch encodes a component of intercellular bridges in Drosophila egg chambers.Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Kelch proteins are usually composed of three domains, termed the BTB (BRC, ttk, and bab), BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch), and Kelch domains (2.Prag S. Adams J.C. Molecular phylogeny of the kelch-repeat superfamily reveals an expansion of BTB/kelch proteins in animals.BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The BTB domain functions as the protein-protein interaction domain for dimer formation and the interaction with a coactivator or corepressor or in the recruitment of the Cul3 complex (3.Perez-Torrado R. Yamada D. Defossez P.A. Born to bind: the BTB protein-protein interaction domain.BioEssays. 2006; 28: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The BACK domain is named on the basis of its location between the BTB and Kelch domains. However, its function has not been defined (4.Stogios P.J. Privé G.G. The BACK domain in BTB-kelch proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 634-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Kelch domain usually consists of two to seven repeats, with each repeat forming the structure of β strands and serving as the protein-interacting surface (5.Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. The kelch repeat superfamily of proteins: propellers of cell function.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). A number of Kelch proteins have been identified (6.Dhanoa B.S. Cogliati T. Satish A.G. Bruford E.A. Friedman J.S. Update on the Kelch-like (KLHL) gene family.Hum.

Muscle. 2014; 4: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and can be classified into three subfamilies on the basis of their domains: the Kelch-like (KLHL) subfamily, containing all of the BTB, BACK, and Kelch domains; the Kelch repeat and BTB domain containing protein (KBTBD) subfamily, containing BTB and Kelch domains (and, possibly, a BACK domain); and the Kelch domain containing protein (KLHDC) subfamily, which contains only the Kelch domain (7.Gupta V.A. Beggs A.H. Kelch proteins: emerging roles in skeletal muscle development and diseases.Skelet. Muscle. 2014; 4: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Kelch proteins have diverse regulatory roles in cellular function, such as B cell signaling, cell morphology, cell cycle, oxidative and electrophilic stress response, and skeletal muscle myogenesis (5.Adams J.

Extensive biochemical studies have revealed that Kelch proteins function as the adaptors of Cul3 E3 ligase to recognize a broad range of substrates, thereby regulating multiple cellular processes (9.Pintard L. Willis J.H. Willems A. Johnson J.L. Srayko M. Kurz T. Glaser S. Mains P.E. Tyers M. Bowerman B. Peter M.

For example, Klhl12 targets Dsh for ubiquitination and negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling (11.Angers S. Thorpe C.J. Biechele T.L. Goldenberg S.J. Zheng N. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T.

Perdue S.A. Baas P.W. Singer J.D. The Cul3/Klhdc5 E3 ligase regulates p60/katanin and is required for normal mitosis in mammalian cells.J. Biol.

Activation of E2F transcription factors is the central event in cell cycle progression (13.Rowland B.D. Bernards R.

The E2F transcriptional network: old acquaintances with new faces.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2810-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). E2F factors regulate the expression of genes that are essential for cell division, such as cell cycle regulators (including cyclin E, cyclin A, Cdc2, Cdc25A, c-myc, pRb, and E2F1), enzymes involved in nuclear biosynthesis, and the main components of the DNA replication machinery (15.Lavia P.

There are eight members in the E2F subfamily and three members in the DP subfamily. E2F factors are further divided into two groups: the typical group that consists of activator E2Fs (E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3) and repressor E2Fs (E2F4, E2F5, and E2F6) and the atypical E2F7 and E2F8 (17.Trimarchi J.M.

Atypical E2Fs: new players in the E2F transcription factor family.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The typical E2Fs (E2F1-E2F6) bind DNA by heterodimerizing with the DP subfamily, which is composed of DP1 and DP2 (18.Lammens T. Li J. Leone G. De Veylder L. Atypical E2Fs: new players in the E2F transcription factor family.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). E2F1 is localized in the nuclear compartment, whereas DP1 shuttles between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments and translocates into the nucleus when it binds E2F1 as a heterodimer (19.Magae J.

In addition, gene targeting studies revealed that Kbtbd5 was essential for postnatal survival, and the lethality of the Kbtbd5 null mouse was rescued in the E2F1 null background.

All other plasmids and their mutant constructs were cloned by PCR and then verified by DNA sequence analysis. The raw RNAseq data were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using TopHat (version 2.0.11) with default parameters (36.Trapnell C. Pachter L. Salzberg S.L. TopHat: discovering splice junctions with RNA-Seq.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar), yielding an average of ∼50 million mappable paired reads per sample. The expected counts of each gene were estimated by Cufflink pipeline, followed by differential expression analysis through edgeR (37.Trapnell C. Roberts A. Goff L. Pertea G. Kim D. Kelley D.R.

C2C12 myoblasts and NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in the incubator with 5% CO2 and transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or FuGENE HD (Roche), respectively. The total amount of DNA was normalized with the vector DNA. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for luciferase assays as outlined in the manual of the manufacturer of the Dual-Luciferase system (Promega). A pGBKT7 vector-Kbtbd5 construct was used to screen a skeletal muscle cDNA library as outlined in our previous report (40.Meeson A.P. Shi X. Alexander M.S. Williams R.S. Allen R.E. Jiang N.

Sox15 and Fhl3 transcriptionally coactivate Foxk1 and regulate myogenic progenitor cells.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed as described in our previous studies using the following antibodies: anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Sigma Aldrich), anti-tubulin (Sigma Aldrich), and anti-ubiquitin (BD Biosciences) sera (41.Shi X. Bowlin K.M. Garry D.J. Fhl2 interacts with Foxk1 and corepresses Foxo4 activity in myogenic progenitors.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5% of the total lysate as the input was utilized for Western blot analysis to examine protein overexpression. Then the total lysate was incubated with anti-HA or anti-Myc sera for immunoprecipitation. The total immunoprecipitation complex was analyzed in the SDS-PAGE gel and then immunoblotted with anti-Myc or anti-HA, respectively. In vitro protein synthesis was performed by TnT Quick systems (Promega) in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine. The 35S-labeled Kbtbd5 deletional proteins were first examined with SDS-PAGE gel as the input. GST-DP1 (199–350) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, extracted with B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce Biochemicals), and then purified with glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare). The in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with the GST-DP1 (199–350) fusion protein bound to Sepharose beads, washed, and resuspended in sample loading buffer. Note that the GST control was performed at the same time as the GST pulldown assays to evaluate the Kbtbd5 deletional proteins. The pulldown proteins were analyzed using a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel and imaged using Typhoon 2000 (41.Shi X. Bowlin K.M. Garry D.J. Fhl2 interacts with Foxk1 and corepresses Foxo4 activity in myogenic progenitors.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining, LacZ staining, and H&E staining were performed as described previously (39.Shi X. Richard J. Zirbes K.M. Gong W. Lin G. Kyba M. Thomson J.A. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Garry D.J.

Neonatal skeletal muscle was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to sectioning. A TUNEL assay was performed with a DeadEnd colorimetric TUNEL system (Promega) according to the directions outlined in the user manual. Briefly, the tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and permeabilized with protease K buffer before incubation with the TdT reaction mixture. The slides were treated with 2× SSC buffer, 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and then incubated with streptavidin HPR reaction buffer. The sections were imaged with an Zeiss Axio Imager M1 upright microscope equipped with Zen software (39.Shi X. Richard J. Zirbes K.M. Gong W. Lin G. Kyba M. Thomson J.A. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Garry D.J.

For DP1 ubiquitination in vivo, C2C12 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for HA-ubiquitin, Myc-DP1, and FLAG-Kbtbd5 or the vector as a control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 0.01 mm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 5 h before lysis with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplied with protease inhibitor (Roche) and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (EMD). The protein extract was incubated with a Myc antibody conjugated with agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by three washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The final immunoprecipitation complex was resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed using 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE. DP1 ubiquitination was detected using a 3F10 antibody directed against the HA epitope (Roche). To construct the targeting vector, a 9.07-kb region of the Kbtbd5 gene was subcloned from a BAC clone (RP23 103H3). The region was designed so that the short homologous arm extended 2.34 kb 3′ to exon 1. The long homologous arm ended at the 5′ side of exon 1 and was 5.58 kb long. The LacZ/Neo cassette was used to replace 1150 bp of the coding region for exon 1. The targeting vector was confirmed using restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequence analysis. The targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into C57BL/5 × 129/SvEv hybrid ES cells using standard techniques (43.Garry D.J. Meeson A. Elterman J. Zhao Y. Yang P. Bassel-Duby R.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5416-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After G418 antibiotic selection, the surviving clones were expanded and screened for correct integration by PCR. Clone 114 was expanded and microinjected into C57BL/6J mouse blastocysts. The 100% chimeras were bred with C57BL/6N wild-type female mice (The Jackson Laboratory), and the offspring was genotyped using a PCR strategy. Mice (#144 and #145) were confirmed as having a heterozygous genotype. Those heterozygous mice were then bred to EIIA-Cre to remove the floxed Neo cassette. The resulting chimeric mice were bred for germ line transmission. These heterozygous mice carrying the LacZ/Neo cassette were bred to EIIA-Cre mice to remove the neomycin cassette. All mice were maintained at the University of Minnesota using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Research Animal Resources. All data represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three replicates. Statistical significance analysis was carried out using Student's t test (p < 0.05). Our previous study revealed that Kbtbd5 had an important role in skeletal muscle myogenesis because the knockdown of Kbtbd5 resulted in the perturbation of myogenic differentiation (27.Bowlin K.M. Embree L.J. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. Shi X. Kbtbd5 is regulated by MyoD and restricted to the myogenic lineage.Differentiation. 2013; 86: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To identify potential Kbtbd5-interacting proteins, we screened a skeletal muscle cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system (44.Fields S. Song O. A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions.Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). A number of clones were isolated from this screen, and these genes were classed into two major categories: cytoskeletal structure and transcriptional regulation (Fig. 1A). The high abundance of Nebulin-related anchoring protein (NRAP) and Myoz1 in the screen suggested that Kbtbd5 might be involved in the cytoskeletal regulation because both NRAP and Myoz1 have been reported in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure (45.Dhume A.

Gatad2b has been reported as a component of the Mi-1·NuRD repression complex involved in chromatin remodeling (47.Brackertz M. Gong Z. Leers J.

Previous studies have reported the functional role of Sertad1 in the regulation of the cell cycle, which led us to evaluate the protein-protein interaction between Kbtbd5 and Sertad1 because cell cycle regulation is coordinated with muscle differentiation (25.Sugimoto M.

Both Myc-Sertad1 and HA-Kbtbd5 were overexpressed in C2C12 cells.

However, we could not detect their direct interaction using in vitro binding assays (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicated that there was/were additional protein(s) that served as a bridge between Sertad1 and Kbtbd5. Both Cdk4 and DP1 have been reported as Sertad1-interacting proteins (25.Sugimoto M. Nakamura T. Ohtani N. Hampson L. Hampson I.N. Shimamoto A. Furuichi Y. Okumura K. Niwa S. Taya Y. Hara E.

It has been hypothesized that this form of ""unconscious"" neural plasticity is mediated by an endogenous reward mechanism triggered by the correct task performance. Although this result has challenged the mandatory role of attention in perceptual learning, no direct evidence exists of the hypothesized link between target recognition, reward and TIPL. Here, we manipulated the reward value associated with a target to demonstrate the involvement of reinforcement mechanisms in sensory plasticity for invisible inputs. Participants were trained in a central task associated with either high or low monetary incentives, provided only at the end of the experiment, while subliminal stimuli were presented peripherally. Our results showed that high incentive-value targets induced a greater degree of perceptual improvement for the subliminal stimuli, supporting the role of reinforcement mechanisms in TIPL."
https://openalex.org/W1887583985,"Stimulus encoding by primary sensory brain areas provides a data-rich context for understanding their circuit mechanisms. The vertebrate olfactory bulb is an input area having unusual two-layer dendro-dendritic connections whose roles in odor coding are unclear. To clarify these roles, we built a detailed compartmental model of the rat olfactory bulb that synthesizes a much wider range of experimental observations on bulbar physiology and response dynamics than has hitherto been modeled. We predict that superficial-layer inhibitory interneurons (periglomerular cells) linearize the input-output transformation of the principal neurons (mitral cells), unlike previous models of contrast enhancement. The linearization is required to replicate observed linear summation of mitral odor responses. Further, in our model, action-potentials back-propagate along lateral dendrites of mitral cells and activate deep-layer inhibitory interneurons (granule cells). Using this, we propose sparse, long-range inhibition between mitral cells, mediated by granule cells, to explain how the respiratory phases of odor responses of sister mitral cells can be sometimes decorrelated as observed, despite receiving similar receptor input. We also rule out some alternative mechanisms. In our mechanism, we predict that a few distant mitral cells receiving input from different receptors, inhibit sister mitral cells differentially, by activating disjoint subsets of granule cells. This differential inhibition is strong enough to decorrelate their firing rate phases, and not merely modulate their spike timing. Thus our well-constrained model suggests novel computational roles for the two most numerous classes of interneurons in the bulb."
https://openalex.org/W288924380,"Polydatin, a natural component from Polygonum Cuspidatum, has important therapeutic effects on metabolic syndrome. A novel therapeutic strategy using polydatin to improve vascular function has recently been proposed to treat diabetes-related cardiovascular complications. However, the biological role and molecular basis of polydatin’s action on vascular endothelial cells (VECs)-mediated vasodilatation under diabetes-related hyperglycemia condition remain elusive. The present study aimed to assess the contribution of polydatin in restoring endothelium-dependent relaxation and to determine the details of its underlying mechanism. By measuring endothelium-dependent relaxation, we found that acetylcholine-induced vasodilation was impaired by elevated glucose (55 mmol/L); however, polydatin (1, 3, 10 μmol/L) could restore the relaxation in a dose-dependent manner. Polydatin could also improve the histological damage to endothelial cells in the thoracic aorta. Polydatin’s effects were mediated via promoting the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), enhancing eNOS activity and decreasing the inducible NOS (iNOS) level, finally resulting in a beneficial increase in NO release, which probably, at least in part, through activation of the PPARβ signaling pathway. The results provided a novel insight into polydatin action, via PPARβ-NO signaling pathways, in restoring endothelial function in high glucose conditions. The results also indicated the potential utility of polydatin to treat diabetes related cardiovascular diseases."

Human behavior feature analysis has evolved from traditional 2D features to 3D features. In order to improve the performance of human activity recognition, a human behavior recognition method is proposed, which is based on a hybrid texture-edge local pattern coding feature extraction and integration of RGB and depth videos information. The paper mainly focuses on background subtraction on RGB and depth video sequences of behaviors, extracting and integrating historical images of the behavior outlines, feature extraction and classification. The new method of 3D human behavior recognition has achieved the rapid and efficient recognition of behavior videos. A large number of experiments show that the proposed method has faster speed and higher recognition rate. The recognition method has good robustness for different environmental colors, lightings and other factors. Meanwhile, the feature of mixed texture-edge uniform local binary pattern can be used in most 3D behavior recognition."

Effective antibiotic treatment of inhalational anthrax requires early diagnosis; the further the disease has progressed, the less the likelihood for cure. Current means for diagnosis such as blood culture require several days to a result and require advanced laboratory infrastructure. An alternative approach to diagnosis is detection of a Bacillus anthracis antigen that is shed into blood and can be detected by rapid immunoassay. The goal of the study was to evaluate detection of poly-γ-D-glutamic acid (PGA), the capsular antigen of B. anthracis, as a biomarker surrogate for blood culture in a rabbit model of inhalational anthrax. The mean time to a positive blood culture was 26 ± 5.7 h (mean ± standard deviation), whereas the mean time to a positive ELISA was 22 ± 4.2 h; P = 0.005 in comparison with blood culture. A lateral flow immunoassay was constructed for detection of PGA in plasma at concentrations of less than 1 ng PGA/ml. Use of the lateral flow immunoassay for detection of PGA in the rabbit model found that antigen was detected somewhat earlier than the earliest time point at which the blood culture became positive. The low cost, ease of use, and rapid time to result of the lateral flow immunoassay format make an immunoassay for PGA a viable surrogate for blood culture for detection of infection in individuals who have a likelihood of exposure to B. anthracis."

Participants were randomised to the intervention, comprising geriatrician assessment in acute units and further specialist management, or to control where patients received no additional intervention over and above standard care. Primary outcome was incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.We undertook cost-effectiveness analysis for 417 patients (intervention: 205). The difference in mean adjusted QALYs gained between groups at 3 months was -0.001 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.009, 0.007).

https://openalex.org/W1597386173,"We consider adaptive robust methods for lung cancer that are also dose-reactive, wherein the treatment is modified after each treatment session to account for the dose delivered in prior treatment sessions. Such methods are of interest because they potentially allow for errors in the delivered dose to be corrected as the treatment progresses, thereby ensuring that the tumor receives a sufficient dose at the end of the treatment. We show through a computational study with real lung cancer patient data that while dose reaction is beneficial with respect to the final dose distribution, it may lead to exaggerated daily underdose and overdose relative to non-reactive methods that grows as the treatment progresses. However, by combining dose reaction with a mechanism for updating an estimate of the uncertainty, the magnitude of this growth can be mitigated substantially. The key finding of this paper is that reacting to dose errors - an adaptation strategy that is both simple and intuitively appealing - may backfire and lead to treatments that are clinically unacceptable."

Target outcomes were determinants of troponin release, early graft failure (EGF), acute kidney injury (AKI) and operative death.Mean cTnI release measured 24 hours after transplant was 10.9±11.6 μg/L. Overall hospital mortality was 10.8%, EGF 10.5%, and AKI was 12.2%. cTnI release>10 μg/L proved an independent predictor of EGF (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.06-4.6) and AKI (OR 1.031; 95% CI, 1.001-1.064). EGF, in turn, proved a determinant of hospital mortality. Risk factors for cTnI>10 μg/L release were: status 2B (OR 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18-0.69, protective), duration of the ischemic period (OR 1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.011), previous cardiac operation (OR 2.9; 95% CI, 1.67-5.0), and left ventricular hypertrophy (OR 3.3; 95% CI, 1.9-5.6).Myocardial enzyme leakage clearly emerged as an epiphenomenon of more complicated clinical course. The complex interplay between surgical procedure features, graft characteristics and recipient end-organ function highlights cTnI release as a risk marker of graft failure and acute kidney injury.

https://openalex.org/W325745060,"In most living organisms, isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) convert isocitrate into ɑ-ketoglutarate (ɑ-KG). Phylogenetic analyses divide the IDH protein family into two subgroups: types I and II. Based on cofactor usage, IDHs are either NAD+-specific (NAD-IDH) or NADP+-specific (NADP-IDH); NADP-IDH evolved from NAD-IDH. Type I IDHs include NAD-IDHs and NADP-IDHs; however, no type II NAD-IDHs have been reported to date. This study reports a novel type II NAD-IDH from the marine bacterium Congregibacter litoralis KT71 (ClIDH, GenBank accession no. EAQ96042). His-tagged recombinant ClIDH was produced in Escherichia coli and purified; the recombinant enzyme was NAD+-specific and showed no detectable activity with NADP+. The Km values of the enzyme for NAD+ were 262.6±7.4 μM or 309.1±11.2 μM with Mg2+ or Mn2+ as the divalent cation, respectively. The coenzyme specificity of a ClIDH Asp487Arg/Leu488His mutant was altered, and the preference of the mutant for NADP+ was approximately 24-fold higher than that for NAD+, suggesting that ClIDH is an NAD+-specific ancestral enzyme in the type II IDH subgroup. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses revealed the homohexameric structure of ClIDH, which is the first IDH hexamer discovered thus far. A 163-amino acid segment of CIIDH is essential to maintain its polymerization structure and activity, as a truncated version lacking this region forms a non-functional monomer. ClIDH was dependent on divalent cations, the most effective being Mn2+. The maximal activity of purified recombinant ClIDH was achieved at 35°C and pH 7.5, and a heat inactivation experiment showed that a 20-min incubation at 33°C caused a 50% loss of ClIDH activity. The discovery of a NAD+-specific, type II IDH fills a gap in the current classification of IDHs, and sheds light on the evolution of type II IDHs."

Par14 is found mainly inside the nucleus and has been associated with cell cycle progression and chromatin remodeling (18Surmacz T.A. Bayer E. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. Bayer P.

The residues mainly involved in the substrate interaction (i.e. Met-90, Val-91, and Phe-94, which are identical to Met-115, Val-116, and Phe-119 in Par17) are located in the loop connecting the second β-strand with the last helix. Besides the PPIase domain, Par14 possesses a lysine- and glycine-rich segment at the N terminus, which seems to be important for nuclear localization and DNA binding (17Sekerina E. Rahfeld J.U.

Although Par17 is also able to bind DNA, it is located mainly in the cytoplasm, where it is found in the mitochondrial matrix or colocalized with microtubules (12Kessler D. Papatheodorou P. Stratmann T. Dian E.A. Hartmann-Fatu C. Rassow J. Bayer P. Mueller J.W. The DNA binding parvulin Par17 is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by a recently evolved prepeptide uniquely present in Hominidae.BMC Biol. 2007; 5: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Thiele A.

It was, therefore, suggested that the 25 residues composing the N-terminal elongation in Par17 compared with Par14 (i) may be masking the nuclear localization signal of the Par14 N terminus (21Reimer T. Weiwad M. Schierhorn A. Ruecknagel P.K. Rahfeld J.U. Bayer P. Fischer G. Phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain regulates subcellular localization and DNA binding properties of the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase hPar14.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and (ii) could furthermore function as a novel mitochondrial targeting signal (12Kessler D. Papatheodorou P. Stratmann T. Dian E.A. Hartmann-Fatu C. Rassow J. Bayer P. Mueller J.W. The DNA binding parvulin Par17 is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by a recently evolved prepeptide uniquely present in Hominidae.BMC Biol. 2007; 5: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that Par17 catalyzes tubulin polymerization in a GTP-dependent manner (20Thiele A. Krentzlin K. Erdmann F. Rauh D. Hause G. Zerweck J. Kilka S. Pösel S. Fischer G. Schutkowski M. Weiwad M. Parvulin 17 promotes microtubule assembly by its peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 896-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Tubulin heterodimers form long cylindrical structures called microtubules, one of the main components of the cytoskeleton (22Downing K.H. Nogales E. Tubulin and microtubule structure.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The polymerization process of microtubules is highly regulated, as these dynamic structures change in response to different stimuli. Two tubulin-binding sites were identified in Par17 (20Thiele A. Krentzlin K. Erdmann F. Rauh D. Hause G. Zerweck J. Kilka S. Pösel S. Fischer G. Schutkowski M. Weiwad M. Parvulin 17 promotes microtubule assembly by its peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 896-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar): (i) the amphipathic α-helix defined by the segment Lys-75 to Lys-84, and (ii) the segment Gln-103–Pro-118 located near the putative active site, which includes residues Leu-107 and Met-115 that constitute a part of the substrate binding pocket in the Par14 homolog. Par17-induced microtubule assembly seems to depend on the isomerase activity in the active site of Par17, yet it is 2.5-fold more efficient than Par14. Therefore, the N-terminal elongation of Par17 may represent just one component of a more complex tubulin interaction scenario or it merely accelerates the reaction. Tubulin polymerization is promoted by proteins called microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which interact with the C-terminal tubulin domain and induce microtubule stabilization (23Maccioni R.B. Cambiazo V. Role of microtubule-associated proteins in the control of microtubule assembly.Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 835-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Microtubule assembly is subsequently regulated by calcium-loaded calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) via direct binding to MAPs (24Lee Y.C. Wolff J. Calmodulin binds to both microtubule-associated protein 2 and tau proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1226-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Padilla R. Maccioni R.B. Avila J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 24910-24922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Calmodulin (CaM) is a relatively small calcium-binding protein involved in many signaling pathways that regulate a large number of crucial cellular processes (27Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The CaM structure consists of two globular lobes connected by a flexible linker (28Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E.

Backbone dynamics of calmodulin studied by nitrogen-15 relaxation using inverse detected two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy: the central helix is flexible.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Each lobe is able to bind two calcium (Ca2+) ions, which results in a change of the lobe structure (30Potter J.D. Strang-Brown P. Walker P.L. Iida S. Ca2+ binding to calmodulin.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lopez C. Kilhoffer M. Makarov A. Briand C. Haiech J. Thermodynamic analysis of calcium and magnesium binding to calmodulin.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both in the Ca2+-free and the Ca2+-bound state, CaM is able to interact with a plethora of other proteins (9Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Apocalmodulin.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 32Vetter S.W. Leclerc E. Novel aspects of calmodulin target recognition and activation.Eur. J.

Calmodulin's flexibility allows for promiscuity in its interactions with target proteins and peptides.Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 27: 33-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of all the CaM complexes reported to date, the structure of CaM bound to the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK), where the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM both wrap around a helical segment of smMLCK to form a globular complex (34Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Target enzyme recognition by calmodulin: 2.4 Å structure of a calmodulin-peptide complex.Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), turned out to be of particular relevance for the Par17-Ca2+/CaM interaction. In the present work we investigated the structure and function of the 25-residue elongation at the Par17 N terminus to further elucidate the features responsible for the functional differences to Par14. Based on our results, we could (i) demonstrate that Par17 is able to interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, thus preventing microtubule assembly, (ii) identify a Ca2+/CaM-binding site at the 25-residue elongation of the Par17 N terminus, and (iii) propose that the structure of the Par17-Ca2+/CaM complex resembles the one of CaM bound to smMLCK. Hence, a Ca2+-mediated regulation of microtubule assembly via Ca2+/CaM and Par17 may be envisioned. Par17, GST-Par14, GST-Par17, and His6-CaM were expressed and purified as reported previously (20Thiele A. Krentzlin K. Erdmann F. Rauh D. Hause G. Zerweck J. Kilka S. Pösel S. Fischer G.

Par172–22 peptide was generated by solid-phase synthesis as previously described (37Maestre-Martínez M. Haupt K. Edlich F. Jahreis G. Jarczowski F. Erdmann F. Fischer G. Lücke C. New structural aspects of FKBP38 activation.Biol. Chem. 2010; 391: 1157-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length Par17 and the Par172–22 peptide each were produced as the Gln-16/Arg-18 isoform. Bovine brain tubulin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver). smMLCK797–813 was obtained from Merck Biosciences (Calbiochem). Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using the program ClustalW (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Potential CaM-binding sites were identified using the online server “CaM target database.” Helix properties were predicted employing the online server “heliquest” (39Gautier R. Douguet D. Antonny B. Drin G. HELIQUEST: a web server to screen sequences with specific α-helical properties.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2101-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The ProtoArray® Human Protein Microarray v5.0 from Invitrogen was used to identify new binding partners of Par17. This microarray contains 9000 human GST-tagged proteins expressed in Sf9 insect cells and spotted in duplicate on the nitrocellulose-coated glass slide. ProtoArray® was used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, the slides were equilibrated for 15 min at 4 °C and then blocked for 1 h on ice by incubating with 1% BSA and 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.08% Triton X-100, 25% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. Next, the buffer was removed, and 1 μm Par17 diluted in PBS buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 was spread carefully on the array and capped with a coverslip. After 90 min of incubation on ice, the cover was carefully removed, and the protein arrays were rinsed 5 times for 10 min each in PBS buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. After washing, the slides were incubated with rabbit anti-Par14/17 antibody (pab productions, Herbertshausen, Germany; diluted 1:1000) for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, the slides were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Invitrogen; diluted 1:2000 in sample buffer) for 90 min at 4 °C under slow agitation in the dark. The protein arrays were washed 5 times with PBS buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 and dried by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. Slides were scanned on a ScanArray 5000 (Packard BioChip Technologies, Billerica, MA) to produce red (Alexa Fluor 647) images. The Genepix Pro 6.0 image analysis software (Axon Laboratories) was employed for data quantification. Equal amounts (20 μg) of GST-Par14, GST-Par17, GST-Par171–25, and GST were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Excess protein was removed by extensive washing. Then, glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 20 μg of CaM in 60 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3% BSA, and either 5 mm EGTA or 0.5 mm CaCl2). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, unbound protein was removed by 3 washes with incubation buffer. Interacting proteins were eluted by boiling with sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the proteins were visualized by silver staining. The tubulin polymerization assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (tubulin polymerization assay kit; Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO). In brief, bovine brain tubulin (>99% purity) was resuspended in G-PEM buffer (containing 80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm GTP) and 5% glycerol. Polymerization was started by dilution of tubulin to a final concentration of 6.7 μm in 80 μl of G-PEM buffer at a temperature of 37 °C. The polymerization of tubulin was monitored as the increase in absorbance at 340 nm over a period of 60 min using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. To investigate the effect of CaM and Ca2+ on the Par17-promoted microtubule assembly, 1 mm CaCl2 and 30 μm CaM were added to the reaction mixture containing 6.7 μm tubulin and 16 μm concentration of the respective GST-parvulin construct. ITC experiments were performed with a VP-ITC system (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). The standard ITC conditions were 10 mm MES, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm CaCl2, pH 6.8, at 20 °C. For a typical titration of Par172–22 peptide with CaM, 50 μm peptide was placed in the reaction cell, whereas a solution of 300 μm CaM was placed in the ITC syringe. For the titration of full-length Par17 with CaM, 10 μm Par17 was placed in the reaction cell, whereas a solution of 100 μm CaM was placed in the ITC syringe. The titration of Par14 was performed in an analogous manner but with three times the Par14 and CaM concentrations for higher sensitivity. In all titrations, CaM was injected into the reaction cell every 5 min in 15 μl aliquots. Data were analyzed using the MicroCal Origin 7.0 software, and the data were fitted with a “one set of sites” model yielding binding enthalpy (H), stoichiometry (n), entropy (S), and association constant (Ka). PPIase activity of Par17 was determined in a coupled assay with the protease α-chymotrypsin. The assay exploits the specificity of α-chymotrypsin for the trans isomer of proline-containing oligopeptides. Thus, α-chymotrypsin only cleaves off the 4-nitroanilide from the substrate succinyl-Ala-Lys-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide when the Lys-Pro bond is in the trans conformation. At the applied high concentration of α-chymotrypsin, hydrolysis of the trans peptide occurs immediately in a few seconds. Release of 4-nitroaniline from the remaining cis peptide depends on the rate of cis-to-trans isomerization of the prolyl bond and can be followed by an increase in absorbance at 390 nm. Par17 catalyzed cis/trans isomerization was measured at 10 °C for 6 min in a reaction mixture containing 35 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 40 μm succinyl-Ala-Lys-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide, 2 μm GST-Par17, and 1 mm CaCl2 either with or without 15 μm recombinant human CaM. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 mg/ml α-chymotrypsin, and the release of 4-nitroanilide was monitored at 390 nm. NMR data were collected the way previously described (36Lin Y.J. Schmidt A. Burgardt N.I. Thiele A. Weiwad M. Lücke C. 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of human parvulin 17.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2013; 7: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, all NMR spectra were collected in 10 mm MES buffer (50 mm KCl, 6 mm CaCl2, pH 6.8). For resonance assignment purposes, triple-resonance experiments were collected at 18 °C, and in addition titration data were employed to trace signals that showed significant line-broadening with increasing concentration of the binding partner. 1H,15N TROSY experiments for chemical shift perturbation (CSP) a"

A quantitative histochemical method can help advance knowledge of cellular and subcellular localization and distribution of heavy metals in plant tissues. An immunohistochemical (IHC) imaging method for cadmium ions (Cd2+) was developed for the first time for the wheat Triticum aestivum grown in Cd2+-fortified soils. Also, 1-(4-Isothiocyanobenzyl)-ethylenediamine-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (ITCB-EDTA) was used to chelate the mobile Cd2+. The ITCB-EDTA/Cd2+ complex was fixed with proteins in situ via the isothiocyano group. A new Cd2+-EDTA specific monoclonal antibody, 4F3B6D9A1, was used to locate the Cd2+-EDTA protein complex. After staining, the fluorescence intensities of sections of Cd2+-positive roots were compared with those of Cd2+-negative roots under a laser confocal scanning microscope, and the location of colloidal gold particles was determined with a transmission electron microscope. The results enable quantification of the Cd2+ content in plant tissues and illustrate Cd2+ translocation and cellular and subcellular responses of T. aestivum to Cd2+ stress. Compared to the conventional metal-S coprecipitation histochemical method, this new IHC method is quantitative, more specific and has less background interference. The subcellular location of Cd2+ was also confirmed with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The IHC method is suitable for locating and quantifying Cd2+ in plant tissues and can be extended to other heavy metallic ions."
https://openalex.org/W1820466363,"Enhanced influenza surveillance was implemented to analyze transmission dynamics particularly driving force of influenza transmission in a community during 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons in Odate City, Japan. In these two consecutive seasons, influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant influenza A subtype. Suspected influenza cases were tested by commercial rapid test kits. Demographic and epidemiological information of influenza positive cases were recorded using a standardized questionnaire, which included age or age group, date of visit, date of fever onset, and the result of rapid test kit. Epidemiological parameters including epidemic midpoint (EM) and growth rate (GR) were analyzed. In 2012/13 season, numbers of influenza A positive cases were significantly lower among preschool (212 cases) and primary school (224 cases) children than in 2011/12 season (461 and 538 cases, respectively). Simultaneously, total influenza A cases were also reduced from 2,092 in 2011/12 season to 1,846 in 2012/13 season. The EMs in preschool and primary school children were earlier than EMs for adult and all age group in both 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons. The GR in 2012/13 season was significantly lower than that in 2011/12 season (0.11 and 0.18, respectively, p = 0.003). Multiple linear regression analysis by school districts revealed that GRs in both seasons were significantly correlated with the incidence of school age children. Our findings suggest that preschool and primary school children played an important role as a driving force of epidemics in the community in both 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons. The reduction of total influenza A cases in 2012/13 season can be explained by decreased susceptible population in these age groups due to immunity acquired by infections in 2011/12 season. Further investigations are needed to investigate the effect of pre-existing immunity on influenza transmission in the community."
https://openalex.org/W411174181,"Calcium is an important structural component of the skeletal system. Although an adequate intake of calcium helps to maintain bone health and reduce the risk of osteoporosis, many women do not meet recommended daily intakes of calcium. Previous interventions studies designed to increase dietary intake of women have utilized primarily dairy sources of calcium or supplements. However, lactose intolerance, milk protein allergies, or food preferences may lead many women to exclude important dairy sources of dietary calcium. Therefore, we undertook a 9 week randomized crossover design trial to examine the potential benefit of including a non-dairy source of calcium in the diet of women. Following a 3 week run-in baseline period, 35 healthy women > 18 years were randomized by crossover design into either Group I or Group II. Group I added 2 calcium-fortified cereal bars daily (total of 400 mg calcium/day) (intervention) to their usual diet and Group II continued their usual diet (control). At the end of 3 weeks, diets were switched for another 3 weeks. Intakes of calcium and energy were estimated from 3-day diet and supplemental diaries. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for within group comparisons and Mann Whitney U tests were used for between group comparisons of calcium and energy intake. Dietary calcium was significantly higher during intervention (1071 mg/d) when participants consumed 2 calcium-fortified cereal bars daily than during the baseline (720 mg/d, P <0.0001) or control diets (775 mg/d, P = 0.0001) periods. Furthermore, the addition of 2 calcium-fortified cereal bars daily for the 3 week intervention did not significantly increase total energy intake or result in weight gain. In conclusion, consumption of calcium-fortified cereal bars significantly increased calcium intake of women. Further research examining the potential ability of fortified cereal bars to help maintain and improve bone health of women is warranted. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01508689"

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the role of IL10 variations in Indian VL; and to estimate the distribution of disease associated allele in diverse Indian populations.All the exons and exon-intron boundaries of IL10 were sequenced in 184 VL patients along with 172 ethnically matched controls from VL endemic region of India.Our analysis revealed four variations; rs1518111 (2195 A>G, intron), rs1554286 (2607 C>T, intron), rs3024496 (4976 T>C, 3' UTR) and rs3024498 (5311 A>G, 3' UTR). Of these, a variant g.5311A is significantly associated with VL (χ2=18.87; p =0.00001). In silico approaches have shown that a putative micro RNA binding site (miR-4321) is lost in rs3024498 mRNA. Further, analysis of the above four variations in 1138 individuals from 34 ethnic populations, representing different social and linguistic groups who are inhabited in different geographical regions of India, showed variable frequency. Interestingly, we have found, majority of the tribal populations have low frequency of VL ('A' of rs3024498); and high frequency of leprosy ('T' of rs1554286), and Behcet's ('A' of rs1518111) associated alleles, whereas these were vice versa in castes. Our findings suggest that majority of tribal populations of India carry the protected / less severe allele against VL, while risk / more severe allele for leprosy and Behcet's disease. This study has potential implications in counseling and management of VL and other infectious diseases."

All patients were divided into three stages. A total of 70 patients underwent decortication, and we studied intraoperative indicators and postoperative indicators at 1 and 3 years follow-up.In 70 patients who underwent decortication, significant differences were observed in operative duration and bleeding volume between patients with stage I and II ADPKD (P<0.05), but no significant differences were observed in intestinal recovery time, pain medication dose, and the days of postoperative hospitalization (P > 0.05). The total complication occurrence rate was significantly different between them (P < 0.05). The serum creatinine (Scr) levels in patients with stage I ADPKD were within normal limits 1 and 3 years postoperatively and did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). Scr levels were significantly decreased in patients with stage II ADPKD in the 1st postoperative year (P < 0.05), but these were not significant differences in the 3rd postoperative year (P > 0.05). In the 1st postoperative year, VAS value, blood pressure and renal volume significantly differed (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed 3 years later (P > 0.05).Decortication in patients with stage I ADPKD can alleviate back pain symptoms and decrease blood pressure within 1 year, but the long-term efficacy is not ideal. Scr levels can be maintained within normal limits, suggesting that decortication does not lead to deterioration of renal function. For patients with stage II ADPKD, decortication can significantly improve renal function over the short term. However, after 3 years, renal function returns to the preoperative level, and surgical difficulties and complications also increase."
https://openalex.org/W326406900,"Hydrodynamic injection (HI) with a replication competent hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome may lead to transient or prolonged HBV replication in mice. However, the prolonged HBV persistence after HI depends on the specific backbone of the vector carrying HBV genome and the genetic background of the mouse strain. We asked whether a genetically closely related hepadnavirus, woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), may maintain the gene expression and replication in the mouse liver after HI. Interestingly, we found that HI of pBS-WHV1.3 containing a 1.3 fold overlength WHV genome in BALB/c mouse led to the long presence of WHV DNA and WHV proteins expression in the mouse liver. Thus, we asked whether WHV genome carrying foreign DNA sequences could maintain the long term gene expression and persistence. For this purpose, the coding region of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was inserted into the WHV genome to replace the corresponding region. Three recombinant WHV-HBV genomes were constructed with the replacement with HBsAg a-determinant, major HBsAg, and middle HBsAg. Serum HBsAg, viral DNA, hepatic WHV protein expression, and viral replication intermediates were detected in mice after HI with recombinant genomes. Similarly, the recombinant genomes could persist for a prolonged period of time up to 45 weeks in mice. WHV and recombinant WHV-HBV genomes did not trigger effective antibody and T-cell responses to viral proteins. The ability of recombinant WHV constructs to persist in mice is an interesting aspect for the future investigation and may be explored for in vivo gene transfer."
