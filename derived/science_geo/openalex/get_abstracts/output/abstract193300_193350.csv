Exposure to unphysiologically high tensions of oxygen causes irreversible damage to living matter. The problem of oxygen toxicity is important in clinical medicine and in deep-sea diving. A consideration of various isolated reports leads to the hypothesis that oxygen poisoning and the primary action of X-irradiation have a common basis of action: possibly the formation of the oxidizing free radicals OH, and O2H, and H2O2. The evidence of a protective effect of coenzyme A against X-rays and against oxygen toxicity in experiments is incomplete and needs further studies. The chapter presents a table reporting the effect of X-rays and protective agents on oxygen poisoning in mice."

https://openalex.org/W1507398294,"Ethanol formation during the heterolactic fermentation of glucose by Leuconostoc me$enteroides has been shown to proceed via a pathway differing from the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis scheme (1-3). Ethanol arising during yeast fermentation via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas scheme is derived from carbon atoms 1 (aldehyde carbon), 2, 5, and 6 of glucose (4), the methyl group representing carbons 1 and 6, while in the heterolactic fermentation only carbon atoms 2 and 3 give rise to ethanol, the methyl group representing carbon atom 2. It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether ethanol formation in other bacterial fermentations involved the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas or other pathways. Pseudomonas lindneri (Zymomonas lindneri, Termobacterium mobile) was investigated because of its high yield of ethanol during glucose or fructose fermentation. This fermentation has been studied by Kluyver and Hoppenbrouwers (5) using growing cultures, and their results may be expressed in the following equation:"

The authors working alone initially accumulated a list of more than 100 plants reported to contain substances that affect human reproduction. These were divided into 3 categories: 1) so-called oral contraceptives thought to cause temporary sterility (e.g. Lithospermum ruderale used by Southwest American indians for fertility control); 2) substances which in certain doses are believed to interfere with implantation or gestation but which may prove to be in the 1st class if used in smaller concentrations (e.g. unripe pineapple American mistletoe and green coconuts); and 3) emmenagogues plant materials believed to affect menstruation many of which after investigation might be put in Class 1 when their active principles have been isolated and their therapeutic value determined (e.g. begonia squaw root and rosemary).

https://openalex.org/W2437353448,"The increased oxygen uptake of liver suspensions on the addition of acetylcholine, which was reported by Bernheim and Bernheim in 1933 (2), was shown by Mann and Quastel (3) to be due to the oxidation of choline. Betaine aldehyde was identified as the oxidation product (3). The choline oxidase (CO) system was found by Marm, Woodward, and Quastel (4) to consist partly of a typical dehydrogenase. They demonstrated that, in the presence of choline, rat liver extracts reduced sodium ferricyanide anaerobically and cytochrome c aerobically and concluded that the CO system consisted of choline dehydrogenase (CD), cytochrome c, and cytochrome oxidase. During the course of developing the procedure presented in this paper, it was found (1) that the antimycin-sensitive factor of the succinoxidase and diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN) cytochrome c reductase systems (5, 6) was involved in the oxidation of choline by rat liver and kidney. This was confirmed by Ebisuzaki and Williams in a subsequent report (7). Evidence was also obtained (1) implicating the Slater factor (8), believed to be a component of the succinoxidase system required for the transmission of electrons between cytochrome b and cytochrome c, in the CO system. Since both BAL and antimycin inhibit CO, and since the inhibition is reversed by artificial carriers such as methylene blue and brilliant cresyl blue,l it is possible that the two compounds are acting on the same substance, although this has yet to be proved. It should be noted, as pointed out by Edelhoch et al. (9), that the lack of effect of antimycin on a soluble DPN cytochrome c reductase (9) may indicate that the arltibiotic acts on some site in particulate preparations which affects reductase activity and not on the reductase protein per se. While no other component of the CO system has been unequivocally identified, riboflavin (10, 11) in the form of flavin-adenine dinucleotide (7), DPN (12-14), folic acid, Leuconostoc citrovorum factor, vitamin B12, and ascorbic acid (15-18) have all been shown t.o enhance the activity of liver CO.
