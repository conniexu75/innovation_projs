Fawcett et al. show that visible light can induce replacement of carboxylic acid groups with boronate esters, which will ease their introduction into a wide variety of compounds. Once the acids are activated with phthalimide substituents, they can react with catecholborane dimers under illumination in amide solvents, with no need for catalysts or other additives. The reaction appears to proceed by radical chain propagation after photoinitiation. Science , this issue p. 283"

Gates et al. determined high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Hsp104 disaggregase bound to an unfolded polypeptide substrate in its channel. The structures reveal substrate interactions and two different translocation states. Hsp104 undergoes conformational changes that drive movement along the substrate by two-amino-acid steps. These states help explain how this molecular machine can solubilize protein aggregates and amyloids. Science , this issue p. 273"

We found that MiT/TFE transcription factors-master regulators of lysosomal and melanosomal biogenesis and autophagy-control mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and activity by directly regulating the expression of RagD. In mice, this mechanism mediated adaptation to food availability after starvation and physical exercise and played an important role in cancer growth. Up-regulation of MiT/TFE genes in cells and tissues from patients and murine models of renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and melanoma triggered RagD-mediated mTORC1 induction, resulting in cell hyperproliferation and cancer growth. Thus, this transcriptional regulatory mechanism enables cellular adaptation to nutrient availability and supports the energy-demanding metabolism of cancer cells."

However, its biological function and substrate repertoire remain to be investigated. In this study, we utilized the tandem mass tag labeling assay to identify USP9X-regulated proteins and revealed that the expression of multiple genes is altered in USP9X-deficient cells. Interestingly, we showed that USP9X promotes stabilization of centrosome proteins PCM1 and CEP55 through its catalytic activity. Remarkably, we demonstrated that USP9X is physically associated and spatially co-localized with PCM1 and CEP55 in the centrosome, and we revealed that either PCM1 or CEP55 loss resulted in impairment of USP9X centrosome localization. Moreover, we showed that USP9X is required for centrosome duplication, and this effect is dependent on its catalytic activity and its N-terminal module, which is responsible for physical association of USP9X with PCM1 and CEP55. Collectively, our experiments identified USP9X as an integral component of the centrosome where it functions to stabilize PCM1 and CEP55 and promote centrosome biogenesis.

Collectively, our experiments identified USP9X as an integral component of the centrosome where it functions to stabilize PCM1 and CEP55 and promote centrosome biogenesis. The centrosome is a microtubule organizing center, the primary site where microtubule nucleation and organization take place during interphase and mitosis in diploid cells (1.Badano J.L.

Centrosome function and assembly in animal cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Similar to the chromosomes, the centrosome is precisely reproduced, initiated around the time of S phase entry and completed by the end of G2 phase (3.Baumann K. Cell cycle: maintaining centrosome copy number.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 542Google Scholar). During the prophase of mitosis, the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell, and the mitotic spindle forms between them. Upon division, each daughter cell receives one centrosome (4.David R. Cell cycle: keeping centrosome numbers in check.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The centrosome plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes including cell division, polarity, and migration (1.Badano J.L.

However, how this protein-based structure undergoes accurate duplication in a semiconservative manner, at least the molecular mechanism by which centrosome duplication is regulated, is still poorly understood. As a non-membrane organelle in most mammalian cells, the centrosome is composed of two orthogonally arranged centrioles surrounded by an amorphous granular structure termed the pericentriolar material (PCM) 4The abbreviations used are: PCMpericentriolar materialTMTtandem mass tagCEPcentrosomal proteinDUBdeubiquitinaseUSPubiquitin-specific proteaseUSP9Xubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linkedqRTquantitative reverse transcriptionIPimmunoprecipitationIBimmunoblottingUSP9X-NN-terminal region of USP9XUSP9X-ΔNUSP9X lacking the N-terminal regionIFimmunofluorescenceWBWestern blottingTEABtetraethylammonium bromideUPLCultraperformance LCANOVAanalysis of variance. where microtubules are nucleated from γ-tubulin ring complexes (5.Lüders J.

Similarly to acetylation and methylation, protein ubiquitination is a reversible reaction and is constantly opposed by deubiquitinases (DUBs) with enzymatic activity that proteolytically removes polyubiquitin chains from substrates (23.Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The human genome encodes approximately 95 putative DUBs (23.Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Among these DUBs, the largest family is the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). Loss of function of each USP is associated with functional consequences that are often severe (23.Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 24.Murtaza M. Jolly L.A. Gecz J. Wood S.A. La FAM fatale: USP9X in development and disease.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 2075-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One of the most studied USPs is the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9X; also known as FAM for Drosophila fat facets in mouse) (25.Wood S.A. Pascoe W.S. Ru K. Yamada T. Hirchenhain J.

In particular, USP9X has been reported to target dozens of proteins to regulate cellular processes that are fundamental to many aspects of development and disease, namely protein trafficking/endocytosis (26.Murray R.Z.

Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2015-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In responding to its diverse cellular functions, the intracellular localization of USP9X is versatile and dependent on cell type and status. Generally, USP9X predominantly resides in cytoplasmic and membrane-associated puncta (26.Murray R.Z. Jolly L.A. Wood S.A. The FAM deubiquitylating enzyme localizes to multiple points of protein trafficking in epithelia, where it associates with E-cadherin and β-catenin.Mol. Biol.

USP9X enhances the polarity and self-renewal of embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2015-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, USP9X has also been detected at specific cellular compartments including Golgi apparatus, late endosomes, mitochondria, and nucleus (24.Murtaza M. Jolly L.A. Gecz J. Wood S.A. La FAM fatale: USP9X in development and disease.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 2075-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These observations point to an important cellular function of USP9X and highlight the need to interrogate USP9X substrates with less disruptive biochemical or genetic approaches. In this study, we revealed that USP9X is physically associated with PCM1 and CEP55 and stabilizes these centrosome proteins through its deubiquitinase activity. We showed that USP9X is an integral component of the centrosome and required for proper centrosome duplication. To obtain unbiased information of USP9X-promoted protein stabilization and further characterize its biological functionality, a quantitative proteomics strategy based on the TMT labeling assay was performed to determine the down- and up-regulated proteins upon USP9X depletion in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Specifically, MCF-7 cells were transfected with control siRNA or USP9X siRNA, and the whole cellular proteins from biological duplicate samples were extracted and quantified. Following trypsin digestion of equal amounts of proteins, the resolved peptides were labeled with fourplex TMT kits, fractionated by HPLC, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. In total, 4452 proteins were identified and quantified in all of the four samples (supplemental Table 1). After modeling the normal distribution of the protein ratios, cutoff values of ≦0.770 and ≧1.3 with p values <0.05 were applied to identify proteins with significant expression changes upon USP9X depletion (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table 1). In summary, 27 proteins were up-regulated, and 28 proteins were down-regulated in replicate analyses (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table 1). Because the down-regulated proteins resulting from USP9X depletion could be candidate substrates of USP9X, we primarily focused on these proteins in this study. Functional enrichment-based clustering for overlapping hits from duplicate treatment indicated that USP9X deficiency is associated with alterations of multiple signaling pathways including centrosome biogenesis as manifested by down-regulated expression levels of centrosome components PCM1 and CEP55 upon USP9X loss of function (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table 1). To validate the TMT labeling assay data and test whether the abundance of PCM1 and CEP55 is truly controlled by USP9X, we examined the effect of USP9X on the expression of PCM1 and CEP55. Western blot analysis of the cellular lysates of MCF-7 cells transfected with two independent sets of siRNAs targeting different regions of USP9X revealed that although the expression of centrosome protein Pericentrin and loading control protein β-actin was essentially unchanged, the level of PCM1 and CEP55 was markedly decreased upon USP9X depletion (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR measurements indicated that USP9X knockdown did not result in alterations in mRNA expression levels of PCM1 and CEP55 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the reduction in PCM1 and CEP55 protein levels associated with USP9X depletion was probably a result of proteasome-mediated protein degradation as the effect could be effectively blocked by a proteasome-specific inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1B). To gain molecular insights into the functional connection between USP9X and PCM1 or CEP55, we next investigated whether USP9X-promoted PCM1 and CEP55 stabilization is a consequence of protein deubiquitination. Control U2OS cells or U2OS cells stably expressing USP9X were transfected with siRNA targeting the 3′-UTR of USP9X mRNA, and Western blot analysis revealed that wild-type USP9X (USP9X-WT) was able to restore the expression of PCM1 and CEP55, whereas catalytic mutant USP9X (USP9X-C1566S) failed to do so (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1C). Furthermore, treatment of MCF-7 cells with WP1130, a deubiquitinase inhibitor reported to inhibit USP9X at low micromolar concentrations (37.Wang S. Kollipara R.K. Srivastava N. Li R. Ravindranathan P. Hernandez E. Freeman E. Humphries C.G. Kapur P. Lotan Y. Fazli L. Gleave M.E. Plymate S.R. Raj G.V. Hsieh J.T. et al.Ablation of the oncogenic transcription factor ERG by deubiquitinase inhibition in prostate cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 4251-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of PCM1 and CEP55 protein but not that of Pericentrin, whereas it had no effect on the mRNA levels of these genes (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S1D). Together, these results indicated that USP9X regulates the stability of PCM1 and CEP55 and that USP9X does so through its deubiquitinase activity. The functional association of deubiquitinase USP9X with centrosomal proteins PCM1 and CEP55 suggested that USP9X is a centrosome-associated protein. To test this hypothesis, immunofluorescent staining was performed to examine the subcellular localization of endogenous USP9X in U2OS cells. We found that USP9X was predominantly localized in centrosomes and co-localized with the centrosomal markers Centrin and γ-tubulin (Fig. 3A). In support of the finding that USP9X promotes stabilization of PCM1 and CEP55, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that USP9X was spatially co-localized with PCM1 (Fig. 3B) and CEP55 (Fig. 3C). To further establish the functional link between USP9X and PCM1 or CEP55, we asked whether USP9X-promoted PCM1 and CEP55 stabilization has an effect on the localization or centrosome abundance of these proteins. To this end, immunofluorescent staining followed by confocal microscopy analysis was performed, and the results implied that depletion of USP9X resulted in lost staining of PCM1 (Fig. 3B) and CEP55 (Fig. 3C) in centrosomes, but the centrosomal localization of Pericentrin (Fig. 3D) was essentially unchanged. Together, these results suggested that USP9X is a centrosomal protein and further support the notion that USP9X controls the stabilization of PCM1 and CEP55 in the centrosome. Because centrosome proteins exhibit a high degree of interdependence in their localizations, we next asked whether the centrosomal localization of USP9X is controlled by PCM1 or CEP55. To test this hypothesis, control siRNA, PCM1 siRNA, or CEP55 siRNA was transfected into U2OS cells. Immunofluorescent staining followed by confocal microscopy analysis indicated that knockdown of the expression of either PCM1 (Fig. 4A) or CEP55 (Fig. 4B) resulted in a diminished centrosomal localization of USP9X in U2OS cells, suggesting that the centrosomal localization of USP9X is dependent on PCM1 and CEP55. The functional link between USP9X and PCM1 or CEP55 prompted us to investigate whether USP9X is physically associated with PCM1 and CEP55. To test this hypothesis, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with MCF-7 cell extracts. Immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies against PCM1 or CEP55 followed by immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies against USP9X demonstrated that USP9X was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with PCM1 or CEP55 (Fig. 5A). Reciprocally, IP with antibodies against USP9X and IB with antibodies against PCM1 or CEP55 also revealed that either PCM1 or CEP55 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with USP9X (Fig. 5B). To further understand the molecular details of the association of USP9X with PCM1 and CEP55, we analyzed the domain structures of USP9X. In its N-terminal region, there is an α-α superhelix domain (Fig. 5C), which is supposed to mediate protein–protein interaction (38.Takayanagi H. Yuzawa S. Sumimoto H. Structural basis for the recognition of the scaffold protein Frmpd4/Preso1 by the TPR domain of the adaptor protein LGN.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2015; 71: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 39.Taschner M. Kotsis F. Braeuer P. Kuehn E.W. Lorentzen E. Crystal structures of IFT70/52 and IFT52/46 provide insight into intraflagellar transport B core complex assembly.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, we demonstrated that the N-terminal region of USP9X (USP9X-N) is necessary and sufficient for its association with PCM1 and CEP55 (Fig. 5C). In support of the above findings, fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that USP9X-N is able to localize to centrosome, whereas lack of the N-terminal region impaired USP9X centrosome localization (Fig. 5D). These results indicated that USP9X and PCM1 or CEP55 co-exist in the same multiprotein-containing complex and are physically associated (could be indirectly or directly), which provides a meaningful explanation for the centrosomal localization of USP9X and its centrosome substrate preference. To understand the biological significance of USP9X centrosomal localization, we next investigated the effect of USP9X on the biogenesis of centrosome. To this end, U2OS cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting the 3′-UTR of USP9X mRNA followed by treatment with hydroxyurea to induce a prolonged S phase. Immunofluorescent staining of USP9X and Centrin in these cells showed that although control cells that were arrested in S phase underwent centrosome overduplication, manifested by the presence of more than four Centrin foci, USP9X depletion resulted in a significant reduction of centrosome amplification (Fig. 6, A and B). Importantly, the phenotype associated with USP9X deficiency could be rescued by overexpression of USP9X-WT but not its catalytic mutant USP9X-C1566S or USP9X lacking the N-terminal region (USP9X-ΔN) (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistent with the observation that USP9X-ΔN was largely diffused in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A), we showed that USP9X-ΔN overexpression could not restore the expression of PCM1 and CEP55 in USP9X-deficient cells (Fig. 6C and supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that USP9X-promoted centrosome biogenesis is dependent on its catalytic activity and its N-terminal module that is responsible for physical association of USP9X with PCM1 and CEP55. Collectively, these results support the notion that USP9X is an important player in the regulation of centrosome duplication/biogenesis. In this study, we used proteomic screening and mass spectrometry analysis and found that depletion of the X-linked deubiquitinase USP9X led to expression alterations of multiple genes including centrosome proteins PCM1 and CEP55. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that USP9X is physically associated with PCM1 and CEP55. Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that USP9X is spatially restricted to the centrosome where it is co-localized with PCM1 and CEP55 and promotes the stabilization of these proteins, indicating that USP9X is an integral component of the centrosome. Understanding the cellular distributions of USP9X is a prerequisite for characterization of its role in development and disease. Thus far, USP9X has been reported to be present at distinct cellular organelles including the mitochondria (40.Schwickart M. Huang X. Lill J.R. Liu J. Ferrando R. French D.M. Maecker H. O'Rourke K.

Our observation that USP9X is localized in the centrosome expands the spatial domains and thus the functionality of this deubiquitinase. Interestingly, disrupting protein trafficking or the Golgi in polarized epithelia results in relocation or accumulation of USP9X, implying that this protein circulates between organelles and vesicles with different resident times at each compartment (24.Murtaza M. Jolly L.A. Gecz J. Wood S.A. La FAM fatale: USP9X in development and disease.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 2075-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although whether USP9X is able to shuttle between the centrosome and other organelles or vesicles remains to be investigated, the diversified cellular localization of USP9X reflects a dynamic nature of distribution of this protein in cells. Consistently, USP9X has been reported to interact with and deubiquitinate dozens of proteins in distinct cellular compartments (24.Murtaza M. Jolly L.A. Gecz"
https://openalex.org/W2625950130,"Objective The increasing number of refugees seeking asylum in Europe in recent years poses new challenges for the healthcare systems in the destination countries. The goal of the study was to describe the evolution of medical problems of asylum seekers at a tertiary care centre in Switzerland. Methods At the University Hospital Basel, we compared all asylum seekers during two 1-year time periods in 2004/05 and 2014/15 concerning demographic characteristics and reasons for referrals and hospitalizations. Results Hundred ninety five of 2’544 and 516 of 6’243 asylum seekers registered at the national asylum reception and procedure centre Basel were referred to the University Hospital Basel in 2004/05 and 2014/15, and originated mainly from Europe (62.3%, mainly Turkey) and Africa (49.1%, mainly Eritrea), respectively. Median age was similar in both study periods (26.9 and 26.2 years). Infectious diseases in asylum seekers increased from 22.6% to 36.6% (p<0.001) and were the main reasons for hospitalizations (33.3% of 45 and 55.6% of 81 hospitalized patients, p = 0.017) in 2004/05 compared to 2014/15. The leading infectious diseases in hospitalized patients were tuberculosis (n = 4) and bacterial skin infections (n = 2) in 2004/05; Malaria (n = 9), pneumonia (n = 6), Chickenpox (n = 5), other viral infections (n = 5) and bacterial skin infections (n = 5) in 2014/15. Infectious diseases like malaria, cutaneous diphtheria, louseborne-relapsing fever or scabies were only found in the second study period. Almost one third of the admitted asylum seekers required isolation precautions with median duration of 6–9.5 days in both study periods. Conclusions The changing demography of asylum seekers arriving in Switzerland in the current refugee crisis has led to a shift in disease patterns with an increase of infectious diseases and the re-emergence of migration-associated neglected infections. Physicians should be aware of these new challenges."

Samples from twelve ND and twelve matched T2D multiorgan donors were studied by electron microscopy, including amylase and insulin immunogold labeling; carboxypeptidase A immunofluorescence light microscopy assessment was also performed. In the pancreas from four T2D donors, cells containing both zymogen-like and insulin-like granules were observed, scattered in the exocrine compartment. Nature of granules was confirmed by immunogold labeling for amylase and insulin. Double positive cells ranged from 0.82 to 1.74 per mm2, corresponding to 0.26±0.045% of the counted exocrine cells. Intriguingly, cells of the innate immune systems (mast cells and/or macrophages) were adjacent to 33.3±13.6% of these hybrid cells. No cells showing co-localization of amylase and insulin were found in ND samples by electron microscopy. Similarly, cells containing both carboxypeptidase A and insulin were more frequently observed in the diabetic pancreata. These results demonstrate more abundant presence of cells containing both acinar markers and insulin in the pancreas of T2D subjects, which suggests possible conversion from one cellular type to the other and specific association with the diseased condition."
https://openalex.org/W2626166437,"Asthma often progresses into adulthood from early-life episodes of adverse environmental exposures. However, how the injury to developing lungs contributes to the pathophysiology of persistent asthma remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified an age-related mechanism along the cholinergic nerve-airway smooth muscle (ASM) axis that underlies prolonged airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in mice. We showed that ASM continued to mature until ∼3 wk after birth. Coinciding with postnatal ASM maturation, there was a critical time window for the development of ASM hypercontractility after cholinergic stimulation. We found that allergen exposure in neonatal mice, but not in adult mice, elevated the level and activity of cholinergic nerves (termed neuroplasticity). We demonstrated that cholinergic neuroplasticity is necessary for the induction of persistent AHR after neonatal exposure during rescue assays in mice deficient in neuroplasticity. In addition, early intervention with cholinergic receptor muscarinic (ChRM)-3 blocker reversed the progression of AHR in the neonatal exposure model, whereas β2-adrenoceptor agonists had no such effect. Together, our findings demonstrate a functional relationship between cholinergic neuroplasticity and ASM contractile phenotypes that operates uniquely in early life to induce persistent AHR after allergen exposure. Targeting ChRM3 may have disease-modifying benefits in childhood asthma.-Patel, K. R., Bai, Y., Trieu, K. G., Barrios, J., Ai, X.

Some fatty acids are known to modulate tight junctions. Fatty acids resulting from the digestion of edible oils may improve the absorption of polyphenolic antioxidants. Therefore, we explored the effect of three edible oils on the intestinal absorption of caffeic acid. Rats were fed with soybean oil and caffeic acid dissolved in distilled water. Caffeic acid contents in the plasma collected up to 1 hr were quantified. The experiment was repeated with coconut oil and olive oil. Component fatty acids of the oils were individually tested in vitro for their effect on permeability of caffeic acid using Caco-2 cell monolayers. Highest absorption of caffeic acid was observed in animals fed with coconut oil. In vitro transport percentages of caffeic acid in 2.5 mmol/L solutions of fatty acids were 22.01±0.12 (lauric), 15.30 ± 0.25 (myristic acid), 13.59 ± 0.35 (linoleic acid), 3.70 ± 0.09 (oleic acid) and 0.10–2.0 (all other fatty acids). Lauric acid and myristic acid are the two major fatty acids present in coconut oil. Therefore, these fatty acids may contribute to the higher absorption of caffeic acid in the presence of coconut oil."
https://openalex.org/W2626869586,"Squamous cell carcinoma–related oncogene (SCCRO)/DCUN1D1, a component of the neddylation E3 complex, regulates the activity of the cullin–RING–ligase type of ubiquitination E3s by promoting neddylation of cullin family members. Studies have shown that SCCRO regulates proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that inactivation of SCCRO results in prolonged mitotic time because of delayed and/or failed abscission. The effects of SCCRO on abscission involve its role in neddylation and localization of Cul3 to the midbody. The Cul3 adaptor KLHL21 mediates the effects of SCCRO on abscission, as it fails to localize to the midbody in SCCRO-deficient cells during abscission, and its inactivation resulted in phenotypic changes identical to SCCRO inactivation. Ubiquitination-promoted turnover of Aurora B at the midbody was deficient in SCCRO- and KLHL21-deficient cells, suggesting that it is the target of Cul3KLHL21 at the midbody. Correction of abscission delays in SCCRO-deficient cells with addition of an Aurora B inhibitor at the midbody stage suggests that Aurora B is the target of SCCRO-promoted Cul3KLHL21 activity. The activity of other Cul3-anchored complexes, including Cul3KLHL9/KLHL13, was intact in SCCRO-deficient cells, suggesting that SCCRO selectively, rather than collectively, neddylates cullins in vivo. Combined, these findings support a model in which the SCCRO, substrate, and substrate adaptors cooperatively provide tight control of neddylation and cullin–RING–ligase activity in vivo."

We therefore studied life satisfaction among 641 individuals (ages 18-66 years) who spent their entire childhood with a single mother, 1539 individuals who spent part of their childhood with both parents but then experienced parental separation, and 21,943 individuals who grew up with both parents. Individuals who grew up with a single mother for their entire childhood and to a lesser degree also individuals who experienced parental separation showed a small but persistent decrease in life satisfaction into old age controlling childhood socio-economic status. This decrease was partly mediated by worse adulthood living conditions related to socio-economic and educational success, physical health, social integration, and romantic relationship outcomes. No moderation by age, gender, and societal system where the childhood was spent (i.e. western oriented FRG or socialist GDR) was found."
https://openalex.org/W2624954765,"When people learn foreign languages, they find it difficult to perceive speech sounds that are nonexistent in their native language, and extensive training is consequently necessary. Our previous studies have shown that by using neurofeedback based on the mismatch negativity event-related brain potential, participants could unconsciously achieve learning in the auditory discrimination of pure tones that could not be consciously discriminated without the neurofeedback. Here, we examined whether mismatch negativity neurofeedback is effective for helping someone to perceive new speech sounds in foreign language learning. We developed a task for training native Japanese speakers to discriminate between 'l' and 'r' sounds in English, as they usually cannot discriminate between these two sounds. Without participants attending to auditory stimuli or being aware of the nature of the experiment, neurofeedback training helped them to achieve significant improvement in unconscious auditory discrimination and recognition of the target words 'light' and 'right'. There was also improvement in the recognition of other words containing 'l' and 'r' (e.g., 'blight' and 'bright'), even though these words had not been presented during training. This method could be used to facilitate foreign language learning and can be extended to other fields of auditory and clinical research and even other senses."
https://openalex.org/W2625208847,"Trace metals are essential for health but toxic when present in excess. The maintenance of trace metals at physiologic levels reflects both import and export by cells and absorption and excretion by organs. The mechanism by which this maintenance is achieved in vertebrate organisms is incompletely understood. To explore this, we chose zebrafish as our model organism, as they are amenable to both pharmacologic and genetic manipulation and comprise an ideal system for genetic screens and toxicological studies. To characterize trace metal content in developing zebrafish, we measured levels of three trace elements, copper, zinc, and manganese, from the oocyte stage to 30 days post-fertilization using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results indicate that metal levels are stable until zebrafish can acquire metals from the environment and imply that the early embryo relies on maternal contribution of metals to the oocyte. We also measured metal levels in bodies and yolks of embryos reared in presence and absence of the copper chelator neocuproine. All three metals exhibited different relative abundances between yolks and bodies of embryos. While neocuproine treatment led to an expected phenotype of copper deficiency, total copper levels were unaffected, indicating that measurement of total metal levels does not equate with measurement of biologically active metal levels. Overall, our data not only can be used in the design and execution of genetic, physiologic, and toxicologic studies but also has implications for the understanding of vertebrate metal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2625785293,"Background Exercise and statins reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD). Exercise capacity may be assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Whether statin medication is associated with CPET parameters is unclear. We investigated if statins are related with exercise capacity during CPET in the general population. Methods Cross-sectional data of two independent cohorts of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) were merged (n = 3,500; 50% males). Oxygen consumption (VO2) at peak exercise (VO2peak) and anaerobic threshold (VO2@AT) was assessed during symptom-limited CPET. Two linear regression models related VO2peak with statin usage were calculated. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, previous myocardial infarction, and physical inactivity and model 2 additionally for body mass index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Propensity score matching was used for validation. Results Statin usage was associated with lower VO2peak (no statin: 2336; 95%-confidence interval [CI]: 2287–2,385 vs. statin 2090; 95%-CI: 2,031–2149 ml/min; P < .0001) and VO2@AT (no statin: 1,172; 95%-CI: 1,142–1,202 vs. statin: 1,111; 95%-CI: 1,075–1,147 ml/min; P = .0061) in males but not females (VO2peak: no statin: 1,467; 95%-CI: 1,417–1,517 vs. statin: 1,503; 95%-CI: 1,426–1,579 ml/min; P = 1.00 and VO2@AT: no statin: 854; 95%-CI: 824–885 vs. statin 864; 95%-CI: 817–911 ml/min; P = 1.00). Model 2 revealed similar results. Propensity scores analysis confirmed the results. Conclusion In the general population present statin medication was related with impaired exercise capacity in males but not females. Sex specific effects of statins on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity deserve further research."
https://openalex.org/W2625716526,"Heavy veal calves (4-6 months old) are at risk of developing insulin resistance and disturbed glucose homeostasis. Prolonged insulin resistance could lead to metabolic disorders and impaired growth performance. Recently, we discovered that heavy Holstein-Friesian calves raised on a high-lactose or high-fat diet did not differ in insulin sensitivity, that insulin sensitivity was low and 50% of the calves could be considered insulin resistant. Understanding the patho-physiological mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and discovering biomarkers for early diagnosis would be useful for developing prevention strategies. Therefore, we explored plasma metabolic profiling techniques to build models and discover potential biomarkers and pathways that can distinguish between insulin resistant and moderately insulin sensitive veal calves. The calves (n = 14) were classified as insulin resistant (IR) or moderately insulin sensitive (MIS) based on results from a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, using a cut-off value (M/I-value <4.4) to identify insulin resistance. Metabolic profiles of fasting plasma samples were analyzed using reversed phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis was performed to compare metabolic profiles. Insulin sensitivity was on average 2.3x higher (P <0.001) in MIS than IR group. For both RP-LC-MS and HILIC-LC-MS satisfactory models were build (R2Y >90% and Q2Y >66%), which allowed discrimination between MIS and IR calves. A total of 7 and 20 metabolic features (for RP-LC-MS and HILIC-LC-MS respectively) were most responsible for group separation. Of these, 7 metabolites could putatively be identified that differed (P <0.05) between groups (potential biomarkers). Pathway analysis indicated disturbances in glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that plasma metabolic profiling can be used to identify insulin resistance in veal calves and can lead to underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2625857360,"Individuals with congenital amusia usually exhibit impairments in melodic contour processing when asked to compare pairs of melodies that may or may not be identical to one another. However, it is unclear whether the impairment observed in contour processing is caused by an impairment of pitch discrimination, or is a consequence of poor pitch memory. To help resolve this ambiguity, we designed a novel Self-paced Audio-visual Contour Task (SACT) that evaluates sensitivity to contour while placing minimal burden on memory. In this task, participants control the pace of an auditory contour that is simultaneously accompanied by a visual contour, and they are asked to judge whether the two contours are congruent or incongruent. In Experiment 1, melodic contours varying in pitch were presented with a series of dots that varied in spatial height. Amusics exhibited reduced sensitivity to audio-visual congruency in comparison to control participants. To exclude the possibility that the impairment arises from a general deficit in cross-modal mapping, Experiment 2 examined sensitivity to cross-modal mapping for two other auditory dimensions: timbral brightness and loudness. Amusics and controls were significantly more sensitive to large than small contour changes, and to changes in loudness than changes in timbre. However, there were no group differences in cross-modal mapping, suggesting that individuals with congenital amusia can comprehend spatial representations of acoustic information. Taken together, the findings indicate that pitch contour processing in congenital amusia remains impaired even when pitch memory is relatively unburdened."

In warm and hot seasons, such as the summer in Japan, fed mosquitoes are often observed at crime scenes. The current study attempted to estimate the time that elapsed since feeding from the degree of human DNA digestion in mosquito blood meals and also to identify the individual human sources of the DNA using genotyping in two species of mosquito: Culex pipiens pallens and Aedes albopictus. After stereomicroscopic observation, the extracted DNA samples were quantified using a human DNA quantification and quality control kit and were genotyped for 15 short tandem repeats using a commercial multiplexing kit. It took about 3 days for the complete digestion of a blood meal, and genotyping was possible until 2 days post-feeding. The relative peak heights of the 15 STRs and DNA concentrations were useful for estimating the post-feeding time to approximately half a day between 0 and 2 days. Furthermore, the quantitative ratios derived from STR peak heights and the quality control kit (Q129/Q41, Q305/Q41, and Q305/Q129) were reasonably effective for estimating the approximate post-feeding time after 2-3 days. We suggest that this study may be very useful for estimating the time since a mosquito fed from blood meal DNA, although further refinements are necessary to estimate the times more accurately."

https://openalex.org/W2626850989,"Considering the known effects of xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET) on plant growth and development, we aimed to determine whether XETs help to regulate the growth and elongation of Huangguogan shoots and roots. We confirmed a possible role for XET during seedling etiolation. Our results revealed that the roots of etiolated seedlings (H-E) were longer than those of green seedlings (H-G). However, shoot length exhibited the opposite pattern. We also observed positive and negative effects on the xyloglucan-degrading activity of XET in the root sub-apical region and shoots of etiolated Huangguogan seedling, respectively. There was a significant down-regulation in CitXET expression in the etiolated shoots at 15 days after seed germination. On the contrary, it was significantly increased in the root sub-apical region of etiolated and multicolored seedlings at 15 days after seed germination. The XET coding sequence (i.e., CitXET) was cloned from Huangguogan seedlings using gene-specific primers. The encoded amino acid sequence was predicted by using bioinformatics-based methods. The 990-bp CitXET gene was highly homologous to other XET genes. The CitXET protein was predicted to contain 319 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 37.45 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.05. The predicted molecular formula was C1724H2548N448O466S14, and the resulting protein included only one transmembrane structure. The CitXET secondary structure consisted of four main structures (i.e., 21% α-helix, 30.72% extended strand, 9.09% β-turn, and 39.18% random coil). Analyses involving the NCBI Conserved Domains Database (NCBI-CDD), InterPro, and ScanProsite revealed that CitXET was a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (GH16), and included the DEIDFEFLG motif. Our results indicate that the differed degrees of etiolation influenced the CitXET expression pattern and XET activity in Huangguogan seedlings. The differential changes in XET activity and CitXET expression levels in Huangguogan seedlings may influence the regulation of root and shoot development, and may be important for seedling etiolation."

The new plan, unveiled on 8 June, is a stunning shift from the earlier policy, which would have limited a principal investigator9s support to the equivalent of three standard R01 research grants.

The initial peak of the response around 13 ms, designated as N13m, and the second peak of the response, designated as P21m, were investigated. The N13m response, which was detected in 22 of 62 hemispheres in young adults and 37 of 58 hemispheres in elderly adults, showed significantly prolonged latency and increased equivalent current dipole (ECD) moment in the elderly adults. The P21m response, which was detected in 56 of 62 hemispheres in young adults and in 52 of 58 hemispheres in elderly adults, showed longer peak latency in the elderly adults. No significant difference was found in the ECD moment for P21m, which suggests that aging affected the SEFs of the lip somatosensation, but the effects of aging on N13m and P21m differed. Prolonged latency and increased ECD moment of N13m might result from decreased peripheral conduction and increased cortical excitation system associated with aging. Therefore, the initial response component might be an objective parameter for investigating change in lip function with age."

In development, cell fate commitment enables the generation of the body's specialized cells. When one fate is targeted, other paths must be prevented. DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides is key for such molecular repression. However, the erasure of DNA methylation is also critical in development and occurs at specific times, such as during embryonic postimplantation. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) genes perform this role. Khoueiry et al. now identify a methylation-independent role for TET1 to repress genes involved in the differentiation of epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm through regulation of the transcriptional repressor JMJD8. Embryonic defects result if TET1 is removed. Hence, the well-known demethylase has critical functions in normal development through both catalytic and noncatalytic activities.

Theory of mind involves recognizing that others have a distinct perspective. Such an ability is difficult to identify in species that cannot tell you about their thoughts,"

Hair follicles in mammalian skin undergo cycles of quiescence and regeneration. Hair follicle stem cells play a role in the regeneration phase. Ali et al. have found that regulatory T cells (Tregs), immune cells known to suppress inflammation, colocalize with stem cells in hair follicles. In a mouse model of hair regeneration, depletion of Tregs reduced hair growth. Analysis of gene expression revealed that Tregs promote the proliferation and differentiation of hair follicle stem cells. Tregs express a high level of Jagged, a ligand of the cell-cell communication system called the Notch signaling pathway that controls stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. The findings may have implications for treating individuals with alopecia areata, a hair loss condition.

In a remarkable set of studies, Powell and Carey marry two previously unlinked lines of research. Executive function refers to the ability to make decisions, such as being able to switch from pressing the keyboard down (up) arrow when seeing a down (up) arrow on the computer screen to pressing the up (down) arrow when seeing a down (up) arrow. A person's ability to carry out such a task diminishes after being forced to exercise self-control (for example, for a child, waiting to open a box of toys). Theory of mind involves predicting another's behavior on the basis of understanding that person's beliefs. After suffering through the delayed-gratification exercise, 4- and 5-year-old children displayed impaired theory-of-mind capabilities.

It9s unlikely that you recall the specifics of the dishes you savored with such delight, but you undoubtedly remember how the meal made you feel, and you can probably recall the atmosphere in which it was consumed. This is, in fact, a common occurrence: The food itself is only one of the factors that influence your perception of a dining experience, and—much to the chagrin of chefs—not always the most important one. Gastrophysics , by Charles Spence, deals with the wide range of factors that influence the eating experience."

Radar and lidar use pulses of electromagnetic radiation (typically microwaves or laser light) to track and range stationary or moving objects. However, when the object is obscured or hidden from view within a scattering medium, these technologies are ineffective. Akhlaghi and Dogariou have devised an imaging process that can track a hidden target as it moves within a scattering medium. Illuminating one side of the scattering medium with coherent light creates a speckle pattern on the other side. By monitoring changes in the speckle pattern, they show that the spatial and temporal movement of the target can be reconstructed. The technique could find application in biomedical imaging and remote sensing, as well as being applicable to other areas such as acoustics and microwaves.

Molecular junctions formed from Ru(bpy)3 oligomers (bpy, 2,2′-bipyridine) transition with increasing thickness from transporting electrons to emitting light. Tefashe et al. used electrochemical deposition to grow Ru(bpy)3 oligomers along with PF6− counterions on conducting carbon, which was then capped with conducting carbon to form a junction. Films thicker than 4 nm emitted light at wavelengths between 600 and 900 nm for biases above 2.7 V. Unlike previous devices based on Ru(bpy)3, the emission is bipolar (occurs for both positive and negative bias) and has a rapid onset (5 ms) and long persistence (10 hours). The authors argue that both hole and electron injection occur through a resonant process involving a metal-to-ligand charge transition.

But a squabble arose over the optical design. On one side of the argument are optics specialists who want to take the opportunity to advance telescope engineering, on the other are astronomers who want a simpler instrument based on proven technologies designed to meet scientific objectives set through a bottom-up process. An international panel recently reviewed the optical designs and came out squarely in favor of the simpler proposal favored by astronomers. Astronomers now hope the optics engineers will get on board, as building the telescope will require all available expertise and manpower."
