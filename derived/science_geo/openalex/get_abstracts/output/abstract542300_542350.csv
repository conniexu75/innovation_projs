A hierarchy of timescales naturally emerges from this system: sensory areas show brief, transient responses to input (appropriate for sensory processing), whereas association areas integrate inputs over time and exhibit persistent activity (suitable for decision-making and working memory). The model displays multiple temporal hierarchies, as evidenced by contrasting responses to visual versus somatosensory stimulation. Moreover, slower prefrontal and temporal areas have a disproportionate impact on global brain dynamics. These findings establish a circuit mechanism for “temporal receptive windows” that are progressively enlarged along the cortical hierarchy, suggest an extension of time integration in decision making from local to large circuits, and should prompt a re-evaluation of the analysis of functional connectivity (measured by fMRI or electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) by taking into account inter-areal heterogeneity.

The receptive field is a central concept in neuroscience, defined as the spatial region over which an adequate stimulus solicits rigorous response of a neuron (Sherrington, 1906Sherrington C.S. Observations on the scratch-reflex in the spinal dog.J. Physiol. 1906; 34: 1-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the primate visual cortical system, the receptive field size of neurons progressively enlarges along a hierarchy (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat’s visual cortex.J. Physiol. 1962; 160: 106-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (8580) Google Scholar, Hubel, 1988Hubel D.H.

Structure and function come unglued in the visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 60: 195-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As a result, higher areas can integrate stimuli over a greater spatial extent, which is essential for such functions as size-invariance of object recognition in the ventral (“what”) stream for visual perception (Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994Kobatake E. Tanaka K. Neuronal selectivities to complex object features in the ventral visual pathway of the macaque cerebral cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 856-867PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the brain also displays a hierarchy in the temporal domain. This allows neurons in higher areas to respond to stimuli spread over a greater temporal extent and to integrate information over time, while neurons in early sensory areas rapidly track changing stimuli. In human studies, preserving the short timescale structure of stimuli while scrambling long timescale structure changes responses in association areas but not early sensory areas (Hasson et al., 2008Hasson U.

Similarly, temporal correlations in neural activity reveal slower decay rates in the frontal eye fields than area V4 (Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010Ogawa T. Komatsu H.

Finally, normative theories of predictive coding suggest that a hierarchy of timescales would allow animals to form a nested sequence of predictions about the world (Kiebel et al., 2008Kiebel S.J. Daunizeau J. Friston K.J. A hierarchy of time-scales and the brain.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000209Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). What underlying neurobiological mechanisms might give rise to such a range of temporal dynamics? For example, spatial patterns of convergence can produce increasing receptive field sizes in the visual hierarchy. Are there basic anatomical motifs that produce a hierarchy of timescales? Here we report a large-scale circuit mechanism for the generation of a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows in the primate cortex. This hierarchy naturally emerges in a dynamical model based on a recent quantitative anatomical dataset containing directed and weighted connectivity for the macaque neocortex (Markov et al., 2011Markov N.T.

A predictive network model of cerebral cortical connectivity based on a distance rule.Neuron. 2013; 80: 184-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The data were obtained using the same experimental conditions and measures, ensuring a consistent database (Kennedy et al., 2013Kennedy H. Knoblauch K. Toroczkai Z. Why data coherence and quality is critical for understanding interareal cortical networks.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 37-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and include both the number of projections between areas and their laminar origins. Based on a separate anatomical study (Elston, 2000Elston G.N. Pyramidal cells of the frontal lobe: all the more spinous to think with.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC95PubMed Google Scholar, Elston et al., 2011Elston G.N. Benavides-Piccione R. Elston A. Manger P.R. Defelipe J. Pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex of primates: marked differences in neuronal structure among species.Front. Neuroanat. 2011; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we introduced heterogeneity across cortical areas in the form of a gradient of excitatory connection strengths. Strong recurrent excitation has been proposed as a mechanism by which prefrontal cortex could implement “cognitive-type” computations, such as information integration and memory-related delay activity; we hypothesized that differences in recurrent excitation might allow the generation of a temporal hierarchy. The model thus incorporates anatomically constrained variation in both within-area and inter-areal connectivity and enables us to probe the interplay of local microcircuitry and long-range connectivity that underlies a hierarchy of timescales. Using different sensory inputs, we demonstrate the existence, in our model, of multiple dynamical hierarchies subserved by a single integrated global and local circuit. We then investigate the implications of local circuit heterogeneity for macroscopic dynamics measured by functional connectivity (i.e., correlations in activity across areas). Here we find a disproportionate role for slow dynamics in the prefrontal and other association cortices in shaping resting-state functional connectivity. This role is not predicted by long-range connections, suggesting that interpretations of brain imaging data will need to be revised to account for inter-areal heterogeneity. While we have used the model to investigate the origin of a hierarchy of timescales, it can be a platform for future models relating connectivity to dynamics and the functions of cortical areas. Most statistical analyses of connectivity (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009Bullmore E. Sporns O. Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems.Nat. Rev.

How local excitation-inhibition ratio impacts the whole brain dynamics.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 7886-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have lacked comprehensive high-resolution data, relying either on collating qualitative tract-tracing data across disparate experiments and conditions or on diffusion tensor imaging, which is noisy and cannot reveal the direction of a pathway. Moreover, such models typically treat cortical areas as identical nodes in a network, distinguished by connection patterns but not by local properties or computational capabilities. Although this approach is reasonable for certain purposes, it is doubtful that functional specialization of cortical areas can be elucidated without considering heterogeneity. Our model provides a framework to explore how dynamical and functional specialization can emerge from inter-areal pathways coupled with local circuit differences. We developed the model in three steps. First, we used recent connectivity data for the macaque neocortex (Markov et al., 2014aMarkov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Lamy C. Magrou L. Vezoli J. Misery P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. et al.A weighted and directed interareal connectivity matrix for macaque cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2014; 24: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), designed to overcome the limitations of collated anatomical datasets, and collected by the same group under similar conditions, with quantitative measures of connectivity. The connectivity weights are directionally specific and cover 29 widely distributed cortical areas, with 536 connections whose strengths span five orders of magnitude (Figure 1). The presence or absence of all projections in this network has been established; thus, there are no unknown pathways. Second, each cortical area was described by a threshold-linear recurrent network with interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations and calibrated by the neurophysiology of the primary visual cortex (Binzegger et al., 2009Binzegger T. Douglas R.J. Martin K.A. Topology and dynamics of the canonical circuit of cat V1.Neural Netw. 2009; 22: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but rescaled as described below. This is a highly simplified description of the dynamics of an area and ignores most within-area variability. In particular, note that the model is large-scale in that it addresses macroscopic cortical dynamics but is not large-scale in the sense of having millions of neurons or very high-dimensional activity. However, this level of complexity allows us to parsimoniously capture essential requirements for a hierarchy of timescales. We extend our results in Figure 7 and suggest further extensions in the Discussion. Third, we hypothesized that the local microcircuit is qualitatively canonical (Douglas and Martin, 1991Douglas R.J. Martin K.A. A functional microcircuit for cat visual cortex.J. Physiol. 1991; 440: 735-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), i.e., the same across areas, but that quantitative inter-areal differences are crucial in generating the timescales of areas. Specifically, the number of basal dendritic spines on layer three pyramidal neurons increases sharply from primary sensory to prefrontal areas (Elston, 2000Elston G.N. Pyramidal cells of the frontal lobe: all the more spinous to think with.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC95PubMed Google Scholar, Elston et al., 2011Elston G.N. Benavides-Piccione R. Elston A. Manger P.R. Defelipe J. Pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex of primates: marked differences in neuronal structure among species.Front. Neuroanat. 2011; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Taking spine count as a proxy for excitatory synapses per pyramidal cell, we introduced a gradient of excitatory input strength across the cortex. We modeled this by scaling the strength of excitatory projections in an area according to the area’s position in the anatomical hierarchy described below. The laminar pattern of inter-areal projections can be used to place cortical areas in a hierarchy: neurons mediating feedforward connections from one area to another tend to originate in supragranular layers of the source area, whereas feedback projections tend to originate in infragranular layers (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C. Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar, Barbas and Rempel-Clower, 1997Barbas H. Rempel-Clower N. Cortical structure predicts the pattern of corticocortical connections.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This was quantified by Barone et al., 2000Barone P. Batardiere A. Knoblauch K. Kennedy H. Laminar distribution of neurons in extrastriate areas projecting to visual areas V1 and V4 correlates with the hierarchical rank and indicates the operation of a distance rule.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3263-3281PubMed Google Scholar, who observed that the fraction of projecting neurons located in the supragranular layers of the source area defines a hierarchical distance between two areas; this allowed them to reproduce the hierarchy of Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C. Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar using data from connections to only two areas (V1 and V4). The laminar data included with this paper (see Table S1) contain hierarchical distance measured this way for all pairs of cortical areas included in the model (Figure 2A). We follow the approach of Markov et al., 2014bMarkov N.T. Vezoli J. Chameau P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Huissoud C. Lamy C. Misery P. Giroud P. Ullman S. et al.Anatomy of hierarchy: feedforward and feedback pathways in macaque visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 225-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, and use these to estimate each area’s position in an underlying hierarchy. We found that an area’s position in this anatomical hierarchy is strongly correlated with counts of spines on pyramidal neurons in that area (Elston, 2007Elston G.N. Specialization of the neocortical pyramidal cell during primate evolution.in: Evolution of Nervous Systems: A Comprehensive Reference. Volume 4. Elsevier, 2007: 191-242Google Scholar). This allowed us to introduce a systematic gradient of excitatory connection strength per neuron along the cortical hierarchy, and to explore how such heterogeneity interacts with the pattern of long-range projections to produce large-scale dynamics. As a visual and conceptual aid, in Figure 2C we use a two-dimensional embedding to plot hierarchy and connectivity for the 29 areas. The angle between two areas reflects connection strength (closer areas have stronger connections), and the distance of an area from the center reflects hierarchy (higher areas closer to the center). The low-dimensional embedding is approximate but captures broad features of cortical organization and provides intuitive understanding of the model’s behavior. It suggests two hierarchical streams of sensory input originating in area V1 (primary visual cortex) and area 2 (part of primary somatosensory cortex) respectively, and converging on densely connected association areas. We next explored the response of the network to these sensory inputs. We simulated the response of the network to a pulsed input to primary visual cortex (area V1). The response is propagated up the visual hierarchy, progressively slowing as it proceeds (Figure 3A). Early visual areas, such as V1 and V4, exhibit fast, short-lived responses. Prefrontal areas, on the other hand, exhibit slower responses and longer integration times, with traces of the stimulus persisting several seconds after stimulation. As with the response to a pulse of input, white-noise input is integrated with a hierarchy of timescales: the activity of early sensory areas shows rapid decay of autocorrelation with time whereas cognitive areas are correlated across longer periods (Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, a hierarchy of widely disparate temporal windows or timescales emerges from this anatomically calibrated model system. To quantitatively compare areas, we fit single or double exponentials to the decay of each area’s autocorrelation function (see Figure S2 for plots of the fits). These fits capture a dominant characteristic timescale for each area in our model in response to visual stimulation. The time constants from the fits are plotted in Figure 3D, with areas ordered by position in the anatomical hierarchy. As can be seen from the bar plot, the dominant timescale of an area tends to increase along the hierarchy (i.e., left to right), suggesting an important role for a gradient of excitation in generating the temporal hierarchy. Nevertheless, an area’s timescales are not entirely determined by its hierarchical position, and the plotted timescales do not increase monotonically with hierarchy. To gain some intuition for the role of long-range projections in the model, consider area 8m (part of the frontal eye fields), which is low in the hierarchy and would show a rapid decay of correlation in the absence of long-range projections (far-right image of Figure 5A) but instead demonstrates long timescales in the model (and in the empirical observations of Hasson et al., 2008Hasson U. Yang E. Vallines I. Heeger D.J. Rubin N. A hierarchy of temporal receptive windows in human cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2539-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Figure 2C, area 8m participates in a strongly-connected core of prefrontal and association areas (Ercsey-Ravasz et al., 2013Ercsey-Ravasz M. Markov N.T. Lamy C. Van Essen D.C. Knoblauch K. Toroczkai Z. Kennedy H.

Cortical high-density counterstream architectures.Science. 2013; 342: 1238406Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), allowing it to show long timescales that emerge from inter-areal excitatory loops (these timescales are strongly attenuated in the absence of feedback projections). The shared slower timescales are particularly characteristic of prefrontal areas in our model (see Figure S2, especially areas best fit by two timescales). Conversely, whereas area TEpd is high in the hierarchy, it does not participate in this core and is instead strongly coupled to ventral stream visual areas. Thus, it reflects the faster timescales of visual input. The response to visual input reveals an ascending hierarchy of timescales in the visual system. We next stimulated primary somatosensory cortex (area 2), which is weakly connected to the visual hierarchy and strongly connected to other somatosensory and motor areas (Figure 2C). As previously, input propagates up a hierarchy of timescales (Figure 4A). However, the somatosensory response uncovers a different dynamical hierarchy to visual stimulation. Primary somatosensory cortex shows the fastest timescale, followed by primary motor cortex (area F1) and somatosensory association cortex (area 5). Parietal and premotor areas show intermediate timescales and, as with visual stimulation, prefrontal areas show long timescales. Visual areas demonstrate much weaker responses than before and are mostly driven by top-down projections from association areas. Thus, in the absence of direct input, they reflect the slower timescales of a distributed network state. In Figure 4B, we contrast time constants for visual and somatosensory stimulation across areas. An area’s timescales emerge from a combination of local circuit properties, the specificity of long-range projections, and the particular input to the network. Our model allows us to examine the contribution of each. These can be intuitively summarized by noting that each area in Figure 2C shows timescales approximately determined by its distance from the periphery (hierarchical position), proximity to the central clusters (long-range connectivity), and distance from the source of input. To further dissect the contributions of local and long-range projections, we examined time constants in response to visual input after removing either differences in local microcircuitry or inter-areal projections. In the second image of Figure 5A, we show that the range of timescales is drastically reduced in the absence of differences in the microcircuit across areas. Moreover, there is no longer a relationship to an area’s position in the anatomical hierarchy. Thus, while differences in long-range inputs and outputs to each area are significant, they are insufficient to account for disparate timescales and local heterogeneity is needed. In the third image of Figure 5A, we show the effect of removing long-range feedback projections, and for the far right image, we remove all long-range projections and stimulate individual areas separately. The range of time constants is lower, reflecting the propensity of slow areas to form long-range excitatory loops with each other. More significantly, once long-range projections are removed, an area’s time constant simply reflects its position in the hierarchy. We extend our investigation of the role of long-range projections by contrasting the resting-state response (i.e., equal white-noise input to all areas) of the intact network to networks where long-range connections are scrambled while preserving the gradient of excitation. A number of these networks show responses that are poorly fit by exponentials, so we measure timescale non-parametrically as the time after pulse offset for activity to decay to within 5% of baseline. In Figure 5B, we show that scrambling almost entirely removes the hierarchy of timescales, further confirming that a gradient of excitation alone is insufficient to separate timescales. The connectivity data show specificity in which projections exist and in their strengths, and both connection probability and strength decay exponentially with inter-areal distance (Markov et al., 2011Markov N.T.

https://openalex.org/W2118519201,"How cancer cells adapt to metabolically adverse conditions in patients and strive to proliferate is a fundamental question in cancer biology. Here we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic checkpoint kinase, confers metabolic stress resistance to leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and promotes leukemogenesis. Upon dietary restriction, MLL-AF9-induced murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) activated AMPK and maintained leukemogenic potential. AMPK deletion significantly delayed leukemogenesis and depleted LICs by reducing the expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), compromising glucose flux, and increasing oxidative stress and DNA damage. LICs were particularly dependent on AMPK to suppress oxidative stress in the hypoglycemic bone marrow environment. Strikingly, AMPK inhibition synergized with physiological metabolic stress caused by dietary restriction and profoundly suppressed leukemogenesis. Our results indicate that AMPK protects LICs from metabolic stress and that combining AMPK inhibition with physiological metabolic stress potently suppresses AML by inducing oxidative stress and DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2191239308,"Bilaterally symmetric motor patterns--those in which left-right pairs of muscles contract synchronously and with equal amplitude (such as breathing, smiling, whisking, and locomotion)--are widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the underlying neural circuits. We performed a thermogenetic screen to identify neurons required for bilaterally symmetric locomotion in Drosophila larvae and identified the evolutionarily conserved Even-skipped(+) interneurons (Eve/Evx). Activation or ablation of Eve(+) interneurons disrupted bilaterally symmetric muscle contraction amplitude, without affecting the timing of motor output. Eve(+) interneurons are not rhythmically active and thus function independently of the locomotor CPG. GCaMP6 calcium imaging of Eve(+) interneurons in freely moving larvae showed left-right asymmetric activation that correlated with larval behavior. TEM reconstruction of Eve(+) interneuron inputs and outputs showed that the Eve(+) interneurons are at the core of a sensorimotor circuit capable of detecting and modifying body wall muscle contraction."

Short-term memory (STM), which relies on neural activity in frontal cortices (Fuster, 1997Fuster J. The Prefrontal Cortex: Anatomy, Physiology, and Neuropsychology of the Frontal Lobe.Third Edition. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997Google Scholar), is fundamental for successful interactions with a complex world. Memory-guided orienting behaviors use a well-studied form of STM (Funahashi et al., 1989Funahashi S. Bruce C.J. Goldman-Rakic P.S.

Regional and cellular fractionation of working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 13473-13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). On each trial of a memory-guided orienting task, subjects are first presented with a sensory cue indicating an appropriate orienting direction; they must then withhold their motion throughout a memory delay period; and after a “go” cue that indicates the end of the delay period, they must read information out from STM and perform the orienting motion. Hours-long pharmacological silencing of cortical premotor areas such as the primate frontal eye fields (FEFs) and its suggested rat homolog, the frontal orienting fields (FOFs), produces an impairment that is substantially greater for memory-guided orienting than for sensory-guided orienting (Sommer and Tehovnik, 1997Sommer M.A. Tehovnik E.J.

As a result, neural activity in these areas, together with parietal and prefrontal cortices (Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 1998Chafee M.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S.

Correlations between firing rates during the memory delay and the subsequent orienting movement, in both rats (Erlich et al., 2011Erlich J.C. Bialek M. Brody C.D.

Bump attractor dynamics in prefrontal cortex explains behavioral precision in spatial working memory.Nat.

But no causal test of this commonly held hypothesis has yet been performed. (A different cortical region, the anterior lateral motor cortex [ALM], has recently been shown to be necessary in mice for STM maintenance in a related task, memory-guided directional licking [Guo et al., 2014Guo Z.V. Li N. Huber D. Ophir E. Gutnisky D. Ting J.T. Feng G. Svoboda K. Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar]. The results presented below contrast with Guo et al.’s results, a comparison that we expand on in the Discussion.) Another potentially relevant brain region is the superior colliculus (SC) in the brain stem, which, despite not being generally thought to subserve STM maintenance, shares many properties, described in more detail below, with the rodent FOF and primate FEF during memory-guided orienting tasks. Here we used temporally precise optogenetic inactivation to dissect the role of the FOF and SC in STM. We selectively and unilaterally silenced each brain region during specific time periods within trials of a memory-guided orienting task. Using the same task, Erlich et al., 2011Erlich J.C. Bialek M. Brody C.D. A cortical substrate for memory-guided orienting in the rat.Neuron. 2011; 72: 330-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar found that neural encoding in the FOF for the upcoming orienting movement is weakest during the cue stimulus and grows monotonically throughout the memory delay period. This led us to predict that the behavioral effect of inactivating the FOF would be weakest during the cue stimulus (when there is little encoding to disrupt), and would grow monotonically as it occurred later in the delay period (when there is more substantial encoding to disrupt). Directly contrary to these expectations, we found that unilateral inactivation of either the FOF or the SC had its biggest behavioral effect during cue presentation, and the effect magnitude decreased monotonically during the delay period. In other words, the stronger the neural encoding that was silenced, the weaker the effect produced by that silencing. One potential explanation for these results is that the observed neural encoding is largely an epiphenomenon, and that neural activity causal to memory maintenance during the delay period is gradually transferred out of the FOF and SC and mainly held in some other brain region(s). However, we found that an alternative explanation, which would fully reconcile the electrophysiological and optogenetic findings, was provided by a dynamical attractor model previously used to jointly describe decision-making and STM (Wong and Wang, 2006Wong K.-F.F. Wang X.-J.J. A recurrent network mechanism of time integration in perceptual decisions.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1314-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, Machens et al., 2005Machens C.K. Romo R. Brody C.D. Flexible control of mutual inhibition: a neural model of two-interval discrimination.Science. 2005; 307: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In our adaptation of this model, the FOF and the SC play fully causal and equivalent roles within a mutual-inhibition attractor network that maintains the memory over the delay period. During each trial, the model transitions from a relatively perturbable decision-making phase with little encoding (during the stimulus cue) into a relatively unperturbable maintenance phase with strong encoding (during the delay period, when the system has entered a dynamical attractor that maintains the memory). The model thus displays monotonically increasing encoding together with a monotonically decreasing effect of silencing. We probed two key predictions of the model. First, the model predicts that silencing both the FOF and the SC simultaneously at the end of the delay period should have a substantial effect, greater than the sum of inactivating either region alone. Second, the model predicts that during the cue period, difficult trials should be more perturbable than easy trials, but that by the end of the delay period, perturbability should be independent of trial difficulty. This is because by the end of the delay period, the system’s fall into a dynamical attractor will have erased any information about how it got there. We confirmed both predictions. Taken together, our data support the idea that the encoding and maintenance of STM for orientation is distributed across both cortical and subcortical regions, and is well described by a dynamical attractor mechanism. We trained rats to perform a memory-guided orienting task (Figure 1A; Erlich et al., 2011Erlich J.C. Bialek M. Brody C.D. A cortical substrate for memory-guided orienting in the rat.Neuron. 2011; 72: 330-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In these tasks, inhibitory perturbations of frontal premotor cortices are expected to be more informative than excitatory perturbations: low-amplitude electrical microstimulation of the primate FEF readily evokes involuntary short-latency orienting motions (Robinson and Fuchs, 1969Robinson D.A. Fuchs A.F. Eye movements evoked by stimulation of frontal eye fields.J. Neurophysiol. 1969; 32: 637-648PubMed Google Scholar, Bruce and Goldberg, 1985Bruce C.J. Goldberg M.E. Primate frontal eye fields. I. Single neurons discharging before saccades.J. Neurophysiol. 1985; 53: 603-635PubMed Google Scholar) that can break memory delay period fixation (i.e., break motion withholding), and thus preclude completion and analysis of normal behavioral trials. We found similar effects when Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in rat FOF was used to cause an excitatory perturbation, even when the perturbation was very short (see Figures S1A–S1C available online). In contrast, even long inhibitory perturbations did not hinder normal completion of behavioral trials (Figures S1D and S1E). Inhibitory perturbations are therefore the focus of our study. Unilateral injections into the FOF of each rat were made with a virus engineered to drive expression of the light-activated chloride pump eNpHR3.0 (Gradinaru et al., 2010Gradinaru V. Zhang F. Ramakrishnan C. Mattis J. Prakash R. Diester I. Goshen I. Thompson K.R. Deisseroth K.

We made five injection tracts per animal, arranged as a cross with a 500 μm spacing. Together with the injections, a chemically sharpened 125 μm diameter optical fiber was implanted, 1 mm deep, into the center of the virus injection area (Lambelet et al., 1998Lambelet P. Sayah A.

Distinct relationships of parietal and prefrontal cortices to evidence accumulation.Nature. 2015; 520: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). During behavioral sessions, the optical fiber was connected to a computer-controlled 532 nm laser. Simultaneous laser stimulation and electrophysiological recordings in an anesthetized preparation indicated that our procedures produced robust neuronal inhibition within a sphere of ∼750 μm radius from the fiber tip (Hanks et al., 2015Hanks T.D. Kopec C.D. Brunton B.W. Duan C.A. Erlich J.C. Brody C.D. Distinct relationships of parietal and prefrontal cortices to evidence accumulation.Nature. 2015; 520: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Both anesthetized and further awake behaving recordings indicated onset and offset of inhibition in the tens of milliseconds (Figure S3). We first asked whether the effects seen under hours-long pharmacological inactivation (Sommer and Tehovnik, 1997Sommer M.A. Tehovnik E.J. Reversible inactivation of macaque frontal eye field.Exp. Brain Res. 1997; 116: 229-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Dias and Segraves, 1999Dias E.C.

A cortical substrate for memory-guided orienting in the rat.Neuron. 2011; 72: 330-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) could be reproduced when inactivations lasted only a few seconds. In a randomly chosen 25% of trials, we turned the laser on at the start of the auditory orienting cue, and kept the laser on throughout the entire trial (2 s), until the animal had completed its orienting motion (Figure 1A, “Laser On”). As expected, this produced a robust ipsilateral bias specific to the Laser On trials (15.5%, p < 0.01, n = 4 rats, Figure 1B). Whole-trial inactivation in a sensory-guided orienting task that lacks a STM component (Figure 1C) produced no detectable bias (1.1% ± 3.7%, p = 0.29, n = 3 rats, Figure 1D; see also Figures S1F and S1G), providing further evidence for the involvement of the FOF in orienting guided specifically by STM. These data also demonstrate that inhibition of the FOF does not impair the ability to produce normal orienting motions (consistent with Erlich et al., 2011Erlich J.C. Bialek M. Brody C.D. A cortical substrate for memory-guided orienting in the rat.Neuron. 2011; 72: 330-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar; see also Figure S4). We next tested the effect of inactivating only during the 1 s fixation period, encompassing decision formation, STM encoding, and memory maintenance, but prior to initiating the motor response. This again resulted in a significant ipsilateral response bias (17.9%, p < 0.01, n = 7 rats, Figure 2B), confirming that FOF activity preceding the motor response is causal to the subject’s choice. As shown in Figure 2A, neural encoding of the direction of the upcoming orienting movement is weakest in the FOF during the cue presentation, and gradually increases, with the strongest predictive neural signal found immediately before the end of the memory delay period (reanalysis of data from Erlich et al., 2011Erlich J.C. Bialek M. Brody C.D. A cortical substrate for memory-guided orienting in the rat.Neuron. 2011; 72: 330-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). If disrupting a weak neural code produces a weaker behavioral effect than disrupting a strong neural code, then we would have expected the smallest behavioral effect from FOF inactivation during the sensory cue, and the largest effect from inactivation immediately before the end of the memory delay period. We tested this prediction using short inactivation windows at different time points, with one window per trial in a randomly chosen 25% of trials (Figures 2C and 2D). The data produced a pattern precisely opposite to the prediction. Inactivation windows of both 500 ms (Figure 2C) and 250 ms (Figure 2D) produced the largest effects when placed during the sensory cue (500 ms Cue period, 11.6%, n = 7 rats, p < 0.01; 250 ms Cue first half, 12.1%, n = 3 rats, p < 0.01), and the magnitude of the effect decreased monotonically thereafter (Figures 2C and 2D; Tables S1 and S2). Immediately before the end of the delay period, inactivation of the FOF produced the smallest behavioral effect (2.5%, n = 7 rats, p = 0.012, Figure 2D, open arrow), even though at that time the neural signal is the strongest (Figure 2A, open arrows), and eNpHR3.0-mediated inhibition produces robust silencing (Figure S3). To assess whether the small bias magnitude during the memory delay could be a consequence of incompletely silencing some parts of the FOF, in a second group of rats we infected a larger area of frontal cortex and implanted two optical fibers, one 500 μm anterior and the other 500 μm posterior from our original coordinates (Figures S5A and S5B). We estimate that we thus doubled the volume of cortical tissue that we were silencing. Despite this doubling, we observed no additional response bias (p = 0.226, n = 2 rats dual fiber, n = 5 rats single fiber, Figures S5C and S5D), indicating that our single-fiber experiments had already saturated the size of the effect that could be produced by unilateral silencing of the FOF. Inactivation at a later time point, during the subject’s orienting response, had no discernible effect on side choice (−0.1% ± 3.5%, p = 0.53, n = 6 rats, Figure 2C, solid arrow). Nor was there an effect on movement times (Figure S4). These data thus suggest that frontal cortical activity plays an important causal role during STM encoding, a gradually diminishing role in maintenance during the delay period—becoming only marginally important by the delay period’s end—and is not required for movement execution. Subsequent to the formation of orienting motor plans (which, in our task, is not distinguished from making a Left versus Right decision, and which could occur as soon as the first few hundred milliseconds of the sensory cue), a causal role in the maintenance of those plans in STM could move to brain areas other than the FOF, possibly downstream in the motor pathway. One candidate for such a downstream region is the SC (Wurtz and Albano, 1980Wurtz R.H. Albano J.E. Visual-motor function of the primate superior colliculus.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1980; 3: 189-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, Munoz and Wurtz, 1995aMunoz D.P. Wurtz R.H. Saccade-related activity in monkey superior colliculus. I.

Although this subcortical region has generally not been thought to subserve STM maintenance, it shares many properties with the primate FEF and rodent FOF, including involvement in the control of orienting movements (Wurtz and Albano, 1980Wurtz R.H.

Anatomically, the SC receives direct projections from the FEF in primates (Komatsu and Suzuki, 1985Komatsu H. Suzuki H.

Efferent connections of the rostral portion of medial agranular cortex in rats.Brain Res. Bull. 1987; 19: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and in turn projects back to frontal premotor cortex via the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (Sommer and Wurtz, 2008Sommer M.A. Wurtz R.H. Brain circuits for the internal monitoring of movements.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 317-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We injected the same AAV-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-eYFP unilaterally into the SC (Figure S2B), and repeated our experiments, but now inactivating the SC. The pattern of results found in the SC closely mirrored those found in the FOF (Figure 3), with no statistically significant differences between the two brain regions (r = 0.98, p = 0.271 that SC differs from FOF, n = 3–5 rats for SC depending on inactivation period; Figure 3; Table S2). Instead of revealing differential roles for the FOF and SC, these data suggested that the two regions may play closely related or parallel roles during memory-guided orienting. One explanation for the two sets of inactivation results, then, is that a causal role in maintenance of orienting motor plans gradually moves away from both the FOF and the SC during the delay period. The monotonically increasing neural encoding of Figure 2A could be mostly an efference copy, or perhaps largely an epiphenomenon. Below we test an alternative explanation. We found that assigning equal, fully causal roles in memory maintenance to the FOF and SC within a model previously used to jointly describe decision-making and STM (Wong and Wang, 2006Wong K.-F.F.

Below we first describe the model, then identify two key untested predictions it makes, and finally confirm both predictions experimentally. In the proposed model, which is a simple adaptation of Hopfield, 1984Hopfield J.J. Neurons with graded response have collective computational properties like those of two-state neurons.Proc. Natl.

The activity in each of two nodes (Left and Right) is represented by a variable U; the output of each node is a sigmoidal function of U and is represented by the variable V (Hopfield, 1984Hopfield J.J. Neurons with graded response have collective computational properties like those of two-state neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1984; 81: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (4910) Google Scholar). There is mutual inhibition between the two nodes (of strength I), self-excitation within each node (of strength M), and an external input Ex to each node (Figure 4A). In addition, the activity of each node is perturbed by a white noise Wiener process dW, scaled by σ, which represents overall noise in the system. Subscripts L and R indicate the Left and Right nodes, respectively:τdULdt=−UL+M⋅VL−I⋅VR+ExL+σdWLτdURdt=−UR+M⋅VR−I⋅VL+ExR+σdWRVL(t)=12tanhUL(t)+12VR(t)=12tanhUR(t)+12.(1) We set τ = 100 ms (Wang, 2008Wang X.-J.J. Decision making in recurrent neuronal circuits.Neuron. 2008; 60: 215-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The external input Ex is composed of a background input B plus an additional term ϕ that depends on the identity of the auditory cue. Thus, letting Ecue be a positive constant, and letting ϕ range from 0 for the strongest Right cue to 1 for the strongest Left cue, during the Cue period we haveExL(i)=B+ϕEcueExR(i)=B+(1−ϕ)Ecue,(2) and during the Memory period,ExL(i)=0ExR(i)=0.(3) The action of halorhodopsin eNpHR3.0 mediated inhibition is modeled by reducing the output V of one node by the fractionh=(1−1n)(4) where n is a free parameter. At the start of each trial, the state of the system begins on the unstable manifold that divides the two basins of attraction. As time evolves, the sensory stimulus biases which of the two attractors the state of the system is likely to move toward. Eventually the network settles into one of the attractors, corresponding to a categorical decision, which persists as a memory because attractors are stable points of the dynamics (Figure 4B) (Wong and Wang, 2006Wong K.-F.F.

https://openalex.org/W2207875562,"Proteins form large macromolecular assemblies with RNA that govern essential molecular processes. RNA-binding proteins have often been associated with conformational flexibility, yet the extent and functional implications of their intrinsic disorder have never been fully assessed. Here, through large-scale analysis of comprehensive protein sequence and structure datasets we demonstrate the prevalence of intrinsic structural disorder in RNA-binding proteins and domains. We addressed their functionality through a quantitative description of the evolutionary conservation of disordered segments involved in binding, and investigated the structural implications of flexibility in terms of conformational stability and interface formation. We conclude that the functional role of intrinsically disordered protein segments in RNA-binding is two-fold: first, these regions establish extended, conserved electrostatic interfaces with RNAs via induced fit. Second, conformational flexibility enables them to target different RNA partners, providing multi-functionality, while also ensuring specificity. These findings emphasize the functional importance of intrinsically disordered regions in RNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2115624928,"Processing speed is an important contributor to working memory performance and fluid intelligence in young children. Myelinated white matter plays a central role in brain messaging, and likely mediates processing speed, but little is known about the relationship between myelination and processing speed in young children. In the present study, processing speed was measured through inspection times, and myelin volume fraction (VFM) was quantified using a multicomponent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach in 2- to 5-years of age. Both inspection times and VFM were found to increase with age. Greater VFM in the right and left occipital lobes, the body of the corpus callosum, and the right cerebellum was significantly associated with shorter inspection times, after controlling for age. A hierarchical regression showed that VFM in the left occipital lobe predicted inspection times over and beyond the effects of age and the VFM in the other brain regions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that myelin supports processing speed in early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2137299052,"Fatty liver is a major cause of obesity-related morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to identify early metabolic alterations associated with liver fat accumulation in 50- to 55-year-old men (n = 49) and women (n = 52) with and without NAFLD.Hepatic fat content was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). Serum samples were analyzed using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform. Global gene expression profiles of adipose tissues and skeletal muscle were analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays and quantitative PCR. Muscle protein expression was analyzed by Western blot.Increased branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), aromatic amino acid (AAA) and orosomucoid were associated with liver fat accumulation already in its early stage, independent of sex, obesity or insulin resistance (p<0.05 for all). Significant down-regulation of BCAA catabolism and fatty acid and energy metabolism was observed in the adipose tissue of the NAFLD group (p<0.001for all), whereas no aberrant gene expression in the skeletal muscle was found. Reduced BCAA catabolic activity was inversely associated with serum BCAA and liver fat content (p<0.05 for all).Liver fat accumulation, already in its early stage, is associated with increased serum branched-chain and aromatic amino acids. The observed associations of decreased BCAA catabolism activity, mitochondrial energy metabolism and serum BCAA concentration with liver fat content suggest that adipose tissue dysfunction may have a key role in the systemic nature of NAFLD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2179118268,"Under selective pressure from the host immune system, antigenic epitopes of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) have continually evolved to escape antibody recognition, termed antigenic drift. We analyzed the genomes of influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains circulating in Thailand between 2010 and 2014 and assessed how well the yearly vaccine strains recommended for the southern hemisphere matched them. We amplified and sequenced the HA gene of 120 A(H3N2) and 81 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus samples obtained from respiratory specimens and calculated the perfect-match vaccine efficacy using the pepitope model, which quantitated the antigenic drift in the dominant epitope of HA. Phylogenetic analysis of the A(H3N2) HA1 genes classified most strains into genetic clades 1, 3A, 3B, and 3C. The A(H3N2) strains from the 2013 and 2014 seasons showed very low to moderate vaccine efficacy and demonstrated antigenic drift from epitopes C and A to epitope B. Meanwhile, most A(H1N1)pdm09 strains from the 2012-2014 seasons belonged to genetic clades 6A, 6B, and 6C and displayed the dominant epitope mutations at epitopes B and E. Finally, the vaccine efficacy for A(H1N1)pdm09 (79.6-93.4%) was generally higher than that of A(H3N2). These findings further confirmed the accelerating antigenic drift of the circulating influenza A(H3N2) in recent years."
https://openalex.org/W1749394265,"Despite the progress made by modern medicine, infectious diseases remain one of the most important threats to human health. Vaccination against pathogens is one of the primary methods used to prevent and treat infectious diseases that cause illness and death. Vaccines administered by the mucosal route are potentially a promising strategy to combat infectious diseases since mucosal surfaces are a major route of entry for most pathogens. However, this route of vaccination is not widely used in the clinic due to the lack of a safe and effective mucosal adjuvant. Therefore, the development of safe and effective mucosal adjuvants is key to preventing infectious diseases by enabling the use of mucosal vaccines in the clinic. In this study, we show that intranasal administration of a cationic liposome composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and 3β-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] (DC-chol) (DOTAP/DC-chol liposome) has a potent mucosal adjuvant effect in mice. Intranasal vaccination with ovalbumin (OVA) in combination with DOTAP/DC-chol liposomes induced the production of OVA-specific IgA in nasal tissues and increased serum IgG1 levels, suggesting that the cationic DOTAP/DC-chol liposome leads to the induction of a Th2 immune response. Additionally, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and splenocytes from mice treated with OVA plus DOTAP/DC-chol liposome showed high levels of IL-4 expression. DOTAP/DC-chol liposomes also enhanced OVA uptake by CD11c+ dendritic cells in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue. These data demonstrate that DOTAP/DC-chol liposomes elicit immune responses via an antigen-specific Th2 reaction. These results suggest that cationic liposomes merit further development as a mucosal adjuvant for vaccination against infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1882428435,"Intestinal mucositis is a common side effect of irinotecan-based anticancer regimens. Mucositis causes cell damage, bacterial/endotoxin translocation and production of cytokines including IL-1 and IL-18. These molecules and toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate a common signaling pathway that involves the Myeloid Differentiation adaptor protein, MyD88, whose role in intestinal mucositis is unknown. Then, we evaluated the involvement of TLRs and MyD88 in the pathogenesis of irinotecan-induced intestinal mucositis. MyD88-, TLR2- or TLR9-knockout mice and C57BL/6 (WT) mice were given either saline or irinotecan (75 mg/kg, i.p. for 4 days). On day 7, animal survival, diarrhea and bacteremia were assessed, and following euthanasia, samples of the ileum were obtained for morphometric analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay and measurement of pro-inflammatory markers. Irinotecan reduced the animal survival (50%) and induced a pronounced diarrhea, increased bacteremia, neutrophil accumulation in the intestinal tissue, intestinal damage and more than twofold increased expression of MyD88 (200%), TLR9 (400%), TRAF6 (236%), IL-1β (405%), IL-18 (365%), COX-2 (2,777%) and NF-κB (245%) in the WT animals when compared with saline-injected group (P<0.05). Genetic deletion of MyD88, TLR2 or TLR9 effectively controlled the signs of intestinal injury when compared with irinotecan-administered WT controls (P<0.05). In contrast to the MyD88-/- and TLR2-/- mice, the irinotecan-injected TLR9-/- mice showed a reduced survival, a marked diarrhea and an enhanced expression of IL-18 versus irinotecan-injected WT controls. Additionally, the expression of MyD88 was reduced in the TLR2-/- or TLR9-/- mice. This study shows a critical role of the MyD88-mediated TLR2 and TLR9 signaling in the pathogenesis of irinotecan-induced intestinal mucositis."
https://openalex.org/W2176949197,"Automatic species identification has many advantages over traditional species identification. Currently, most plant automatic identification methods focus on the features of leaf shape, venation and texture, which are promising for the identification of some plant species. However, leaf tooth, a feature commonly used in traditional species identification, is ignored. In this paper, a novel automatic species identification method using sparse representation of leaf tooth features is proposed. In this method, image corners are detected first, and the abnormal image corner is removed by the PauTa criteria. Next, the top and bottom leaf tooth edges are discriminated to effectively correspond to the extracted image corners; then, four leaf tooth features (Leaf-num, Leaf-rate, Leaf-sharpness and Leaf-obliqueness) are extracted and concatenated into a feature vector. Finally, a sparse representation-based classifier is used to identify a plant species sample. Tests on a real-world leaf image dataset show that our proposed method is feasible for species identification."
https://openalex.org/W2123669571,"Myocardial fibrosis contributes to the remodeling of heart and the loss of cardiac function leading to heart failure. SRF is a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of a large variety of genes involved in cardiac structure and function. To investigate the impact of an SRF overexpression in heart, we developed a new cardiac-specific and tamoxifen-inducible SRF overexpression mouse model by the Cre/loxP strategy. Here, we report that a high level overexpression of SRF leads to severe modifications of cardiac cytoarchitecture affecting the balance between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts and also a profound alteration of cardiac gene expression program. The drastic development of fibrosis was characterized by intense sirius red staining and associated with an increased expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, procollagen type 1α1 and type 3α1 and especially connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Furthermore miR-133a, one of the most predominant cardiac miRNAs, is strongly downregulated when SRF is overexpressed. By comparison a low level overexpression of SRF has minor impact on these different processes. Investigation with miR-133a, antimiR-133a and AdSRF-VP16 experiments in H9c2 cardiac cells demonstrated that: 1)-miR-133a acts as a repressor of SRF and CTGF expression; 2)-a simultaneous overexpression of SRF by AdSRF-VP16 and inhibition of miR-133a by a specific antimiR increase CTGF expression; 3)-miR-133a overexpression can block the upregulation of CTGF induced by AdSRF-VP16. Taken together, these findings reveal a key role of the SRF/CTGF/miR-133a axis in the regulation of cardiac fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2173081688,"Diatoms are very efficient in their use of available nutrients. Changes in nutrient availability influence the metabolism and the composition of the cell constituents. Since diatoms are valuable candidates to search for oil producing algae, measurements of diatom-produced compounds can be very useful for biotechnology. In order to explore the diversity of lipophilic compounds produced by diatoms, we describe the results from an analysis of 13 diatom strains. With the help of a lipidomics platform, which combines an UPLC separation with a high resolution/high mass accuracy mass spectrometer, we were able to measure and annotate 142 lipid species. Out of these, 32 were present in all 13 cultures. The annotated lipid features belong to six classes of glycerolipids. The data obtained from the measurements were used to create lipidomic profiles. The metabolomic overview of analysed cultures is amended by the measurement of 96 polar compounds. To further increase the lipid diversity and gain insight into metabolomic adaptation to nitrogen limitation, diatoms were cultured in media with high and low concentrations of nitrate. The growth in nitrogen-deplete or nitrogen-replete conditions affects metabolite accumulation but has no major influence on the species-specific metabolomic profile. Thus, the genetic component is stronger in determining metabolic patterns than nitrogen levels. Therefore, lipid profiling is powerful enough to be used as a molecular fingerprint for diatom cultures. Furthermore, an increase of triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation was observed in low nitrogen samples, although this trend was not consistent across all 13 diatom strains. Overall, our results expand the current understanding of metabolomics diversity in diatoms and confirm their potential value for producing lipids for either bioenergy or as feed stock."

The 40 patients with the pathological lesions located in the external carotid artery were classified as group 1 and were treated with embolization. The other 56 patients with the pathological lesions located in the trunk of the carotid artery were divided into 2 groups as follows: group 2A comprised the 38 patients treated with embolization, and group 2B comprised the 18 patients treated with stent-graft placement. Fisher's exact test was used to examine endovascular methods, clinical severities, and postprocedural clinical diseases as predictors of outcomes.Technical success and immediate hemostasis were achieved in all patients. The results according to endovascular methods (group 1 vs 2A vs 2B) were as follows: technical complication (1/40[2.5%] vs 9/38[23.7%] vs 9/18[50.0%], P = 0.0001); rebleeding (14/40[35.0%] vs 5/38[13.2%] vs 7/18[38.9%]), P = 0.0435). The results according to clinical severity (acute vs ongoing PCBS) were as follows: technical complication (15/47[31.9%] vs 4/49[8.2%], P = 0.0035); rebleeding (18/47[38.3%] vs 8/49[16.3%], P = 0.0155). The results according to post-procedural clinical disease (regressive vs progressive change) were as follows: alive (14/21[66.7%] vs 8/75[10.7%], P<0.0001); survival time (34.1±30.6[0.3-110] vs 3.6±4.0[0.07-22] months, P<0.0001).The outcomes of endovascular management of PCBS can be improved by taking embolization as a prior way of treatment, performing endovascular intervention in slight clinical severity and aggressive management of the post-procedural clinical disease."

However, genomics resources of pea are limited comparing to other crop species. Application of marker assisted selection (MAS) in pea breeding has lagged behind many other crops. Development of a large number of novel and reliable SSR (simple sequence repeat) or microsatellite markers will help both basic and applied genomics research of this crop. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 System was used to uncover 8,899 putative SSR containing sequences, and 3,275 non-redundant primers were designed to amplify these SSRs. Among the 1,644 SSRs that were randomly selected for primer validation, 841 yielded reliable amplifications of detectable polymorphisms among 24 genotypes of cultivated pea (Pisum sativum L.) and wild relatives (P. fulvum Sm.) originated from diverse geographical locations. The dataset indicated that the allele number per locus ranged from 2 to 10, and that the polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.08 to 0.82 with an average of 0.38. These 1,644 novel SSR markers were also tested for polymorphism between genotypes G0003973 and G0005527.

Following clinical assessment, children were tested with the QFT-IT assay.Among the 140 active TB suspects, we identified 19 cases of active disease. The overall sensitivity for active TB was 87.5%, ranging from 62.5% in children 25-36 months old to 100% in children older than 49 months. The overall specificity for active TB was 93.6%. Among the 481 children tested for LTBI screening, 38 scored positive and all but 2 had at least one risk factor for TB infection. Among the 26 children with indeterminate results, bacterial, viral or fungal pneumonia were later diagnosed in 11 (42.3%) cases and non-TB related extra-pulmonary infections in 12 (46.1%).Our results indicate that the children's response to QFT-IT associates to active TB and risk factors for LTBI. Moreover, we show that mitogen response is also found in children of 1 year of age, providing support for QFT-IT use also in young children."

However, the development of non-eosinophilic NPs which is a predominant subtype in Asian population still remains unclear.A total of 81 patients (45 with non-eosinophilic NPs and 36 with eosinophilic NPs) were enrolled. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT), endoscopic, and histological findings were investigated. Tissue samples were analyzed for total IgE levels and for mRNA expression levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23p19, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and periostin. Immunostaining assessment of Ki-67 as a proliferation marker was performed.We found that epithelial in-growing patterns such as pseudocysts were more frequently observed in histological and endoscopic evaluations of non-eosinophilic NPs, which was linked to increase epithelial staining of Ki-67, a proliferating marker. Eosinophilic NPs were characterized by high infiltration of inflammatory cells, compared with non-eosinophilic NPs. To investigate the developmental course of each subtype, CT was analyzed according to CT scores and subtypes. Non-eosinophilic NPs showed more localized pattern and maxillary sinus involvement, but lesser olfactory involvement in early stage whereas eosinophilic NPs were characterized by diffuse ethmoidal and olfactory involvement. In addition, high ethmoidal/maxillary (E/M) CT scores, indicating ethmoidal dominant involvement, were one of surrogate markers for eosinophilic NP. E/M CT scores was positively correlated with levels of TH2 inflammatory markers, including IL-4, IL-5, periostin mRNA expression and total IgE levels in NPs, whereas levels of the TH1 cytokine, IFN- γ were inversely correlated. Moreover, if the combinatorial algorithm meet the three of the four markers, including IL-5 (<2.379), periostin (<3.889), IFN-γ (>0.316), and E/M ratio (<2.167), non-eosinophilic CRSwNP are diagnosed with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 84.8%.Histologic, immunologic and clinical data suggest that non-eosinophilic NPs showed enhanced epithelial alteration and more localized maxillary involvement. Combination of cutoff value on IL-5, periostin, IFN-γ, and E/M scores may be one of surrogate markers for non-eosinophil NP subtype."

Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an attractive drug target. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of inosine 5'-monophosphate into xanthosine 5'-monophosphate with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. This reaction controls flux into the guanine nucleotide pool. We report seventeen selective IMPDH inhibitors with antitubercular activity. The crystal structures of a deletion mutant of MtbIMPDH2 in the apo form and in complex with the product XMP and substrate NAD+ are determined.

We included 538 anti-TNF naïve Danish RA patients from the nationwide DANBIO database. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to detect associations (p-value<0.05) between genotypes and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) treatment responses. False Discovery Rate corrections for multiple testing (q-value) and stratified analyses were performed to investigate association with individual therapies and IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) status.Six of twenty successfully genotyped polymorphisms were nominally associated with EULAR treatment response. Three of these were in weak to moderate linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms previously reported associated with anti-TNF treatment response. TLR5(rs5744174) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 1.7(1.1-2.5),p = 0.010,q = 0.46) and TLR1(rs4833095) homozygous variant carriers (OR = 2.8(1.1-7.4),p = 0.037,q = 0.46) had higher odds for a positive treatment response. NLRP3(rs10754558) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 0.6(0.4-1.0),p = 0.045,q = 0.46) were more likely to have a negative treatment response. The association in TLR5(rs5744174) remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons among patients negative for RF (OR = 6.2(2.4-16.3),p = 0.0002,q = 0.024). No other association withstood correction for multiple testing. Post hoc analyses showed that change in Patient Global score on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and change in pain VAS were the main factors responsible for the association.We reproduced previously reported associations between genetic variation in the TLR10/1/6 gene cluster, TLR5, and NLRP3 loci and response to anti-TNF treatment in RA. Changes in VAS pain and patient global scores were the main contributors to the association found for TLR5.

https://openalex.org/W1843357528,"Epidemiologic studies show a correlation between the dietary intake of food polyphenols and beneficial health effects. Several in vitro studies indicate that the anti-inflammatory potential of polyphenols is, at least in part, mediated by a modulation of the enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade, such as the prostaglandin forming cyclooxygenases (COXs). Evidence that this mode of action can be transferred to the situation in vivo is scarce. This study characterized effects of a subset of polyphenols on COX-2 expression and activity in vitro and compared the potency with known drugs. Next, the in vivo relevance of the observed in vitro effects was tested. Enzyme assays and incubations of polyphenols with the cancer cell line HCA-7 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated primary monocytes support the hypothesis that polyphenols can effect COX-2 expression and activity in vitro. The effects were most pronounced in the monocyte assay for wogonin, apigenin, resveratrol and genistein with IC50 values of 1.5 μM, 2.6 μM, 2.8 μM and 7.4 μM. However, these values are 100- to 1000-fold higher in comparison to those of the known pharmaceuticals celecoxib, indomethacin and dexamethasone. In an animal model of LPS induced sepsis, pretreatment with polyphenols (i. p. 100 mg/kg bw) did not result in decreased plasma or tissue prostaglandin levels, whereas the positive control celecoxib effectively attenuated LPS induced prostaglandin formation. These data suggest that despite the moderate potency in vitro, an effect of polyphenols on COX-2 during acute inflammation is unlikely, even if a high dose of polyphenols is ingested."
https://openalex.org/W1876960093,"Introduction Recently, the pleiotropic benefits of incretin-based therapy have been reported. We have previously reported that Exendin–4, a glucagon-like peptide–1 (GLP–1) receptor agonist, attenuates prostate cancer growth. Metformin is known for its anti-cancer effect. Here, we examined the anti-cancer effect of Exendin–4 and metformin using a prostate cancer model. Methods Prostate cancer cells were treated with Exendin–4 and/or metformin. Cell proliferation was quantified by growth curves and 5-bromo–2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. TUNEL assay and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation were examined in LNCaP cells. For in vivo experiments, LNCaP cells were transplanted subcutaneously into the flank region of athymic mice, which were then treated with Exendin–4 and/or metformin. TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumors. Results Exendin–4 and metformin additively decreased the growth curve, but not the migration, of prostate cancer cells. The BrdU assay revealed that both Exendin–4 and metformin significantly decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, metformin, but not Exendin–4, activated AMPK and induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. The anti-proliferative effect of metformin was abolished by inhibition or knock down of AMPK. In vivo, Exendin–4 and metformin significantly decreased tumor size, and further significant tumor size reduction was observed after combined treatment. Immunohistochemistry on tumors revealed that the P504S and Ki67 expression decreased by Exendin–4 and/or metformin, and that metformin increased phospho-AMPK expression and the apoptotic cell number. Conclusion These data suggest that Exendin–4 and metformin attenuated prostate cancer growth by inhibiting proliferation, and that metformin inhibited proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Combined treatment with Exendin–4 and metformin attenuated prostate cancer growth more than separate treatments."

Thus, we aimed to identify predicting factors for severe sepsis and assess the outcome of fluid resuscitation of such children. Methods In this retrospective case-control study SAM children aged 0–59 months, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh from April 2011 through July 2012 with history of cough or difficult breathing and radiologic pneumonia, who were assessed for severe sepsis at admission constituted the study population. We compared the pneumonic SAM children with severe sepsis (cases = 50) with those without severe sepsis (controls = 354). Severe sepsis was defined with objective clinical criteria and managed with fluid resuscitation, in addition to antibiotic and other supportive therapy, following the standard hospital guideline, which is very similar to the WHO guideline. Results The case-fatality-rate was significantly higher among the cases than the controls (40% vs. 4%; p<0.001). In logistic regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounders, lack of BCG vaccination, drowsiness, abdominal distension, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis at admission remained as independent predicting factors for severe sepsis in pneumonic SAM children (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusion and Significance We noted a much higher case fatality among under-five SAM children with pneumonia and severe sepsis who required fluid resuscitation in addition to standard antibiotic and other supportive therapy compared to those without severe sepsis. Independent risk factors and outcome of the management of severe sepsis in our study children highlight the importance for defining optimal fluid resuscitation therapy aiming at reducing the case fatality in such children."
https://openalex.org/W1881094167,"Parthenocarpic fruit development (PFD) reduces fruit yield and quality in grapevine. Parthenocarpic seedless berries arise from fruit set without effective fertilization due to defective pollen germination. PFD has been associated to micronutrient deficiency but the relation of this phenomenon with pollen polymorphism has not been reported before. In this work, six grapevine cultivars with different tendency for PFD and grown under micronutrient-sufficient conditions were analyzed to determine pollen structure and germination capability as well as PFD rates. Wide variation in non-germinative abnormal pollen was detected either among cultivars as well as for the same cultivar in different growing seasons. A straight correlation with PFD rates was found (R2 = 0.9896), suggesting that natural parthenocarpy is related to defective pollen development. Such relation was not observed when PFD was analyzed in grapevine plants exposed to exogenous gibberellin (GA) or abscissic acid (ABA) applications at pre-anthesis. Increase (GA treatment) or reduction (ABA treatment) in PFD rates without significative changes in abnormal pollen was determined. Although these plants were maintained at sufficient boron (B) condition, a down-regulation of the floral genes VvBOR3 and VvBOR4 together with a reduction of floral B content in GA-treated plants was established. These results suggest that impairment in B mobility to reproductive tissues and restriction of pollen tube growth could be involved in the GA-induced parthenocarpy."

Then, we artificially defined two statistical indexes (the chimeric distance and the overlap length), and their regular abundance distribution helped illustrate of the structural characteristics of the chimeras. Finally we analyzed the relationship between the chimera type and the average insertion size, so that illustrate a method to decrease the proportion of wasted data in the procedure of DNA library construction.131.4 Gb pair-end (PE) sequence data was reanalyzed for the chimeras. Totally, 40,259,438 read pairs (6.19%) with chimerism were discovered among 650,430,811 read pairs. The chimeric sequences are consisted of two or more parts which locate inconsecutively but adjacently on the chromosome. The chimeric distance between the locations of adjacent parts on the chromosome followed an approximate bimodal distribution ranging from 0 to over 5,000 nt, whose peak was at about 250 to 300 nt. The overlap length of adjacent parts followed an approximate Poisson distribution and revealed a peak at 6 nt. Moreover, unmapped chimeras, which were classified as the wasted data, could be reduced by properly increasing the length of the insertion segment size through a linear correlation analysis.This study exhibited the profile of the phi29MDA chimeras by tens of millions of chimeric sequences, and helped understand the amplification mechanism of the phi29 DNA polymerase. Our work also illustrated the importance of NGS data reanalysis, not only for the improvement of data utilization efficiency, but also for more potential genomic information."
https://openalex.org/W1788042824,"Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) can affect male reproductive function, but the underlying mechanism of this effect remains unknown. miRNA-mediated regulation has been implicated as an important epigenetic mechanism for regulatory pathways. Herein, we profiled miRNA expression in response to ELF-EMFs in vitro. Mouse spermatocyte-derived GC-2 cells were intermittently exposed to a 50 Hz ELF-EMF for 72 h (5 min on/10 min off) at magnetic field intensities of 1 mT, 2 mT and 3 mT. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were analyzed with flow cytometry. miRNA expression was profiled using Affymetrix Mouse Genechip miRNA 3.0 arrays. Our data showed that the growth, apoptosis or cell cycle arrest of GC-2 cells exposed to the 50 Hz ELF-EMF did not significantly change. However, we identified a total of 55 miRNAs whose expression significantly changed compared with the sham group, including 19 differentially expressed miRNAs (7 miRNAs were upregulated, and 12 were downregulated) in the 1 mT exposure group and 36 (9 miRNAs were upregulated, and 27 were downregulated) in the 3 mT exposure group. The changes in the expression of 15 selected miRNAs measured by real-time PCR were consistent with the microarray results. A network analysis was used to predict core miRNAs and target genes, including miR-30e-5p, miR-210-5p, miR-196b-5p, miR-504-3p, miR-669c-5p and miR-455-3p. We found that these miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to different magnetic field intensities of ELF-EMFs. GO term and KEGG pathway annotation based on the miRNA expression profiling results showed that miRNAs may regulate circadian rhythms, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and the p53 signaling pathway. These results suggested that miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers, and the miRNA-mediated regulation of signaling pathways might play significant roles in the biological effects of ELF-EMFs."
https://openalex.org/W1947077777,"Background and Objectives Identification of new targets for metabolic diseases treatment or prevention is required. In this context, FIAF/ANGPTL4 appears as a crucial regulator of energy homeostasis. Lactobacilli are often considered to display beneficial effect for their hosts, acting on different regulatory pathways. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of several lactobacilli strains on Fiaf gene expression in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and on mice tissues to decipher the underlying mechanisms. Subjects and Methods Nineteen lactobacilli strains have been tested on HT–29 human intestinal epithelial cells for their ability to regulate Fiaf gene expression by RT-qPCR. In order to determine regulated pathways, we analysed the whole genome transcriptome of IECs. We then validated in vivo bacterial effects using C57BL/6 mono-colonized mice fed with normal chow. Results We identified one strain (Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCMI–4317) that modulated Fiaf expression in IECs. This regulation relied potentially on bacterial surface-exposed molecules and seemed to be PPAR-γ independent but PPAR-α dependent. Transcriptome functional analysis revealed that multiple pathways including cellular function and maintenance, lymphoid tissue structure and development, as well as lipid metabolism were regulated by this strain. The regulation of immune system and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was also confirmed by overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms analysis. In vivo, circulating FIAF protein was increased by the strain but this phenomenon was not correlated with modulation Fiaf expression in tissues (except a trend in distal small intestine). Conclusion We showed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCMI–4317 induced Fiaf expression in human IECs, and increased circulating FIAF protein level in mice. Moreover, this effect was accompanied by transcriptome modulation of several pathways including immune response and metabolism in vitro."

There is no study to examine the incidence and risk factors of prehypertension in a sex stratified setting. The aim of this study was to examine the effect modification of sex for different risk factors which predicts the progression from normotension to prehypertension in a Middle East population-based cohort, during a median follow-up of 9.2 years.A multivariate Cox analysis was performed among 1466 and 2131 Iranian men and women, respectively, who were free of prehypertension, hypertension, CVD and diabetes at baseline and free of incident hypertension without preceding prehypertension at follow-up. Incident prehypertension at follow-up was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120-139 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 80-89 mmHg.Overall, 1440 new cases of prehypertension were identified resulting in an incidence rate of 593/10000 person-years; the corresponding values for women and men were 489/10000 and 764/10000person-years, respectively. There were significant interactions between gender with age, DBP, waist-to-hip-ratio (WHpR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (all P-values <0.05) in multivariate analysis. Strong associations were found between age, body mass index (BMI) and SBP with incident prehypertension in both genders. However, the effect of DBP and WHpR was significant among women and 2-hour post challenge plasma glucose (2h-PCPG)was an independent risk factor for men. In the sex-adjusted analysis, glomerular hyperfiltration [Hazard ratio (HR) and 95%CI: 1.01 (1.00-1.01), P-value = 0.02], age, BMI, WHpR, SBP and DBP had higher risks while being female [HR (95%CI): 0.81(0.69-0.94), P-value = 0.01] had a lower risk for incident prehypertension.According to this study results, among Iranian population with high incidence of prehypertension, general adiposity and glomerular hyperfiltration in total, 2h-PCPG in men and central adiposity in women should be emphasized as risk factors for prehypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2219940815,"Hyperkalemia increases the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hemodialysis patients. Our objective was to determine the association between administering low potassium dialysate to hyperkalemic hemodialysis patients and SCD.We conducted a retrospective cohort study with patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis from May 1, 2006, through December 31, 2013. The dialysate composition was adjusted over time according to monthly laboratory results. A 1.0 mEq/L potassium dialysate was applied in patients with predialysis hyperkalemia (>5.5 mEq/L) and was included as a time-dependent confounding factor. The clinical characteristics of enrolled patients, the incidence and timing of SCD and risk factors for all-cause mortality and SCD were analyzed.There were 312 patients on maintenance hemodialysis during the study period. One hundred and fifty-seven patients had been dialyzed against a 1.0 mEq/L potassium dialysate at least once. The rates of all-cause mortality and SCD were 48.17 and 20.74 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. A 1.12-fold increase in the risk of SCD in the 24-hour period starting with the hemodialysis procedure and a 1.36-fold increase in the 24 hours preceding a weekly cycle were found (p = 0.017). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models showed that age, diabetes mellitus and predialysis hyperkalemia (>5.0 mEq/L) were significant predictors of all-cause mortality and SCD. Exposure to 1.0 mEq/L potassium dialysate, Kt/V, and serum albumin were independent protective factors against all-cause mortality. Only exposure to 1.0 mEq/L potassium dialysate significantly prevented SCD (hazard ratio = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13-0.85).Using low potassium dialysate in hyperkalemic hemodialysis patients may prevent SCD."
https://openalex.org/W2111269200,"Accurate prediction of complex traits based on whole-genome data is a computational problem of paramount importance, particularly to plant and animal breeders. However, the number of genetic markers is typically orders of magnitude larger than the number of samples (p >> n), amongst other challenges. We assessed the effectiveness of a diverse set of state-of-the-art methods on publicly accessible real data. The most surprising finding was that approaches with feature selection performed better than others on average, in contrast to the expectation in the community that variable selection is mostly ineffective, i.e. that it does not improve accuracy of prediction, in spite of p >> n. We observed superior performance despite a somewhat simplistic approach to variable selection, possibly suggesting an inherent robustness. This bodes well in general since the variable selection methods usually improve interpretability without loss of prediction power. Apart from identifying a set of benchmark data sets (including one simulated data), we also discuss the performance analysis for each data set in terms of the input characteristics."

Objective The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of nickel allergy in women with and without endometriosis. Methods We used a National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) sample cohort dataset that included approximately 1 million individuals from South Korea; the data were obtained between January 01, 2002, and December 31, 2013. We selected the endometriosis group according to diagnosis code (N80.X), surgery codes, and drug codes during the years 2009~2013. The controls were randomly matched to the endometriosis patients at a ratio of 4:1 by age and socioeconomic status. Patients with nickel allergy were defined in the cohort dataset as those with a simultaneous diagnosis code (L23.0) and patch test code during 2002~2008. Results In total, 4,985 women were selected from the NHIS cohort database and divided into an endometriosis group (997 women) and a control group (3,988 women). The number of patients with nickel allergy in the endometriosis group was eight (0.8%), and that in the control group was thirteen (0.3%). After adjustment for age and socioeconomic status, the rate of nickel allergy in was higher in the endometriosis group than in the control group [odds ratio: 2.474; 95% confidence interval: 1.023~5.988; p = 0.044]. Conclusions We found that nickel allergy is a risk factor for endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W2337789734,"In recent years, the diagnostic and therapeutic uses of radioisotopes have shown significant progress. Immunoglobulin (Ig) appears to be a promising tracer, particularly due to its ability to target selected antigens. The main objective of this study is to optimize and assess an Ig radiolabeling method with Technetium 99m (99mTc), an attractive radioelement used widely for diagnostic imaging. Monoclonal anti-CD20 IgG was retained to study in vitro and in vivo radiolabeling impact. After IgG derivatization with 2-iminothiolane, IgG-SH was radiolabeled by an indirect method, using a 99mTc-tricarbonyl core. Radiolabeling stability was evaluated over 24h by thin-layer chromatography. IgG integrity was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with Western blot and autoradiography. The radiolabeled Ig's immunoaffinity was assessed in vitro by a radioimmunoassay method and binding experiments with cells (EL4-hCD20 and EL4-WT). Biodistribution studies were performed in normal BALB/c mice. Tumor uptake was assessed in mice bearing EL4-hCD20 and EL4-WT subcutaneous xenografts. With optimized method, high radiolabeling yields were obtained (95.9 ± 3.5%). 99mTc-IgG-SH was stable in phosphate-buffered saline (4°C and 25°C) and in serum (37°C), even if important sensitivity to transchelation was observed. IgG was not degraded by derivatization and radiolabeling, as shown by Western blot and autoradiography results. 99mTc-anti-CD20 IgG-SH immunoaffinity was estimated with Kd = 35 nM by both methods. In vivo biodistribution studies for 48h showed significant accumulation of radioactivity in plasma, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys. Planar scintigraphy of mice bearing tumors showed a significant uptake of 99mTc-anti-CD20 IgG-SH in CD20+ tumor versus CD20- tumor. Radiolabeling of derivatized IgG with 99mTc-tricarbonyl was effective, stable and required few antibody amounts. This attractive radiolabeling method is ""antibody safe"" and preserves Ig affinity for antigen, as shown by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This method could easily be used with noncommercial IgG or other antibody isotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2179077526,"Interleukin (IL)-20 is a proinflammatory cytokine in the IL-10 family. IL-20 is associated with tumor promotion in the pathogenesis of oral, bladder, and breast cancer. However, little is known about the role of IL-20 in prostate cancer. We hypothesize that IL-20 promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that IL-20 and its receptors were expressed in human PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines and in prostate tumor tissue from 40 patients. In vitro, IL-20 upregulated N-cadherin, STAT3, vimentin, fibronectin, RANKL, cathepsin G, and cathepsin K, and increased the migration and colony formation of prostate cancer cells via activated p38, ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-κB signals in PC-3 cells. We investigated the effects of anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody 7E on prostate tumor growth in vivo using SCID mouse subcutaneous and intratibial xenograft tumor models. In vivo, 7E reduced tumor growth, suppressed tumor-mediated osteolysis, and protected bone mineral density after intratibial injection of prostate cancer cells. We conclude that IL-20 is involved in the cell migration, colony formation, and tumor-induced osteolysis of prostate cancer. Therefore, IL-20 might be a novel target for treating prostate cancer."

Compared to naïve B cells, IgM memory B cells had lower integrated mean fluorescence intensity (iMFI) of BAFF-R, CD38, CD73, and IL-21R, but higher iMFI of CD95, CD11c, TLR9, PD-1, and CD122. Compared to switched memory B cells, IgM memory B cells had higher iMFI of BAFF-R, PD-1, IL-21R, TLR9, and CD122, but lower iMFI of CD38, CD95, and CD73. Four days after receiving the CpG/cytokine cocktail, higher frequencies of IgM than switched memory B cells—and these in turn greater than naïve cells—proliferated and differentiated to antibody secreting cells. At this time point, a small percentage (median of 7.6%) of stimulated IgM memory B cells changed isotype to IgG. Thus, among the heterogeneous population of human circulating IgM memory B cells a subset is capable of a rapid functional response to a CpG/cytokine stimulus in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2289922040,"Scutellarin (SCU), a flavonoid glycoside compound, has been successfully used in clinic for treatment of ischemic diseases in China. In this report, we checked the effects of SCU on endothelium dysfunction (ED) of coronary artery (CA) against myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MIR) injury in vivo. The involvement of PKG-Iα was further studied using cultured endothelial cells subjected to hypoxia reoxygenation (HR) injury in vitro. In rat MIR model, SCU (45 and 90 mg/kg, iv) significantly reduced ischemic size and restored the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated CA rings. PKG inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cGMP (50 μg/kg, iv) could ameliorate the protective effects of SCU. Increase in phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a main substrate of PKG, at Ser 239 was observed in both heart tissue and serum of SCU-treated animals. In cultured human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), SCU (1 and 10 μM) dose-dependently protected cell viability and increased the mRNA and protein level of PKG-Iα against HR injury. The activity of PKG was also increased by SCU treatment. The activation of PKG-1α was then studied using targeted proteomic analysis (MRM-MS) checking the phosphorylation state of the autophosphorylation domain (aa42-94). Significant decrease in phosphorylation of PKG-Iα at Ser50, Ser72, Ser89 was induced by HR injury while SCU treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of PKG-Iα, not only at Ser50, Ser72 and Ser89, but also at Ser44 and Thr58 (two novel phosphorylation domains). Our results demonstrate PKG-Iα might play an important role in the protective effects of SCU on ED against MIR injury."
https://openalex.org/W2220960297,"Background Observational studies (OS) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) often report discordant results. In the Women’s Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D (WHI CaD) RCT, women were randomly assigned to CaD or placebo, but were permitted to use personal calcium and vitamin D supplements, creating a unique opportunity to compare results from randomized and observational analyses within the same study. Methods WHI CaD was a 7-year RCT of 1g calcium/400IU vitamin D daily in 36,282 post-menopausal women. We assessed the effects of CaD on cardiovascular events, death, cancer and fracture in a randomized design- comparing CaD with placebo in 43% of women not using personal calcium or vitamin D supplements- and in a observational design- comparing women in the placebo group (44%) using personal calcium and vitamin D supplements with non-users. Incidence was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, and results from the two study designs deemed concordant if the absolute difference in hazard ratios was ≤0.15. We also compared results from WHI CaD to those from the WHI Observational Study(WHI OS), which used similar methodology for analyses and recruited from the same population. Results In WHI CaD, for myocardial infarction and stroke, results of unadjusted and 6/8 covariate-controlled observational analyses (age-adjusted, multivariate-adjusted, propensity-adjusted, propensity-matched) were not concordant with the randomized design results. For death, hip and total fracture, colorectal and total cancer, unadjusted and covariate-controlled observational results were concordant with randomized results. For breast cancer, unadjusted and age-adjusted observational results were concordant with randomized results, but only 1/3 other covariate-controlled observational results were concordant with randomized results. Multivariate-adjusted results from WHI OS were concordant with randomized WHI CaD results for only 4/8 endpoints. Conclusions Results of randomized analyses in WHI CaD were concordant with observational analyses for 5/8 endpoints in WHI CaD and 4/8 endpoints in WHI OS."

We made a study of household cases of pertussis during 2012 and 2013 in order to identify risk factors for hospitalization in pertussis cases. Each primary case reported triggered the study of their contacts. Close contacts at home and people who were in contact for >2 hours during the transmission period of cases were included. The adjusted OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using logistic regression. A total of 1124 pertussis cases were detected, of which 14.9% were hospitalized. Inspiratory whoop (aOR: 1.64; CI: 1.02–2.65), apnoea (aOR: 2.47; CI: 1.51–4.03) and cyanosis (aOR: 15.51; CI: 1.87–128.09) were more common in hospitalized than in outpatient cases. Hospitalization occurred in 8.7% of correctly-vaccinated cases, 41.1% of non-vaccinated cases and 9.4% of partially-vaccinated cases. In conclusion, inspiratory whoop, apnoea and cyanosis were associated factors to hospitalization while vaccination reduced hospitalizations due to pertussis."
https://openalex.org/W2268408435,"Liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), also known as fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1), is a key regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Elevated FABP1 levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndromes. In this study, we examine the association of FABP1 gene promoter variants with serum FABP1 and lipid levels in a Chinese population. Four promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FABP1 gene were genotyped in a cross-sectional survey of healthy volunteers (n = 1,182) from Fuzhou city of China. Results showed that only the rs2919872 G>A variant was significantly associated with serum TG concentration(P = 0.032).Compared with the rs2919872 G allele, rs2919872 A allele contributed significantly to reduced serum TG concentration, and this allele dramatically decreased the FABP1 promoter activity(P < 0.05). The rs2919872 A allele carriers had considerably lower serum FABP1 levels than G allele carriers (P < 0.01). In the multivariable linear regression analysis, the rs2919872 A allele was negatively associated with serum FABP1 levels (β = —0.320, P = 0.003), while serum TG levels were positively associated with serum FABP1 levels (β = 0.487, P = 0.014). Our data suggest that compared with the rs2919872 G allele, the rs2919872 A allele reduces the transcriptional activity of FABP1 promoter, and thereby may link FABP1 gene variation to TG level in humans."

Also, screening for IA to prevent aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is inefficient, as disease markers are lacking. We investigated gene expression profiles in blood of previous aSAH patients, who are still at risk for future IA, aiming to gain insight into the pathogenesis of IA and aSAH, and to make a first step towards improvement of aSAH risk prediction.We collected peripheral blood of 119 patients with aSAH at least two years prior, and 118 controls. We determined gene expression profiles using Illumina HumanHT-12v4 BeadChips. After quality control, we divided the dataset in a discovery (2/3) and replication set (1/3), identified differentially expressed genes, and applied (co-)differential co-expression to identify disease-related gene networks. No genes with a significant (false-discovery rate <5%) differential expression were observed. We detected one gene network with significant differential co-expression, but did not find biologically meaningful gene networks related to a history of aSAH. Next, we applied prediction analysis of microarrays to find a gene set that optimally predicts absence or presence of a history of aSAH. We found no gene sets with a correct disease state prediction higher than 40%.No gene expression differences were present in blood of previous aSAH patients compared to controls, besides one differentially co-expressed gene network without a clear relevant biological function. Our findings suggest that gene expression profiles, as detected in blood of previous aSAH patients, do not reveal the pathogenesis of IA and aSAH, and cannot be used for aSAH risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2337636184,"Bile acids have recently been demonstrated as molecules with endocrine activities controlling several physiological functions such as immunity and glucose homeostases. They act mainly through two receptors, the nuclear receptor Farnesol-X-Receptor alpha (FXRα) and the G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5). These recent studies have led to the idea that molecules derived from bile acids (BAs) and targeting their receptors must be good targets for treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity or diabetes. Thus it might be important to decipher the potential long term impact of such treatment on different physiological functions. Indeed, BAs have recently been demonstrated to alter male fertility. Here we demonstrate that in mice with overweight induced by high fat diet, BA exposure leads to increased rate of male infertility. This is associated with the altered germ cell proliferation, default of testicular endocrine function and abnormalities in cell-cell interaction within the seminiferous epithelium. Even if the identification of the exact molecular mechanisms will need more studies, the present results suggest that both FXRα and TGR5 might be involved. We believed that this work is of particular interest regarding the potential consequences on future approaches for the treatment of metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2337733289,"Cellular responses to starvation are of ancient origin since nutrient limitation has always been a common challenge to the stability of living systems. Hence, signaling molecules involved in sensing or transducing information about limiting metabolites are highly conserved, whereas transcription factors and the genes they regulate have diverged. In eukaryotes the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The yeast AMPK ortholog SNF1 controls the transcriptional network that counteracts carbon starvation conditions by regulating a set of transcription factors. Among those Cat8 and Sip4 have overlapping DNA-binding specificity for so-called carbon source responsive elements and induce target genes upon SNF1 activation. To analyze the evolution of the Cat8-Sip4 controlled transcriptional network we have compared the response to carbon limitation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to that of Kluyveromyces lactis. In high glucose, S. cerevisiae displays tumor cell-like aerobic fermentation and repression of respiration (Crabtree-positive) while K. lactis has a respiratory-fermentative life-style, respiration being regulated by oxygen availability (Crabtree-negative), which is typical for many yeasts and for differentiated higher cells. We demonstrate divergent evolution of the Cat8-Sip4 network and present evidence that a role of Sip4 in controlling anabolic metabolism has been lost in the Saccharomyces lineage. We find that in K. lactis, but not in S. cerevisiae, the Sip4 protein plays an essential role in C2 carbon assimilation including induction of the glyoxylate cycle and the carnitine shuttle genes. Induction of KlSIP4 gene expression by KlCat8 is essential under these growth conditions and a primary function of KlCat8. Both KlCat8 and KlSip4 are involved in the regulation of lactose metabolism in K. lactis. In chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments we demonstrate binding of both, KlSip4 and KlCat8, to selected CSREs and provide evidence that KlSip4 counteracts KlCat8-mediated transcription activation by competing for binding to some but not all CSREs. The finding that the hierarchical relationship of these transcription factors differs between K. lactis and S. cerevisiae and that the sets of target genes have diverged contributes to explaining the phenotypic differences in metabolic life-style."
https://openalex.org/W2283027720,"Previous research regarding anchoring effects has demonstrated that human judgments are often assimilated to irrelevant information. Studies have demonstrated that anchors influence the economic valuation of various products and experiences; however, the cognitive explanations of this effect remain controversial, and its neural mechanisms have rarely been explored. In the current study, we conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment to investigate the anchoring effect on willingness to accept (WTA) for an aversive hedonic experience and the role of anchors in this judgment heuristic. The behavioral results demonstrated that random numbers affect participants' WTA for listening to pieces of noise. The participants asked for higher pay after comparing their WTA with higher numbers. The EEG results indicated that anchors also influenced the neural underpinnings of the valuation process. Specifically, when a higher anchor number was drawn, larger P2 and late positive potential amplitudes were elicited, reflecting the anticipation of more intensive pain from the subsequent noise. Moreover, higher anchors induced a stronger theta band power increase compared with lower anchors when subjects listened to the noises, indicating that the participants felt more unpleasant during the actual experience of the noise. The levels of unpleasantness during both anticipation and experience were consistent with the semantic information implied by the anchors. Therefore, these data suggest that a semantic priming process underlies the anchoring effect in WTA. This study provides proof for the robustness of the anchoring effect and neural evidence of the semantic priming model. Our findings indicate that activated contextual information, even seemingly irrelevant, can be embedded in the construction of economic value in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2226284792,"Modelling crop evapotranspiration (ET) response to different planting scenarios in an irrigation district plays a significant role in optimizing crop planting patterns, resolving agricultural water scarcity and facilitating the sustainable use of water resources. In this study, the SWAT model was improved by transforming the evapotranspiration module. Then, the improved model was applied in Qingyuan Irrigation District of northwest China as a case study. Land use, soil, meteorology, irrigation scheduling and crop coefficient were considered as input data, and the irrigation district was divided into subdivisions based on the DEM and local canal systems. On the basis of model calibration and verification, the improved model showed better simulation efficiency than did the original model. Therefore, the improved model was used to simulate the crop evapotranspiration response under different planting scenarios in the irrigation district. Results indicated that crop evapotranspiration decreased by 2.94% and 6.01% under the scenarios of reducing the planting proportion of spring wheat (scenario 1) and summer maize (scenario 2) by keeping the total cultivated area unchanged. However, the total net output values presented an opposite trend under different scenarios. The values decreased by 3.28% under scenario 1, while it increased by 7.79% under scenario 2, compared with the current situation. This study presents a novel method to estimate crop evapotranspiration response under different planting scenarios using the SWAT model, and makes recommendations for strategic agricultural water management planning for the rational utilization of water resources and development of local economy by studying the impact of planting scenario changes on crop evapotranspiration and output values in the irrigation district of northwest China."

While the notion that this is a reflection of neuronal plasticity has gained much support, confounding by compensatory strategies cannot be ruled out. We address this issue by comparing brain activity in recovered patients 6 months after stroke with healthy controls. Methods We included 20 patients with upper limb paresis due to ischemic stroke and 15 controls. We measured brain activation during a finger flexion-extension task with functional MRI, and the relationship between brain activation and hand function. Patients exhibited various levels of recovery, but all were able to perform the task. Results Comparison between patients and controls with voxel-wise whole-brain analysis failed to reveal significant differences in brain activation. Equally, a region of interest analysis constrained to the motor network to optimize statistical power, failed to yield any differences. Finally, no significant relationship between brain activation and hand function was found in patients. Patients and controls performed scanner task equally well. Conclusion Brain activation and behavioral performance during finger flexion-extensions in (moderately) well recovered patients seems normal. The absence of significant differences in brain activity even in patients with a residual impairment may suggest that infarcts do not necessarily induce reorganization of motor function. While brain activity could be abnormal with higher task demands, this may also introduce performance confounds. It is thus still uncertain to what extent capacity for true neuronal repair after stroke exists."

Using animal models to identify and study host-derived factors that underlie this process can aid interventions in preventing tumor expansion and metastasis. In healthy steady states in humans and mice (e.g. C57BL/6 strain), colonic Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) gene expression is undetectable. However, this expression can be induced during intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis where CHI3L1 plays an important role in tissue restitution and cell proliferation. Here, we show that a wild-derived mouse strain MOLF/EiJ expresses high levels of colonic epithelial CHI3L1 at the steady state due to several nucleotide polymorphisms in the proximal promoter regions of the CHI3L1 gene. Interestingly, these mice spontaneously developed polypoid nodules in the colon with signs of immune cell infiltrations at steady state. The CHI3L1 positive colonic epithelial cells were highly proliferative and exhibited malignant transformation and expansion when exposed in vivo to azoxymethane, one of the well-known colonic carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W1950829059,"Long-term survival of T lymphocytes in quiescent state is essential to maintain their cell numbers in secondary lymphoid organs. In mice and in rats, the loss of functional GTPase of the immune associated nucleotide binding protein 5 (GIMAP5) causes peripheral T lymphopenia due to spontaneous death of T cells. The underlying mechanism responsible for the disruption of quiescence in Gimap5 deficient T cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that loss of functional Gimap5 results in increased basal activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), independent of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our results suggest that the constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway may be one of the consequences of the absence of functional GIMAP5."
https://openalex.org/W2262234360,"The introduction of invasive species represents a major threat to the integrity of stream-dwelling fish populations worldwide, and this issue is receiving increasing attention from scientists, in particular because of potential impact on biodiversity. In this study, we analysed the dispersal of an exotic loricariid fish the red fin dwarf pleco (Parotocinclus maculicauda) in a stream of the Atlantic Forest biome in coastal south-eastern Brazil and evaluated the effects of this invasion on the native loricariid common pleco (Hypostomus punctatus). Specimens were collected at eight sites located along the course of the stream over a 15-year period. The distribution and density of the two species were determined by the Successive Removal Method. The introduction of P. maculicauda occurred in the medium sector of the stream, and during the course of the study, the species dispersed to new sites further upstream. By the end of the study, it was found at all points upstream from the original site. Hypostomus punctatus was registered at all sample sites both before and after the introduction of P. maculicauda, but its density decreased at all upstream sites after the arrival of the exotic species. Our analysis shows that colonisation by P. maculicauda seems to have a negative effect on H. punctatus densities. The maintenance of H. punctatus densities at the sites not colonised by P. maculicauda reinforces the conclusion that the colonisation of the stream by the exotic species had deleterious effects on the density of the resident H. punctatus populations, either by direct or indirect action."
https://openalex.org/W2339065825,"The glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), is a xylem-feeding leafhopper and an important vector of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa; the causal agent of Pierce's disease of grapevines. MicroRNAs are a class of small RNAs that play an important role in the functional development of various organisms including insects. In H. vitripennis, we identified microRNAs using high-throughput deep sequencing of adults followed by computational and manual annotation. A total of 14 novel microRNAs that are not found in the miRBase were identified from adult H. vitripennis. Conserved microRNAs were also found in our datasets. By comparison to our previously determined transcriptome sequence of H. vitripennis, we identified the potential targets of the microRNAs in the transcriptome. This microRNA profile information not only provides a more nuanced understanding of the biological and physiological mechanisms that govern gene expression in H. vitripennis, but may also lead to the identification of novel mechanisms for biorationally designed management strategies through the use of microRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2213671545,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays important roles in the tumorigenesis of multiple cancers and is a key target for drug discovery. In a screen of natural products extracted from Chinese herbs, we identified eight ent-Kaurane diterpenoids and two triterpene dilactones as novel Hh pathway antagonists. Epistatic analyses suggest that these compounds likely act at the level or downstream of Smoothened (Smo) and upstream of Suppressor of Fused (Sufu). The ent-Kauranoid-treated cells showed elongated cilia, suppressed Smo trafficking to cilia, and mitotic defects, while the triterpene dilactones had no effect on the cilia and ciliary Smo. These ent-Kaurane diterpenoids provide new prototypes of Hh inhibitors, and are valuable probes for deciphering the mechanisms of Smo ciliary transport and ciliogenesis."
