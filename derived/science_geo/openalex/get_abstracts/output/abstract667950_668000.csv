Baruch et al. and Davar et al. report first-in-human clinical trials to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can affect how metastatic melanoma patients respond to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Woelk and Snyder). Both studies observed evidence of clinical benefit in a subset of treated patients. This included increased abundance of taxa previously shown to be associated with response to anti–PD-1, increased CD8 + T cell activation, and decreased frequency of interleukin-8–expressing myeloid cells, which are involved in immunosuppression. These studies provide proof-of-concept evidence for the ability of FMT to affect immunotherapy response in cancer patients. Science , this issue p. 602 , p. 595 ; see also p. 573"

At the average twist angle $\theta\sim 1.56^{\circ}$, a theoretically predicted magic angle for the formation of flat electron bands, narrow conduction and valence moir\'e bands appear together with a linearly dispersing Dirac band. Upon doping the half-filled moir\'e valence band with holes, or the half-filled moir\'e conduction band with electrons, displacement field tunable superconductivity emerges, reaching a maximum critical temperature of 2.1 K at optimal doping and displacement field. By tuning the doping level and displacement fields, we find that superconducting regimes occur in conjunction with flavour polarization of moir\'e bands bounded by a van Hove singularity (vHS) at high displacement fields. This experimental observation is found to be inconsistent with a weak coupling description, suggesting that the observed moir\'e superconductivity has an unconventional nature."

However, a workable route remains elusive. Here, we describe a practical strategy, namely de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice. By screening allotetraploid wild rice inventory, we identified one genotype of Oryza alta (CCDD), polyploid rice 1 (PPR1), and established two important resources for its de novo domestication: (1) an efficient tissue culture, transformation, and genome editing system and (2) a high-quality genome assembly discriminated into two subgenomes of 12 chromosomes apiece. With these resources, we show that six agronomically important traits could be rapidly improved by editing O. alta homologs of the genes controlling these traits in diploid rice. Our results demonstrate the possibility that de novo domesticated allotetraploid rice can be developed into a new staple cereal to strengthen world food security.

Our results demonstrate the possibility that de novo domesticated allotetraploid rice can be developed into a new staple cereal to strengthen world food security. To meet the world summit on food security, 50% more food is required by 2050, putting enormous pressure on increasing the yield per unit area (Bailey-Serres et al., 2019Bailey-Serres J. Parker J.E.

This challenge becomes even greater owing to rapid climate changes, which results in global warming, extreme high and low temperatures, more droughts and floods, new emergence of pests and diseases, and has already become an immense threat to agriculture and food security (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994Rosenzweig C.

Climate change impacts on global food security.Science. 2013; 341: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Environmental adaptation of major crops will involve a huge cost, and there is a great need to develop new high yield crops that are more resilient to climate variability and disasters (Nelson et al., 2009Nelson G.C.

Inst., 2009Google Scholar). Polyploidy, mostly resulting from whole genome duplications or interspecific hybridizations, is a common mode of evolution in flowering plants, and polyploid plants often have significant advantages in terms of biomass, vigorousness, and robust adaptation to environmental changes (Comai, 2005Comai L.

Therefore, crop polyploidization may play an important role in next-generation crop improvement aimed at facing food security challenges. The domestication of cultivated rice from its ancestral progenitor wild diploid rice Oryza rufipogon is considered one of the most important developments in human history, and rice is now the staple food feeding more than half of the world’s population (Huang et al., 2012Huang X. Kurata N. Wei X. Wang Z.X. Wang A. Zhao Q. Zhao Y. Liu K. Lu H. Li W. et al.A map of rice genome variation reveals the origin of cultivated rice.Nature. 2012; 490: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). During domestication, various important agronomical traits were selected, including seed shattering, erect plant architecture, panicle shape, awn length, grain size and quality, hull color, and so on (Chen et al., 2019Chen E. Huang X. Tian Z. Wing R.A. Han B. The genomics of Oryza species provides insights into rice domestication and heterosis.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2019; 70: 639-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the genomic era, diploid rice has become a model monocot species owing to its relatively simple genome and the development of efficient transformation systems (Izawa and Shimamoto, 1996Izawa T. Shimamoto K. Becoming a model plant: The importance of rice to plant science.Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 95-99Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Agronomically important genes controlling plant height, tiller number, panicle morphology, seed weight, etc. are well-studied and have been utilized to breed new elite varieties by rational design (Qian et al., 2016Qian Q.

Even so, new strategies for rice improvement are badly needed. Polyploidization of cultivated diploid rice species has also been proposed, but this presents difficulties mainly because of their restricted genetic backgrounds (Cai et al., 2007Cai D. Chen J. Chen D. Dai B. Zhang W. Song Z. Yang Z. Du C. Tang Z. He Y. et al.The breeding of two polyploid rice lines with the characteristic of polyploid meiosis stability.Sci.

Evol. 2014; 31: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date, 27 species of the genus Oryza have been identified and classified into 11 distinct genome types, comprising six diploids (AA, BB, CC, EE, FF, and GG) and five allotetraploids (BBCC, CCDD, HHJJ, HHKK, and KKLL) (Wing et al., 2018Wing R.A. Purugganan M.D. Zhang Q. The rice genome revolution: from an ancient grain to Green Super Rice.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Of these, the species with CCDD genome from South America have much larger biomass and stronger biotic and abiotic resistance than the cultivated diploid rice (Ammiraju et al., 2010aAmmiraju J.S. Fan C. Yu Y. Song X. Cranston K.A. Pontaroli A.C. Lu F. Sanyal A. Jiang N.

Plant Sci. 2018; 9: 417Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Allotetraploid rice with the CCDD genome originated from a single hybridization event, with the CC genome species (O. officinalis or O. rhizomatis) serving as the maternal parent and an extinct species with the DD genome type serving as the paternal donor (O. australiensis with the EE genome type is the extant closest relative of DD) (Ammiraju et al., 2010bAmmiraju J.S.

Genet. 2018; 19: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Research on allotetraploid rice has largely lagged behind the well-studied diploid rice species with AA genome because of the lack of a reference genome (Stein et al., 2018Stein J.C. Yu Y. Copetti D.

In vitro induction of auto-allotetraploid in a newly developed wild rice line from Oryza alta Swallen.Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult. 2019; 139: 577-587Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Domestication of wild plants is believed to have enormous potential for agriculture. The traditional domestication of wild plants into commercially available crops has usually taken hundreds or even thousands of years, but recently developed genome editing technologies make it possible to achieve this in a few generations (DeHaan et al., 2020DeHaan L.

De novo domestication of wild tomato using genome editing.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 1211-1216Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, efficient genome editing systems are badly needed to accelerate the pace of domestication. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation systems have been developed efficiently only in O. sativa subspecies japonica and indica (Hiei et al., 1994Hiei Y. Ohta S. Komari T. Kumashiro T.

Terada R. Izawa T. Fujimoto H. Fertile transgenic rice plants regenerated from transformed protoplasts.Nature. 1989; 338: 274-276Crossref Google Scholar); however, the transformation efficiency is still very low in O. glaberrima and in wild rice with AA genome (Lacchini et al., 2020Lacchini E.

Samad A.A. Rahmat Z. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice: constraints and possible solutions.Rice Science. 2019; 26: 133-146Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). As for allotetraploid wild rice, their transformation remains a formidable challenge, although some of them could be regenerated at an extremely low rate (Zhang et al., 2019Zhang L. Shivute F.N. Shahid M.Q. Kamara N. Wu J. Liu X.

Here, we describe a route for de novo domestication and improvement of a wild rice relative—the allotetraploid O. alta (CCDD)—by screening the wild allotetraploid rice inventory, establishing an efficient transformation and genome editing system, generating a high-quality annotated assembly of 24 chromosomes that illuminates the hereditary blueprint and evolutionary history of allotetraploid rice genomes, and genome-editing of domestication-related genes and agronomically important genes based on the knowledge of diploid rice. Our work offers a practical strategy for creating new crops to meet future food demand. To generate polyploid rice crops, we initiated a roadmap strategy, namely a de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice (Figure 1A). The whole process can be divided into four steps: step 1, selection of an appropriate starting material for de novo domestication; step 2, establishment of desirable technical systems including a reference genome, the functional annotation of genes and, importantly, an efficient transformation and genome editing system; step 3, design and rapid introduction by multiplex genome editing of domestication-related genes or alleles, followed by field evaluation; and step 4, certification and popularization of the new crop. However, neither a suitable starting material nor the required technical systems were initially available for wild allotetraploid rice. To identify the most promising starting material, we considered that callus induction and regeneration abilities were essential attributes, followed by suitable biomass characteristics and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Therefore, we collected seeds for 28 lines with CCDD genome from germplasm banks, comprising eight O. alta, two O. grandiglumis, and 18 O. latifolia lines, and tested their abilities of callus induction and regeneration using the typical methods for diploid rice (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang Y. Li J. Gao C. Generation of stable transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) by agrobacterium-mediated transformation.Curr. Protoc. Plant Biol. 2016; 1: 235-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that some of the lines had modest callus induction ability but most gave a very low rate of regeneration, except for one genotype of O. alta (accession ID 2007-24 from National Nursery of Wild Rice Germplasm, Nanning, China), which performed well for both callus induction and regeneration (Figure S1A; Table S1). Focusing on this line, we optimized the protocols and finally achieved a satisfactory transformation system with ∼80% transformation efficiency and ∼40% regeneration ability (Figures S1B–S1E). We therefore considered this material a model for further research into de novo domestication and named it polyploid rice 1 (PPR1). Importantly, PPR1 also had a low rate of heterozygosity (<0.2%) (Figure S2A), which is a positive feature for genome sequencing and assembly. Although it has a substantially larger biomass than cultivated rice, it has typical non-domesticated features, such as height >2.7 m (Figure 1B), broad and long leaves (Figure 1C), panicle >48 cm in length with sparse spikelets (Figure 1D), and small grain size (thousand-grain weight ∼8.79 g) with awns >4 cm (Figure 1E). In summary, we selected PPR1 as the starting model material for de novo domestication and established an efficient tissue culture and transformation system of it, thus overcoming one of the biggest hurdles in the process of de novo domestication.Figure S2Genome estimation and assembly of O. alta, related to Table 1Show full caption(A) Distribution of 31-mer in clean sequence data of the O. alta genome.

We took an integrated genome sequencing and assembling approach by generating 121.1 Gb (∼123.42X) of single-molecule real-time sequencing data, 287.1 Gb (∼292.62X) of BioNano data, 103.2 Gb (∼105.18X) of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data, and 85.2 Gb (∼86.79X) Illumina short reads (Figures S2B and S2C), and achieved a high-quality assembly comprising 24 pseudo-chromosomes with contig N50 of 18.2 Mb, superscaffold N50 of 37.1 Mb (PPR1 V1.0) (Table 1), and a total genome size of 894.6 Mb (876.4 Mb anchored on chromosomes). We then constructed a gene expression atlas by generating 235 Gb of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for ten representative tissues, which yielded an average 92.81% mapping rate to PPR1 V1.0 (Figures S3A and S3B). Of the 482,997 transcripts derived from transcriptome sequencing, 90.16% were detected in PPR1 V1.0 with more than 99% identity (Figure S3C). Finally, 99,312 protein-coding genes, including 81,421 high-confidence (HC) and 17,891 low-confidence genes with an average length of 3,021 bp, were predicted and functionally annotated (Figures S3D and S3E). In addition, we annotated 1,253 pseudogenes and 17,104 non-coding RNAs, including 12,332 microRNAs, 2,032 rRNAs, 1,147 tRNAs, 207 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), 1,057 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 10 signal recognition particle RNAs (srpRNAs), and 319 other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (Table S2). Of the predicted protein-coding genes, 99.94% were unevenly distributed over the 24 chromosomes with more genes on chromosome arms/ends (Figure 1F). We found 98.2% complete genes of the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) gene set (Seppey et al., 2019Seppey M. Manni M. Zdobnov E.M.

Among them, we identified 19,958 homeologous gene pairs, and the transcriptome analysis indicated that 5,732 homeologous gene pairs on the homologous chromosomes showed expression dominance in one gene. Although genome sizes differed noticeably between CC (∼651 Mb) and EE (∼965 Mb) species (Zuccolo et al., 2007Zuccolo A. Sebastian A. Talag J. Yu Y. Kim H. Collura K. Kudrna D. Wing R.A.

These findings further demonstrate the high quality and coverage of the allotetraploid PPR1 genome sequence.

Meanwhile, we found that 10,862 and 9,982 genes on the Ct and Dt subgenomes of O. alta found no homologs in cultivated diploid rice, possibly because the highly diverged homologs could not be reliably identified.

However, for the production of olefins, a key feedstock for other chemicals, about 50% of the CO is transformed to carbon dioxide and methane. Xu et al. decreased the selectivity for these undesired by-products to under 25% by modifying their catalyst, nanoparticles of iron doped with manganese and coated with a silica, with methyl groups (see the Perspective by Xie).

As the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β, PLA2G6 or PNPLA9 gene) can preferentially hydrolyze peroxidized phospholipids, it may eliminate the ferroptotic 15-HpETE-PE death signal. Here, we demonstrate that by hydrolyzing 15-HpETE-PE, iPLA2β averts ferroptosis, whereas its genetic or pharmacological inactivation sensitizes cells to ferroptosis. Given that PLA2G6 mutations relate to neurodegeneration, we examined fibroblasts from a patient with a Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated mutation (fPDR747W) and found selectively decreased 15-HpETE-PE-hydrolyzing activity, 15-HpETE-PE accumulation and elevated sensitivity to ferroptosis. CRISPR-Cas9-engineered Pnpla9R748W/R748W mice exhibited progressive parkinsonian motor deficits and 15-HpETE-PE accumulation. Elevated 15-HpETE-PE levels were also detected in midbrains of rotenone-infused parkinsonian rats and α-synuclein-mutant SncaA53T mice, with decreased iPLA2β expression and a PD-relevant phenotype. Thus, iPLA2β is a new ferroptosis regulator, and its mutations may be implicated in PD pathogenesis."

Paradoxically, a large fraction of a DNA-sensing enzyme called cGAS is tightly associated with the chromatin, especially during mitosis. Li et al. uncovered two mechanisms that prevent cGAS from being activated by the chromatin DNA (see the Perspective by Ablasser). First, cGAS is hyperphosphorylated as cells enter mitosis, thereby inhibiting its DNA-binding and liquid-liquid phase separation, which promotes cGAS activation. Second, chromatin-bound cGAS is unable to oligomerize, a process required for its activation. Together, these mechanisms ensure cGAS inactivation during cell division to prevent autoimmune reactions.

However, cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), a transient cell population that generates most of the craniofacial skeleton, have much broader differentiation potential than their ectodermal lineage of origin. Here, we identify a neuroepithelial precursor population characterized by expression of canonical pluripotency transcription factors that gives rise to CNCCs and is essential for craniofacial development. Pluripotency factor Oct4 is transiently reactivated in CNCCs and is required for the subsequent formation of ectomesenchyme. Furthermore, open chromatin landscapes of Oct4+ CNCC precursors resemble those of epiblast stem cells, with additional features suggestive of priming for mesenchymal programs. We propose that CNCCs expand their developmental potential through a transient reacquisition of molecular signatures of pluripotency."

Prior learning and innate architecture likely restrict neural plasticity, however. Here, we test how the incorporation of synthetic hippocampal signals is constrained by preexisting circuit dynamics. We optogenetically stimulated small groups of CA1 neurons as mice traversed a chosen segment of a linear track, mimicking the emergence of place fields. Stimulation induced persistent place field remapping in stimulated and non-stimulated neurons. The emergence of place fields could be predicted from sporadic firing in the new place field location and the temporal relationship to peer neurons before the optogenetic perturbation. Circuit modification was reflected by altered spike transmission between connected pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, which persisted during post-experience sleep. We hypothesize that optogenetic perturbation unmasked sub-threshold place fields. Plasticity in recurrent/lateral inhibition may drive learning through the rapid association of existing states."

Another approach being pursued is a modular platform in which the qubits are spatially separated. Daiss et al. demonstrate the operation of a quantum gate in which one qubit conditionally controls the state of another qubit spatially separated by 60 meters (see the Perspective by Hunger).

This cleavage should result in the programmed cell death of infected cells, but HIV-1 protease remains inactive and undetected as a subunit of the unprocessed Gag-Pol polyprotein.

Illuminating the material with ultrafast pulses of sub-bandgap light creates a transient waveguide, resulting in hyperbolic dispersion in the material.

https://openalex.org/W3128920979,"Adipose precursor cells (APCs) exhibit regional variation in response to obesity, for unclear reasons. Here, we reveal that HIFα-induced PDGFRβ signaling within murine white adipose tissue (WAT) PDGFRβ+ cells drives inhibitory serine 112 (S112) phosphorylation of PPARγ, the master regulator of adipogenesis. Levels of PPARγ S112 phosphorylation in WAT PDGFRβ+ cells are depot dependent, with levels of PPARγ phosphorylation in PDGFRβ+ cells inversely correlating with their capacity for adipogenesis upon high-fat-diet feeding. HIFα suppression in PDGFRβ+ progenitors promotes subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipogenesis, healthy WAT remodeling, and improved metabolic health in obesity. These metabolic benefits are mimicked by treatment of obese mice with the PDGFR antagonist Imatinib, which promotes adipocyte hyperplasia and glucose tolerance in a progenitor cell PPARγ-dependent manner. Our studies unveil a mechanism underlying depot-specific responses of APCs to high-fat feeding and highlight the potential for APCs to be targeted pharmacologically to improve metabolic health in obesity."

Reducing the mitochondrial β-oxidative capacity of PDGFRβ+ cells via inducible expression of MitoNEET drives a pro-inflammatory phenotype in adipose progenitors and alters lineage commitment. Furthermore, disrupting mitochondrial function in PDGFRβ+ cells rapidly induces alterations in immune cell composition in lean mice and impacts expansion of adipose tissue in diet-induced obesity. The adverse effects on adipose tissue remodeling can be reversed by restoring mitochondrial activity in progenitors, suggesting therapeutic potential for targeting energy metabolism in these cells."

By measuring indel frequencies, we developed a method for recording and measuring absolute time periods over hours to weeks in mammalian cells. These time-recordings were conducted in several cell types, with different promoters and delivery vectors for Cas9, and in both cultured cells and cells of living mice.

To elucidate which protein fibril characteristics determine if and how heterologous amyloid seeding can occur, we investigated the potential of amyloid fibrils formed from proteins found in food, hen egg white lysozyme, and bovine milk β-lactoglobulin to cross-seed aSyn aggregation in the test tube.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative protein aggregation disease (1Shastry B.S. Neurodegenerative disorders of protein aggregation.Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this disease, the soluble protein α-synuclein (aSyn) self-assembles into characteristic insoluble β-sheet rich amyloid fibrils that accumulate in so-called Lewy bodies inside neuronal cells of the brain (2Rambaran R.N. Serpell L.C. Amyloid fibrils.Prion. 2008; 2: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In diseased postmortem brain tissue, Lewy body pathology is accompanied by a loss of dopaminergic neurons. Although PD-related aSyn amyloid fibril formation has long been presumed to occur independently in affected cells, studies indicate that cell-to-cell transmission may play an important role in spreading of the disease (3McCann H.

These observations culminated in the idea that as the aggregation of aSyn into amyloid fibrils is a nucleation-dependent process, transmitted fibrils may act as nuclei and initiate aSyn aggregation in the recipient cell. Recently, studies showed that aSyn can indeed exert prion-like behavior which may play a role in the development of PD and other synucleopathies (5Angot E. Steiner J.A. Hansen C. Li J.Y. Brundin P.

It is of interest to investigate the potential of such nondisease–related proteins to cross-seed amyloid formation of a disease-related protein to obtain a better understanding of the biochemical or physicochemical requirements for the process of heterologous seeding but also in view of potential health risks. We here address if disease-related aSyn can be seeded by the addition of preformed fibril seeds from the nondisease–related proteins lysozyme and β-lactoglobulin in the test tube in buffer solution. The results show that lysozyme seeds, but not β-lactoglobulin seeds, potently induce the aggregation of aSyn into amyloid fibrils. The observed heterologous seeding activity of lysozyme is driven by a fibril surface-mediated nucleation process. The 140 amino acid sequence of aSyn can be divided into three regions: an amphipathic N-terminal region (amino acids 1–60), a hydrophobic central region (called nonabeta component or NAC, amino acids 61–95), and a negatively charged C-terminal region (amino acids 96–140) (28Ulmer T.S.

Our results show that selective seeding by lysozyme but not β-lactoglobulin fibrils seems to be driven by the net positive charge of the lysozyme fibrils causing aSyn to bind via its negatively charged C-terminal region leaving the aggregation prone NAC domain solvent exposed. ASyn can also bind the net negatively charged β-lactoglobulin fibril but in this interaction the NAC domain is involved and thus shielded from the solution. This prevents nucleation of aSyn aggregation on the surface of β-lactoglobulin fibrils. Our results highlight that the aggregation of disease-related amyloidogenic proteins can be heterologously seeded by nondisease–related proteins that share no homology and that the cross-seeding ability depends on the physicochemical properties of the seed. In this study, the heterologous seeding of aSyn aggregation by amyloid fibrils composed of the amyloidogenic food proteins hen egg white lysozyme and bovine milk β-lactoglobulin is investigated. We started by aggregating hen egg white lysozyme and bovine milk β-lactoglobulin to produce amyloid fibrils that served as a source of seeds upon sonication. Previously, the seeding capacity of amyloid fibrils was reported to depend on structural compatibility of seeds and monomers (17Sidhu A. Segers-Nolten I. Subramaniam V. Conformational compatibility is essential for heterologous aggregation of α-synuclein.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2016; 7: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we included two morphologically distinct β-lactoglobulin amyloid fibril populations (polymorphs) by aggregating the protein in a 13 mM NaCl (polymorph “B13”) and in a 100 mM NaCl (polymorph “B100”) containing buffer, as previously reported (30Arnaudov L.N. de Vries R. Strong impact of ionic strength on the kinetics of fibrilar aggregation of bovine β-lactoglobulin.Biomacromolecules. 2006; 7: 3490-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The resulting lysozyme and β-lactoglobulin aggregates bind the amyloid specific dye thioflavin-T (ThT) (Fig. S1), indicating that the food proteins organized into amyloid structures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 1) confirm that these amyloid structures are fibrils. Analysis of AFM images shows that under the aggregation conditions used, lysozyme fibrils vary in height between 4 and 12 nm with a periodicity of 80 to 120 nm. β-Lactoglobulin polymorph B13 fibrils show heights between 4 and 8 nm distributed over two populations with different periodicities: (i) with an average periodicity around 40 nm and (ii) with an average periodicity around 80 nm. Approximately 90% of the observed β-lactoglobulin polymorph B100 fibrils vary in height between 6 and 12 nm with an average periodicity of around 40 nm. The ability of amyloid fibrils to heterologously seed aSyn aggregation is reflected in the aSyn aggregation kinetics. Seeding is visible as a reduction of the lag phase duration compared to unseeded aggregation (31Arosio P. Knowles T.P.J. Linse S. On the lag phase in amyloid fibril formation.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015; 17: 7606-7618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address the question if fibrils composed of food proteins can heterologously seed the aggregation of aSyn, we incubated WT aSyn with small quantities of β-lactoglobulin or lysozyme fibril seeds that were generated by exposure of β-lactoglobulin and lysozyme fibrils to a sonication procedure. Judging from the increase in ThT fluorescence with time (Fig. S2A), the aggregation of WT aSyn (lag phase 41 ± 10 h) could not be cross-seeded by either of the β-lactoglobulin seed polymorphs (lag phase 47.6 ± 17 h for B100; data for B13 not shown), whereas the presence of lysozyme seeds significantly reduced the duration of the lag phase of WT aSyn aggregation (lag phase 19.5 ± 1.7 h). Depending on the seeding mechanism, (1) seeds are incorporated in the fibril transferring the seed morphology to the growing aSyn fibril (seed elongation) (32Törnquist M. Michaels T.C.T. Sanagavarapu K. Yang X. Meisl G. Cohen S.I.A. Knowles T.P.J. Linse S. Secondary nucleation in amyloid formation.Chem. Commun. 2018; 54: 8667-8684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, (2) the seed surface only acts as a catalyst for the nucleation of new aSyn fibrils (seed surface-mediated nucleation). In the latter case, the morphology of the fibril seed is not necessarily transferred. To investigate transmission of seed morphology to growing WT aSyn fibrils using AFM, differences in morphology of food protein fibrils and WT aSyn fibrils should be distinguishable. Preliminary AFM imaging of fibrils formed showed that the morphological characteristics of β-lactoglobulin, as characterized by fibril periodicity, and lysozyme fibrils largely overlap with those of WT aSyn fibrils (periodicity between 60–160 nm) (33Sidhu A. Segers-Nolten I. Raussens V. Claessens M.M.A.E. Subramaniam V. Distinct mechanisms determine α-synuclein fibril morphology during growth and maturation.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2017; 15: 538-547Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AFM analysis showed that the morphologies of lysozyme fibrils and E46K and A30P aSyn fibrils also overlap (Fig. S3). Only the morphologies of the lysozyme and A53T aSyn fibrils are sufficiently different to be distinguished in AFM experiments. The periodicity distribution of A53T aSyn fibrils is very disperse (100–550 nm) compared with the narrow distribution of lysozyme fibril periodicity (80–120 nm). Judging from the increase in ThT fluorescence with time, aggregation of A53T aSyn (Fig. S2B) in presence of lysozyme fibril seeds shows a similar trend to the results obtained with WT aSyn; the lag phase of A53T aSyn aggregation was significantly shorter in presence of lysozyme seeds. Hence, the transmission of lysozyme seed morphology was studied using A53T aSyn. To investigate if seeding by lysozyme seeds is accompanied by transmission of seed morphology to growing A53T fibrils, AFM images of heterologously seeded fibrils were recorded. Despite the finding that the lag phase of A53T aSyn fibril formation was significantly reduced by the presence of lysozyme, the morphological features of the formed A53T aSyn amyloid fibrils were not affected (Fig. 2) arguing for a seed surface-mediated nucleation mechanism. The lack of transfer of morphological characteristics of the lysozyme fibril seeds to growing aSyn fibrils hints toward a seed surface-mediated nucleation mechanism. Seeded fibril growth by seed elongation describes that monomeric protein is added at one or both extremities of the seeds. This type of seeding mechanism is characterized by a seeding efficiency that is directly proportional to the number of seed extremities present in the solution. Seed surface-mediated nucleation comprises the assembly of monomeric protein on the seed surface. In this case, the surface localized increase in monomer concentration induces the aggregation process, and the forming fibrils dissociate from the seed surface once a critical fibril mass has been formed. This type of seeding predicts that the seeding efficiency is directly proportional to the seed surface area available (32Törnquist M. Michaels T.C.T. Sanagavarapu K. Yang X. Meisl G. Cohen S.I.A. Knowles T.P.J. Linse S. Secondary nucleation in amyloid formation.Chem. Commun. 2018; 54: 8667-8684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further discriminate which of the two seeding mechanisms dictates the cross-seeding effect of lysozyme seeds on aSyn aggregation, WT aSyn was aggregated in the presence of different lysozyme seed concentrations and followed in time using optical density (OD) measurements (Fig. S4). The lag phase of aSyn aggregation was found to decrease with increasing concentration of lysozyme seeds (Fig. 3A). In a second experiment, lysozyme seeds of various lengths while preserving total seed mass were prepared by exposing mature lysozyme fibrils to sonication for different amounts of time. When WT aSyn was aggregated in the presence of a fixed equivalent monomer concentration of lysozyme seeds (Fig. S4), the lag phase was not significantly affected by a change in sonication time (Fig. 3B). The efficiency by which lysozyme seeds enhance aSyn aggregation is thus dependent on available seed surface area and not on the number of seed ends. To exclude that the decrease in the aggregation lag time of aSyn in the presence of lysozyme seeds results from seed elongation, fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed. For this, AF488-labeled monomeric aSyn was aggregated in the presence of AF647-labeled lysozyme seeds under conditions where cross-seeding is observed (Fig. 4A). The resulting amyloid fibrils were visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4B). Both green aSyn fibrils and red lysozyme fibrils can be individually observed without significant co-localization or overlap. The visual absence of green aSyn fibrils directly extending from red lysozyme fibrils indicates that aSyn monomers do not elongate from lysozyme seeds. Collectively, these results show that the seeding effect of lysozyme seeds on aSyn aggregation is primarily characterized by a seed surface–mediated nucleation mechanism. To explain why lysozyme seeds can cross-seed aSyn aggregation while β-lactoglobulin seeds lack this ability, we first considered the net charge of the seeds. Based on the pKa values of the amino acids, it is expected that aSyn and β-lactoglobulin are both net negatively charged at neutral pH, whereas lysozyme is net positively charged. To verify if information acquired on the basis of primary sequence translates into net oppositely charged amyloid fibril, we measured the zeta-potential of the seeds. As expected, while lysozyme seeds have a net positive surface charge, β-lactoglobulin polymorph B100 seeds have a net negative surface charge (Fig. 5). This observed difference in net surface charge potentially allows for attractive electrostatic interaction between lysozyme and aSyn. Such a mechanism would predict that lysozyme and β-lactoglobulin seeds show differential binding characteristics with aSyn. To investigate this, microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments were performed. In these experiments, fluorescently labeled aSyn was titrated with lysozyme or β-lactoglobulin seeds. Binding curves were measured, and dissociation constants (KD) were derived from these curves. Because the seed surface–mediated nucleation process depends on the surface area and not on the particle concentration, this KD is determined as an equivalent monomer concentration. From the MST binding curves (Fig. 6), a lower limit to the equilibrium dissociation constants was determined. The obtained KD for the interaction with aSyn has a lower limit of 309 ± 34 μM for β-lactoglobulin seeds and 13 ± 11 μM for lysozyme seeds (based on triplicate measurements). Even though aSyn binds more strongly to lysozyme seeds than to β-lactoglobulin seeds, the micromolar binding affinities demonstrate a relatively weak interaction. In theory, such weak interactions may enable the assembly of surface-associated aSyn into energetically more favorable structures; strong binding would interfere with the structural rearrangements required for seed surface-mediated nucleation processes to take place. The observed order of magnitude difference in KD between binding to lysozyme and β-lactoglobulin fibrils may not directly explain the difference in the ability to cross-seed aSyn aggregation but is consistent with a seed surface–mediated nucleation mechanism. While the observed weak affinities of β-lactoglobulin and lysozyme seeds for aSyn binding do not sufficiently explain the difference in aSyn cross-seeding activity, it is possible that the aSyn regions involved in the interaction with the two types of seeds are different. As the aggregation prone region of aSyn has been identified as the NAC region (34Hashimoto M. Takenouchi T. Mallory M. Masliah E. Culvenor J.G. McLean C.A. Campbell B.C.V. Masters C.L. Li Q.X. Jakala P. Hartmann T. Beyreuther K. The role of NAC in amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease [2] (multiple letters).Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 734-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we anticipate that β-lactoglobulin and lysozyme seeds differentially affect exposure of this region to become available for aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we employed an ELISA-based technique, based on the principle that if an aSyn region is involved in seed interaction, it is unavailable for interaction with a region-specific antibody. After coating of a 96-well plate with β-lactoglobulin or lysozyme seeds, monomeric WT aSyn was added to each well followed by incubation with one of three primary antibodies targeting different regions of aSyn: against the NAC region (epitope: aSyn 61–95), C-tail (epitope: aSyn 120–140), and full length aSyn (“FL”). As it was difficult to precisely quantify the amount of lysozyme or β-lactoglobulin seeds coated in each well, per type of aSyn-seed complex the resulting chemiluminescence signals of the C-tail antibody experiments were divided by either the signal intensities obtained using the NAC or FL targeting antibodies. Even though based on this assay the specific region with which the seeds interact cannot be identified, comparison of resulting C-tail/NAC ratios (Fig. 7) suggests that a large difference exists in the availability of these regions upon incubation of aSyn with seeds derived from either lysozyme or β-lactoglobulin. The C-tail/NAC ratio is higher when aSyn is incubated with β-lactoglobulin seeds compared with when aSyn is incubated with lysozyme seeds. These results imply that the C-tail of aSyn is relatively exposed in the presence of β-lactoglobulin seeds compared with lysozyme seeds. At the same time, the NAC region interacts in binding, albeit at low affinity (as observed from MST), with β-lactoglobulin but not lysozyme seeds. The interaction between aSyn C-tail and lysozyme seeds should decrease the long-range repulsion between aSyn monomers and thus promote aggregation. To support our hypothesis that the interaction of the C-terminus of aSyn with the lysozyme seed is important for cross seeding to occur, a competitive cross-seeding experiment was performed. In this experiment, a C-terminal aSyn peptide comprising of amino acids 96 to 140 and full-length WT aSyn competed for cross-seeding with the lysozyme seeds in an aggregation experiment. The presence of the C-terminal peptide significantly elongated (p-value = 0.026) the aggregation lag time (Fig. 8). The increase in the lag time indicates that aSyn C-tail peptide competes with WT aSyn binding to lysozyme seeds. The occupation of the binding sites on the lysozyme surface by the aSyn C-tail peptide decrease the ability of lysozyme seeds to catalyze the aggregation of WT aSyn. This agrees with the expected role of charge–charge interactions between the net negatively charged aSyn C-tail and the net positively charged lysozyme surface in mediating the interaction. The clinically observed co-occurrence of various protein aggregation–associated pathologies is poorly understood. For example, Lewy body-pathology is frequently observed in Alzheimer's disease suggesting that aggregation of aSyn co-occurs with the characteristic precipitation of Alzheimer's disease proteins Aβ peptide and tau (35Brunnström H. Englund E. Clinicopathological concordance in dementia diagnostics.Am. J. Geriatr. Psychiatry. 2009; 17: 664-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Echávarri C.

In this method, swabs are pooled at the time of collection, as opposed to pooling of equal volumes from individually collected samples. Paired analysis of pooled and individual samples from 613 patients revealed 94 positive individuals. Having individual testing as reference, no false-positives or false-negatives were observed for swab pooling. In additional 18,922 patients screened with swab pooling (1,344 pools), mean Cq differences between individual and pool samples ranged from 0.1 (Cr.I. -0.98 to 1.17) to 2.09 (Cr.I. 1.24 to 2.94). Overall, 19,535 asymptomatic patients were screened using 4,400 RT-qPCR assays. This corresponds to an increase of 4.4 times in laboratory capacity and a reduction of 77% in required tests. Therefore, swab pooling represents a major alternative for reliable and large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 in low prevalence populations."

Methods Data from seven waves of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (1994–2014) were analyzed for trends and projections of U5M and a Chi-square (χ 2 ) test was used to identify if there was any association with maternal high-risk fertility behaviours and use of healthcare services. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the effects of fertility behaviors and healthcare usage on the occurrence of U5M adjusting with confounders. Results U5M declined from 82.5 to 41.0 per 1000 livebirths during 1994–2014 and is projected to further reduce to 17.6 per 1000 livebirths by 2030. The study identified a noticeable regional variation in U5M with maternal high-risk fertility behaviours including age at birth &lt;18 years (aOR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.23–2.76) and birth interval &lt;24 months (aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.02–2.37) found to be significant determinants. There was a 39–53% decline in this rate of mortality among women that had used antenatal care services at least four times (aOR, 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27–0.97), delivery care (aOR, 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24–0.95), and had received postnatal care (aOR, 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41–0.91) in their last birth. Cesarean section was found to be associated with a 51% reduction in U5M (aOR, 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29–0.82) compared to its non-use. Conclusion The Sustainable Development Goals require a U5M rate of 25 per 1000 livebirths to be achieved by 2030. This study suggests that with the current trend of reduction, Bangladesh will achieve this target before the deadline. This study also found that maternal high-risk fertility behaviours and non-use of maternal healthcare services are very prevalent in some regions of Bangladesh and have increased the occurrence of U5M in those areas. This suggests therefore, that policies and programmes designed to reduce the pregnancy rates of women that are at risk and to encourage an increase in the use of maternal healthcare services are needed."

https://openalex.org/W3128046150,"The feeding pattern and control of energy intake in mice housed in groups are poorly understood. Here, we determined and quantified the normal feeding microstructure of social male and female mice of the C57BL/6J genetic background fed a chow diet. Mice at 10w, 20w and 30w of age showed the expected increase in lean and fat mass, being the latter more pronounced and variable in males than in females. Under ad libitum conditions, 20w and 30w old females housed in groups showed significantly increased daily energy intake when adjusted to body weight relative to age-matched males. This was the combined result of small increases in energy intake during the nocturnal and diurnal photoperiods of the day without major changes in the circadian pattern of energy intake or spontaneous ambulatory activity. The analysis of the feeding microstructure suggests sex- and age-related contributions of meal size, meal frequency and intermeal interval to the control of energy intake under stable energy balance, but not under negative energy balance imposed by prolonged fasting. During the night, 10-20w old females ate less frequently bigger meals and spent more time eating them resulting in reduced net energy intake relative to age-matched males. In addition, male and female mice at all ages tested significantly shortened the intermeal interval during the first hours of re-feeding in response to fasting without affecting meal size. Further, 20-30w old males lengthened their intermeal interval as re-feeding time increased to reach fed-levels faster than age-matched females. Collectively, our results suggest that the physiological mechanisms controlling meal size (satiation) and the non-eating time spent between meals (satiety) during stable or negative energy balance are regulated in a sex- and age-dependent manner in social mice."

The FoF1–ATP synthase is a multisubunit protein complex capable of coupling ATP synthesis/hydrolysis with transmembrane proton translocation. In eukaryotes, this nanomachine is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of two parts, the matrix-facing F1 and the membrane-embedded Fo. The F1 domain, known as F1-ATPase, is responsible for the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, and it consists of a heterohexamer of α and β subunits and a central stalk (subunits γ, δ, and ε) that connects the (αβ)3-headpiece to the Fo section. The core of the Fo section consists of a ring of c subunits that tightly interacts with subunit a, a highly hydrophobic subunit encoded by the mitochondrial genome in most eukaryotes, including trypanosomatids (1Walker J.E.

Aside from the central stalk, the interaction between the Fo and F1 domains is mediated by the peripheral stalk, an elongated structure that immobilizes the (αβ)3-headpiece during the rotation of the central rotor shaft (central stalk plus c-ring) by directly binding to subunits α and β (1Walker J.E.

The peculiarities of T. brucei FoF1–ATP synthase are not restricted only to complex composition. A remarkable feature of this complex is that its activity depends on the parasite's life cycle. The procyclic form (PCF), also known as insect midgut stage, harbors a conventional mitochondrion where the FoF1–ATP synthase produces ATP (forward mode) using the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane generated by the proton-pumping activity of respiratory complexes III and IV (8Zikova A.

In contrast, the infectious stage of the mammalian host, termed long slender bloodstream form (BSF), lacks a cytochrome-mediated electron transport chain and respires exclusively via the alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway (14Smith T.K.

The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is generated by the proton-pumping activity (reverse mode) of the FoF1–ATP synthase (aka FoF1–ATPase) complex at the expense of ATP (15Nolan D.P. Voorheis H.P. The mitochondrion in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei is energized by the electrogenic pumping of protons catalysed by the F1F0-ATPase.Eur. J.

The F1-ATP synthase complex in bloodstream stage trypanosomes has an unusual and essential function.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hence, T. brucei represents a unique eukaryotic system that allows to study both modes of the FoF1–ATP synthase in physiological settings and the distinct bioenergetic consequences upon the loss of either of the activities. The reverse mode of the FoF1–ATP synthase complex is used by some prokaryotes (17Futai M. Kanazawa H. Structure and function of proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (F0F1): Biochemical and molecular biological approaches.Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 285-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is unusual in eukaryotes, where it occurs under rare nonphysiological and stress conditions, such as hypoxia or anoxia. In these cases, the respiratory arrest and subsequent collapse of the ΔΨm causes a reversal of the FoF1–ATP synthase to generate a modest ΔΨm (18Chinopoulos C. Adam-Vizi V. Mitochondria as ATP consumers in cellular pathology.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1802: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Chinopoulos C. Mitochondrial consumption of cytosolic ATP: Not so fast.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reversal of FoF1–ATP synthase also takes place in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, which maintain ΔΨm by an electrogenic exchange of ATP4− for ADP3− by the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) coupled to ATP hydrolysis by an incomplete FoF1–ATPase (20Chen X.J.

The depletion of ATP due to the hydrolytic activity of the FoF1–ATP synthase during ischemic conditions is mitigated by a unidirectional inhibitor, the inhibitory factor 1 (23Campanella M. Casswell E. Chong S. Farah Z. Wieckowski M.R. Abramov A.Y. Tinker A. Duchen M.R.

Noteworthy, in T. brucei, the expression of inhibitory factor 1 is tightly regulated throughout the parasite's life cycle, and its experimental expression in BSF trypanosomes results in cell death (24Panicucci B.

ATPaseTb1 (Tb1 in short; systematic TriTrypDB.org ID Tb927.10.520) (47 kDa) is one of the 14 lineage-specific subunits and the largest Fo subunit of the T. brucei FoF1–ATP synthase complex (8Zikova A. Schnaufer A. Dalley R.A. Panigrahi A.K. Stuart K.D. The F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase complex contains novel subunits and is essential for procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (named Tb7760 in that study, after its previous systematic TriTrypDB ID TB10.70.7760). Downregulation of Tb1 in PCF trypanosomes inhibits cell growth, destabilizes FoF1–ATP synthase, and affects both the ATP synthetic and hydrolytic activities of the complex (8Zikova A. Schnaufer A. Dalley R.A. Panigrahi A.K. Stuart K.D. The F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase complex contains novel subunits and is essential for procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we studied in more detail the mitochondrial phenotypes associated with the downregulation of Tb1 in PCF cells and further explore the role of this subunit, as well as that of the peripheral subunit oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP), in the BSF stage. Tb1, the largest membrane-associated subunit of the T. brucei FoF1–ATP synthase, has homologs in representatives of the Euglenozoa group but appears to be absent from other eukaryotic lineages (8Zikova A. Schnaufer A. Dalley R.A. Panigrahi A.K. Stuart K.D. The F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase complex contains novel subunits and is essential for procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In agreement with the reduced size and activity of the mitochondrion in the BSFs of T. brucei (26Vertommen D. Van Roy J. Szikora J.P. Rider M.H. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Differential expression of glycosomal and mitochondrial proteins in the two major life-cycle stages of Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 158: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Tb1 is less abundant in BSF cells than in PCF cells and barely detectable in the mitochondrial DNA-lacking (aka akinetoplastic) strains T. b. brucei Dk 164 and Trypanosoma brucei evansi AnTat 3/3 (Fig. 1A). To confirm the submitochondrial localization of Tb1 and determine how it is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, we performed carbonate extraction of mitochondria purified from T. brucei cells expressing C-terminally v5-tagged Tb1 (Fig. 1B). Tb1 is found exclusively in the membrane fraction, and the marker proteins, enolase, mitochondrial RNA-binding protein 1, and AAC, are detected in their expected compartments: cytosol, mitochondrial matrix, and mitochondrial membrane, respectively. This result suggests that Tb1 is an integral membrane protein. In PCF and BSF cells, Tb1 is present in fully assembled FoF1–ATP synthase monomers and dimers, as documented by high-resolution clear native electrophoresis (Fig. 1C) and sedimentation in glycerol gradient (Fig. 1D) followed by Western blot analyses with a specific anti-Tb1 antibody. In glycerol gradients, the Tb1 antibody detected, in addition to Tb1 migrating with the FoF1–ATP synthase, nonspecific bands of ∼40 kDa and 42 kDa in PCF and of 55 kDa in BSF, which are identified by the asterisk (Fig. 1D). Our observations that Tb1 is present in fully assembled FoF1–ATP synthase are in agreement with a recent cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the FoF1–ATP synthase dimer from Euglena gracilis, a closely related free-living species within the Euglenozoa group, in which Tb1 is found on the matrix side of the membrane part of the complex at the peripheral stalk base (6Muhleip A. McComas S.E. Amunts A. Structure of a mitochondrial ATP synthase with bound native cardiolipin.Elife. 2019; 8e51179Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We predicted the structure of T. brucei Tb1 using E. gracilis Tb1 as a template (Fig. 1E). The modeling showed that both Tb1 orthologs share a fold similar to the mitochondrial distribution and morphology protein 38 (Mdm38) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a protein suggested to be involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial-encoded subunit a into the Fo moiety (27Frazier A.E. Taylor R.D. Mick D.U. Warscheid B. Stoepel N. Meyer H.E. Ryan M.T. Guiard B. Rehling P. Mdm38 interacts with ribosomes and is a component of the mitochondrial protein export machinery.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although several algorithms predicted one transmembrane helix in Tb1, the protein does not span the inner mitochondrial membrane. Instead, the presumptive transmembrane region occurs as a HTH motif intruding into the membrane (Fig. 1E), and therefore, Tb1 is a monotopic membrane protein. Previously, we showed that Tb1 silencing in PCF cells leads to decreased steady-state levels of fully assembled FoF1–ATP synthase complexes, and, therefore, to less ATP produced by substrate-stimulated oxidative phosphorylation in digitonin-permeabilized cells (8Zikova A. Schnaufer A. Dalley R.A. Panigrahi A.K. Stuart K.D. The F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase complex contains novel subunits and is essential for procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we explored in more detail the effect of Tb1 silencing on mitochondrial physiology and bioenergetics of PCF cells. As expected, Tb1 silencing caused a progressive growth phenotype detected first at day 4 of RNAi induction (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis using a specific anti-Tb1 antibody showed that Tb1 protein expression was reduced to less than 10% at day 2 of RNAi induction (Fig. 2B). The downregulation of Tb1 was accompanied by a decrease in the steady-state level of the peripheral stalk subunit Tb2, whereas the abundance of the F1 moiety subunit β was not as strongly affected (Fig. 2B). The structural integrity and the activity of the FoF1–ATP synthase complex were assessed by blue native electrophoresis (BNE) followed by Western blotting and in-gel activity staining of the complex, respectively (Fig. 2C). Western blot analyses of native complexes showed a significant reduction of FoF1–ATP synthase monomers and dimers at days 2 and 4 of RNAi induction. In agreement with the steady-state levels of subunit β, the free F1-ATPase moiety was assembled and active, and it accumulated in Tb1-silenced cells. The decreased levels of fully assembled FoF1–ATP synthase complexes affected ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (8Zikova A. Schnaufer A. Dalley R.A. Panigrahi A.K. Stuart K.D. The F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase complex contains novel subunits and is essential for procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000436Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which was reflected by a ∼25% reduction in the total cellular ATP levels (Fig. 2D) and by a 50% increase in the ADP/ATP ratio (Fig. 2E) by day 4 of RNAi induction. Suppression of Tb1 expression also caused a mild, but statistically significant, increase in ΔΨm at day 2 of RNAi induction (Fig. 2F), but notably, this increase was only transient. In PCF cells, the ΔΨm is maintained by the activity of respiratory complexes III and IV, passing electrons from ubiquinol to molecular oxygen. However, electrons can be rerouted to another electron acceptor, a plant-like AOX, which reduces molecular oxygen to water without proton translocation (28Chaudhuri M. Ott R.D. Hill G.C. Trypanosome alternative oxidase: From molecule to function.Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 484-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). By doing so, PCF cells can uncouple cellular respiration from ΔΨm generation. To test if the cells responded to the hyperpolarization detected at day 2 by rewiring the electrons toward AOX, we measured the oxygen consumption rate in the presence of potassium cyanide (KCN) and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), inhibitors of complex IV and AOX, respectively. Indeed, we detected that the respiration of Tb1-silenced cells is more sensitive to SHAM compared with KCN, confirming the higher proportion of AOX-mediated respiration (Fig. 2G). This rerouting of electrons was accompanied by an increase in AOX expression as determined by Western blot (Fig. 2B). Because complex III is one of the major producers of harmful superoxide (O2⋅−) molecules, an important subclass of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (29Brand M.D. The sites and topology of mitochondrial superoxide production.Exp. Gerontol. 2010; 45: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), we measured the mitochondrial concentration of O2⋅− before and after Tb1 RNAi in PCF cells (Fig. 2H). We found that O2⋅− decreased over time after Tb1 ablation, supporting the proposed rerouting of electrons from complexes III and IV toward AOX, perhaps as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress (30Maxwell D.P.

Alternative oxidase expression in the mouse enables bypassing cytochrome c oxidase blockade and limits mitochondrial ROS overproduction.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9e1003182Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite the lower levels of mitochondrial O2⋅−, the disruption of fully assembled FoF1–ATP synthase induced changes in cellular physiology that ultimately led to higher levels of various cytosolic ROS molecules (e.g., peroxyl, hydroxyl) as measured by dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCFHDA), a fluorescent ROS-sensitive dye (Fig. 2I). This gradual increment of oxidative stress might have contributed to the growth phenotype observed in parasites with suppressed Tb1 expression. In contrast to the canonical role of the FoF1–ATP synthase in PCF cells, BSF cells use the reverse activity of this complex, which generates ΔΨm at the expense of ATP (15Nolan D.P. Voorheis H.P. The mitochondrion in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei is energized by the electrogenic pumping of protons catalysed by the F1F0-ATPase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Schnaufer A. Clark-Walker G.D. Steinberg A.G. Stuart K. The F1-ATP synthase complex in bloodstream stage trypanosomes has an unusual and essential function.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We silenced Tb1 in BSF cells by using an RNAi construct targeting the 3’ region of the Tb1 ORF. This caused a decrease of Tb1 to 11% at day 2 of RNAi induction, reaching undetectable levels of the protein at day 3 (Fig. 3A). As expected, the BSF Tb1 3’ RNAi cell line exhibited a strong growth phenotype and ceased growing entirely by day 4 of induction (Fig. 3B). The steady-state levels of F1–ATPase subunits β and p18 were decreased by ∼40% at day 2, whereas the steady-state levels of the Fo-associated subunits Tb2 and OSCP dropped to ∼10% (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the levels of AAC were decreased by 60% (Fig. 3C), suggesting that disruption of the FoF1–ATPase might affect the stability of this transporter. As in PCF cells, Tb1 downregulation caused a strong decrease of FoF1–ATPase monomers and dimers while there was a simultaneous increase in free F1 subcomplex (Fig. 3D, Fig. S1A). Similarly, a conditional double knock-out (cDKO) of OSCP resulted in undetectable levels of OSCP at day 2 (Fig. 3E), which was accompanied by a strong growth phenotype (Fig. 3F). In this cell line, termed BSF OSCP cDKO, both OSCP alleles were replaced by drug resistance cassettes, and an ectopic copy of the OSCP gene, whose expression depends on the presence of tetracycline in the culture medium, was introduced (Fig. S2). The removal of tetracycline led to ablation of OSCP expression, reduced levels of F1 subunits to ∼80%, and Fo subunits to ∼10% (Fig. 3G), as well as virtually complete loss of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the complex (Fig. 3H, Fig. S1B), by day 2 of tetracycline removal. To investigate the effect of the FoF1–ATPase loss on ΔΨm, we used flow cytometry analysis of intact, live cells stained with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). In both BSF Tb1 3’ RNAi and OSCP cDKO cell lines, the ΔΨm was strongly compromised at day 2 of RNAi induction and tetracycline removal, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B), preceding the observed growth defect. To corroborate these results, we determined the ability of the mitochondrion to generate ΔΨm in digitonin-permeabilized cells using safranin O dye. Control BSF Tb1 3’ RNAi and OSCP cDKO cells were able to build up and retain a ΔΨm, as addition of ATP caused a decrease in safranin O fluorescence, indicating stacking of the dye within the energized organelle. This decrease was completely reversed by adding either oligomycin (Fig. 4, C and D, black lines) or carboxyatractyloside (Fig. S3, A and D, black lines), inhibitors of the FoF1–ATP synthase and the AAC, respectively. Subsequent addition of the uncoupler SF 6847 had no further effect on depolarization. In contrast, cells silenced for Tb1 or ablated for OSCP were unable to generate ΔΨm in situ (Fig. 4, C and D, red lines). No changes in fluorescence were detected when the addition of oligomycin or carboxyatractyloside preceded that of ATP (Fig. S3, B, C, E and F), confirming that the decrease in safranin O fluorescence observed in control cells indeed depends on the ATP-hydrolyzing activity of the FoF1–ATPase and on the ADP/ATP exchanging activity of the AAC. In summary, these measurements indicate that, in the absence of either Tb1 or OSCP, BSF cells cannot generate ΔΨm, presumably because the proton-pumping FoF1–ATPase is completely disrupted in these cells. Because the activity of the F1–ATPase is tightly connected to the cellular ADP/ATP pool (33Chinopoulos C. The “B space” of mitochondrial phosphorylation.J. Neurosci. Res. 2011; 89: 1897-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we measured the cellular ADP/ATP ratio in control BSF Tb1 3’ RNAi and OSCP cDKO cells and in cells with diminished Tb1 and OSCP expression. The ADP/ATP ratio was already significantly decreased at day 1 (Fig. 4, E and F), the opposite of the effect observed in PCF cells (compare Fig. 2E), likely because of the dysfunctional FoF1–ATPase. Higher levels of ATP than ADP may also affect the glycolytic flux, which is directly linked to respiration via the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (34Bakker B.M. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. What controls glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei?.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14551-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and/or activity of AOX (35Alberto Luevano-Martinez L. Girard R. Alencar M.B. Silber A.M.

Indeed, decreased levels of FoF1–ATPase caused lower glycerol-3-phosphate–stimulated oxygen consumption in digitonin-permeabilized BSF cells depleted of Tb1 or OSCP (Fig. 4, G and H). As expected, in both samples, the measured respiration was fully inhibited by addition of SHAM. The virtually complete ablation of either Tb1 or OSCP (Fig. 3, A and E) is lethal for BSF trypanosomes, and this is in agreement with previous studies examining FoF1–ATPase subunits (9Gahura O.

Homologous recombination (HR) of DNA involves multifaceted processes and pathways that respond to various types of DNA damage agents encountered during S/G2 phases of mitotic cells (1Wright W.D.

Recombination occurring during meiosis can generate crossovers for genetic diversity and proper segregation in germline cells, utilizing many of the same enzymes (3Hunter N.

Therefore, HR is vital for genomic integrity and diversity required for organismal survival. Defects in either mitotic or meiotic HR can directly contribute to increased cancer susceptibility and infertility through improper chromosomal rearrangements that represent incomplete intermediates and are hallmarks of disease. Various DNA helicases contribute to several steps in the recombination pathways either facilitating or dissolving hybrid DNA recombinants (5Huselid E. Bunting S.F. The regulation of homologous recombination by helicases.Genes (Basel). 2020; 11: 498Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Their individualized roles and substrate specificities in HR are commonly overlapping, making absolute distinctions of function difficult. MCM8 and MCM9 are recent additions to the roster of DNA helicases involved in HR (6Griffin W.C.

They are members of the ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities (AAA+) superfamily and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family of proteins that includes MCM2-7 as the heterohexameric helicase complex central to the replication fork. The MCM8/9 complex does not appear to interact directly with MCM2-7, nor is it essential for replication (7Gambus A. Blow J.J.

This results in diminished DNA damage signaling as exhibited by decreased phosphorylated CHK1 (pCHK1) and increased double-strand breaks (DSBs) as indicated by H2AX foci in the presence of various fork stalling or cross-linking agents. The absence of functional MCM8 or 9 impairs HR mediated fork rescue after damage through decreased recruitment of Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN), RPA, and RAD51. In fact, MCM8/9 has been shown to be required for MRN nuclease activity to generate single-strand DNA (ssDNA) for HR after treatment with cisplatin (Cis-Pt) (10Lee K.Y. Im J.S. Shibata E. Park J.

In fact, deficiencies in MCM8 or 9 are phenotypically similar to Fanconi anemia (FA) patient mutations (21Giampietro P.F. Adler-Brecher B. Verlander P.C. Pavlakis S.G. Davis J.G. Auerbach A.D.

MCM9 mutations are also linked to hereditary mixed polyposis and colorectal cancer, commonly caused by loss of function in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) (23Poulogiannis G. Frayling I.M. Arends M.J.

Like that found for BRCA1/2-deficient cells, MCM8 or 9 deficient cells are hypersensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors indicating a link between fork progression and BRAC1/2-mediated HR repair that can be exploited in the clinic for synthetically lethal therapies with platinum-based DNA cross-linking agents (32Morii I. Iwabuchi Y. Mori S. Suekuni M. Natsume T. Yoshida K. Sugimoto N. Kanemaki M.T. Fujita M. Inhibiting the MCM8-9 complex selectively sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin and olaparib.Cancer Sci. 2019; 110: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). MCM9 contains a unique and large C-terminal extension (CTE) not found in the other MCM family members and can be alternatively spliced to give a shorter MCM9M isoform that retains the conserved helicase domains but removes the CTE (33Jeffries E.P. Denq W.I. Bartko J.C. Trakselis M.A. Identification, quantification, and evolutionary analysis of a novel isoform of MCM9.Gene. 2013; 519: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The CTE is a common feature in other HR helicases and is generally considered to be unstructured with scattered putative amino acid motifs that can impact protein interactions and affect proper function (6Griffin W.C. Trakselis M.A. The MCM8/9 complex: A recent recruit to the roster of helicases involved in genome maintenance.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2019; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, no such motifs or role for the CTE has been identified for MCM9. Here, we can show that the CTE in MCM9 plays an essential role in nuclear import and formation of DNA repair foci after treatment with the cross-linking agent, mitomycin C (MMC). We have identified and validated a unique “bipartite-like” nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the CTE that directs the nuclear import of MCM8. Finally, we have also identified a BRCv motif that is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to sites of MMC-induced damage that is analogous to that found in other HR helicases (34Islam M.N. Paquet N. Fox 3rd, D. Dray E. Zheng X.F. Klein H. Sung P. Wang W. A variant of the breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein (BRC) repeat is essential for the RECQL5 helicase to interact with RAD51 recombinase for genome stabilization.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23808-23818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The overall results confirm an influential role for the CTE of MCM9 in importing the MCM8/9 complex into the nucleus, directing it to sites of cross-link damage, and recruiting RAD51 for downstream repair. We and others have shown previously that MCM8 and MCM9 are generally localized to the nucleus and form nuclear foci after damage with MMC (11Nishimura K. Ishiai M. Horikawa K. Fukagawa T. Takata M. Takisawa H. Kanemaki M.T. Mcm8 and Mcm9 form a complex that functions in homologous recombination repair induced by DNA interstrand crosslinks.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17AlAsiri S. Basit S. Wood-Trageser M.A. Yatsenko S.A. Jeffries E.P. Surti U. Ketterer D.M. Afzal S.

Invest. 2015; 125: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, we sought to examine which of the domains of MCM9 (Fig. 1A) are required for nuclear foci formation after MMC treatment. MCM9 contains a unique CTE that comprises 42% of the 1143 amino acids and 52 kDa of the total 127 kDa molecular weight of the full-length protein. The CTE is more hydrophilic compared with the rest of the protein, has a higher disorder probability, and is likely mostly unstructured (Fig. S1). As the CTE of MCM9 is predicted to have high disorder and low secondary structure, we sought to directly measure the solution structure composition of various MCM9 CTE truncations (Fig. 1B) using circular dichroism (CD). Spectra for both MCM9 643 to 900 and 680 to 900 show a pronounced minimum at 201 nm (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with significant disorder (35Chemes L.B. Alonso L.G. Noval M.G. de Prat-Gay G. Circular dichroism techniques for the analysis of intrinsically disordered proteins and domains.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 895: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There are shallow valleys from 215 to 230 nm indicative of minor α-helical and antiparallel β-sheet characteristics, but the overall spectrum is representative of a highly disordered (∼50%) protein, indicated as “other” in the quantification (Fig. 1D). For the limited secondary structure, the two truncations are highly similar with only ∼7% helical and ∼30% β-sheet. Full-length MCM9-GFP (MCM9L) is nuclear and forms a significant number of nuclear foci upon treatment with the cross-linking agent MMC (Fig. 2, A–C). Interestingly, the transfection of the alternatively spliced MCM9 product (MCM9M) (33Jeffries E.P. Denq W.I. Bartko J.C. Trakselis M.A. Identification, quantification, and evolutionary analysis of a novel isoform of MCM9.Gene. 2013; 519: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) showed primarily cytoplasmic staining, while MCM9Cterm showed concise nuclear staining but an absence of repair foci with MMC. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extractions of various MCM9-GFP transfected constructs were used to validate these observations in a population of cells and quantified by calculating nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratios (Fig. 2D). MCM9L is more nuclear than cytoplasmic; MCM9M is primarily cytoplasmic; and MCM9Cterm is more nuclear, while alpha-Tubulin and Lamin B1 were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear controls, respectively. Quantification of the nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratios show values above 1 for both MCM9L and MCM9Cterm but below 1 for MCM9M that lacks the CTE, which are statistically different. Although MCM9Cterm does not form MMC-induced foci, it does interact with chromatin probably though the winged-helix domain contained in the CTE (Fig. S2). Therefore, the CTE directs MCM9 into the nucleus, but the helicase core is required for localization to DNA repair sites. As MCM9Cterm had predominantly nuclear staining but MCM9M did not, we searched for nuclear localization sequences (NLS) in the CTE and found four conserved, high-confidence putative NLS sequences (pNLS) (Fig. S3). These four pNLS sequences were individually mutated in MCM9L-GFP, transfected into U2OS cells, and the localization was examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3, A and B). U2OS cells were used because of their larger nuclei that can be easily distinguished from cytoplasmic areas. Mutation of pNLS1 or pNLS2 resulted in primarily cytoplasmic staining indicating a lack of nuclear import. Alternatively, mutation of pNLS3 and pNLS4 had no noticeable effect on nuclear import. Interestingly, mutation of either pNLS1 or pNLS2 alone had a clear effect on nuclear import, indicating that a bipartite NLS1/NLS2 is required; however, the linker between NLS1 and NLS2 spans 67 a.a., much longer than a canonical bipartite NLS that generally has a 10 to 12 a.a. linker. Therefore, the import signal motif for MCM9 is “bipartite-like” consisting of dual NLS1/NLS2 motifs connected by an extended linker region. To unequivocally show the effect of mutating NLS1 or NLS2 in a population of cells, we performed nuclear and cytosolic extractions on MCM9L-GFP construct transfected into 293T cells (Fig. 3C). Again, wild-type (WT) MCM9L is confined more in the nuclear fraction than the cytoplasm as indicated by N/C = 1.5. However, mutation of either NLS1 or NLS2 shows a significant decrease in the N/C ratio. This result confirms a requirement for both NLS1 and NLS2 in the CTE of MCM9 for efficient import into the nucleus. We also searched in silico for a pNLS in MCM8, but no high-confidence motifs were detected. Therefore, we hypothesized that the NLS1/2 in the CTE of MCM9 may be responsible for nuclear import of the MCM8/9 complex. Therefore, we created custom CRISPR-Cas9 MCM8 or MCM9 knockout cell lines from 293T cells with significant multiallelic indels and validated phenotypically with severe MMC sensitivity (Fig. S4). To confirm if knockout of MCM9 disrupts import of MCM8 into the nucleus, MCM8-GFP was transfected into the MCM9KO cell line (Fig. 4B) . In WT 293T cells, MCM8-GFP is primarily nuclear and forms foci with MMC treatment (Fig.4A); however, in MCM9KO cells, the MCM8-GFP staining is diffuse throughout the cytoplasm, not localized to the nucleus, and fails to form MMC-induced nuclear foci (Fig. 4B). Transfection of MCM9L-GFP or MCM9M-GPF into MCM8KO cells (Fig. 4C) shows essentially the same results (as in Fig. 2, B and C) with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, respectively. Therefore, MCM8 is imported into the nucleus complexed with MCM9 as directed by the “bipartite-like” NLS1/NLS2. The BRC repeat sequence is a structural motif in the breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein (BRCA2) that is utilized to promote RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation during fork reversal or recombination (36Shivji M.K. Mukund S.R. Rajendra E. Chen S. Short J.M. Savill J. Klenerman D. Venkitaraman A.R. The BRC repeats of human BRCA2 differentially regulate RAD51 binding on single- versus double-stranded DNA to stimulate strand exchange.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 13254-13259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The eight repeats in BRCA2 show a consensus BRC motif sequence (Fig. S5), and variants of these BRC motifs (BRCv) have been found in other proteins including RECQL5 and yeast helicases Srs2, Sgs1, Mph1, and Pif1 (34Islam M.N. Paquet N. Fox 3rd, D. Dray E. Zheng X.F. Klein H. Sung P. Wang W. A variant of the breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein (BRC) repeat is essential for the RECQL5 helicase to interact with RAD51 recombinase for genome stabilization.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23808-23818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The BRCv motif in RECQL5 is shown to be important for interacting with RAD51, directing D-loop and filament formation, and responding to cross-linking stress. In our examination of the expansive and unique CTE of MCM9, we also identified a putative BRCv motif that is similar to that found in RECQL5 and adjacent to a predicted WH motif important for DNA binding (Fig. 5, A and B). The BRCv consensus sequence within motif 1, FxTASxxxϕxϕS, is highly similar to the BRC repeats themselves FxTASGKxϕxϕS (where “ϕ” represents hydrophobic residues). BRCv motif 2 occurs after a linker region in these HR helicases that is not present in BRCA2 and is less well conserved. However, a small hydrophobic/electrostatic patch in Motif 2, ϕL(D/E)-(D/E), is present in MCM9 and similar to RECQL5. Both BRCv motifs 1 and 2 in MCM9 are well conserved across Mammalia species, but less conserved in other metazoans (Fig. S5B). Structural modeling of the MCM9 BRCv motif threaded onto BRCA2-BRC4 component in complex with RAD51 (34Islam M.N. Paquet N. Fox 3rd, D. Dray E. Zheng X.F. Klein H. Sung P. Wang W. A variant of the breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein (BRC) repeat is essential for the RECQL5 helicase to interact with RAD51 recombinase for genome stabilization.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 23808-23818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) shows the importance of the universally conserved F687 residue binding deep into a hydrophobic pocket of RAD51 (Fig. 5C and Fig. S5C). Other conserved residues (T689, S690, S691, I695, and Y697) within motif 1 make backbone and side-chain contacts across a path of hydrophobic surface area. Residues within motif 2 make both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding contacts with RAD51 that would loop out the linker region in between (Fig. S5, D and E). Leu714 is predicted to make hydrophobic contacts with RAD51 residues 254-5 and 258-9. Our model also predicts that Glu722 and Asn724 make H-bond contacts with Tyr205 and Arg250 of RAD51, respectively. Together MCM9 BRCv motifs 1 and 2 are predicted to make sufficient hydrophobic surface area contacts with RAD51 that are anchored by F687. To test whether mutation of the MCM9 BRCv motif has any effect on foci formation in MMC treated cells, we transfected mutated MCM9-GFP constructs (FR687/8AA, F687E, and L720A) into 293T cells (Fig. 5, D and E). The GFP fluorescence for the BRCv mutants was nuclear as expected, but MMC did not induce significant foci formation in any of these mutants. Quantification of cells with >5 foci with MMC treatment for WT (78.7 ± 8.0%) versus BRCv− mutants: F687A/R688A (12.2 ± 0.8%), F687E (20.2 ± 0.8%), and L687A (10.4 ± 0.5%) show significant differences (Fig. 5E) and illustrate the importance of the bipartite BRCv motif in directing downstream DNA repair. As both BRCA1 and RAD51 form MMC-induced nuclear foci (37Pichierri P. Averbeck D. Rosselli F. DNA cross-link-dependent RAD50/MRE11/NBS1 subnuclear assembly requires the Fanconi anemia C protein.Hum.

https://openalex.org/W3126819379,"The K+/Cl- cotransporter KCC2 (SLC12A5) allows mature neurons in the CNS to maintain low intracellular Cl- levels that are critical in mediating fast hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition via type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs). In accordance with this, compromised KCC2 activity results in seizures, but whether such deficits directly contribute to the subsequent changes in neuronal structure and viability that lead to epileptogenesis remains to be assessed. Canonical hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents develop postnatally, which reflect a progressive increase in KCC2 expression levels and activity. To investigate the role that KCC2 plays in regulating neuronal viability and architecture, we have conditionally ablated KCC2 expression in developing and mature neurons. Decreasing KCC2 expression in mature neurons resulted in the rapid activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Intriguingly, direct pharmacological inhibition of KCC2 in mature neurons was sufficient to rapidly induce apoptosis, an effect that was not abrogated via blockade of neuronal depolarization using tetrodotoxin (TTX). In contrast, ablating KCC2 expression in immature neurons had no discernable effects on their subsequent development, arborization, or dendritic structure. However, removing KCC2 in immature neurons was sufficient to ablate the subsequent postnatal development of hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents. Collectively, our results demonstrate that KCC2 plays a critical role in neuronal survival by limiting apoptosis, and mature neurons are highly sensitive to the loss of KCC2 function. In contrast, KCC2 appears to play a minimal role in mediating neuronal development or architecture."
https://openalex.org/W3126418960,"Fibronectin (FN) is an abundant glycoprotein found in plasma and the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is present at high concentrations at sites of tissue damage, where it is exposed to oxidants generated by activated leukocytes, including peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) formed from nitric oxide (from inducible nitric oxide synthase) and superoxide radicals (from NADPH oxidases and other sources). ONOOH reacts rapidly with the abundant tyrosine and tryptophan residues in ECM proteins, resulting in the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine, di-tyrosine, and 6-nitrotryptophan. We have shown previously that human plasma FN is readily modified by ONOOH, but the <i>extent</i> and <i>location</i> of modifications, and the role of FN structure (compact <i>versus</i> extended) in determining these factors is poorly understood. Here, we provide a detailed LC-MS analysis of ONOOH-induced FN modifications, including the extent of their formation and the sites of intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links, including Tyr-Tyr, Trp-Trp, and Tyr-Trp linkages. The localization of these cross-links to specific domains provides novel data on the interactions between different modules in the compact conformation of plasma FN and allows us to propose a model of its unknown quaternary structure. Interestingly, the pattern of modifications is significantly different to that generated by another inflammatory oxidant, HOCl, in both extent and sites. The characterization and quantification of these modifications offers the possibility of the use of these materials as specific biomarkers of ECM modification and turnover in the many pathologies associated with inflammation-associated fibrosis."

In three controlled-environment experiments, ictB insertion increased leaf starch and sucrose content by up to 25% relative to controls. Experimental field trials in four growing seasons, spanning the Midwestern United States (Summers 2018 &amp; 2019) and Argentina (Winter 2018 &amp; 2019), showed an average of 3.49% grain yield improvement, by as much as 5.4% in a given season and up to 9.4% at certain trial locations. A subset of field trial locations was used to test for modification of ear traits and ФPSII, a proxy for photosynthesis. Results suggested that yield gain in transgenics could be associated with increased ФPSII, and the production of longer, thinner ears with more kernels. ictB localized primarily to the microsome fraction of leaf bundle-sheath cells, but not to chloroplasts. Extramembrane domains of ictB interacted in vitro with proteins involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence of ictB insertion into a species using C 4 photosynthesis and the largest-scale demonstration of grain yield enhancement from ictB insertion in planta . Results show that ictB is a valuable yield gene in the economically important crop maize, and are an important proof of concept that transgenic manipulation of photosynthesis can be used to create economically viable crop improvement traits."

Direct-to-consumer services and integration with other “big data” increasingly commoditize what was rightly celebrated as a singular achievement in February 2001 when the first draft human genomes were published. But such remarkable technical and scientific progress has not been without its share of missteps and growing pains. Science invited the experts below to help explore how we got here and where we should (or ought not) be going.
https://openalex.org/W3129107659,"Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a protein deacetylase that maintains genome stability by preventing the activation of latent replication origins. Amplified genes in cancer cells localize on either extrachromosomal double minutes (DMs) or the chromosomal homogeneously staining region. Previously, we found that a plasmid with a mammalian replication initiation region and a matrix attachment region spontaneously mimics gene amplification in cultured animal cells and efficiently generates DMs and/or an homogeneously staining region. Here, we addressed the possibility that SIRT1 might be involved in initiation region/matrix attachment region–mediated gene amplification using SIRT1-knockout human COLO 320DM cells. Consequently, we found that extrachromosomal amplification was infrequent in SIRT1-deficient cells, suggesting that DNA breakage caused by latent origin activation prevented the formation of stable extrachromosomal amplicons. Moreover, we serendipitously found that reporter gene expression from the amplified repeats, which is commonly silenced by repeat-induced gene silencing (RIGS) in SIRT1-proficient cells, was strikingly higher in SIRT1-deficient cells, especially in the culture treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor butyrate. Compared with the SIRT1-proficient cells, the gene expression per copy was up to thousand-fold higher in the sorter-isolated highest 10% cells among the SIRT1-deficient cells. These observations suggest that SIRT1 depletion alleviates RIGS. Thus, SIRT1 may stabilize extrachromosomal amplicons and facilitate RIGS. This result could have implications in cancer malignancy and protein expression.

Gene amplification plays a pivotal role in tumor progression by providing cells with growth advantages or drug resistance. Highly amplified genes localize either at the extrachromosomal, circular, and autonomously replicating double minutes (DMs) or at the chromosomal homogeneously staining region (HSR). The location of amplified genes in human cancer is closely associated with disease prognosis (1Verhaak R.G.W. Bafna V. Mischel P.S. Extrachromosomal oncogene amplification in tumour pathogenesis and evolution.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DMs and the HSR often share the same sequence (2Shimizu N. Ochi T. Itonaga K. Replication timing of amplified genetic regions relates to intranuclear localization but not to genetic activity or G/R band.Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and mutual conversions between them are correlated with the development of therapy resistance in human cancer (3Nathanson D.A.

Conversely, a decrease in the number of amplified genes at DMs is associated with growth arrest, cellular differentiation (8Shimizu N. Nakamura H. Kadota T. Kitajima K. Oda T. Hirano T. Utiyama H.

Hydroxyurea accelerates the loss of extrachromosomally amplified genes form tumor cells.Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6273-6279PubMed Google Scholar) and is accompanied by the selective entrapment of DMs in cytoplasmic micronuclei (9Eckhardt S.G.

Selective capture of acentric fragments by micronuclei provides a rapid method for purifying extrachromosomally amplified DNA.Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that random double strand breakage (DSB), caused by low concentrations of hydroxyurea (13Shimizu N. Misaka N. Utani K. Nonselective DNA damage induced by a replication inhibitor results in the selective elimination of extrachromosomal double minutes from human cancer cells.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007; 46: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), or targeted DSB at the DMs (14Oobatake Y. Shimizu N. Double-strand breakage in the extrachromosomal double minutes triggers their aggregation in the nucleus, micronucleation, and morphological transformation.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019; 59: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) induces the aggregation of multiple DMs in the nucleus, which generates micronuclei composed of DMs after mitosis. In addition, we have found that a plasmid with a mammalian replication initiation region (IR) and a matrix attachment region (MAR) initiates gene amplification in cultured mammalian cells and efficiently generates DMs or HSRs (15Shimizu N. Miura Y. Sakamoto Y. Tsutsui K.

Amplification of plasmids containing a mammalian replication initiation region is mediated by controllable conflict between replication and transcription.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid mimics the episome model of gene amplification (17Wahl G.M. The importance of circular DNA in mammalian gene amplification.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1333-1340PubMed Google Scholar, 18Von H.D. New mechanisms of gene amplification in drug resistance (the episome model).Cancer Treat. Res. 1991; 57: 1-11Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in cancer cells. The involvement of extrachromosomal circular DNA in gene amplification was recently reported in plant herbicide resistance (19Koo D.H. Molin W.T. Saski C.A. Jiang J. Putta K. Jugulam M. Friebe B. Gill B.S. Extrachromosomal circular DNA-based amplification and transmission of herbicide resistance in crop weed Amaranthus palmeri.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 3332-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The IR/MAR plasmid is multimerized during its autonomous replication to a tandem repeat and is maintained at the extrachromosomal site (16Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Amplification of plasmids containing a mammalian replication initiation region is mediated by controllable conflict between replication and transcription.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shimizu N.

Cell Res. 2005; 302: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such multimers might be integrated into the chromosome arm and induce breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles that elongate the amplified regions to generate long HSRs (20Shimizu N. Shingaki K. Kaneko-Sasaguri Y. Hashizume T. Kanda T. When, where and how the bridge breaks: Anaphase bridge breakage plays a crucial role in gene amplification and HSR generation.Exp.

How a replication origin and matrix attachment region accelerate gene amplification under replication stress in mammalian cells.PLoS One. 2014; 9e103439Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The amplification of a gene of interest could be targeted to a mammalian artificial chromosome (22Asoshina M. Myo G. Tada N. Tajino K. Shimizu N. Targeted amplification of a sequence of interest in artificial chromosome in mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 5998-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The IR/MAR gene amplification was useful for basic chromosome biology (reviewed in [23Shimizu N. Extrachromosomal double minutes and chromosomal homogeneously staining regions as probes for chromosome research.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2009; 124: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar]) as well as for recombinant protein production (24Araki Y. Hamafuji T. Noguchi C. Shimizu N. Efficient recombinant production in mammalian cells using a novel IR/MAR gene amplification method.PLoS One. 2012; 7e41787Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Noguchi C. Araki Y. Miki D. Shimizu N. Fusion of the Dhfr/Mtx and IR/MAR gene amplification methods produces a rapid and efficient method for stable recombinant protein production.PLoS One. 2012; 7e52990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the amplified genes are frequently subjected to epigenetic gene silencing (26Mitsuda S.H. Shimizu N. Epigenetic repeat-induced gene silencing in the chromosomal and extrachromosomal contexts in human cells.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0161288Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), by a mechanism known as repeat-induced gene silencing (RIGS) (27Garrick D. Fiering S. Martin D.I. Whitelaw E. Repeat-induced gene silencing in mammals.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). RIGS is an important biological process that heterochromatinizes pericentromeric regions to establish their mechanical strength (28Reddy B.D. Wang Y. Niu L. Higuchi E.C. Marguerat S.B. Bahler J. Smith G.R. Jia S. Elimination of a specific histone H3K14 acetyltransferase complex bypasses the RNAi pathway to regulate pericentric heterochromatin functions.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), silences transposons to prevent their spread (29Kondo Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27658-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or silences transgenes (30McBurney M.W. Mai T. Yang X. Jardine K.

Conspiracy of silence among repeated transgenes.Bioessays. 1998; 20: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is an NAD-dependent deacetylase involved in many biological processes (reviewed in [32Fusco S. Maulucci G. Pani G. Sirt1: Def-eating senescence?.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 4135-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Rahman S. Islam R. Mammalian Sirt1: Insights on its biological functions.Cell Commun Signal. 2011; 9: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 34Luna A. Aladjem M.I. Kohn K.W. SIRT1/PARP1 crosstalk: Connecting DNA damage and metabolism.Genome Integ. 2013; 4: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar]). Recently, we found that SIRT1 preserves genomic stability by preventing the activation of latent origins of replication (35Utani K. Fu H. Jang S.M. Marks A.B. Smith O.K. Zhang Y. Redon C.E. Shimizu N. Aladjem M.I. Phosphorylated SIRT1 associates with replication origins to prevent excess replication initiation and preserve genomic stability.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 7807-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that SIRT1 might affect gene amplification in cancer cells. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the effect of SIRT1 deficiency on gene amplification at DMs or HSRs using our original IR/MAR gene amplification system. Consequently, we found that SIRT1 is involved in extrachromosomal element stability and serendipitously uncovered the involvement of SIRT1 in RIGS. We successfully depleted the SIRT1 gene in human colorectal carcinoma COLO 320DM cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and examined SIRT1 protein expression in isolated clonal cells by Western blotting. Consequently, we obtained several clones (KO clones) that exhibited complete depletion of the SIRT1 protein (Fig. 1A). These KO-cells showed almost similar growth rate to the wildtype (WT) cells. We transfected an IR/MAR-bearing plasmid (pΔBM d2EGFP; Fig. 1B) into WT or SIRT1 KO cell clones, selected stable transformants on blasticidine for approximately 1 month, prepared chromosome spreads, and conducted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to detect the plasmid sequences. The plasmid demonstrated amplification at large and small DMs and short, mid-sized, or long HSRs (the representative images, see Fig. 1C), as observed in our previous studies (15Shimizu N. Miura Y. Sakamoto Y. Tsutsui K. Plasmids with a mammalian replication origin and a matrix attachment region initiate the event similar to gene amplification.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6987-6990PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Amplification of plasmids containing a mammalian replication initiation region is mediated by controllable conflict between replication and transcription.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar). As previously observed, the amplified IR/MAR plasmid at DMs or HSR in a single metaphase is mutually exclusive in most cells (15Shimizu N. Miura Y. Sakamoto Y. Tsutsui K. Plasmids with a mammalian replication origin and a matrix attachment region initiate the event similar to gene amplification.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6987-6990PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Amplification of plasmids containing a mammalian replication initiation region is mediated by controllable conflict between replication and transcription.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next measured the frequencies of the various sizes of DMs and HSRs in three independent transfections, selections, and FISH analyses (Exp. 1∼3; Fig. 2). Compared with WT cells, we found that plasmid amplification at the DMs was consistently inefficient in six independent SIRT1 KO clones in three independent experiments. Amplification at the chromosomal HSR varied between the different KO clones; however, the clonal variation was reproducible among three independent experiments, and the relative frequency of DMs and HSRs remained consistent 30 to 70 days posttransfection (Fig. 2, B and C). As the pΔBM d2EGFP plasmid contains a destabilized enhanced GFP (d2EGFP) expression cassette, we were able to measure its expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 3). The d2EGFP contained PEST domain that destabilize the protein product; therefore, it is adequate for evaluating the gene expression in real-time. Unexpectedly, we found that the expression of the EGFP marker was much higher in SIRT1 KO cells than in WT cells. This result was consistently obtained from different SIRT1 KO clones and was reproducible among three independent transfections and selections (Exp. 1–3). We also analyzed the cells treated with butyrate, because the drug augmented gene expression from the amplified transgene (25Noguchi C. Araki Y. Miki D. Shimizu N. Fusion of the Dhfr/Mtx and IR/MAR gene amplification methods produces a rapid and efficient method for stable recombinant protein production.PLoS One. 2012; 7e52990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Fukuma M. Ganmyo Y. Miura O. Ohyama T. Shimizu N. Cloning and characterization of a human genomic sequence that alleviates repeat-induced gene silencing.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0153338Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The high expression in the SIRT1 KO cells was further enhanced by treatment with butyrate, an inhibitor of class I and class II histone deacetylase complexes but not sirtuins (Fig. 3). These results indicated that the effects of SIRT1 deficiency and butyrate treatment were synergistic. We next examined whether transient inhibition of SIRT1 activity by a specific inhibitor could also alleviate the suppression of genes expressed in the amplified sequences in SIRT1-proficient cells by adding EX-527 to stable transformants from WT cells (Exp. 1) and examining d2EGFP expression (Fig. 4A) and deacetylation activity (Fig. 4, B and C). EX-527 was highly stable in the culture medium as a single dose of EX-527 markedly inhibited the deacetylation activity of SIRT1 after 72 h. Because a 72-h exposure to the inhibitor did not elevate gene expression from the amplified sequences (Fig. 4A), we conclude that SIRT1 participates in the establishment of silencing during the gene amplification process and is not required for the maintenance of the silenced phenotype. The transformants, which were generated from wild-type, KO clone 1 and clone 6 in Exp. 3 (Figs. 2D and 3), were cultured in the absence (−) or presence (+) of butyrate, and cells with the highest (H; 10%) and lowest (L; 10%) GFP fluorescence intensities were segregated using a cell sorter (Fig. 5A). Again, GFP expression was much higher in SIRT1 KO clone 1 and 6 compared with the WT cells, and the expression was further increased by butyrate treatment. The average expression of total, H, or L cells was noted in each chart. Total DNA was isolated from the sorted cells and subject to real-time PCR to determine the plasmid copy number (SRα promoter) relative to endogenous GAPDH. The result (Fig. 5B) showed that the copy number was constantly higher in the highest expression cells compared with the lowest expression cells, and the ratio between them was in the range of 1.4 (6−) to 4.1 (1+), suggesting that the gene dosage effect may have partly contributed to the higher expression. We then divided the gene expression value (mean fluorescence intensity) by the gene copy number to determine the level of expression per copy number (Fig. 5C). Consequently, we found that d2EGFP expression levels per copy were extraordinarily high in the higher-expressing fraction from the SIRT1 KO clone. For example, as shown in Figure 5C, SIRT1 KO populations showed notably high ratios of d2EGFP expression values (25 and 115 for −, and 123 and 79 for +) compared with the WT cell population (1.4 for – and 7.1 for +). Consequently, butyrate-treated cells with high d2EGFP expression showed 1450-fold (KO clone 1) or 979-fold (KO clone 6) higher expression/copy compared with the control unsorted WT cells. These observations demonstrated that the population of SIRT1 KO cells contained cells showing extraordinarily high expression/copy, suggesting that the depletion of SIRT1 resulted in alleviation from repeat-induced gene silencing. To address the question whether higher gene expression in SIRT1-deficient cells was stable or not during culturing, we isolated clones from WT and KO cl. 1 transformants (Exp. 1) and examined them by both FISH and flow cytometry. After careful examination by FISH, we identified several clones bearing similar amplifications at large DMs (Fig. 6A) or similar, single short HSRs (Fig. 6B). Flow cytometric examination of d2EGFP expression in these clones revealed that the expression was constantly and substantially higher in SIRT1 KO cells than in WT cells. This result was obtained for the amplicons residing in both DMs or HSR. Furthermore, this effect was more pronounced when we compared the cultures treated with butyrate, further suggesting that SIRT1 deficiency and butyrate treatment have a synergistic effect. We concluded that gene expression per amplified gene copy was higher in SIRT1 KO cells, and the phenotype was stable, thus enabling the efficient isolation of a stable cell line that expresses a recombinant protein at a considerably high level. Here, we have shown that amplification at the extrachromosomal DMs of the IR/MAR plasmid was inefficient in SIRT1-deficient cells (Fig. 2). Our previous studies have revealed that the IR/MAR plasmid is initially amplified to a direct repeat at the extrachromosomal context, and the tandem repeat is then integrated into the chromosome arm, where it is elongated to a large HSR by efficiently inducing the BFB cycle (Fig. 7A, [16Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Amplification of plasmids containing a mammalian replication initiation region is mediated by controllable conflict between replication and transcription.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shimizu N. Shingaki K. Kaneko-Sasaguri Y. Hashizume T. Kanda T. When, where and how the bridge breaks: Anaphase bridge breakage plays a crucial role in gene amplification and HSR generation.Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 302: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar]). Notably, we have also shown that SIRT1 prevents dormant origin activation, thereby preserving genome stability (35Utani K. Fu H. Jang S.M. Marks A.B. Smith O.K. Zhang Y. Redon C.E. Shimizu N. Aladjem M.I. Phosphorylated SIRT1 associates with replication origins to prevent excess replication initiation and preserve genomic stability.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 7807-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, SIRT1 deficiency would likely result in DSB among the tandem repeats of IR/MAR sequences that potentially function as replication origins (37Hashizume T. Shimizu N. Dissection of mammalian replicators by a novel plasmid stability assay.J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 101: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Okada N. Shimizu N. Dissection of the beta-globin replication-initiation region reveals specific requirements for replicator elements during gene amplification.PLoS One. 2013; 8e77350Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that DSB in the extrachromosomal DMs, which was induced by low concentrations of replication inhibitors or directly induced by CRISPR/Cas9, was sufficient to aggregate multiple DMs in the nucleus and eliminate them (13Shimizu N. Misaka N. Utani K. Nonselective DNA damage induced by a replication inhibitor results in the selective elimination of extrachromosomal double minutes from human cancer cells.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007; 46: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Oobatake Y. Shimizu N. Double-strand breakage in the extrachromosomal double minutes triggers their aggregation in the nucleus, micronucleation, and morphological transformation.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019; 59: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tandem IR/MAR plasmid multimer would suffer from frequent DSB and be eliminated during amplification in SIRT1-deficient cells (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the generation of HSRs requires the induction of BFB cycles. The BFB cycle is induced by DSB within the plasmid repeat in the chromosomal context, the efficiency of which would depend on plasmid repeat length. Therefore, differences in the extent of extrachromosomal multimerization between the SIRT1 KO clones would differently trigger the BFB cycle, thus generating variations in HSR generation between the SIRT1 KO clones (Figs. 2 and 7B). The predicted function of SIRT1 as a transcriptional silencer is based on its yeast ortholog, SIR2, which plays a role as a silencer and a histone deacetylase (HDAC) (39Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Transcriptional silencing and longevity protein Sir2 is an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase.Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar). In mammals, SIRT1 prevents tumorigenic transformation by epigenetically silencing cancer-promoting genes (40Pruitt K. Zinn R.L. Ohm J.E. McGarvey K.M. Kang S.H. Watkins D.N. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B.

Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W. Modulation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription and cell survival by the SIRT1 deacetylase.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar) and promote autophagy (43Yang G.

Jenuwein T. et al.The histone H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H links SIRT1 repression to myocardial infarction.Nat. Comm. 2017; 8: 14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we serendipitously found that the genes amplified in SIRT1-deficient cells exhibited much higher expression (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). SIRT1 is a class III HDAC, whereas butyrate is an inhibitor of class I and IIa HDACs (44Dokmanovic M. Clarke C. Marks P.A. Histone deacetylase inhibitors: Overview and perspectives.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation is generally associated with higher gene expression; therefore, HDAC inhibition would generate a relaxed chromatin with higher gene expression. SIRT1-deficiency and the butyrate treatment synergistically augmented the expression of the amplified genes, because these conditions inhibit different classes of HDACs. Therefore, their combination will be highly useful for recombinant protein production. Genes amplified by the IR/MAR method are frequently subject to RIGS. As mentioned in the Introduction, RIGS has an important cellular function as it establishes the mechanical strength of centromeres, prevents transposon spreading, and silences foreign transgenes. In this study, we found that RIGS was at least partially alleviated in the genes amplified in SIRT1-deficient cells; in other words, SIRT1 is involved in the establishment of RIGS. Because SIRT1 inhibition did not alleviate gene silencing, our observations also imply that once RIGS is established, SIRT1 activity is no longer required for the maintenance of the silenced state. SIRT1 could either promote or inhibit cancer progression, depending on the specific molecular target or cancer type (45Lin Z. Fang D. The roles of SIRT1 in cancer.Genes Cancer. 2013; 4: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our current study suggests that SIRT1 stabilizes the extrachromosomal amplification structures, which are critical to the progression of many human malignancies. Furthermore, SIRT1 plays a role in genome maintenance through RIGS, which establishes centromere structure and repeat stability. Therefore, our present study discovered new roles of SIRT1 in genome stability by modulating extrachromosomal gene amplification and RIGS, potentially leading to important implications in cancer malignancy and protein expression. The human colorectal carcinoma COLO 320DM (CCL-220) cell line was originally derived from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and clone “COLO 320DM #3” bearing multiple DMs (15Shimizu N. Miura Y. Sakamoto Y. Tsutsui K. Plasmids with a mammalian replication origin and a matrix attachment region initiate the event similar to gene amplification.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6987-6990PubMed Google Scholar) was used in this study. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest). Hamster cell line CHO K1 (CCL 61) was obtained from the Cell Research Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University, Japan. Hamster CHO DG44 cells were obtained from Dr Lawrence Chasin at Columbia University. The cells were grown in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (EuroClone) and maintained using TrypLE Express with Phenol Red (12605-028; Invitrogen). Ex-527 (Merck) was dissolved in DMSO at 100 mM and added to the culture at a final concentration of 2 μM. We established SIRT1-depleted cell lines from COLO 320DM cells as previously described (35Utani K. Fu H. Jang S.M. Marks A.B. Smith O.K. Zhang Y. Redon C.E. Shimizu N. Aladjem M.I. Phosphorylated SIRT1 associates with replication origins to prevent excess replication initiation and preserve genomic stability.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 7807-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with modification. Plasmid pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #42230; https://www.addgene.org/42230/; RRID; Addgene 42230). The guide RNA sequence for the human SIRT1 gene (NM_012238.5) was designed with CRISPR design tool DNA2.0 (https://www.atum.bio/eCommerce/cas9/input). The sg-oligo sequence was as follows: Cas9 human SIRT1(67–87): GAGGCCGCGTCGTCCCCCGCCGG. The underlined sequence represents the protospacer adjacent motif sequence. The sg-oligo sequence targets exon 1 of human SIRT1. We inserted synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides, which contained the abovementioned sg-oligo sequences, into the BbsI site of pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9. Next, we co-transfected the pSpCas9(67–87) and pCR2.1 plasmid bearing a puromycin resistance gene into COLO 320DM (#3) cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (11668019; Invitrogen). The transfected cells were selected on 1 μg/ml puromycin to obtain stable SIRT1-deficient cells. From these cells, we isolated clones and checked SIRT1 protein expression by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-SIRT1 antibody (07–131; Millipore) or a rabbit monoclonal anti-SIRT1 (p530) antibody (ab156585). These cell clones as well as plasmid used in this study will be deposited to RIKEN Bioresource Center (BRC), Japan, and will be available upon request to BRC. pΔBM d2EGFP was constructed as previously described (46Harada S. Uchida M. Shimizu N. Episomal high copy number maintenance of hairpin-capped DNA bearing a replication initiation region in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24320-24327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It contains a BSR gene driven by SRαpromoter, the d2EGFP gene driven by a CMV promoter, and a DHFR IR (Ori β; 4634 bp) that contains a sequence showing in vitro MAR activity (15Shimizu N. Miura Y. Sakamoto Y. Tsutsui K. Plasmids with a mammalian replication origin and a matrix attachment region initiate the event similar to gene amplification.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6987-6990PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids were cloned into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was purified using the PureLink HiPure plasmid midiprep kit (Invitrogen). COLO 320DM cells were transfected using GenePORTER2 Transfection Reagent (Genlantis Co), whereas CHO DG44 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific Co) according to the manufacturers' recommended protocols. Stable transformants were selected on blasticidin (Funakoshi) or puromycin (Nacalai Tesque). The metaphase chromosome spread was prepared according to a standard protocol, which involved hypotonic swelling in 75 mM KCl, at 37 °C for 10 min, the centrifugal washing by methanol/acetic acids = 3/1 for three times, followed by dropping onto the prewet slide glass (superfrost, Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd). The digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe for detecting the amplified plasmid sequence was prepared from pΔBM d2EGFP plasmid DNA using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) combined with 10× DIG DNA labeling mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The hybridized DIG probe was detected with an anti-DIG fluorescein Fab fragment (Roche Diagnostics). The slide was counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and examined using an epifluorescence microscope (TE2000E, Nikon) equipped with a 100× objective lens (Nikon Plan Fluor, NA 1.30 oil) and an appropriate filter set. Digital images were acquired with a Nikon D7000 digital camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems, Inc). For flow cytometry analysis of d2EGFP expression, the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed using a FACSCalibur system (Becton Dickinson Co) in the absence or the presence of 2 mM sodium butyrate for the last 3 days of culture. For isolating cells according to green fluorescence, which reflects the expression of d2EGFP in the plasmid, we used FACSAria III (Becton Dickinson) and appropriate setting for FITC because the excitation/emission spectrum of FITC is close to the one for d2EGFP. The highest 10% or the lowest 10% cells based on FITC-area (FITC-A) and FITC-height (FITV-H) were sorted directly to the culture medium. A cell concentration of 5 × 104 for each fraction was obtained and collected by centrifugation. Total DNA was extracted based on a published protocol using Triton X100 and proteinase K (8Shimizu N. Nakamura H. Kadota T. Kitajima K. Oda T. Hirano T. Utiyama H. Loss of amplified c-myc genes in the spontaneously differentiated HL-60 cells.Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3561-3567PubMed Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus system (Applied Biosystems) with Thunderbird qPCR Mix (Toyobo) and gene-specific primers for human genomic GAPDH (forward primer: TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG and reverse primer: TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA) or SRα promoter that drives BSR in the plasmid (forward primer: CTCGCATCTCTCCTTCACG and reverse primer: CGGTCTCGACCTGAGCTTTA). The reaction was performed in triplicate, and their mean values were used to evaluate the copy number of the SRα promoter relative to GAPDH by the ΔΔCt method. SIRT1 deacetylation activity was measured using a SIRT1 deacetylation kit (Abcam, ab156065) as per manufactures instructions. Briefly total protein from cell were prepared using NP40 buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1%NP40) and were mixed with reaction components and fluorometric substrate. This reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, the fluorometric signal was measured by Spectra Max GEMINIXS (Molecular Devices). The NAD+ samples fluorometric values were normalized by subtracting the control values. Trichostatin A was used to inhibit class I and II HDAC activity. All data are provided in the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W3126818428,"The goal of this study was to test for long-term benefits three years after the completion of a cognitive training intervention (Project: EVO ™ ) in a subset of children with Sensory Processing Dysfunction (SPD). Our initial findings revealed that children with SPD who also met research criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (SPD +IA ) showed a significant decrease in parent-observed inattentive behaviors, which remained stable in a nine-month follow-up assessment. Forty nine caregivers of participants who completed the Project: EVO ™ training were contacted to be included in this follow up study. Each was emailed an invitation to complete the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale, which yielded a completion rate of 39/49 (80%). A Generalized Estimating Equations analysis was used to assess changes in symptoms over time, specifically to determine whether the initial improvements were retained. The SPD +IA cohort continued to show sustained benefits on their parent-reported scores of inattention, with 54% of SPD +IA individuals no longer meeting criteria for ADHD three years following intervention. These findings provide initial insights into the potential long-term benefits of a digital health intervention for children with attention-based issues."
https://openalex.org/W3128577198,"Introduction Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased risk of pregnancy complications, including preterm birth before 37 weeks. However, if this increased risk also includes extremely preterm births (&lt;28 weeks) is unknown. Such information is important to identify women at risk and tailor antenatal care, since child morbidity and mortality become more prevalent with increasing prematurity. Aims To investigate the association between PCOS and extremely preterm birth, and whether onset of PCOS-related preterm birth is predominantly spontaneous or medically indicated. Material and methods This was a nationwide register-based cohort study in Sweden. The study population was all live singleton births registered in the Swedish Medical Birth Register 2005–2014 (n = 1 046 448). Women with and without PCOS were compared by severity of preterm birth [extremely (22+0 to 27+6 weeks), very (28+0 to 31+6 weeks) and moderately (32+0 to 36+6 weeks)] and delivery onset mode (spontaneous or medically indicated). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjustments were made for maternal age, parity, body mass index, smoking, country of birth and year of delivery. Results During the study period, 1.3% of the women giving birth had PCOS diagnosis. They had an overall higher preterm birth rate than women without PCOS (6.7% and 4.8%, respectively). Women with PCOS had increased odds of preterm birth of all severities, with the highest odds for extremely preterm birth (aOR 2.3; 95% CI 1.7–3.0), particularly of spontaneous onset (aOR 2.7; 95% CI 2.0–3.6). Conclusions Women with PCOS had more than a two-fold increased risk of extremely preterm birth with spontaneous onset than women without such diagnosis. This can be important in antenatal risk assessment of preterm birth in women with PCOS. Future research is warranted to investigate the biological mechanisms behind preterm birth in women with PCOS."

https://openalex.org/W3127698697,"Millions of bird observations have been entered on online portals in the past 20 years either as checklists or arbitrary individual entries. While several hundred publications have been written on a variety of topics based on bird checklists worldwide, unstructured non-checklist observations have received little attention and praise by academia. In the present study we tested the suitability of non-checklist data to estimate key figures of large-scale migration phenology in four zones covering the whole of Finland. For that purpose, we analysed 10 years of ornithological non-checklist data including over 400 million. individuals of 115 bird species. We discuss bird- and human-induced effects to be considered in handling non-checklist data in this context and describe applied methodologies to address these effects. We calculated 5%, 50% and 95% percentile dates of spring and autumn migration period for all species in all four zones. For validation purposes we compared the temporal distributions of 43 bird species with migration phenology from standardized long-term ringing data in autumn of which 24 species (56%) showed similar medians. In a model approach, non-checklist data successfully revealed latitudinal migration progression in spring and autumn. Overall, non-checklist data proved to be well suited to determine descriptors of migration phenology in Northern Europe which are challenging to attain by any other currently available means. The effort-to-yield ratio of data processing was commensurate to the outcomes. The unprecedented spatiotemporal coverage makes non-checklist data a valuable complement to current migration databases from bird observatories. The basic concept of the present methodology is applicable to data from other bird portals, if combined with local field ornithological knowledge and literature. Species-specific descriptors of migration phenology can be potentially used in climate change studies and to support echo interpretation in radar ornithology."
https://openalex.org/W3127951342,"Background Fatigue is common in Parkinson’s Disease, but few effective treatments are available for it. Exploring triggers and alleviating factors, including effects of exercise, could inform development of management strategies for Parkinson’s Disease fatigue. Objectives To examine triggers and alleviating factors for fatigue reported by individuals with Parkinson’s Disease, including perceived effect of exercise. Methods A sample of individuals with self-reported Parkinson’s Disease participating in the study Fox Insight were administered an online survey. The survey included the Parkinson's Fatigue Scale, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, and multiple-choice questions about triggers and alleviating factors for fatigue. Results Among the sample of 1,029 individuals with Parkinson’s disease, mean (standard deviation (SD)) age was 67.4 (9.3) years, 44.0% were female. Parkinson’s Fatigue Scale score ranged from 16–80, mean (SD) 48.8 (16.2). Poor sleep (62.1%) and physical exertion (45.1%) were frequently reported triggers for fatigue. Coping strategies including sitting quietly (58.1%), laying down with or without napping, and exercise (20%). Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly scores were higher in those who reported that exercise alleviated their fatigue (49.7%) compared to those who reported it worsened their fatigue (18.9%) (mean (SD) score 158.5 (88.8) vs 119.8 (66.6) respectively; p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Several behavioral and environmental triggers and alleviating strategies for fatigue are reported by individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Many feel that exercise alleviates fatigue, though the relationship between exercise and fatigue in Parkinson’s Disease appears complex. This exploratory study may inform future development of treatments or coping strategies for Parkinson’s disease fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W3128122376,"During the integration step, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase (IN) interacts with viral DNA and the cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75 to effectively integrate the reverse transcript into the host chromatin. Allosteric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs) are a new class of antiviral agents that bind at the dimer interface of the IN catalytic core domain and occupy the binding site of LEDGF/p75. While originally designed to block IN-LEDGF/p75 interactions during viral integration, several of these compounds have been shown to also severely impact viral maturation through an IN multimerization mechanism. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these dual properties of ALLINIs could be decoupled toward late stage viral replication effects by generating additional contact points between the bound ALLINI and a third subunit of IN. By sequential derivatization at position 7 of a quinoline-based ALLINI scaffold, we show that IN multimerization properties are enhanced by optimizing hydrophobic interactions between the compound and the C-terminal domain of the third IN subunit. These features not only improve the overall antiviral potencies of these compounds but also significantly shift the ALLINIs selectivity toward the viral maturation stage. Thus, we demonstrate that to fully maximize the potency of ALLINIs, the interactions between the inhibitor and all three IN subunits need to be simultaneously optimized.

The integrase (IN) protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) catalyzes the insertion of viral cDNA (vDNA) into the host chromosome. This catalytic activity of IN is essential for the early stage of the viral replication and has been developed as therapeutic target. Four FDA-approved inhibitors (raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, and bictegravir) that bind at the catalytic site are now commonly used clinically to treat HIV-1 infected individuals. The HIV-1 IN is comprised of three structurally distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the catalytic core domain (CCD), and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (1Chiu T.K. Davies D.R.

Studies on the antiviral mechanism of action of ALLINIs have revealed that these compounds not only inhibit integration but also unexpectedly impede the late stages of HIV-1 replication. Closer observations have shown that the binding of these compounds significantly interfere with proper virus particle maturation and yield noninfectious particles. A hallmark of this drug-induced defect is the mislocalization of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) to an eccentric position between the empty capsid (CA) core and the particle membrane in mature virions, whereas normal virions contain RNPs within the CA core. Thus, IN plays a critical noncatalytic role during viral particle maturation that can be probed or targeted using ALLINIs. The use of these intriguing compounds has emerged as a promising, complementary approach to active site-based inhibitors of HIV-1 IN (24Engelman A.N.

Here, we have selected to further derivatize our quinoline scaffold at position 7 to test if an increase of compound interaction with the residues Y226 and W235 of the third subunit (magenta in Figs. 1 and 2) would enhance IN multimerization properties. Preliminary examination of the available ALLINI-bound IN tetramer (26Gupta K. Turkki V. Sherrill-Mix S. Hwang Y. Eilers G. Taylor L. McDanal C. Wang P. Temelkoff D. Nolte R.T. Velthuisen E.

The double substitution at both the 4 and 7 positions was obtained by a sequential Suzuki cross-coupling strategy where selected boronic acid analogs were added to halogens on the quinoline scaffold using a palladium catalyst under basic conditions (detailed chemical synthesis procedures and complete compounds characterization are included in the Supporting Information section). The α-tert-butoxy-acetic acid was then recovered through saponification (Fig. S1). To test our hypothesis, we first obtained KHP1095 (Table 1) which added a simple phenyl group at position 7.

Interestingly, this effect could be achieved by adding aliphatic substituents on ortho position of the phenyl ring. Thus, six additional ortho phenyl–substituted quinoline analogs were then generated and tested for in vitro IN multimerization (Table 1). Among those, three compounds displayed better EC50 values than KPH1095, with JDH2110 having the lowest multimerization EC50 value at 0.04 μM. Finally, to further explore the properties of this series, we synthesized and tested both the meta (JDH2102) and the para (KHP1123) variants of JDH2110 (Table 2). While the para substitution (KHP1123) displayed a multimerization EC50 of 0.04 μM like the ortho (JDH2110), we observed a notably less potent value for the meta variant (JDH2102) with 0.52 μM.Table 1In vitro IN multimerization EC50 activities of substituted quinoline-based ALLINIsCompoundREC50 (μM)NGJ-90020.11 ± 0.01KHP-1095H0.07 ± 0.01KHP-1056Cl0.11 ± 0.01KHP-1050CH30.06 ± 0.01KHP-1091CF30.14 ± 0.01JDH-2110OCH30.04 ± 0.01KHP-1092OCF30.12 ± 0.01KHP-1099OC2H50.06 ± 0.01ALLINI, allosteric IN inhibitor; IN, integrase.Average values with SD are shown for three independent experiments.

To detect in isolation the specific contribution of the IN-CTD to the ALLINI-induced IN multimer complex formation, we have modified our published HTRF-based assay (Fig. 3, A and B). In this new analytical assay, anti-His6-XL665 and anti-FLAG-EuCryptate antibodies allow the detection of fluorescence energy transfer only when FLAG-tagged full-length IN protein tightly interacts with a His-tagged IN-CTD construct. Mixing of the proteins and without compound addition generated a small HTRF signal (Fig. 3C, dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) indicating a weak interaction between the full-length IN and the IN-CTD construct. Strikingly, the addition of ALLINI to the assay promoted a significant increase of HTRF signals proportional to the IN multimerization properties of the compound. The data in Figure 3C show that JDH2110 generated higher HTRF than NGJ9002, suggesting additional contact points with the IN-CTD for this compound. On note, while the ALLINI-induced multimerization of the FLAG tagged full-length IN protein is likely to occur in the assay, it does not contribute to the recorded signal (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W3128148207,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a central component of the intracellular ILK–pinch–parvin complex, localizes together with paxillin to focal adhesions and regulates integrin-mediated cell functions. ILK was initially misclassified as a kinase based on phenotypical characterization of cells expressing ILK mutated in the “kinase” domain, such as the E359K and K220M mutants and a V386G/T387G mutation in the paxillin-binding site (PBS). ILK is now known to be a pseudokinase, and mechanisms of action of these mutants are not clear. We selectively induced expression of only the E359K, PBS, and K220M ILK mutations in the developing kidney collecting system and kidney collecting duct (CD) cells and analyzed their impact on structural integrity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Mice or CD cells carrying the E359K mutation had a severe phenotype that is indistinguishable from ILK-null mice or ILK-null CD cells. The K220M mutant mice developed normally, and K220M-CD cells had a mild adhesion, migration, and tubulogenesis defect. The PBS mutant mice had a subtle developmental defect, and PBS-CD cells had moderate functional abnormalities. Consistent with these observed phenotypes, MD studies suggest that the E359K mutant produces the most structurally perturbed, and K220M the most WT-like ILK molecules. Although all three mutations disrupted ILK binding to parvin and paxillin in vitro, only the E359K mutation decreased ILK binding to pinch suggesting that it increases ILK misfolding. Thus, point mutations in the ILK pseudokinase domain cause functional abnormalities by altering the ILK structure, leading to increased turnover and destabilization of ILK–parvin and (sometimes) ILK–pinch interactions. The integrin-linked kinase (ILK)–pinch–parvin (IPP) complex is a critical component of focal adhesions that binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin β subunits. Integrins, composed of an α and a β subunit, are the principal receptors that mediate cell–extracellular matrix interactions and regulate many cell functions, including adhesion, spreading, migration, polarization, and tubulogenesis. ILK is a 450 amino acid multidomain pseudokinase protein consisting of an N-terminal domain with five ankyrin repeats, a COOH-terminal pseudo kinase domain, and an intervening pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (1Ghatak S.

The three components of the IPP complex are thought to assemble in the cytosol, and the pseudokinase domain is required for this interaction to occur. The pseudokinase domain is inherently unstable, and the heat shock protein Hsp90 is required to stabilize interactions between parvin and ILK (5Wickstrom S.A. Lange A. Hess M.W. Polleux J. Spatz J.P.

Cell. 2010; 19: 574-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The expression of all three IPP components is critical for IPP complex formation as genetic deletion of either pinch or ILK leads to a decrease in IPP complex formation; however, the mechanism for this interdependency is unknown (2Wickstrom S.A.

A point mutagenesis strategy was employed to define the mechanisms of ILK function in the setting of the IPP complex. Mice carrying a constititve and homozygous R211A or the S343A/D mutations in the pseudokinase domain are normal, while mice with a K220A/M mutation in the same domain show kidney developmental abnormalities due to decreased interactions between ILK and α-parvin caused by increased destabilization of the ILK pseudokinase domain structure (9Lange A.

Mice carrying the V386G/T387G mutation in the PBS-binding sites die at E9.5, and in vitro studies revealed that these mutations alter ILK stability and decrease its ability to bind α-parvin or paxillin. Finally, an E359K mutation was made based on a Glu-Arg salt bridge that connects coevolved motifs that defines the highly conserved fold found in in all eukarytoic protein kinases (13Yang J. Wu J.

However, it is now clear that ILK is not a kinase and the mechanism of action of this mutant deviates from structurally homologus eukaryotic protein kinases, thus its effects in vivo must now be regarded as unknown (11Nikolopoulos S.N.

We previously showed that deleting ILK in the developing ureteric bud (UB) of the kidney results in a branching morphogenesis defect and that ILK-null collecting duct (CD) cells have abnormalities in multiple integrin-dependent functions (7Smeeton J. Zhang X. Bulus N. Mernaugh G. Lange A. Karner C.M. Carroll T.J. Fassler R. Pozzi A. Rosenblum N.D. Zent R. Integrin-linked kinase regulates p38 MAPK-dependent cell cycle arrest in ureteric bud development.Development. 2010; 137: 3233-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated mutations in the developing UB and CD cells to define the mechanisms whereby K220M, E359K, and PBS mutations alter ILK function in the setting of polarized epithelium. We subsequently employed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and molecular modeling techniques to visualize how these ILK mutations can disrupt the IPP complex. ILK is required for normal development, and global ILK-null mice die at the periimplantation stage (6Sakai T. Li S. Docheva D. Grashoff C. Sakai K. Kostka G. Braun A. Pfeifer A. Yurchenco P.D.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is required for polarizing the epiblast, cell adhesion, and controlling actin accumulation.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Mice constitutively expressing K220M die shortly after birth from kidney development complications (9Lange A. Wickstrom S.A. Jakobson M. Zent R. Sainio K. Fassler R. Integrin-linked kinase is an adaptor with essential functions during mouse development.Nature. 2009; 461: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and PBS ILK mutants do not survive longer than E9.5 (12Moik D. Bottcher A. Makhina T. Grashoff C. Bulus N. Zent R. Fassler R. Mutations in the paxillin-binding site of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) destabilize the pseudokinase domain and cause embryonic lethality in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 18863-18871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We generated the constitutive E359K mutant mice as described in the Experimental procedures and Figure S1 and found that they have an early embryonic lethal phenotype (data not shown). To compare the differential effects of the E359K, K220M, and PBS mutations in the same biological system in vivo, we expressed the mutant ILK versions in the UB, which gives rise to the kidney collecting system. This was achieved by intercrossing the heterozygous E359K, K220M, and PBS mutant mice with ILK-floxed mice expressing Cre recombinase under the hoxB7 promoter (18Yu J. Carroll T.J. McMahon A.P. Sonic hedgehog regulates proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells in the mouse metanephric kidney.Development. 2002; 129: 5301-5312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heterozygous mutant mice and heterozygous floxed ILK mice crossed with hoxB7 Cre mice were normal (data not shown). The breeding strategy used should result in 12.5% of the offspring expressing the mutant protein in the UB. Littermates carrying the floxed and mutated ILK alleles without the Cre recombinase transgene served as controls for experiments. The PBS and K220M mutant mice were born in the correct Mendelian ratio while the E359K mutants were born at a lower ratio (6.7%), which was similar to the mice lacking ILK in the UB (8.1%), suggesting that some of these mice died in utero or at birth. The PBS and K220M mice developed normally and did not display overt developmental phenotypes. By contrast, the surviving E359K and the UB-ILK null mice died at about 8 weeks of age from renal failure. We analyzed kidneys from 1-year-old PBS and K220M mice and the E359K mice just prior to death (Fig. 1, A–D). The K220M kidneys were normal and indistinguishable from control mice at all time points analyzed. The PBS mutant kidneys displayed a subtle branching morphogenesis defect characterized by less tubules in the kidney papilla (Fig. 1C). By contrast, the E359K mice either developed obstruction or the kidneys were severely dysplastic and hypoplastic (Fig. 1B), consistent with defects seen in the UB-ILK-null mice (7Smeeton J. Zhang X. Bulus N. Mernaugh G. Lange A. Karner C.M. Carroll T.J. Fassler R. Pozzi A. Rosenblum N.D. Zent R. Integrin-linked kinase regulates p38 MAPK-dependent cell cycle arrest in ureteric bud development.Development. 2010; 137: 3233-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in the E359K kidneys were evident at all embryological developmental stages, and at E15.5 the kidneys were noted to be small with a moderate branching morphogenesis defect and impaired metanephric mesenchyme induction (Fig. 1, E and F). Kidneys at P0 were hypoplastic and dysplastic (Fig. 1, G and H), and they became dilated over time due to the intraluminal obstruction in the collecting ducts (Fig. 1, I–L). During the postnatal period, the tubules did not have any cell survival defects, but displayed intratubular proliferation characterized by increased Ki67 cells (Fig. 1, M–O), similar to that seen in UB-ILK-null mice (7Smeeton J. Zhang X. Bulus N. Mernaugh G. Lange A. Karner C.M. Carroll T.J. Fassler R. Pozzi A. Rosenblum N.D. Zent R. Integrin-linked kinase regulates p38 MAPK-dependent cell cycle arrest in ureteric bud development.Development. 2010; 137: 3233-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, introducing the K220 M mutation does not cause any detectable developmental abnormalities in the collecting system, and the PBS mutation causes a subtle nonprogressive branching defect with no evidence of obstruction. On the other hand, the E359K mutation causes a severe developmental phenotype that is indistinguishable from the UB-ILK null mice (7Smeeton J. Zhang X. Bulus N. Mernaugh G. Lange A. Karner C.M. Carroll T.J. Fassler R. Pozzi A. Rosenblum N.D. Zent R. Integrin-linked kinase regulates p38 MAPK-dependent cell cycle arrest in ureteric bud development.Development. 2010; 137: 3233-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To define the mechanisms of action of the various ILK mutants in polarized renal epithelial cells, we generated stable clones of ILK-null CD cells (7Smeeton J. Zhang X. Bulus N. Mernaugh G. Lange A. Karner C.M. Carroll T.J. Fassler R. Pozzi A. Rosenblum N.D. Zent R. Integrin-linked kinase regulates p38 MAPK-dependent cell cycle arrest in ureteric bud development.Development. 2010; 137: 3233-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) expressing comparable levels of wild-type (WT) ILK and the three ILK mutants (Fig. 2A). Multiple clones were generated and shown to have similar phenotypes. We initially performed branching morphogenesis assays in three-dimensional collagen I/Matrigel gels. CD cells expressing WT-ILK were able to form tubules with lumens (arrow) that were visible in single-plane confocal pictures (Fig. 2B). By contrast, the E359K CD cells were unable to undergo branching morphogenesis and made multicellular aggregates within the gel (Fig. 2, B, C, and F). The PBS formed unicellular cellular outgrowths with no visible lumens and had half as many branched structures per tubule as the WT-ILK cells (Fig. 2, D and F). Although the K220M mutant cells developed multicellular structures with lumens (arrow), they had half the branch number of the WT-ILK cells (Fig. 2, E and F). We next investigated well-described integrin/ILK-mediated functions, which include cell adhesion, haptotactic cell migration, cell proliferation, and spreading on extracellular matrices (Fig. 2, G–N). In all these functional assays, the E359K-CD cells had the most severe defects when plated on either collagen I or Matrigel. The PBS mutant cells showed less severe, yet significant defects, while the K220M cells showed the least severe phenotype with a mild yet significant adhesion and migration defect, but no differences in proliferation or spreading when compared with cells expressing WT-ILK (Fig. 2, G–N). Together these results demonstrate that the three mutations within the pseudokinase domain of ILK variably affect multiple integrin-dependent cell functions. We next investigated the mechanisms whereby the mutants induce their different phenotypes in CD cells. We initially defined the effects of the various ILK mutants on the levels of the major components of the IPP complex and paxillin, which is thought to bind to ILK via the highly conserved PBS site. Immunoblots of total cell lysates of CD cells expressing WT-ILK and the K220M mutation demonstrated that all three components of the IPP complex as well as paxillin were present (Fig. 3, A and B); however, similar to cells lacking ILK (KO), there was almost no α-parvin in the lysates of the E359K and PBS mutants (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results were observed for β-parvin, which is also expressed in CD cells (Fig. S2), demonstrating that there is no compensation by β-parvin for the decreased α-parvin. There were no differences in the amount of pinch or paxillin in cells expressing WT-ILK or any of the mutants (Fig. 3, A and B). We next defined which proteins formed a complex with ILK by performing 12 h immunoprecipitation assays with an antibody directed against FLAG. Similar amounts of ILK were immunoprecipitated from WT- and K220M-ILK expressing cells; however, less was immunoprecipitated from the PBS and E359K mutants, respectively, suggesting there may be degradation of these mutant forms of ILK. Almost no α-parvin or β-parvin, pinch, or paxillin was immunoprecipitated with the E359K mutant (Fig. 3, C and D and Fig. S2). By contrast, pinch, but not α-parvin, β-parvin, or paxillin, was coimmunoprecipitated with the PBS or K220M mutants. We next examined whether the mutant ILK proteins localize to focal adhesion on cells that were plated on collagen I by performing costaining with ILK and phospho-paxillin antibodies. Interestingly, the WT-ILK as well as PBS and K220M mutants colocalized with phospho-paxillin (Fig. 3, E and F); however, there was almost no colocalization between the E359K mutant and phospho-paxillin, except in large paxillin focal adhesions (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, E359K-ILK is absent from most focal adhesions and does not form a complex with parvin, paxillin, and pinch. By contrast, the PBS and K220M mutants bind with pinch and localize to focal adhesions even though they do not form a complex with paxillin or parvin. We previously showed that the cellular lifetime of the PBS mutant is decreased relative to WT-ILK (12Moik D. Bottcher A. Makhina T. Grashoff C. Bulus N. Zent R. Fassler R. Mutations in the paxillin-binding site of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) destabilize the pseudokinase domain and cause embryonic lethality in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 18863-18871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore dermined WT, E359K-, PBS-, and K220M-ILK levels in CD cells 8, 18, and 24 h after treatment with cylohexamide (to inhibit protein synthesis). There was an approximately 20% decrease of WT ILK at 8 h, which stayed relatively constant until the 24 h time point. By contrast, the amount of E359K decreased by about 30% at 8 h, 50% at 18 h, and 68% at 24 h. The decrease in the PBS and K220M mutants was between the WT and E359K mutants at 18 and 24 h (Fig. 4, A and B). The half-lives of WT, E359K-, PBS-, and K220M-ILK are 63.7, 15.5, 24.1, and 24.7 h, respectively. As the difference in amounts between all the mutants and WT ILK and between the E359K mutant and the PBS or K220M mutant was significant at 24 h, we assessed the amounts of α-parvin, pinch, and paxillin in the various cell lines at this time point. Cycloheximide decreased α-parvin by approximately 60% in the CD cells expressing WT-ILK, 75% in the E359K and PBS mutants, and 90% in the K220M mutants (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, cycloheximide decreased pinch by 30% in WT and K220M ILK cells, but this was markedly decreased by 90% and 80% in the E359K and PBS mutants, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). Finally, cycloheximide decreased paxillin by 30% in ILK WT CD cells, and it was down by 50%, 60%, and 70% in the E359K, PBS, and K220M CD cells, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, E359K-ILK was turned over quicker than WT-ILK or the other two ILK mutants. Furthermore, α-parvin and pinch turnover was the highest in this E359K mutant followed by the PBS mutant, while in the K220M mutant α-parvin was primarily decreased. Cellular ILK levels are regulated by the Hsp90–Hsc70 chaperone machinery where Hsp90 binds the pseudokinase domain of ILK (19Radovanac K. Morgner J. Schulz J.N. Blumbach K. Patterson C. Geiger T. Mann M. Krieg T. Eckes B. Fassler R. Wickstrom S.A. Stabilization of integrin-linked kinase by the Hsp90-CHIP axis impacts cellular force generation, migration and the fibrotic response.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 1409-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the increased ILK turnover in the E359K, PBS, and K220M mutants was due to a disruption between the mutated ILK proteins and Hsp90. When we immunoprecipitated Hsp90α from the ILK-WT, E359K-, PBS-, and K220M-CD cells and immunoblotted the immunoprecipitated proteins with ILK antibody, ILK was detected in all the cell populations (Fig. 4E). When we immunoprecipitated α-parvin in WT-ILK expressing CD cells, both ILK and Hsp90 were in the immunoprecipitated proteins; however, as expected based on the results shown in Figure 3D, this interaction did not occur in the mutants, where α-parvin is not part of the IPP complex (Fig. 4F). Thus, the mutations in ILK do not alter its ability to bind Hsp-90, which suggests that the increased turnover of the ILK mutants is not due to altered interactions between ILK and the Hsp90–Hsc70 chaperone machinery. As E359K-ILK turnover was significantly higher than either WT-ILK, PBS, and K220M mutants, we tested whether the severe phenotype of this mutant was due to insufficient expression in the cells. We generated CD cells that expressed comparable amounts of WT-ILK and the E359K mutant (E359K/Lo) as well as CD cells that express 2.5 times more E359K-ILK (E359K/Hi) compared with WT-ILK cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast to cells expressing WT-ILK, neither of the E359K mutants expressed α-parvin (Fig. 5A). When adhesion, migration, and proliferation assays were performed, we observed that although E359K/Hi CD cells adhered significantly more than the E359K/Lo CD cells to collagen; they still adhered significantly less than cells expressing WT-ILK (Fig. 5C). The E359K/Hi CD cells did not migrate or proliferate more than the E359K/Lo CD cells (Fig. 5, D and E). Thus, the functional defects observed in cells expressing E359K-ILK are likely due to disruption of global ILK structure that renders it unable to bind to either parvin or pinch. Our results suggest that the E359K, PBS, and K220M mutations caused increased ILK turnover, decreased the amount of parvin (E359K and PBS mutations), and resulted in an inability to form an IPP complex. To better understand the mechanism, we utilized MD simulations of each individual mutation derived from starting coordinates of the WT ILK α-parvin crystal structure (Fig. 6A) (3Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. The pseudoactive site of ILK is essential for its binding to alpha-Parvin and localization to focal adhesions.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In total, 100 ns trajectories were analyzed to determine the impact of each mutation on global structural features as well as hydrogen bonding networks relative to the WT trajectory. The E359K mutation is located in the APE motif of the putative kinase domain, which forms a conserved salt-bridge with R436 within the GHI-subdomain, which comprises the short G, H, and I helices, (Fig. 6B) with a hydrogen occupancy of 97% and 94% for the E359:OE1-R435:H12 and E359:OE2-R435:H22 bonds, respectively. ILK homology with other eurokeyotic protein kinases (EPKs) indicates that E359 is part of the activation segment found in canonical kinases. In addition, the GHI subdomain is an integral element of the EPK allosteric network that contains the R436 residue of the salt bridge (13Yang J. Wu J. Steichen J.M. Kornev A.P. Deal M.S. Li S. Sankaran B. Woods Jr., V.L. Taylor S.S. A conserved Glu-Arg salt bridge connects coevolved motifs that define the eukaryotic protein kinase fold.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415: 666-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The E359K mutation results in disruption of this highly stable and well-conserved salt bridge as there is now minimal hydrogen binding (<5%) between the lysine sidechain and local backbone oxygens (20Kim C.

These results suggest that an E359K mutation significantly impacts the ILK molecule's structural stability that impacts multiple possible downstream effects. Paxillin binding is reported to be disrupted in the PBS mutant (10Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E.

Although paxillin was not included in the simulations, the MD trajectory predicts that the T387 OG1 side-chain oxygen forms hydrogen bonds with the E389 backbone hydrogen (71% occupancy) and with the W383 backbone oxygen (<5% occupancy, Fig. 6C) in the WT system. The PBS mutation replaces V386 and T387 with glycines, which disrupt the hydrophobic interactions of the Val side chain and hydrogen bonds mediated by the Thr hydroxyl side chain. Of interest, a backbone hydrogen bond between the carboxyl oxygen of W383 and amide proton of G387(W383:O-G387:H) was not observed during the PBS MD trajectory. It seems unlikely that loss of this hydrogen bond would yield a global effect on ILK structure. Rather, in conjunction with less favorable hydrophobic interactions with V386G, the loss of the T387G intrahelix hydrogen bond almost certainly disrupts the local stability of the small helix comprising the paxillin binding site and likely affects the overall thermal stability of the ILK molecule. Although ILK has no kinase activity (3Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. The pseudoactive site of ILK is essential for its binding to alpha-Parvin and localization to focal adhesions.Mol.

In the K220M versus WT simulation, the K220 amide side chain was observed to participate in multiple hydrogen bonding with the α- and γ-phosphate oxygen atoms on the bound ATP molecule. Each phosphate group has multiple oxygen atoms that may interact with the K220 sidechain. The sums of the α-phosphate hydrogen bond occupancies with K220:NZH were 62% and 56% for the γ-phosphate; no interactions were observed between K220 and the β-phosphate of ATP. The K220M mutation replaces the electropositive lysine side chain with a nonpolar methionine that does not hydrogen bond with any atoms on the ATP molecule (Fig. 6D). A complete list of hydrogen-bonding occupancies over 10% is provided in Figure S3. Earlier studies show that K220M can alter ILK thermostability (22Fukuda K. Bledzka K. Yang J. Perera H.D. Plow E.F.

Some clinicians lack confidence in injury recognition, management and knowing when to refer. A clinical expert group developed the Brain Injury Screening Tool (BIST) to provide guidance on health care pathways based on clinical indicators of poor recovery. The tool aims to facilitate access to specialist services (if required) to improve longer term prognosis. The tool was developed using a three-step process including: 1) domain mapping; 2) item development and 3) item testing and review. An online retrospective survey of 114 adults (&gt;16 years) who had experienced a mild brain injury in the past 10 years was used to determine the initial psychometric properties of the 15-item symptom scale of the BIST. Participants were randomised to complete the BIST and one of two existing symptom scales; the Rivermead Post-concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) or the Sports Concussion Assessment Test (SCAT-5) symptom scale to determine concurrent validity. Participant responses to the BIST symptom scale items were used to determine scale reliability using Cronbach’s alpha. A principal components analysis explored the underlying factor structure. Spearman’s correlation coefficients determined concurrent validity with the RPQ and SCAT-5 symptom scales. The 15 items were found to require a reading age of 6–8 years old using readability statistics. High concurrent validity was shown against the RPQ ( r = 0.91) and SCAT-5 ( r = 0.90). The BIST total symptom scale (α = 0.94) and the three factors identified demonstrated excellent internal consistency: physical/emotional (α = 0.90), cognitive (α = 0.92) and vestibular-ocular (α = 0.80). This study provides evidence to support the utility, internal consistency, factor structure and concurrent validity of the BIST. Further research is warranted to determine the utility of the BIST scoring criteria and responsiveness to change in patients."

However, the mechanisms responsible for photoreceptor death remain unclear. Here, we tested two hypothesized biochemical events that may underlie photoreceptor death: (i) the failure to prevent aberrant activation of retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) by calcium-sensor proteins (GCAPs) versus (ii) the reduction of GMP phosphorylation rate, preventing its recycling to GDP/GTP. We found that GMP converts to GDP/GTP in the photoreceptor fraction of the retina ∼24-fold faster in WT mice and ∼400-fold faster in rd3 mice than GTP conversion to cGMP by RetGC. Adding purified RD3 to the retinal extracts inhibited RetGC 4-fold but did not affect GMP phosphorylation in wildtype or rd3 retinas. RD3-deficient photoreceptors rapidly degenerated in rd3 mice that were reared in constant darkness to prevent light-activated GTP consumption via RetGC and phosphodiesterase 6. In contrast, rd3 degeneration was alleviated by deletion of GCAPs. After 2.5 months, only ∼40% of photoreceptors remained in rd3/rd3 retinas. Deletion of GCAP1 or GCAP2 alone preserved 68% and 57% of photoreceptors, respectively, whereas deletion of GCAP1 and GCAP2 together preserved 86%.

Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo results support the hypothesis that RD3 prevents photoreceptor death primarily by suppressing activation of RetGC by both GCAP1 and GCAP2 but do not support the hypothesis that RD3 plays a significant role in GMP recycling.

RD3 not only enables the normal function of rods and cones but also is essential for their survival—in addition to the reduction of rod and cone responses, the lack of RD3 causes rapid progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors (1Friedman J.S.

Therefore, the reduction of RetGC activity per se does not constitute the principal cause of apoptosis in RD3-deficient rods and cones. In previous studies, we established that RD3 strongly inhibits RetGC activity (17Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M.

When the residual RetGC in rd3 photoreceptors cannot be stimulated by GCAPs, this drastically slows their degeneration, despite further reduction in their cGMP production rate (17Peshenko I.V.

These observations gave rise to the hypothesis that RD3 protects photoreceptors against rapid degeneration primarily by blocking aberrant activation of RetGC by GCAPs in the inner segment (17Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Functional study and mapping sites for interaction with the target enzyme in retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein.J. Biol.

In this study, we further evaluated this hypothesis by comparing the effect of deleting GCAP1 and the effect of deleting GCAP2 on rd3 photoreceptor degeneration. We also tested an alternative hypothesis recently proposed by Wimberg et al. (20Wimberg H. Janssen-Bienhold U. Koch K.-W. Control of the nucleotide cycle in photoreceptor cell extracts by retinal degeneration protein 3.Front Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This hypothesis suggests that the RD3-deficient photoreceptors die because they are unable to stimulate RD3-dependent phosphorylation of GMP. The decay of GTP to GMP in photoreceptors accelerates in the light, when RetGC converts GTP to cGMP and PDE6 subsequently hydrolyses cGMP to 5’GMP (reviewed in (2Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Insights into the role of RD3 in guanylate cyclase trafficking, photoreceptor degeneration, and Leber congenital amaurosis.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2014; 7: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). According to the Wimberg et al. (20Wimberg H. Janssen-Bienhold U. Koch K.-W. Control of the nucleotide cycle in photoreceptor cell extracts by retinal degeneration protein 3.Front Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) hypothesis, RD3 is required to stimulate guanylate kinase in the inner segment to recycle GMP back to the GDP pool. Consequently, in the absence of RD3, photoreceptors cannot phosphorylate GMP and fail to replenish GTP consumed by RetGC (20Wimberg H. Janssen-Bienhold U. Koch K.-W. Control of the nucleotide cycle in photoreceptor cell extracts by retinal degeneration protein 3.Front Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In our study, we compared the rates of GMP phosphorylation and GTP consumption in photoreceptors of the normal and RD3-deficient mice and tested how RD3 affected the rate of GMP recycling to the GDP/GTP pool. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the protective role of RD3 against photoreceptor degeneration is to counteract stimulation of RetGC by both GCAP1 and GCAP2. In contrast, the results also rule out the possibility that RD3 deficiency causes photoreceptor degeneration by making them unable to recycle GMP produced via the light-activated RetGC/PDE6 pathway. Figure 1A illustrates the hypothesis that an aberrant GCAP-stimulated RetGC activity in the inner segment triggers rd3 degeneration (17Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M.

Neurosci. 2018; 11: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We emphasize that we estimated only the depletion of GTP to GMP via RetGC1/PDE6 activity, hypothetically counteracted by RD3, not the depletion of the GTP via GTPase activities, such as that of transducin (5Koch K.-W.

To avoid potential nonspecific effects of RD3 on a complex enzymatically coupled spectrophotometric assay used in study by Wimberg et al. (20Wimberg H. Janssen-Bienhold U. Koch K.-W. Control of the nucleotide cycle in photoreceptor cell extracts by retinal degeneration protein 3.Front Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we directly monitored [3H]GMP phosphorylation, combining its conversion to [3H]GDP by guanylate kinase and subsequently to [3H]GTP by nucleoside diphosphokinase, highly active in photoreceptors (27Berger S.J. DeVries G.W. Carter J.G. Schulz D.W. Passonneau P.N. Lowry O.H. Ferrendelli J.A. The distribution of the components of the cyclic GMP cycle in retina.J. Biol.

Tymoczko J.L. Gatto G.J. Stryer L. Biochemistry.8th addition. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY2015Google Scholar). The method utilized separation of the [3H]GMP substrate (Fig. 3A) from its phosphorylated products, [3H]GDP and [3H]GTP, using TLC on polyethyleneimine (PEI) cellulose (Fig. 3B). Incubation with the retinal extract resulted in a complete conversion of [3H]GMP to the phosphorylated species (Fig. 3C), indicating a lack of interference from any reversible reactions potentially capable of affecting the analysis. The concentrations of GMP and ATP in the assay (1 mM and 2 mM, respectively) by far exceeded the respective 14 μM km,GMP and 0.4 mM km,ATP values for the retinal guanylate kinase reported by Hall and Kuhn (29Hall S.W. Kühn H. Purification and properties of guanylate kinase from bovine retinas and rod outer segments.Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). [3H]GMP conversion to [3H]GDP/[3H]GTP in the conditions of the assay was directly proportional to the concentration of the retinal extracts and remained linear throughout the incubation period (Fig. 3, D and E). In WT mouse retinas that retained normal complement of photoreceptors (Fig. 4A), GMP was phosphorylated at the rate of 32 nmol/min/retina (Fig. 4B, Table 1). However, the photoreceptor layer comprises only approximately half of the retinal tissue mass (Fig. 4A, highlighted in yellow). Therefore, to evaluate the fraction of GMP-phosphorylating activity in the photoreceptor layer, we compared the WT (Rd3+/+) retinas with the Rd3+/+ retinas from CORD6 transgenic mouse line 362 (30Dizhoor A.M.

However, limited studies focused on jointly associated genetic variance between systolic pressure (SBP), diastolic pressure (DBP) and BMI. Therefore, a bivariate twin study was performed to explore the genetic variants associated with BMI-SBP, BMI-DBP and SBP-DBP. A total of 380 twin pairs (137 dizygotic pairs and 243 monozygotic pairs) recruited from Qingdao Twin Registry system were used to access the genetic correlations (0.2108 for BMI-SBP, 0.2345 for BMI-DBP, and 0.6942 for SBP-DBP, respectively) by bivariate Cholesky decomposition model. Bivariate GWAS in 137 dizygotic pairs nominated 27 single identified 27 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) for BMI and SBP, 27 QTNs for BMI and DBP, and 25 QTNs for SBP and DBP with the suggestive P -value threshold of 1×10 −5 . After imputation, we found eight SNPs, one for both BMI-SBP and SBP-DBP, and eight for SBP-DBP, exceed significant statistic level. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis identified rs4794029 as new significant eQTL in tissues related to BMI and SBP. Also, we found 6 new significant eQTLs (rs4400367, rs10113750, rs11776003, rs3739327, rs55978930, and rs4794029) in tissues were related to SBP and DBP. Gene-based analysis identified nominally associated genes ( P &lt; 0.05) with BMI-SBP, BMI-DBP, and SBP-DBP, respectively, such as PHOSPHO1 , GNGT2 , KEAP1 , and S1PR5 . In the pathway analysis, we found some pathways associated with BMI-SBP, BMI-DBP and SBP-DBP, such as prion diseases, IL5 pathway, cyclin E associated events during G1/S transition, TGF beta signaling pathway, G βγ signaling through PI3Kγ, prolactin receptor signaling etc. These findings may enrich the results of genetic variants related to BMI and BP traits, and provide some evidences to future study the pathogenesis of hypertension and obesity in the northern Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W3128177814,"An unhealthy diet during childhood directly impacts the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) later on in life. However, well-documented information on this issue is lacking. We investigated the dietary quality of young Indonesian children and assessed the relationship to serum adiponectin levels as an early marker of NCDs. Eighty-five (44 girls and 41 boys) Indonesian preschool-age children in East Jakarta were included in this study. Dietary intake data were gathered by collecting repeated 24-hour recalls for one weekday and one day during the weekend, which were then further converted into participants’ Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2015 scores. Meanwhile, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to determine the serum adiponectin level. A multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the association between the HEI 2015 score and serum adiponectin, adjusting for potential confounders. The mean HEI 2015 score was 33.2 ± 8.3 points, which was far below the recommended score of ≥ 80 points, while the mean serum adiponectin was 10.3 ± 4.1 μg/mL. Multiple linear regression testing showed that a one-point increase in the HEI 2015 score was significantly associated with an increase in the serum adiponectin level by 0.115 μg/mL after adjusting for exclusive breastfeeding history (β = 0.115; 95% CI = 0.010–0.221; p = 0.032). In conclusion, better adherence of young children to a healthy diet has a positive association with their adiponectin level. This result suggests that strengthening children’s dietary quality from an early age by involving all parties in the children’s environment (e.g., parents, teachers at school, policymakers) may help to reduce the risk of NCDs later on in childhood and during adult life."
https://openalex.org/W3128878076,"Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that infect animals and humans with proteinaceous particles called prions. Prions consist of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc), a misfolded version of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). During disease progression, PrPSc replicates by interacting with PrPC and inducing its conversion to PrPSc. Attachment of PrPC to cellular membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is critical for the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. However, the mechanisms governing PrPC conversion and replication on the membrane remain largely unclear. Here, a site-selectively modified PrP variant equipped with a fluorescent GPI anchor mimic (PrP-GPI) was employed to directly observe PrP at the cellular membrane in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. PrP-GPI exhibits a cholesterol-dependent membrane accumulation and a cytoskeleton-dependent mobility. More specifically, inhibition of actin polymerization reduced the diffusion of PrP-GPI indicating protein clustering, which resembles the initial step of PrP aggregation and conversion into its pathogenic isoform. An intact actin cytoskeleton might therefore prevent conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and offer new therapeutic angles.

To date, the mechanisms of PrPC-PrPSc conversion, PrPSc replication, and the molecular pathways leading to neurodegeneration are largely unknown.

In this context, deciphering the earliest pathophysiologic events in prion diseases by direct observation of posttranslationally modified PrP at the cellular membrane, the initial site of prion infection and PrP misfolding is of utmost importance. So far, most studies used recombinant PrP lacking posttranslational modifications as a surrogate (14Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A.

To this end, semisynthesis offers a unique possibility to access homogeneous, membrane-anchored, labeled PrP-GPI (Fig. 1). The semisynthetic approach relies on linking a synthetic membrane anchoring peptide to recombinantly produced PrP-α-thioester by expressed protein ligation (EPL) (17Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A.

These experiments revealed specific binding of PrP-GPI to membranes, distinct from unmodified PrP, with impact on biochemical and conformational properties of the protein. Critical roles for both the C-terminal and the N-terminal domain of PrP-GPI were found (22Chu N.K. Shabbir W. Bove-Fenderson E. Araman C. Lemmens-Gruber R. Harris D.A. Becker C.F.

Here, we aim at directly studying the movement of semisynthetic membrane-anchored PrP in its native environment by fluorescence microscopy. This setup allows discerning the effect of membrane properties on PrP mobility and their role in triggering protein misfolding. Extension of our semisynthetic approach toward additional fluorescence labeling with Cy5 produced homogeneously labeled PrP-GPI to directly study the PrP–cellular membrane interaction within living neuronal SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1). Expressed protein ligation (EPL) under optimized conditions afforded pure PrP-GPI with a yield of 14% over all steps (ESI), which was folded with 69% yield. CD spectroscopy revealed a predominantly α-helical fold, in very good agreement with previously reported results (Fig. S1) (22Chu N.K. Shabbir W. Bove-Fenderson E. Araman C. Lemmens-Gruber R.

In turn, cell imaging experiments based on superresolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) combined with colocalization analysis were then applied to study the cellular localization of folded Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI. In our experimental setup, superresolution (SR) images of SH-SY5Y cells were acquired with SIM (Fig. 2A). Prior to fixation, these cells were incubated for 1 h with Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI in the presence of Cellmask (to stain membranes). In order to accelerate the process of PrP-GPI transfer from solution to the cell membrane, the cationic liposome-based transfection agent Pro-Ject was employed (26Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Lipofection: A highly efficient, lipid-mediated DNA-transfection procedure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For quantification and statistical interpretation of colocalization between PrP-GPI and the cellular membrane, Pearson's (rp or PCC) and Manders' (M1, M2) coefficients (27Manders E.M. Verbeek F.J.

Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Colocalization was proven with Manders' (M1, M2) coefficients close to 1 (Fig. 2B). In addition, a plot of the Van Steensel's cross-correlation function (CCF) (31van Steensel B. van Binnendijk E.P. Hornsby C.D. van der Voort H.T. Krozowski Z.S. de Kloet E.R. van Driel R.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 787-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained by shifting one of the SIM images relative to the other, which afforded a bell-shaped curve with its maxima located at δx = 0, confirming complete colocalization (Fig. 2B). The observed membrane-binding pattern agrees very well with findings reported for other PrP variants carrying a GPI anchor (mimic) and for PrPC (20Olschewski D. Seidel R. Miesbauer M. Rambold A.S. Oesterhelt D. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Engelhard M. Becker C.F. Semisynthetic murine prion protein equipped with a GPI anchor mimic incorporates into cellular membranes.Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 994-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the contrary, PrP lacking a GPI anchor was not found to be located at the cellular membrane but occurred as small, bright spots that most likely constitute large PrP aggregates. Noteworthy, the GPI anchor mimic by itself showed a strong interaction with the cell membrane confirming its critical role in localizing PrP-GPI on the membrane (Fig. S2). Taken together, SR microscopy combined with quantitative and statistical colocalization analysis verified native-like membrane localization of our semisynthetic PrP-GPI species on SH-SY5Y cells. This was the basis for further studying the relation between PrP-GPI and the highly dynamic and spatially heterogeneous membrane on a molecular level by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Assessing diverse molecular dynamics in live specimen is a challenge well met by FCS. By measuring dynamic processes such as diffusion and interactions within typical timescales of micro- to milliseconds based on fluctuations of the fluorescence signal, FCS provides a quantitative approach to observe such mechanisms at the molecular level (32Rigler R. Mets Ü. Diffusion of single molecules through a Gaussian laser beam.SPIE Laser Spectrosc. Biomol. 1992; 1921: 239-248Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For assessing PrP–membrane interactions, the membrane accumulation and mobility of Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI at the plasma membrane of SH-SY5Y cells were analyzed together with established membrane probes that are linked to different patterns of membrane organization. Treatments with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD), a cholesterol-depleting agent that changes membrane composition, and addition of latrunculin A (LatA), an actin polymerization inhibitor (33Simons K.

Schutz G.J. Eggeling C. Cebecauer M. There is no simple model of the plasma membrane organization.Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 4: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To assess the role of cholesterol-dependent membrane domains on PrP-GPI membrane localization, SH-SY5Y cells transiently transfected with green fluorescent protein carrying a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (GFP-GPI AP) that acts as a cholesterol-dependent membrane domain marker were treated with mβCD, a cholesterol-depleting agent (38Huang S.

Quantification was based on colocalization analysis of nontreated compared with mβCD pretreated GFP-GPI AP transfected SH-SY5Y cells incubated with Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI. Over a time period of 40 min, significantly less PrP-GPI accumulated at the cell membrane of mβCD pretreated cells (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3, Table S1). Thus, disturbances in the integrity of the cholesterol-rich, ordered membrane domains influence PrP–GPI membrane binding without affecting its diffusion properties (Fig. 3B). This finding agrees with other studies highlighting the necessity of cholesterol for PrPC localization at the cell surface (8Goold R. Rabbanian S. Sutton L. Andre R. Arora P. Moonga J. Clarke A.R.

Typically, the diffusion of membrane-anchored proteins such as GFP-GPI AP located in the ordered and tightly packed cholesterol-dependent domains is increased upon treatment with mβCD (38Huang S.

Confocal FCS data of Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI on SH-SY5Y cell membranes was best fitted with a two-component model (2D, 2p) yielding the diffusion coefficients (D) and fractions of PrP-GPI in solution and bound to the cell membrane. The fast component represents PrP-GPI in the extracellular space not linked to the membrane (D ∼ 30 μm2/s, fraction 60%), and the slow component corresponds to membrane-bound PrP-GPI (D ∼ 0.6 μm2/s, fraction 40%), respectively. Here, we solely focus on the relevant slow component representing membrane-bound PrP-GPI. The dynamics of Cy5-labeled membrane-bound PrP-GPI remained unaffected by mβCD treatment and retained a diffusion coefficient of ∼0.6 μm2/s (Fig. 3B, Table S3). This suggests a stronger anchoring of PrP-GPI within the cholesterol-dependent domains of the plasma membrane or the involvement of additional factors, e.g., links to the cytoskeleton. Other studies of GPI-anchored proteins, such as the folate receptor and CD52, indicate a direct or indirect link to the actin cytoskeleton and binding of these GPI-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane (44Raghupathy R.

Cell Biol. 2014; 29: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such a link could explain the strong anchoring of PrP-GPI to the cellular membrane rendering its mobility unaffected by cholesterol depletion. To address such an involvement of the cytoskeleton in PrP–GPI interactions on the membrane, we disrupted the cytoskeleton by exposing the cells to LatA (47Bacia K. Scherfeld D. Kahya N. Schwille P. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy relates rafts in model and native membranes.Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This treatment had no significant effect on the fraction of PrP-GPI not bound to the membrane (Fig. S4) and also did not render membrane-bound PrP-GPI more mobile as could be expected based on previous observations with proteins carrying a transmembrane domain such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Bag et al. showed an increase in both the fractions of slow-diffusing and fast-diffusing EGFR populations after LatA treatment that were attributed to synergistic effects of EGFR clustering on removal of the cytoskeleton barrier and a release of cytoskeleton-bound EGFR, respectively (38Huang S.

In contrast, PrP–GPI cytoskeleton disruption caused a significant decrease in the diffusion coefficients from 0.6 ± 0.11 to 0.4 ± 0.12 μm2/s for membrane-bound PrP-GPI (Fig. 3C; Table S4; Fig. S5 shows confocal images of Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI bound to LifeAct-GFP transfected SH-SY5Y cells). Slower dynamics associated with clustering have been described previously for other peptides and proteins, including PrP itself (49Bag N. Ali A. Chauhan V.S. Wohland T. Mishra A.

A. 2015; 112: 8308-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Control measurements with GFP-GPI AP showed no effect of LatA treatment on mobility of this GPI-anchored membrane probe and exclude a general effect on GPI-anchored proteins (Fig. S6, Table S5). Elucidating the pathophysiologic events in prion diseases involves understanding the trigger(s) of the conformational change of cellular (PrPC) into scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) that further propagates PrPC misfolding and aggregation. To this end, recent studies describe fibril fragmentation and elongation of individual recombinant murine PrP aggregates from seeded aggregation in the test tube (51Sang J.C. Meisl G. Thackray A.M. Hong L. Ponjavic A. Knowles T.P.J. Bujdoso R. Klenerman D. Direct observation of murine prion protein replication in Vitro.J. Am. Chem.

Direct observation of prion protein oligomer formation reveals an aggregation mechanism with multiple conformationally distinct species.Chem. Sci. 2019; 10: 4588-4597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But so far, experimental studies have been very limited in directly analyzing the earliest events of PrP misfolding at the cellular membrane of live cells, the initial site of prion infection, by a lack of suitably modified PrP variants and sophisticated experimental setups. Here, application of a semisynthesis strategy offers a unique opportunity to access homogeneous membrane-anchored Cy5-labeled PrP (PrP-GPI) allowing to directly observe PrP on the cellular membrane. SR images confirmed a native-like membrane localization of Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI on SH-SY5Y cells. Upon manipulating the integrity of the cholesterol-rich, ordered membrane domains in the cell membrane, membrane binding of PrP-GPI decreased but the diffusion dynamics of membrane-bound PrP-GPI remained unaffected. Cytoskeleton disruption, however, caused slower diffusion of PrP-GPI on the membrane. We propose that these slower dynamics of Cy5-labeled PrP-GPI at the membrane are linked to PrP clustering and constitute the initial step of PrP aggregation. Providing direct evidence for PrP clustering on live cells is quite challenging. For example, Goold et al. (8Goold R. Rabbanian S. Sutton L. Andre R. Arora P. Moonga J. Clarke A.R. Schiavo G. Jat P. Collinge J. Tabrizi S.J. Rapid cell-surface prion protein conversion revealed using a novel cell system.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 281Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have previously analyzed a PrP knockdown cell line expressing epitope-tagged PrPC upon infection with exogenous PrPSc by immunostaining. Shortly after prion exposure, PrPSc was detected on the plasma membrane by immunostaining. This is, however, only feasible on fixed cells and impedes dynamic studies. According to the picket-fence model by Fujiwara et al. (34Ritchie K. Iino R. Fujiwara T. Murase K. Kusumi A.

https://openalex.org/W3126161104,"Interleukin-31 (IL-31) is involved in excessive development of cutaneous sensory nerves in atopic dermatitis (AD), leading to severe pruritus. We previously reported that PQA-18, a prenylated quinolinecarboxylic acid (PQA) derivative, is an immunosuppressant with inhibition of p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) and improves skin lesions in Nc/Nga mice as an AD model. In the present study, we investigate the effect of PQA-18 on sensory nerves in lesional skin. PQA-18 alleviates cutaneous nerve fiber density in the skin of Nc/Nga mice. PQA-18 also inhibits IL-31-induced sensory nerve fiber outgrowth in dorsal root ganglion cultures. Signaling analysis reveals that PQA-18 suppresses phosphorylation of PAK2, Janus kinase 2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), activated by IL-31 receptor (IL-31R), resulting in inhibition of neurite outgrowth in Neuro2A cells. Gene silencing analysis for PAK2 confirms the requirement for STAT3 phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth elicited by IL-31R activation. LC/MS/MS analysis reveals that PQA-18 prevents the formation of PAK2 activation complexes induced by IL-31R activation. These results suggest that PQA-18 inhibits the IL-31 pathway through suppressing PAK2 activity, which suppresses sensory nerve outgrowth. PQA-18 may be a valuable lead for the development of a novel drug for pruritus of AD."

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the type strains of L . atacamensis and L . deserti shared 99.7% sequence similarity. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between the genomes of two type strains were 88.6% and 98.8%, respectively, greater than the two recognized thresholds values of 70% dDDH and 95–96% ANI for bacterial species delineation. These results suggested that L . atacamensis and L . deserti should share the same taxonomic position. And this conclusion was further supported by similar phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features between them. Therefore, we propose that L . deserti is a later heterotypic synonym of L . atacamensis ."
https://openalex.org/W3127617832,"Background and objective To study the cumulative incidence and surgical treatment of midline incisional hernia (MIH) after cystectomy for bladder cancer. Methods In the nationwide Bladder Cancer Data Base Sweden (BladderBaSe), cystectomy was performed in 5646 individuals. Cumulative incidence MIH and surgery for MIH were investigated in relation to age, gender, comorbidity, previous laparotomy and/or inguinal hernia repair, operative technique, primary/secondary cystectomy, postoperative wound dehiscence, year of surgery, and period-specific mean annual hospital cystectomy volume (PSMAV). Results Three years after cystectomy the cumulative incidence of MIH and surgery for MIH was 8% and 4%, respectively. The cumulative incidence MIH was 12%, 9% and 7% in patients having urinary diversion with continent cutaneous pouch, orthotopic neobladder and ileal conduit. Patients with postoperative wound dehiscence had a higher three-year cumulative incidence MIH (20%) compared to 8% without. The corresponding cumulative incidence surgery for MIH three years after cystectomy was 9%, 6%, and 4% for continent cutaneous, neobladder, and conduit diversion, respectively, and 11% for individuals with postoperative wound dehiscence (vs 4% without). Using multivariable Cox regression, secondary cystectomy (HR 1.3 (1.0–1.7)), continent cutaneous diversion (HR 1.9 (1.1–2.4)), robot-assisted cystectomy (HR 1.8 (1–3.2)), wound dehiscence (HR 3.0 (2.0–4.7)), cystectomy in hospitals with PSMAV 10–25 (HR 1.4 (1.0–1.9)), as well as cystectomy during later years (HRs 2.5–3.1) were all independently associated with increased risk of MIH. Conclusions The cumulative incidence of MIH was 8% three years postoperatively, and increase over time. Avoiding postoperative wound dehiscence after midline closure is important to decrease the risk of MIH."

As we threw away our cell cultures and wound down our animal colonies, we imagined the manuscripts we would finally draft, the papers we would read, and the bioinformatic skills we would learn. However, our plans went astray a few days later when we received an email from our program director with a subject line that read: “Interested in an ‘at home’ public health project to help fight COVID-19?” The email set us down a path we never imagined—one that taught us how the soft skills we've learned in graduate school can serve us in the real world. We also learned the hard way that in order to take care of others, we must first take care of ourselves."
