https://openalex.org/W2883635247,"Mucosal changes in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by a prominent infiltration of inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, macrophages, T cells and neutrophils. The precise etiology of IBD is unknown but it involves a complex interplay of factors associated with the immune system, environment, host genotype and enteric commensal bacteria. As there is no known safe cure for IBD, natural alternative therapeutic options without side effects are urgently needed. To this end, Soy-based foods, which have been eaten for centuries in Asian countries, have potential benefits, including lowering the incidence of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes, allergic response, and autoimmune diseases. This study describes the effect of Soy isoflavons 4', 5, 7 Trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced experimental colitis. The extent and severity of disease was analyzed through body weight, histopathological analysis, cellular immune response, systemic cytokine levels, and inflammation score using a disease activity index. Genistein treatment significantly attenuated DSS-induced colitis severity and resulted in increase in body weight, colon length and reduction in inflammation score. Genistein also skews M1 macrophages towards the M2 phenotype. Further, gen also reduced the systemic cytokine levels as compared to vehicle control. This serves as the first detailed study towards natural soya based product that shows the polarization of M1 towards M2 macrophages, and reduction of systemic cytokine in part to attenuate the colitis symptoms. Thus, our work demonstrates that genistein, a soya compound, may be useful for the treatment of IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2883641933,"Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant cells in human blood. Remarkably RBCs deform and bridge together to form aggregates under very low shear rates. The theory and mechanics behind aggregation are, however, not yet completely understood. The main objective of this work is to quantify and characterize RBC aggregates in order to enhance the current understanding of the non-Newtonian behaviour of blood in microcirculation. Suspensions of human blood were flowed and observed in vitro in poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS) microchannels to characterize RBC aggregates. These microchannels were fabricated using standard photolithography methods. Experiments were performed using a micro particle image velocimetry (μPIV) system for shear rate measurements, coupled with a high-speed camera for flow visualization. RBC aggregate sizes were quantified in controlled and measurable shear rate environments for 5, 10 and 15% hematocrit. Aggregate sizes were determined using image processing techniques, while apparent viscosity was measured using optical viscometry. For the samples suspended at 5% H, aggregate size was not strongly correlated with shear rate. For the 10% H suspensions, in contrast, lowering the shear rate below 10 s-1 resulted in a significant increase of RBC aggregate sizes. The viscosity was found to increase with decreasing shear rate and increasing hematocrit, exemplifying the established non-Newtonian shear-thinning behaviour of blood. Increase in aggregation size did not translate into a linear increase of the blood viscosity. Temperature was shown to affect blood viscosity as expected, however, no correlation for aggregate size with temperature was observed. Non-Newtonian parameters associated with power law and Carreau models were determined by fitting the experimental data and can be used towards the simple modeling of blood’s non-Newtonian behaviour in microcirculation. This work establishes a relationship between RBC aggregate sizes and corresponding shear rates and one between RBC aggregate sizes and apparent blood viscosity at body and room temperatures, in a microfluidic environment for low hematocrit. Effects of hematocrit, shear rate, viscosity and temperature on RBC aggregate sizes have been quantified."
https://openalex.org/W2884299922,"The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is commonly used to screen for depressive disorder and for monitoring depressive symptoms. However, there are mixed findings regarding its factor structure (i.e., whether it has a unidimensional, two-dimensional, or bi-factor structure). Furthermore, its measurement invariance between non-clinical and clinical populations and that between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and MDD with comorbid anxiety disorder (AD) is unknown. Japanese adults with MDD (n = 406), MDD with AD (n = 636), and no psychiatric disorders (non-clinical population; n = 1,163) answered this questionnaire on the Internet. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the bi-factor model had a better fit than the unidimensional and two-dimensional factor models did. The results of a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis indicated scalar invariance between the non-clinical and only MDD groups, and that between the only MDD and MDD with AD groups. In conclusion, the bi-factor model with two specific factors was supported among the non-clinical, only MDD, and MDD with AD groups. The scalar measurement invariance model was supported between the groups, which indicated the total or sub-scale scores were comparable between groups."
https://openalex.org/W2883298821,"To investigate the role of miR-122 in the development and regression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in vitro, we used multicellular 3D human liver organoids developed in our laboratory. These organoids consist of primary human hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, quiescent stellate cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. They remain viable and functional for 4 weeks expressing typical markers of liver function such as synthesis of albumin, urea, and alpha-1 p450 drug metabolism. Before mixing, hepatic cells were transduced with lentivirus to inhibit miR122 expression (ABM, CA). Immediately after the organoids were fully formed (day 4) or after 1 or 2 weeks of additional incubation (days 11 or 18), the organoids were analyzed using fluorescent live/dead staining and ATP production; total RNA was extracted for qPCR gene expression profiling. Our results show that miR-122 inhibition in liver organoids leads to inflammation, necrosis, steatosis and fibrosis. This was associated with increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL6, TNF), chemokines (CCL2, CCL3) and increase in a subset of Matrix Metaloproteinases (MMP8, MMP9). An altered expression of key genes in lipid metabolism (i.e LPL, LDLR) and insulin signaling (i.e GLUT4, IRS1) was also identified. Conclusion: Our results highlight the role of miR-122 inhibition in liver inflammation, steatofibrosis and dysregulation of insulin signaling. Patients with NAFLD are known to have altered levels of miR-122, therefore we suggest that miR-122 mimics could play a useful role in reversing liver steatofibrosis and insulin resistance seen in patients with NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2883497608,"Background Gendered power dynamics within couple relationships can constrain women from achieving positive sexual and reproductive health outcomes. But little is known about relationship power among adolescents, and tools to measure it are rarely validated among adolescents. We tested the Sexual Relationship Power Scale (SRPS) among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and examined associations with select health outcomes. Methods A 16-item adaptation of the SRPS was administered to AGYW aged 15–24 in Kenya (n = 1,101). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and theta coefficients assessed scale performance for three age bands: 15–17, 18–20, and 21–24 years old. Relationship power levels were examined and multivariate logistic regressions assessed the relationship between power, and partner violence and HIV risk outcomes. Results CFAs confirmed a one factor structure for each subgroup, and thetas for final 15-item scales were robust (>.82). Most respondents reported limited power in their sexual relationships, however older respondents consistently reported lower levels of power. Relationship power was strongly associated with several outcomes, even when controlling for socioeconomic status and schooling. For example, AGYW who reported more relationship power were 12, 6, and 7 times less likely (ages 21–24, 18–20, and 15–17, respectively) to experience sexual violence (p<0.001). Significant relationships were also found in multivariate analyses for physical partner violence (all three age bands), using a condom at last sex (18–20-year-olds), and increased knowledge of partner’s HIV status (21–24-year-olds). Conclusions The SRPS is a good measure of relationship power for several age bands within AGYW, and power is experienced differently by older and younger AGYW. Low relationship power was a consistent predictor of partner violence, as well as an important predictor of HIV risk. Interventions seeking to address HIV and violence should also explicitly address relationship power and utilize validated tools (like the SRPS) to evaluate impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2883372536,"Off-label prescribing of psychiatric drugs is common, despite lacking strong scientific evidence of efficacy and potentially increasing risk for adverse events. The goal of this study was to characterize prevalence of off-label prescriptions of psychiatric drugs and examine patient and clinician predictors of off-label use. This manuscript presents a retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from the 2012 and 2013 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCS). The study examined all adult outpatient visits to psychiatric practices for chronic care management with a single listed visit diagnosis in which at least one psychiatric drug was prescribed. The main outcome measure was off-label prescribing of at least one psychiatric drug, defined as prescription for a condition for which it has not been approved for use by the FDA. Among our sample representative of 1.85 billion outpatient visits, 18.5 million (1.3%) visits were to psychiatrists for chronic care management in which at least one psychiatric drug was prescribed. Overall, the rate of off-label use was 12.9% (95% CI: 12.2-15.7). The most common off-label uses were for manic-depressive psychosis treated with citalopram and primary insomnia treated with trazodone. Several patient and clinician characteristics were positively associated with off-label prescribing, including seeing a psychiatrist (OR: 1.06, 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; p = 0.03) instead of another type of clinician, the office visit taking place in the Western region of the country (OR: 1.09, 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; p = 0.02), and the patient having 3 or more chronic conditions (OR: 1.12, 95% CI, 1.02-1.14; p = 0.003). In contrast, having Medicare coverage (OR: 0.93, 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; p = 0.04) and receiving payment assistance from a medical charity (OR: 0.91, 95% CI, 0.88-0.96; p = 0.03) instead of private insurance were negatively associated with off-label prescribing. These results suggest that certain classes of psychiatric medications are being commonly prescribed to treat conditions for which they have not been determined by the FDA to be clinically efficacious and/or safe."
https://openalex.org/W2883407343,"Phase III trials of long-acting injectable (LAI) PrEP, currently underway, have great potential for expanding the menu of HIV prevention options. Imagining a future in which multiple PrEP modalities are available to potential users of biomedical HIV prevention, we investigated which factors might help direct a patient-physician shared-decision making process to optimize the choice of biomedical HIV prevention method.Participants (n = 105; ages 19-63; 46.7% men of color) were former participants in a PrEP demonstration project and had taken daily oral PrEP for ≥ 12 months. Participants were given information about LAI PrEP and asked whether they would be interested in switching from oral to LAI PrEP. Participants were also asked about specific pros/cons of LAI PrEP, PrEP attitudes and experiences, and personality factors.Two-thirds (66.7%) of current oral PrEP users would switch to LAI PrEP. Intention to switch was associated with product-level and psychosocial factors. Attitudes towards logistical factors (i.e. getting to regular clinic visits for recurring shots) featured more prominently than factors related to the physical experience of PrEP modality (i.e., concerns about injection pain) as motivators for switching. In a multivariate regression model, psychosocial factors including the emotional burden of daily pill taking, deriving a sense of responsibility from PrEP use, and self-identifying as an early adopter, were the strongest predictors of switching.These data underscore the importance of attending not only to product-level factors, but also to the logistical and psychological experience of prevention methods for users. Findings have significant implications for the development of patient education materials and patient-provider shared decision aids."
https://openalex.org/W2884348741,"Introduction The aim of the study was to (i) analyze the match performance of professional female tennis players in different Grand Slams; (ii) model the relationships between match performance variables and relative quality; and (iii) build typical performance profiles for those players in Grand Slams. Method Data of a total of 1369 matches were collected within 2014–2017 four Grand Slams (Australian Open: n = 499; Roland Garros: n = 249; Wimbledon: n = 249 and US Open, n = 372). Correlations between 37 performance variables and relative quality (difference of expected rounds between two competing players of given ranking) were determined and automatically classified into two groups of magnitudes via two-step cluster analysis. Higher-correlated variables were used to build players’ typical performance profiles via regression-based technique to give percentage evaluation scores (%ES), which means the percentage of matches where a performance variable value would be expected to be lower than the observed value considering the RQ of two competing players. Results Players had more service winners, double faults, return winners and return unforced errors in the Australian Open and US Open, implying a “fast-fast” serve strategy, and higher dominance ratio and better serving performance in Wimbledon. While receiving players had better chances to break opponents’ service game in Roland Garros. Distance covered became similar in all Grand Slams. All studied variables showed obvious correlation with RQ expect for those of physical performance. Conclusions The findings (i) indicate that female game in Grand Slams remained to be a contest over baseline, although players had good efficiency at net; (ii) demonstrate the influence of relative quality on serve and return, break point, net point and efficiency performance; and (iii) evidence the usefulness of applying %ES to evaluate performance of individual player."
https://openalex.org/W2883797130,"Blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB) impedes the transportation of antitumor therapeutic drugs into brain tumors. Its mechanism is still unknown, but learning how to improve the BTB permeability is critical for drug intervention. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have appeared as regulation factors of numerous biologic processes and therapeutic targets of diverse diseases. In this study, we have identified that miR-132-3p is an essential miRNA by increasing the transcellular transport through the BTB. We found that miR-132-3p expression was significantly up-regulated in glioma endothelial cells (GECs). Furthermore we showed that miR132-3p+ greatly induced the endocytosis of cholera toxin subunit B and FITC-bovine serum albumin and up-regulated the expression of p-PKB, p-Src and Tyr14 phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (p-Cav-1), while phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) expression was markedly down-regulated in GECs. Our results identify PTEN as a direct and functional downstream target of miR-132-3p, which is involved in the regulation of p-PKB, p-Src, and p-Cav-1. The inhibitors for PI3K and Src significantly reversed the increase of p-Cav-1 induced by miR-132-3p. Moreover, overexpression of PTEN greatly reduced the endocytosis of cholera toxin subunit B and the up-regulation of p-Cav-1 induced by agomiR132-3p, suggesting that miR132-3p+ increases the endothelial permeability by inhibition of PTEN expression. In addition, miR132-3p+ significantly increased the delivery of doxorubicin across the BTB in vitro and contributed to the accumulation of doxorubicin within the brain tumor tissue. Our results show that miR-132-3p contributes to the increased permeability of BTB by targeting PTEN/PI3K/PKB/Src/Cav-1, thereby revealing a novel drug target for the treatment of brain gliomas.-Gu, Y., Cai, R., Zhang, C., Xue, Y., Pan, Y., Wang, J., Zhang, Z. miR-132-3p boosts caveolae-mediated transcellular transport in glioma endothelial cells by targeting PTEN/PI3K/PKB/Src/Cav-1 signaling pathway."

At variance with recent results on quantum reinforcement learning with superconducting circuits, in our current protocol coherent feedback during the learning process is not required, enabling its implementation in a wide variety of quantum systems.

We finally propose possible implementations of this protocol in trapped ions and superconducting circuits. The field of quantum reinforcement learning with quantum technologies will enable enhanced quantum control, as well as more efficient machine learning calculations."
https://openalex.org/W2884321202,"Mutations in the gene Adenomatous Polyposis Coli or APC appear in most sporadic cases of colorectal cancer and it is the most frequent mutation causing hereditary Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. The detailed molecular mechanism by which APC mutations predispose to the development of colorectal cancer is not completely understood. This is in part due to the lack of accessibility to appropriate models that recapitulate the early events associated with APC mediated intestinal transformation. We have established a novel platform utilizing human induced Pluripotent Stem cells or iPSC from normal or FAP-specific APC mutant individuals and evaluated the effect of the mutation in the cells before and after differentiation into intestinal organoids. In order to minimize genetic background effects, we also established an isogenic platform using TALEN-mediated gene editing. Comparison of normal and APC mutant iPSC revealed a significant defect in cell identity and polarity due to the presence of APC in heterozygosity as well as chromosomal aberrations including abnormal anaphases and centrosome numbers. Importantly, upon specification into intestinal progeny, APC heterozygosity was responsible for a major change in the transcriptional identity of the cells with dysregulation of key signaling pathways, including metabolic reprogramming, abnormal lipid metabolism and intestinal-specific cadherin expression. In conclusion, we have developed a novel iPSC/intestinal model of APC mutagenesis and provide strong evidence that APC in heterozygosity imparts a clear phenotypic and molecular defect, affecting basic cellular functions and integrity, providing novel insights in the earlier events of APC-mediated tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2884065794,"How can we predict the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cancer patients based on machine learning with serum creatinine data? Given irregular and heterogeneous clinical data, how can we make the most of it for accurate AKI prediction? AKI is a common and significant complication in cancer patients, and correlates with substantial morbidity and mortality. Since no effective treatment for AKI still exists, it is important to take timely preventive measures. While several approaches have been proposed for predicting AKI, their scope and applicability are limited as they either assume regular data measured over a short hospital stay, or do not fully utilize heterogeneous data. In this paper, we provide an AKI prediction model with a greater applicability, which relaxes the constraints of existing approaches, and fully utilizes irregular and heterogeneous data for learning the model. In a cohort of 21,022 cancer patients who were registered into Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) in Seoul National University Hospital between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2013, our method achieves 0.7892 precision, 0.7506 recall, and 0.7576 F-measure in predicting whether a patient will develop AKI during the next 14 days."
https://openalex.org/W2884960929,"In Japan, which is thought to be a rapidly growing super-aging society, a national campaign named ""the Dementia Supporter Caravan"" has been deployed. The aim of this study was to assess the educational benefits of the dementia supporter training program for nurses and nursing students. We conducted dementia supporter training, and measured knowledge and attitudes regarding people with dementia as educational benefits pre- and post-training. Data sets of 134 nursing students and 63 nurses were analyzed. The results indicated that the two groups gained knowledge, understanding, and the confidence to care for people with dementia after attending the dementia supporter training program. Moreover, the two groups derived different benefits from the program. Nursing students gained substantial knowledge and learnt the importance of early detection and treatment, to levels similar to those of nurses prior to training. The training program reduced the difficulties of nurses to interact with and care for people with dementia. We can conclude that the dementia supporter training program has considerable educational benefits for nurses and nursing students."
https://openalex.org/W2883226031,"Purpose Observational studies have demonstrated increased colon cancer recurrence and mortality in states of excess energy balance, as denoted by factors including sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, increased dietary glycemic load, and increased intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. Nonetheless, the relation between artificially sweetened beverages, a popular alternative for sugar-sweetened beverages, and colon cancer recurrence and survival is unknown. Methods We analyzed data from 1,018 patients with stage III colon cancer who prospectively reported dietary intake during and after chemotherapy while enrolled in a National Cancer Institute-sponsored trial of adjuvant chemotherapy. Using Cox proportional hazards regressions, we assessed associations of artificially sweetened beverage intake with cancer recurrence and mortality. Results Patients consuming one or more 12-ounce servings of artificially sweetened beverages per day experienced an adjusted hazard ratio for cancer recurrence or mortality of 0.54 (95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.80) when compared to those who largely abstained (Ptrend = .004). Similarly, increasing artificially sweetened beverage intake was also associated with a significant improvement in both recurrence-free survival (Ptrend = .005) and overall survival (Ptrend = .02). Substitution models demonstrated that replacing a 12-ounce serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage with an isovolumetric serving of an artificially sweetened beverage per day was associated with a 23% lower risk of cancer recurrence and mortality (relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.95; P = .02). Conclusion Higher artificially sweetened beverage consumption may be associated with significantly reduced cancer recurrence and death in patients with stage III colon cancer. This association may be mediated by substitution for sugar-sweetened alternatives. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2883956366,"The red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) is an important pest of date palms in many regions of the world. This paper reports the first survey of insecticide resistance in field populations of R. ferrugineus in Pakistan which were collected from seven date palm growing areas across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces, Pakistan. The resistance was assessed by the diet incorporation method against the formulated commonly used chemical insecticides profenophos, imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, spinosad, lambda-cyhalothrin and a fumigant phosphine. Elevated levels of resistance were recorded for cypermethrin, deltamethrin and phosphine after a long history of insecticide use in Pakistan. Resistance Ratios (RRs) were 63- to 79-fold for phosphine, 16- to 74-fold for cypermethrin, 13- to 58-fold for deltamethrin, 2.6- to 44-fold for profenophos, 3- to 24-fold for chlorpyrifos, 2- to 12-fold for lambda-cyhalothrin and 1- to 10-fold for spinosad compared to a susceptible control line. Resistant R. ferrugineus populations were mainly found in southern Punjab and to some extent in KPK. The populations from Bahawalpur, Vehari, Layyah and Dera Ghazi Khan were most resistant to chemical insecticides, while all populations exhibited high levels of resistance to phosphine. Of the eight agents tested, lower LC50 and LC90 values were recorded for spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin. These results suggest that spinosad and lambda-cyhalothrin exhibit unique modes of action and given their better environmental profile, these two insecticides could be used in insecticide rotation or assist in phasing out the use of older insecticides. A changed pattern of both insecticides can be used sensibly be recommended without evidence of dose rates and frequencies used."
https://openalex.org/W2882982236,"The ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) integrates different types of stress into a p53-mediated response. Here, we analyzed the impact of the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO on the RPL11-mouse double-minute 2 homolog-p53 signaling. We show that small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)1 and SUMO2 covalently modify RPL11. We find that SUMO negatively modulates the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8) to RPL11 and promotes the translocation of the RP outside of the nucleoli. Moreover, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, is required for RPL11-mediated activation of p53. SUMOylation of RPL11 is triggered by ribosomal stress, as well as by alternate reading frame protein upregulation. Collectively, our data identify SUMO protein conjugation to RPL11 as a new regulator of the p53-mediated cellular response to different types of stress and reveal a previously unknown SUMO-NEDD8 interplay.—El Motiam, A., Vidal, S., de la Cruz-Herrera, C.

https://openalex.org/W2883119505,"Image registration of remotely sensed imagery is challenging, as complex deformations are common. Different deformations, such as affine and homogenous transformation, combined with multimodal data capturing can emerge in the data acquisition process. These effects, when combined, tend to compromise the performance of the currently available registration methods. A new image transform, known as geometric mean projection transform, is introduced in this work. As it is deformation invariant, it can be employed as a feature descriptor, whereby it analyzes the functions of all vertical and horizontal signals in local areas of the image. Moreover, an invariant feature correspondence method is proposed as a point matching algorithm, which incorporates new descriptor's dissimilarity metric. Considering the image as a signal, the proposed approach utilizes a square Eigenvector correlation (SEC) based on the Eigenvector properties. In our experiments on standard test images sourced from ""Featurespace"" and ""IKONOS"" datasets, the proposed method achieved higher average accuracy relative to that obtained from other state of the art image registration techniques. The accuracy of the proposed method was assessed using six standard evaluation metrics. Furthermore, statistical analyses, including t-test and Friedman test, demonstrate that the method developed as a part of this study is superior to the existing methods."
https://openalex.org/W2883138051,"Recent studies showed that induced microRNA-449a (miR-449a) enhances a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint arrest in prostate cancer (LNCaP) and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. In the case of LNCaP cells, upregulated miR-449a directly downregulates c-Myc that is required to induce the cell cycle regulators Cdc25A and Cdc2/CyclinB whose inactivation blocks G2 to M phase transition. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are yet unclear, although in other prostate cancer cells the interactions among p53, miR-449a and Sirt-1 can affect the induction of the G2/M arrest. In order to clarify these molecular mechanisms, in this work we propose a boolean model of the G2/M checkpoint arrest regulation contemplating the influence of miR-449a. The model shows that the cell fate determination between two cellular phenotypes: G2/M-Arrest for DNA repair and G2/M-induced apoptosis is stochastic and influenced by miR-449a state of activation. The results were compared with experimental data available presenting agreement. We also found that several feedback loops are involved in this cell fate regulation and we indicate, through in silico gain or loss of function perturbations of genes, which of these feedback loops are more efficient to favor a specific phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2883954008,"Active contraction of the diaphragm and other inspiratory pump muscles during swallow create a negative thoracic pressure to improve the movement of the bolus (food/liquid) into the esophagus. We tested the hypothesis that dorsomedial medullary inspiratory neurons, including the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS, pre-motor to the phrenic) would be active during swallow induced by oral water infusion. We recorded neurons in the NTS and medial reticular formation in anesthetized spontaneously breathing cats, and induced swallow by injection of water into the oropharynx. Our results indicate that: 1) a majority of inspiratory cells in the dorsomedial medulla are active during swallow, 2) expiratory neurons are present in the medial reticular formation (deeper to the NTS) in unparalyzed cats and a majority of these cells decreased firing frequency during swallow. Our findings suggest that the dorsomedial medulla is a source of inspiratory motor drive during swallow and that a novel population of breathing-modulated neurons that also are modulated during swallowing exist in the medial reticular formation in unparalyzed animals."
https://openalex.org/W2884571435,"Secale L. is a small but important genus that includes cultivated rye. Although genetic diversity of cultivated rye is high, patterns of genetic diversity in the whole genus, and potential factors affecting the distribution of genetic diversity remain elusive. The population structure and distribution of genetic variation within Secale, and its correlation with taxonomic delimitation, cultivation status or spatial distribution in relation to geography and climate zones were analyzed in this study. A collection of 726 individual plants derived from 139 different accessions representing Secale cereale, S. vavilovii, S. strictum, and S. sylvestre were investigated using SSR analysis and sequence diversity analysis of a nuclear EST region. Our results indicated that perennial S. strictum subspecies are genetically divergent from annual forms of the genus. Existence of two distinct clusters within the annual taxa was observed, one corresponding to samples from Asia, and a second to those outside of Asia. No clear genetic structure was observed between different annual species/subspecies, indicating introgression between these taxa. The analysis of cultivated rye revealed that landrace populations from the Middle East have the highest genetic diversity, supporting the idea of the area being the center of origin for cultivated rye. Considering high adaptive potential of those populations, Middle Eastern landraces should be regarded as genetic resources reservoirs for new niches and future breeding programs."

It challenges the traditional paper-based insulating materials, with poor thermal conductivity. Introducing thermally conductive and electrically insulating filler into cellulose-based insulating material can enhance heat conduction performance. This work provided a method to prepare thermally conductive and electrically insulating BN/cellulosic fibre composites. And the thermal conductivity of the composites was remarkably increased via grafting APTES and adding dual-sized fillers. The thermal conductivity of the composite reached 0.682 W/(m•k) that increased by 387% with h-BN loading of 41.08 wt%. Simultaneously, BN fillers improved the insulating properties of the resultant composites. The dielectric constant, breaking strength of and volume resistivity of the composites reached 4.75, 9.2 kV/mm-1 and 4.72×1014 Ω•m, respectively. The resultant insulating material which has better heat conduction property may have a vast potential for future development in electrical equipment."

Methods Cohort of 809 students aged 10–16 years old from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, enrolled in 2010, and followed for three years. Breakfast skippers were those not eating breakfast. Those with breakfast frequency of 4 or less times per week were considered irregular breakfast eaters. Changes over time of breakfast frequency and breakfast foods/food groups were analyzed by generalized estimating equations. Results At baseline, overweight/obese girls had higher prevalence of irregular breakfast than those non-overweight/obese (40% vs. 26%; p = 0.005); among boys, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of irregular breakfast according to weight status. After three years, among girls there was an increase in the risk of irregular breakfast consumption (RR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.08; 1.54) and breakfast skipping (RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.12; 2.38). Also, overweight/obese boys (RR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.89) and non-overweight/obese girls (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.04) had higher risk of irregular breakfast in three years, compared to baseline. After three years, boys changed the consumption of foods/food groups at breakfast and presented higher risk of decreased intake of fruits (RR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.13), sandwiches and snacks (RR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.22), chips (RR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.13), and ham (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.07), and lower risk of cheese intake (RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.00). Girls had higher risk of decreased intake of fruits (RR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.47, 2.95), milk (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.08), chocolate powder (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.14) and ham (RR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.36). Conclusions Changes in breakfast patterns are different according to sex. Also, different changes in breakfast frequency according to BMI category were found. Consumption patterns of some foods/food groups have a tendency to become changed from initial to middle adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2883261901,"Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are known for their efficient bactericidal activity and are widely used in industry. This study aims to produce printable antibacterial devices by drop-on-demand (DoD) inkjet technology, using Ag-NPs as the active part in complex printable fluids. The synthesis of this active part is described using two methods to obtain monodisperse NPs: chemical and microwave irradiation. The synthesized NPs were characterized by UV-VIS, STEM, TEM, DLS and XRD. Two printable fluids were produced based: one with Ag-NPs and a second one, a polymeric nanocomposite, using silver nanoparticles and polyvinyl butyral (Ag-NPs/PVB). Cellulose acetate was used as a flexible substrate. The ecotoxicity analysis of fluids and substrate was performed with Artemia franciscana nauplii. Optimized electric pulse waveforms for drop formation of the functional fluids were obtained for the piezoelectric-based DoD printing. Activity of printed antibacterial devices was evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer method with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The results show that the printed device with Ag-NP fluids evidenced a bacterial inhibition. An important advantage in using the DoD process is the possibility of printing, layer by layer or side by side, more than one active principle, allowing an interleaved or simultaneous release of silver NP and other molecules of interest as for example with a second functional fluid to ensure effectiveness of Ag activity."
https://openalex.org/W2883517429,"Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is an essential mitochondria-localized exoribonuclease implicated in multiple biological processes and human disorders. To reveal role(s) for PNPase in mitochondria, we established PNPase knockout (PKO) systems by first shifting culture conditions to enable cell growth with defective respiration. Interestingly, PKO established in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in the loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The transcriptional profile of PKO cells was similar to rho0 mtDNA deleted cells, with perturbations in cholesterol (FDR = 6.35 x 10−13), lipid (FDR = 3.21 x 10−11), and secondary alcohol (FDR = 1.04x10-12) metabolic pathway gene expression compared to wild type parental (TM6) MEFs. Transcriptome analysis indicates processes related to axonogenesis (FDR = 4.49 x 10−3), axon development (FDR = 4.74 x 10−3), and axonal guidance (FDR = 4.74 x 10−3) were overrepresented in PKO cells, consistent with previous studies detailing causative PNPase mutations in delayed myelination, hearing loss, encephalomyopathy, and chorioretinal defects in humans. Overrepresentation analysis revealed alterations in metabolic pathways in both PKO and rho0 cells. Therefore, we assessed the correlation of genes implicated in cell cycle progression and total metabolism and observed a strong positive correlation between PKO cells and rho0 MEFs compared to TM6 MEFs. We quantified the normalized biomass accumulation rate of PKO clones at 1.7% (SD ± 2.0%) and 2.4% (SD ± 1.6%) per hour, which was lower than TM6 cells at 3.3% (SD ± 3.5%) per hour. Furthermore, PKO in mouse inner ear hair cells caused progressive hearing loss that parallels human familial hearing loss previously linked to mutations in PNPase. Combined, our study reports that knockout of a mitochondrial nuclease results in mtDNA loss and suggests that mtDNA maintenance could provide a unifying connection for the large number of biological activities reported for PNPase."
https://openalex.org/W2883921925,"The objective of the current study was to characterize the relationship between diet quality and body composition in participants living with IBD, specifically Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), in Atlantic Canada. Participants from the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrow’s Health (PATH) study are residents of one of the four Atlantic Canada provinces. Participants who completed the dietary questionnaire and had body composition measured were included in the study (n = 12,462 without IBD, n = 111 CD, n = 119 UC). A greater number of participants with IBD reported having multiple chronic conditions compared to those without IBD. Those with UC had statistically higher body weight and body mass index (BMI) compared to those without IBD. Overall, significant positive correlations were observed between adiposity and servings of refined grains, and meats and alternatives such as eggs and fish, whereas negative correlations were observed with servings of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and alternatives such as tofu, and nuts/seeds. Participants with IBD (both CD and UC) consumed more refined grains than those without IBD. Using logistic regression analysis, participants consuming more servings of vegetables and whole grains were less likely to have CD where as those consuming more serving of fruit and bean/legumes were less likely to have UC. In the Atlantic PATH cohort, which includes a region of the world with a high incidence of IBD, distinct differences in adiposity and diet quality were observed in individuals with specific types of IBD compared to those without. There is a need for collaborative efforts to address weight management and diet quality issues in those living with IBD in the Atlantic Canadian region."
https://openalex.org/W2884239627,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) represents the ninth leading cause of death worldwide. In 2016 are estimated 1.3 million TB deaths among HIV negative people and an additional 374,000 deaths among HIV positive people. In 2016 are estimated 1.4 million new cases of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV), 74% of whom were living in Africa. In light of these data, the reduction of mortality caused by TB in PLHIV is strongly required specially in low-income countries as Mozambique. According to international guidelines, the initial TB screening in HIV+ patients should be done with the four symptoms screening (4SS: fever, current cough, night sweats and weight loss). The diagnostic test more used in resource-limited countries is smear microscopy (SMEAR). World Health Organization (WHO) recommended Lateral Flow urine LipoArabinoMannan assay (LF-LAM) in immunocompromised patients; in 2010 WHO endorsed the use of Xpert Mycobacterium Tuberculosis/Rifampicin (MTB/RIF) test for rapid TB diagnosis but the assay is not used as screening test in all HIV+ patients irrespectively of symptoms due to cost and logistical barriers. The paper aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three screening protocols: standard (4SS and SMEAR in positive patients to 4SS); MTB/RIF; LF-LAM / MTB/RIF. Methods We developed a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the MTB/RIF protocol versus the common standard and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocol. The model considered a sample of 1,000 HIV+ antiretroviral treatment naïve patients in Mozambique. We evaluated disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for each protocol, cost per DALY, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), over 1-year, assuming a national healthcare system perspective. The model considered the delayed diagnosis as the time elapsed between a false negative test and the diagnosis and treatment of TB. Additional health system organization delay is defined as the time interval between positive test and treatment initiation caused by a delay in the delivery of results due organization of services. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on more relevant variables. Results The MTB/RIF protocol was cost-effective as compared to the standard protocol with an ICER of $56.54 per DALY saved. In a cohort of 1,000 patients MTB/RIF and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocol generated 1,281 and 1,254 DALY’s saved respectively, with a difference of 174 and 147 DALY respect to the standard protocol. The total cost of MTB/RIF protocol was lower ($92,263) than the standard ($147,226) and the LF-LAM / MTB/RIF ($113,196). Therefore, the cost per DALY saved including new infections due to delayed diagnosis with the standard protocol was $79.06, about 5 fold higher than MTB/RIF and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocols. The cost of additional TB infections due to delays in diagnosis plus health system delay seemed the more relevant costs. The low sensibility and sensitivity of the standard protocol led to a high number of false negatives, thus delayed TB diagnoses and treatment lead to the development of newly transmitted TB infections. Conclusions Our study shows that the MTB/RIF adoption could lead to an increasing of TB case-finding and a reduction in costs compared with standard and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocols."

In the present study the ana gene clusters (anaA-anaG; c. 21.1 kilobases) of two anatoxin producing Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi strains from Germany: (NIVA-CYA 711) and New Zealand (CAWBG02) were sequenced and compared with the ana gene clusters of two C. issatschenkoi strains from Japan (RM-6 and LBRI48) and one from China (CHABD3). All five ana gene clusters are characterized by the same gene order for anaA-anaG. Similarities were highest (99.56–99.57%) between German (NIVA-CYA 711), New Zealand (CAWBG02) and Chinese (CHABD3) strains. Similarities were lower (91.40–91.67%) when compared to the Japanese strains (RM-6 and LBRI48). Collectively, 2,037 variable sites (328 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 9 insertions/deletions, comprising 1,709 nucleotides) were found in the ana gene clusters of the German, New Zealand and Japanese strains compared to the Chinese strain (CHABD3). The ana gene clusters of the German (NIVA-CYA 711), New Zealand (CAWBG02) and Japanese (RM-6 and LBRI48) strains were characterized by 83, 84, 255 and 231 SNP’s compared to the Chinese strain (CHABD3), respectively. The anaE and anaF genes showed the highest variability in all five strains and are recommended as the best genetic markers for further phylogenetic studies of the ana gene cluster from C. issatschenkoi."

One of the most challenging outcomes following trauma exposure is posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite high exposure to traumatic events, the presence and contributors to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms have not been examined in women living with HIV in Canada.The current study examines the presence of, contributors to, and geographical regions associated with self-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among 1405 women enrolled in the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual & Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS).Separate linear regression models were run for the three provinces in the cohort: British Columbia, Ontario and Québec. Scores consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder were reported by 55.9%, 39.1% and 54.1% of the participants in each province, respectively (F(2, 1402) = 13.53, p < .001).The results demonstrate that women living with HIV have high rates of PTSS, and that rates and variables associated with these symptoms vary by province. These results suggest the need for trauma-informed practices and care for women living with HIV in Canada, which may need to be tailored for the community and identities of the women."
https://openalex.org/W2883191061,"Nogo-A is a key inhibitory molecule of axon regeneration in oligodendrocytes. However, little is known about its role in adult neurons. In this study, we showed an important function of Nogo-A on regulation of inflammatory pain in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In adult rats with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) hind paw inflammation, DRG neurons showed a significant increase in Nogo-A expression. Disruption of Nogo-A signaling with Nogo-66 receptor antagonist peptide, Nogo-A blocking antibody, Nogo-A short hairpin RNA, or Nogo-A gene knockout attenuated CFA-induced inflammatory heat hyperalgesia. Moreover, disruption of Nogo-A signaling suppressed the function and expression in DRG neurons of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member (TRPV)-1 channel, which is known to be the endogenous transducer of noxious heat during inflammation. These effects were accompanied with a reduction in LIM domain kinase (LIMK)/cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization. Similar disruption of actin filament architecture by direct action of Latrunculin A reduced the TRPV-1 activity and up-regulation of TRPV-1 protein caused by CFA. We conclude that Nogo-A plays an essential role in the development of inflammatory heat hyperalgesia, partly through maintaining TRPV-1 function via activation of the LIMK/cofilin pathway, which regulates actin filament dynamics. These findings support a therapeutic potential of modulating Nogo-A signaling in pain management.—Hu, F., Liu, H.-C., Su, D.-Q., Chen, H.-J., Chan, S.-O., Wang, Y., Wang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2884147500,"Asthma in the obese is often severe, difficult to treat, and characterized by less eosinophilic inflammation than asthma in the nonobese. Obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation may be a causal factor. We previously reported that a nutrient- and fiber-dense bar [Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI)-bar], which was designed to fill gaps in poor diets, improved metabolism in healthy overweight/obese (OW/OB) adults. In this pilot trial, OW/OB adolescents with poorly controlled asthma were randomized to weekly nutrition/exercise classes with or without twice-daily CHORI-bar consumption. Intent-to-treat analysis did not indicate CHORI-bar-specific effects. However, restricting the analysis to participants with acceptable compliance and a relatively low fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO; <50/ppb, a surrogate for noneosinophilic asthma; study participants: CHORI-bar, n = 16; controls, n = 15) indicated that CHORI-bar-specific, significant improvements in lung function (forced vital capacity, percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and percent-predicted forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of forced vital capacity), primarily in participants with low chronic inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein <1.5 mg/L). (We previously observed that chronic inflammation blunted CHORI-bar-induced metabolic improvements in healthy OW/OB adults.) Lung function improvement occurred without weight loss and was independent of improvements in metabolic and anthropometric end points and questionnaire-based measures of asthma control and quality of life. This study suggests that a nutritional intervention can improve lung function in OW/OB adolescents with asthma and relatively low FENO without requiring major changes in dietary habits, lifestyle, or weight loss and that this effect is blunted by chronic inflammation.—Bseikri, M., McCann, J.

https://openalex.org/W2884117775,"In this article, we test whether an isolated information campaign can deter criminals by appealing to their apprehension risk perception. A randomized trial was conducted around 154 high crime housing blocks in Bogotá. With support of the Colombian Police, half of the blocks were exposed to a three month poster campaign reporting the number of ""arrests around this street block"" and half to a no-treatment control condition. The main outcome measure (total registered crime) and secondary outcome measures (calls to the emergency line for thefts and attacks, and minor wrongdoings) were provided by the Police. Additionally, trust in police, security perception, and police performance perception were measured among residents and workers in the treatment and control areas (N = 616) using a post-treatment survey. Measures were analyzed with linear regression analysis and two-sample t-tests. Over the course of the treatment period, premeditated crime was reduced, while spontaneous crime remained unchanged. Overall levels of crime were not significantly altered. Also, a moderate crime reduction is detectable during the first month of the treatment period. The posters were highly visible (93% of respondents in the treated areas recalled them) and positively received (67% ""liked"" them). Perceptions of security and police among locals improved, though not significantly. Inherent among residents of Bogotá is a pervasive feeling of impunity and low trust in authorities, making the city a hard test case for an offender-targeted advertising campaign. Initial reductions of crime and overall reductions of premeditated crime are thus noteworthy. These results align with key principles of apprehension risk updating theory."
https://openalex.org/W2884189774,"The regulation of one's step length by placing one's foot at a specific position within gait, otherwise known as 'locomotor pointing', is well understood in walking and running gait. The current study was the first to broaden this understanding to a larger cohort and to describe the influence of age on the regulation of locomotor pointing when walking up to and stepping onto a curb-like platform.Younger (n = 17, mean age: 25.35 years, range: 19-33) and older adults (n = 105, mean age: 71.49 years, range: 61-86) participated in a walking experiment, requiring them to approach and step onto a curb-like platform. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to study the main outcome variables: onset of regulation, the regulation strategy and the strength of perceptual-motor coupling.Results showed that with older age, participants showed less variability in foot placement during their approach and seemed to prefer to shorten their steps. Furthermore, the strength of the perceptual-motor relationship was found to be related to age; regulation of step length of both younger and older participants was based on a participant's current foot position. The strength of this relationship increased as participants got closer to the curb and was stronger with increasing age. Furthermore, younger adults on average lengthened their steps as they got closer to the curb, whereas older adults showed significantly less lengthening compared to their younger counterparts. No age-related differences were found in terms of onset of regulation.The results suggest that the strength of the perceptual-motor relationship in gait is related to age. It is argued that this age-related increase in the strength of perceptual-motor coupling is required to cope with increasing demands linked to the age-related declines of action capabilities. The implications of the findings are discussed in the context of increased falls risks and deficits in perceptual-motor functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2884834438,"The emergence of multidrug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with in vitro resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, has necessitated evaluation and validation of appropriate surrogate endpoints for treatment response in drug trials for MDR-TB. The trial that has demonstrated efficacy of bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline that inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase, possesses the requisite features to conduct this evaluation. Approval of bedaquiline for use in MDR-TB was based primarily on the results of the controlled C208 Stage II study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00449644) including 160 patients randomized 1:1 to receive bedaquiline or placebo for 24 weeks when added to an 18–24-month preferred five-drug background regimen. Since randomization in C208 Stage II was preserved until study end, the trial results allow for the investigation of the complex relationship between sustained durable outcome with either Week 8 or Week 24 culture conversion as putative surrogate endpoints. The relationship between Week 120 outcome with Week 8 or Week 24 culture conversion was investigated using a descriptive analysis and with a recently developed statistical methodology for surrogate endpoint evaluation using methods of causal inference. The results demonstrate that sputum culture conversion at 24 weeks is more reliable than sputum culture conversion at 8 weeks when assessing the outcome of adding one new drug to a MDR-TB regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2883798347,"Coordinated changes in signaling pathways and gene expression in hearts subjected to prolonged stress maintain cardiac function. Loss of steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) results in a reversal to the fetal gene program and disrupts the response to pressure overload, accompanied by prominent effects on metabolism and growth signaling, including increased AMPK activation. We proposed that early metabolic stress driven by AMPK activation induces contractile dysfunction in mice lacking SRC-2. We used 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) to activate AMPK transiently before transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in wild-type and cardiomyocyte-specific SRC-2 knockout (CKO) animals. In contrast to AMPK activities during stress, in unstressed hearts, AICAR induced a mild activation of Akt signaling, and, in SRC-2-CKO mice, partially relieved an NAD+ deficiency and increased antioxidant signaling. These molecular changes translated to a mild hypertrophic response to TAC with decreased maladaptive remodeling, including markedly decreased fibrosis. Additionally, preactivation of AMPK in SRC-2-CKO mice was accompanied by a dramatic improvement in cardiac function compared with saline-treated SRC-2-CKO mice. Our results show that altered molecular signaling before stress onset has extended effects on sustained cardiac stress responses, and prestress modulation of transient growth and metabolism pathways may control those effects.-Nam, D.

https://openalex.org/W2883257939,"Using a genetic risk score (GRS) to predict a phenotype in a target sample can be complicated by missing data on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that comprise the GRS. This is usually addressed by imputation, omission of the SNPs or by replacing the missing SNPs with proxy SNPs. To assess the impact of the omission and proxy approaches on effect size estimation and predictive ability of weighted and unweighted GRS with small numbers of SNPs, we simulated a dichotomous phenotype conditional on real genotype data. We considered scenarios in which the proportion of missing SNPs ranged from 20–70%. We assessed the impact of omitting or replacing missing SNPs on the association between the GRS and phenotype, the corresponding statistical power and the area under the receiver operating curve. Omission resulted in a larger bias towards the null value of the effect size, a smaller predictive ability and greater loss of statistical power than proxy approaches. The predictive ability of a weighted GRS that includes SNPs with large weights depends of the availability of these large-weight SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2883999516,"This paper describes the investigations performed to better understand unsteady effect that develop in a contra-rotating axial fan. More specifically, this study focuses on rotor-rotor interactions effects on unsteady characteristic and blade aerodynamic force. The investigation method is based on three-dimensional URANS simulations, in conjunction with SST turbulence model. At first, the experimental measurements are compared to evaluate ability of the numerical method in estimation of unsteady flows. The results show that rotor-rotor interaction in the contra-rotating fan played an important role in aerodynamic efficiency. Unsteady effect increased flow losses of rotor 1, but effectively inhibited flow losses of rotor 2. The inhibition effect was mainly caused by wake recovery effect of upstream wakes in the flow passage of rotor 2. Meanwhile, negative jet flow enhanced boundary layer energy of the blade of rotor 2, so that flow separation was postponed. Different configurations consider five sets of axial spacing dimensions. Specific survey of flows under the same operation conditions indicates that axial spacing is responsible for the unsteady interaction effect. The blade aerodynamics analysis shows that the influence of the downstream potential flow disturbance on rotor 1 is greater than the effect of the upstream wake on rotor 2."
https://openalex.org/W2884472251,The objective of the present study was to conduct an intervention study which aimed to improve emotion recognition for Chinese children with ASD by using animated vehicles with real emotional faces. A total of 21 children participated in the current study; participants consisted of 14 children (2 girls) with a formal diagnosis of ASD and 7 typically developing children. Participants were measured on emotional vocabulary and situation-facial expression matching before and after the intervention. Results indicated that the intervention significantly improved ASD children’s emotion recognition compared to their pre-intervention scores. Our findings suggest that this emotional recognition intervention using animated vehicles (i.e. The Transporters) is an effective early intervention for Chinese children with ASD.
https://openalex.org/W2951343789,"Finding a sought visual target object requires combining visual information about a scene with a remembered representation of the target to create a ""target match"" signal that indicates when a target is in view. Target match signals have been reported to exist within high-level visual brain areas including inferotemporal cortex (IT), where they are mixed with representations of image and object identity. However, these signals are not well understood, particularly in the context of the real-world challenge that the objects we search for typically appear at different positions, sizes, and within different background contexts. To investigate these signals, we recorded neural responses in IT as two rhesus monkeys performed a delayed-match-to-sample object search task in which target objects could appear at a variety of identity-preserving transformations. Consistent with the existence of behaviorally-relevant target match signals in IT, we found that IT contained a linearly separable target match representation that reflected behavioral confusions on trials in which the monkeys made errors. Additionally, target match signals were highly distributed across the IT population, and while a small fraction of units reflected target match signals as target match suppression, most units reflected target match signals as target match enhancement. Finally, we found that the potentially detrimental impact of target match signals on visual representations was mitigated by target match modulation that was approximately (albeit imperfectly) multiplicative. Together, these results support the existence of a robust, behaviorally-relevant target match representation in IT that is configured to minimally interfere with IT visual representations."
https://openalex.org/W2884586131,"Solidified self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) offer strong option to enhance both drug aqueous solubility and stability. The current study was designed to evaluate the potential stabilization benefits of solidifying cinnarizine (CN) liquid SNEDDS into single and multi-layer self-nanoemulsifying pellets (SL-SNEP and ML-SNEP, respectively). The selected formulations were enrolled into accelerated, intermediate and long-term stability studies. The chemical stability was assessed based on the % of intact CN remaining in formulation. The physical stability was assessed by monitoring the in-vitro dissolution and physical appearance of the formulations. The degradation pathway of CN within lipid-based formulation was proposed to involve a hydroxylation reaction of CN molecule. The chemical stability study revealed significant CN degradation in liquid SNEDDS, SL-SNEP and ML-SNEP (lacking moisture-sealing) within all the storage conditions. In contrast, the moisture sealed ML-SNEP showed significant enhancement of CN chemical stability within the formulation. In particular, ML-SNEP coated with Kollicoat Smartseal 30D showed superior CN stabilization and no significant decrease in dissolution efficiency, at all the storage conditions. The observed stability enhancement is owing to the complete isolation between CN and SNEDDS layer as well as the effective moisture protection provided by Kollicoat Smartseal 30D. Hence, the degradation problem could be eradicated completely. The incorporation of silicon dioxide had an important role in the inhibition of pellet agglomeration upon storage. Accordingly, ML-SNEP coated with Kollicoat Smartseal 30D and/or silicon dioxide could be an excellent dosage form that combine dual enhancement of CN solubilization and stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2883240565,"Congenital Cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV) is the leading infection in determining permanent long-term impairments (LTI), and its pathogenesis is largely unknown due to the complex interplay between viral, maternal, placental, and child factors. The cellular activity, considered to be the result of the response to exogenous and endogenous factors, is captured by the determination of gene expression profiles. In this study, we determined whole blood transcriptomes in relation to cCMV, CMV viral load and LTI development at 6 years of age by using RNA isolated from neonatal dried blood spots (DBS) stored at room temperature for 8 years. As DBS were assumed to mainly reflect the neonatal immune system, particular attention was given to the immune pathways using the global test. Additionally, differential expression of individual genes was performed using the voom/limma function packages. We demonstrated feasibility of RNA sequencing from archived neonatal DBS of children with cCMV, and non-infected controls, in relation to LTI and CMV viral load. Despite the lack of statistical power to detect individual genes differences, pathway analysis suggested the involvement of innate immune response with higher CMV viral loads, and of anti-inflammatory markers in infected children that did not develop LTI. Finally, the T cell exhaustion observed in infected neonates, in particular with higher viral load, did not correlate with LTI, therefore other mechanisms are likely to be involved in the long-term immune dysfunction. Despite these data demonstrate limitation in determining prognostic markers for LTI by means of transcriptome analysis, this exploratory study represents a first step in unraveling the pathogenesis of cCMV, and the aforementioned pathways certainly merit further evaluation."

While numerous GRCVs have been isolated from mosquitoes, animals, and humans, genetic analysis of these viruses is limited. In this study, we characterized 65 GRCV isolates from febrile patients identified through clinic-based surveillance in the northern and southern Peruvian Amazon. A 500 base pair region of the S segment and 750 base pair regions of the M and L segments were sequenced. Pairwise sequence analysis of the clinical isolates showed nucleotide identities ranging from 68% to 100% and deduced amino acid sequence identities ranging from 72% to 100%. Sequences were compared with reference strains of the following GRCVs: Caraparu virus (CARV), Murutucu virus (MURV), Oriboca virus (ORIV), Marituba virus (MTBV), Itaqui virus (ITQV), Apeu virus (APEUV), and Madrid virus (MADV). Sequence comparison of clinical isolates with the prototype strains based on the S and L segments identified two clades; clade I included isolates with high genetic association with CARV-MADV, and clade II included isolates with high genetic association with MURV, ORIV, APEUV, and MTBV. Genetic relationships based on the M segment were at time inconsistent with those based on the S and L segments. However, clade groupings based on the M segment were highly consistent with relationships based on microneutralization assays. These results advance our understanding of the genetic and serologic relationships of GRCVs circulating in the Peruvian Amazon."

CK7 and PAX8 staining and 3D cluster patterns were used to differentiate primary origins. Samples from patients with stomach cancer were no 3D cluster /CK7+/PAX8- with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8699 in ROC curve analysis. Samples from ovarian cancer patients were large 3D cluster/CK7+/PAX8+ with AUC of 0.9812. Samples from pancreatobiliary tract cancer patients were small 3D cluster/CK7+/PAX8- with AUC of 0.8772. The remaining cancer samples, including breast, lung and colon cancer samples, had similar patterns of large 3D clusters/CK7+/PAX8- with AUC of 0.882, especially for lung cancer. SurePathTM technology, using 3D cluster patterns and dual ICC for CK7 and PAX8 in peritoneal fluid samples, can provide important information for determining specific primary origins in cases of unknown primary carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2884063932,"Following positive selection, thymocytes migrate into the medulla where they encounter diverse self-antigens that induce central tolerance. Thymocytes expressing T cell receptors (TCRs) with high affinity for self-antigens displayed by medullary antigen presenting cells (APCs) undergo either negative selection or diversion to the regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage, thus ensuring maturation of non-autoreactive T cells. Because many self-antigens are expressed by only a small percentage of medullary thymic epithelial cells, thymocytes must enter the medulla and efficiently scan APCs therein to encounter the full array of self-antigens that induce central tolerance. Chemokine receptors play a critical role in promoting medullary entry and rapid motility of post-positive selection thymocytes. We found that the chemokine receptor CCR8 is expressed by post-positive selection CD4+ single positive (SP) thymocytes in mice, while the corresponding chemokine ligands are expressed by medullary APCs, and thus hypothesized that CCR8 would promote thymocyte medullary entry and/or rapid motility to induce negative selection. However, despite a subtle decline in thymocyte medullary accumulation and the presence of autoantibodies in aged CCR8-deficient mice, CCR8 was not required for thymocyte differentiation, rapid motility, or negative selection."

The aim of this analysis was to describe the relationship of maternal serum uric acid (SUA) and cystatin C with maternal and neonatal cardiometabolic risk markers and with birth weight and risk of small-for-gestational age (SGA) as well as large-for gestational age (LGA).In the Ulm SPATZ Health Study, 934 singleton newborns and their mothers were recruited during their hospital stay in the University Medical Center Ulm between 04/2012 and 05/2013 (overall response 49%). The association between SUA and cystatin C (both in quartiles and as continuous measures) with risk for SGA as well as with LGA was quantified by means of multivariable logistic regression.Overall, n = 885 mother-newborn pairs were included in the final analysis. Most of the mothers were of German nationality (85%) and were between 26 and 35 years of age at delivery (69%). Maternal SUA was associated with maternal age, body mass index, alcohol consumption and history of hypertension as well as with many other maternal and neonate cardiovascular risk markers. Cystatin C was associated with parity. No clear association of SUA with SGA and LGA was observed in fully adjusted models. However, cystatin C was negatively associated with SGA with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.16-0.77; p for trend 0.04) comparing the top quartile vs. the bottom quartile and was positively associated with LGA with an OR of 5.92 (95% CI: 2.27-15.44; p for trend <0.0001) after adjustment for covariates.We found a positive association of cystatin C with birth weight and a clearly increased risk for LGA with maternal increased cystatin C values in a population with fairly normal renal function."
https://openalex.org/W2883843195,"Iterative prototyping is costly and time-consuming. Particularly when designing medical instruments, human factors related design choices significantly impact performance and safety. A tool is presented that allows for the evaluation of steerable instrument controls before the onset of the prototyping stage. The design tool couples gestural input to virtually simulated instrument motions using hand motion tracking. We performed a human-subject evaluation of two manual control strategies that differed in their degrees of freedom (DOF). 2DOF thumb control was compared to 4DOF thumb-index finger control. Results identified regions within the instrument workspace that are difficult to reach and showed participants to favor using the thumb for gross and fine-tuning motions at both control strategies. Index finger ab/adduction was found to be least functional. A strong learning effect was observed at 4DOF control. Based on the results, gesture-based instrument design is a viable design tool."
https://openalex.org/W2884601174,"We examine two possible approaches to reducing residential mortgage default using a dynamic model of heterogeneous infinitely-lived agents acting optimally subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic earnings shocks and systemic house price shocks. We find higher down payments are very effective in minimizing residential mortgage foreclosures, even in periods of house price declines and recessions. In contrast, the length of the credit exclusionary period for people who experience bankruptcy or foreclosure has a much smaller impact on mortgage defaults. Thus, it is much more effective to prevent mortgage default before the mortgage closes than to pressure homeowners not to default once they are in financial trouble. This also suggests a major aspect of credit scores and credit policy is non-productive and punitive, harming people in return for little societal gain."
https://openalex.org/W2884753514,"We previously reported elevated oxidative stress-related mechanical vulnerabilities of the skin as sparse distributions of hyperechoic areas. Although this helped establish a personalized skin care system to prevent skin disorders related to mechanical stress, obesity-related skin vulnerability involves individual differences. Here, we hypothesized that individual differences are caused by polymorphisms of GT repetitive sequences in the heme oxygenase1 (HMOX1) promoter region, which encodes an antioxidant enzyme. This cross-sectional study enrolled healthy male volunteers in a walking classroom aimed at weight control. Subjects with a body mass index <25 kg/m2 were classified as non-obese and those with body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 were classified as obese. Subject skin was categorized into sparse dermis or normal groups according to the distribution of hyperechoic areas by high-resolution skin ultrasonography (20 MHz). Genomic DNA and mRNA extracted from three body hairs with attached follicle cells were used to analyze GT repetitive sequences of the HMOX1 promoter, HMOX1 mRNA expression levels, and oxidative stress levels (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine). Classifications of GT repetitive sequence of HMOX1 promoter were Short (<27 times) and Long (≥27 times). Higher numbers of subjects with sparse dermis were in the obese group compared with the non-obese group. In obese subjects, the number of subjects that had the Long allele of the HMOX1 promoter with sparse dermis was significantly higher compared with the normal group, whereas no association was observed between the polymorphism and ultrasonographic features in non-obese subjects. Thus, HMOX1 polymorphisms detected a risk of low collagen density in Japanese obese male subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2883561499,"The aim of this paper was to compare the cardiorespiratory effects of the two combinations (medetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam (MTZ) or dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam (DTZ)) used for Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) immobilization. A retrospective analysis was carried out, reviewing the anesthetic records of captive bears. Sixty-six records were reviewed. The bears were immobilized, and general anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane vaporized in 100% oxygen. The mean sedation time and score were evaluated. The cardiorespiratory parameters were recorded every 10 minutes from intubation until extubation. Mean sedation time was 26.1 ± 14.5 minutes for the MTZ group and 25.6 ± 19.4 minutes for the DTZ group. The heart rate and the respiratory rate were higher in the bears immobilized with DTZ (66 ± 19 beats/min; 13 ± 5.2 breaths/min) as compared with the bears immobilized with MTZ (57 ± 14.5 beats/min; 10 ± 4.7 breaths/min) whereas the mean arterial pressure did not differ significantly between the groups. The body temperature was in the normal range throughout the procedures in all bears (MTZ 36.3 ± 0.9°C; DTZ 37 ± 1°C). In conclusion, the two protocols used in this study have been proven to be safe and reliable for the immobilization of Asiatic black bears, and the DTZ combination seemed to be associated with less cardiorespiratory depression than the MTZ one."
https://openalex.org/W2883664967,"Toll like receptors (TLRs) share a conserved structure comprising the N-terminal ectodomain, a transmembrane segment and a C-terminal cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Proper assembly of the TIR domain is crucial for signal transduction; however, the contribution of individual motifs within the TIR domain to TLR trafficking and signaling remains unclear. We targeted a highly conserved tyrosine (Y870) located in the box 1 region of the TIR domain of most TLRs, including TLR9, previously described to be a critical site of phosphorylation in TLR4. We reconstituted bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from Tlr9-/- mice WT TLR9 or Y870F or Y870A mutants. Despite normal interactions with the luminal chaperones GRP94 and UNC93B1, Y870F conferred only partial responsiveness to CpG, and Y870A had no activity and functioned as a dominant negative inhibitor when coexpressed with endogenous TLR9. This loss of function correlated with reduction or absence, respectively, of the 80 kDa mature form of TLR9. In Y870F-expressing cells, CpG-dependent signaling correlated directly with levels of the mature form, suggesting that signaling did not require tyrosine phosphorylation but rather that the Y870F mutation conferred reduced receptor levels due to defective processing or trafficking. Microscopy revealed targeting of the mutant protein to an autophagolysosome-like structure for likely degradation. Collectively we postulate that the conserved Y870 in the TIR domain does not participate in phosphorylation-induced signaling downstream of ligand recognition, but rather is crucial for proper TIR assembly and ER egress, resulting in maturation-specific stabilization of TLR9 within endolysosomes and subsequent pro-inflammatory signaling."
