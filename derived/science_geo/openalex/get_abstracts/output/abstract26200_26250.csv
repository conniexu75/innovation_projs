https://openalex.org/W1977356579,"Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous second messenger. Information is encoded in the magnitude, frequency, and spatial organization of changes in the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+. Regenerative spiral waves of release of free Ca2+ were observed by confocal microscopy in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. This pattern of Ca2+ activity is characteristic of an intracellular milieu that behaves as a regenerative excitable medium. The minimal critical radius for propagation of focal Ca2+ waves (10.4 micrometers) and the effective diffusion constant for the excitation signal (2.3 x 10(-6) square centimeters per second) were estimated from measurements of velocity and curvature of circular wavefronts expanding from foci. By modeling Ca2+ release with cellular automata, the absolute refractory period for Ca2+ stores (4.7 seconds) was determined. Other phenomena expected of an excitable medium, such as wave propagation of undiminished amplitude and annihilation of colliding wavefronts, were observed."

Whether such syndromes could be the result of the development of responsiveness by some cutaneous pain receptors (C-fiber nociceptors) to sympathetic efferent activity as a consequence of the nerve injury was tested in an animal model. After nerve damage but not in its absence, sympathetic stimulation and norepinephrine were excitatory for a subset of skin C-fiber nociceptors and enhanced the responsiveness of these nociceptors to tissue-damaging stimulation. These effects were demonstrable within days after nerve lesions, occurred at the cutaneous receptive terminal region, were manifest in sensory fibers that had not degenerated after the injury, and were mediated by α2-adrenergic-like receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2018875909,"Reduced expression of the nm23 gene in certain rodent model systems and human breast tumors has been correlated with high tumor metastatic potential. To investigate the functional effects of nm23 expression, we have transfected a constitutive murine nm23-1 expression construct into highly metastatic K-1735 TK murine melanoma cells. TK clones expressing the exogenous nm23-1 construct exhibited a reduced incidence of primary tumor formation, significant reductions in tumor metastatic potential independent of tumor cell growth, and altered responses to the cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 in soft agar colonization assays, compared with control-transfected TK clones. In contrast, nm23-1-transfected TK clones exhibited no significant differences in intrinsic tumor cell growth, i.e., primary tumor size in vivo, anchorage-dependent growth rate in vitro, and anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar in vitro. The data demonstrate a suppressive effect of nm23 on several aspects of the cancer process, including tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2039545730,"The magnitude of the hydrophobic effect, as measured from the surface area dependence of the solubilities of hydrocarbons in water, is generally thought to be about 25 calories per mole per square angstrom (cal mol-1 A-2). However, the surface tension at a hydrocarbon-water interface, which is a ""macroscopic"" measure of the hydrophobic effect, is approximately 72 cal mol-1 A-2. In an attempt to reconcile these values, alkane solubility data have been reevaluated to account for solute-solvent size differences, leading to a revised ""microscopic"" hydrophobic effect of 47 cal mol-1 A-2. This value, when used in a simple geometric model for the curvature dependence of the hydrophobic effect, predicts a macroscopic alkane-water surface tension that is close to the macroscopic value."
https://openalex.org/W2093267069,"The sensitivity to GABA of Purkinje cells in thin cerebellar slices was examined by recording either spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents or ionic currents elicited by local GABA applications. The effects of Ca2+ entry induced by depolarizing voltage pulses were opposite for the two types of currents. Currents due to exogenous GABA applications were increased by a train of voltage pulses. This potentiation was transient with an average half recovery period of 3.7 min. Spontaneous synaptic currents were reduced by depolarizing voltage pulses, with a half recovery time of about 20 s. The inhibition was largely explained by a decrease of the frequency of synaptic events, suggesting that the primary location of the effect was presynaptic. Thus, a Cal' rise increases the sensitivity of Purkinje cells to GABA and induces a retrograde inhibition of presynaptic terminals. The latter effect may be due to a diffusible Ca2+-dependent messenger."
https://openalex.org/W1985933922,"During development of the nervous system, neurons in many regions are overproduced by proliferation, after which the excess cells are eliminated by cell death. The survival of only a proportion of neurons during normal development is thought to be regulated by the limited availability of neurotrophic agents. One such putative trophic agent is ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a polypeptide that promotes the survival of ciliary, sensory, and sympathetic neurons in vitro. In contrast to the results of in vitro studies, however, the daily treatment of chick embryos in vivo with purified human recombinant CNTF failed to rescue any of these cell populations from cell death, whereas CNTF did promote the in vivo survival of spinal motoneurons. Thus, CNTF may not act as a neurotrophic agent in vivo for those embryonic neurons (especially ciliary neurons) on which it acts in vitro. Rather, CNTF may be required for in vivo survival of motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2083324135,"Expression of the structural proteins of HIV-1 requires the direct interaction of the viral Rev trans-activator with its cis-acting RNA target sequence, the Rev response element or RRE. Here, we demonstrate that this specific RNA-binding event is, as expected, mediated by the conserved arginine-rich motif of Rev. However, we also show that amino acid residues located proximal to this basic domain that are critical for in vivo Rev function are dispensable for sequence-specific binding to the RRE. Instead, these sequences are required for the multimerization of Rev on the viral RRE target sequence. The observation that Rev function requires the sequential binding of multiple Rev molecules to the RRE provides a biochemical explanation for the observed threshold effect for Rev function in vivo and suggests a molecular model for the high incidence of latent infection by HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2009196480,"Engagement of the clonotypic antigen receptor (TCR) on T lymphocytes provokes an activation response leading to cell proliferation and lymphokine secretion. To examine the molecular basis of T cell signaling, we generated transgenic animals in which a lymphocyte-specific nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase p59fyn(T) is 20-fold overexpressed in developing T lineage cells. Thymocytes from these mice, analyzed using both cellular and biochemical assays, were remarkably hyperstimulable. Moreover, the responsiveness of normal thymocytes to TCR-derived signals correlated well with the extent to which p59fyn was expressed in these cells. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of p59fyn substantially inhibited TCR-mediated activation in otherwise normal thymocytes. These effects are unique to p59fyn; overexpression of a closely related T cell-specific tyrosine kinase, p56lck, elicits dramatically different phenotypes. Our results suggest that p59fyn is a critically important component of the TCR signal transduction apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2148510288,"Sex-lethal is a binary switch gene that controls all aspects of Drosophila sexual dimorphism. It must be active in females and inactive in males. The on/off regulation reflects alternative RNA splicing in which full-length proteins are produced only in females. Here we investigate the role of Sxl in maintaining sexual pathway commitments. By ectopic expression of a female Sxl cDNA in transgenic male flies, we show that Sxl protein induces a rapid switch from male- to female-specific splicing. The ectopically expressed Sxl protein will trans-activate an endogenous wild-type Sxl gene. This establishes a feedback loop in which Sxl proteins induce their own synthesis by directing the female-specific splicing of Sxl transcripts. We conclude that the female determined state is maintained by Sxl through positive autoregulation, while the male determined state is maintained by default."
https://openalex.org/W1994551148,"Thrombin, a serine protease of the blood coagulation system, has additional effects on cells in vitro. It is mitogenic for fibroblasts and astrocytes and contributes to the regulation of neurite outgrowth and astrocyte stellation. Until now the expression of thrombin or its precursor prothrombin in tissues other than liver has not been demonstrated conclusively because of difficulty in avoiding serum contamination. Using sensitive mRNA detection methods, we show here that prothrombin is expressed not only in the liver, but also in the brain throughout development. Polymerase chain reaction, Northern, and in situ hybridization studies demonstrate the presence of prothrombin transcripts in the olfactory bulb, the cortex, the cerebellum, and other regions of the rat and human nervous system, as well as in neural cell lines. These results support an involvement of (pro)thrombin in the regulation of cellular events in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2093467598,"We have investigated transmitter release from small and large dense-core vesicles in nerve terminals isolated from guinea pig hippocampus. Small vesicles are found in clusters near the active zone, and large dense-core vesicles are located at ectopic sites. The abilities of Ca2+ channel activation and uniform elevation of Ca2+ concentration (with ionophores) to evoke secretion of representative amino acids, catecholamines, and neuropeptides were compared. For a given increase in Ca2+ concentration, ionophore was less effective than Ca2+ channel activation in releasing amino acids, but not in releasing cholecystokinin-8. Titration of the average Ca2+ concentration showed that the Ca2+ affinity for cholecystokinin-8 secretion was higher than that for amino acids. Catecholamine release showed intermediate behavior. It is concluded that neuropeptide release is triggered by small elevations in the Ca2+ concentration in the bulk cytoplasm, whereas secretion of amino acids requires higher elevations, as produced in the vicinity of Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1978160288,"Cloned integrin alpha 2 subunit complementary DNA was expressed on human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells to give a functional VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta 1) adhesion receptor. The VLA-2-positive RDA2 cells not only showed increased adhesion to collagen and laminin in vitro, but also formed substantially more metastatic tumor colonies in nude mice after either intravenous or subcutaneous injection. These results show that a specific adhesion receptor (VLA-2) can markedly enhance both experimental and spontaneous metastasis. In contrast to the metastasis results, there was no difference in either the in vitro growth rate or apparent in vivo tumorigenicity of RD and RDA2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015838204,"In productively rearranged murine VH-DH-JH genes (encoding immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions), the DH elements are preferentially used in one particular reading frame (RF1), although the recombination breakpoints at the DH-JH border vary. Despite this variability, the bias of RF usage is not due to cellular selection by antigen but is quantitatively established at the stage of DH-JH rearrangement: RF3 is counterselected on the basis of stop codons. RF2 allows the expression of a truncated mu chain (D mu protein) from most DH-JH joints. Using B cells in which the membrane exon of the mu chain is disrupted by homologous recombination on one of the two homologous chromosomes, we obtain evidence that membrane-bound D mu signals arrest of differentiation, presumably by preventing VH-DHJH joining. In addition to RF3 and RF2 counterselection, promotion of DH-JH joining in areas of sequence homology further enforces RF1 usage."
https://openalex.org/W1977304564,"Recognition of 5' splice sites in pre-mRNA splicing is achieved in part by base pairing with U1 snRNA. We have used interactive suppression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to look for other factors involved in 5' splice-site recognition. This approach identified an extragenic suppressor that activates a cryptic 5' splice site. The suppressor is a gene for U5 snRNA (snR7) with a single base mutation in a strictly conserved 9 base sequence. This suggests that U5 snRNA can play a part in determining the position of 5' splice-site cleavage. Consistent with this, we have been able to isolate other mutations in the 9 base element in U5 snRNA that specifically activate a second cryptic 5' splice site nearby."

https://openalex.org/W2101408825,"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8D3 and 3G3 are unique antibodies capable of precipitating both free 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) and HSP90-protein complexes. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled Hepa 1c1c7 cytosolic extracts were performed using mAb 8D3 or 3G3. The resulting immunoprecipitates can be dissociated from the mAb with a 500 mM NaCl wash. These washes were subjected to both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Five major protein spots were detected in addition to HSP90 with the following relative molecular weights: 68,000, 63,000, 56,000, 50,000, and 188,000. On Western blots mAb 3G3 was capable of specifically binding to HSP90. Each of these proteins was localized on two-dimensional gels. Using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunochemical localization on Western blots, the p68 spot was identified as HSP70, and the p56 spot was found to cross-react with polyclonal antibody JP-1 raised against a 59-kDa protein. This 59-kDa protein has been found previously to be associated with several steroid hormone receptors in rabbit uterine cytosol. Immunoprecipitation of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled Hepa 1c1c7 cytosol with mAb 8D3 or 3G3 revealed two major phosphorylated proteins with relative molecular weights of 90,000 and 50,000. The identities of p63 and p188 are currently unknown. This is the first report examining the major proteins that are complexed with HSP90 in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1994968810,"Derivatives of erythromycin with modifications at their C-6 position are generally sought for their increased stability at acid pH, which in turn may confer improved pharmacological properties. A recombinant mutant of the erythromycin-producing bacterium, Saccharopolyspora erythraea, produced an erythromycin derivative, 6-deoxyerythromycin A, that could not be obtained readily by chemical synthesis. This product resulted from targeted disruption of the gene, designated eryF (systematic nomenclature, CYP107), that apparently codes for the cytochrome P450, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (DEB) hydroxylase, which converts DEB to erythronolide B (EB). Enzymes normally acting on EB can process the alternative substrate DEB to form the biologically active erythromycin derivative lacking the C-6 hydroxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1969303353,"The mouse neuronal F3 glycoprotein and its chicken homolog F11 belong to a subclass of proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily with preferential localization on axons and neurites. We have transfected F3 cDNA into CHO cells. Biochemical analysis establishes that the cDNA we have cloned codes for a 130 kd phosphatidylinositol-anchored polypeptide. F3-expressing transfectants exhibited enhanced self-adhesive properties, aggregating with faster kinetics and forming larger aggregates than F3-negative control cells. When used as a culture substrate for sensory neurons, F3-transfected cells showed a markedly enhanced ability to promote neurite outgrowth compared with nontransfected cells. The results support the idea that F3/F11 and other closely similar proteins function as cell adhesion molecules that play a role in axonal growth and guidance."
https://openalex.org/W1671211416,"Expression of the mouse whey acidic protein (WAP) gene is specific to the mammary gland, is induced several thousand-fold during pregnancy, and is under the control of steroid and peptide hormones. To study developmental regulation of the mouse WAP gene, a 7.2-kilobase (kb) WAP transgene, including 2.6 kb of 5‘- and 1.6 kb of 3‘-flanking sequences, was introduced into mice. Of the 13 lines of mice examined, 6 expressed the transgenes during lactation at levels between 3 and 54% of the endogenous gene. Although expression was dependent on the site of integration, the transgenes within a given locus were expressed in a copy number-dependent manner and were coordinately regulated. The WAP transgenes were expressed specifically in the mammary gland, but showed a deregulated pattern of expression during mammary development. In all six lines of mice, induction of the WAP transgenes during pregnancy preceded that of the endogenous gene. During lactation, expression in two lines increased coordinately with the endogenous gene, and in three other lines of mice, transgene expression decreased to a basal level. These data indicate that the 7.2-kb gene contains some but not all of the elements necessary for correct developmental regulation. At a functional level it appears as if a repressor element, which inactivates the endogenous gene until late pregnancy, and an element necessary for induction during lactation are absent from the transgene. Complementary results from developmental and hormone induction studies suggest that WAP gene expression during pregnancy and lactation is mediated by different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2108887220,"Genetic analysis showed that the conserved C-terminal 180 amino acids of yeast TFIID contain all the essential functions for growth of yeast and response to acidic transcriptional activation signals. A genetic screen was used to identify functionally important residues within the C-terminal region. Five dominant TFIID mutations were isolated that had lost the ability to bind DNA. Four of these mutations were single amino acid substitutions in the most N-terminal of two 66–67 amino acid repeats in TFIID. Analogous mutations made in the most C-terminal repeat all failed to bind DNA and inhibited growth of cells, suggesting that the DNA-binding function of TFIID is partitioned between the two repeated regions. Overproduction of wild-type TFIID rescued the dominance of the TFIID mutants, suggesting that the mutant proteins are dominant because they compete with wild-type TFIID for binding to one or more essential transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1987491378,"Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a serious health problem and a severe obstacle to social and economic development, especially in Africa. A complementary DNA fragment coding for an Onchocerca volvulus antigen (OV-16) was cloned and expressed in the plasmid vector pCG808fx. Immune responses to this O. volvulus-specific recombinant antigen were detectable in patients with documented onchocerciasis; the antibody response was also detectable at 3 months and at more than 1 year before infection could otherwise be detected in humans and in chimpanzees experimentally infected with O. volvulus third-stage larvae."
https://openalex.org/W1497627059,"Animal cells utilize beta-D-xylosides as primers for glycosaminoglycan synthesis. However, most xylosides preferentially stimulate chondroitin sulfate synthesis and only weakly prime heparan sulfate synthesis. To test if the structure of the aglycone determines the type of glycosaminoglycan made, the priming activity of methyl, n-octyl, p-nitrophenyl, 4-methylumbelliferyl, trans,trans-farnesyl, cholesteryl, and estradiol beta-D-xylosides was compared. Their potency was tested in pgsA-745 cells, a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant unable to initiate glycosaminoglycan synthesis due to a defect in xylosyltransferase. All of the xylosides stimulated chondroitin sulfate synthesis in the mutant, but only estradiol beta-D-xyloside primed heparan sulfate synthesis efficiently. When incubated with 30 microM estradiol beta-D-xyloside, mutant cells made about 3-fold more glycosaminoglycan than untreated wild-type cells and as much as 50% was heparan sulfate. Estradiol beta-D-xyloside also induced heparan sulfate synthesis in cycloheximide-treated wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells, bovine aortic endothelial cells, baby hamster kidney cells, and Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. In addition to stimulating heparan sulfate synthesis, low concentrations of estradiol beta-D-xyloside inhibited the formation of endogenous heparan sulfate proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2032426710,"The dynamic process of electronic energy transfer is shown to be an important tool for probing the microstructure of molecular systems, particularly those in which donors and acceptors occupy specifically labeled sites of spatially confining host matrices. Special attention is given to analyzing the temporal behavior of the direct energy transfer reaction for systems in which the dipolar coupling is between a donor and randomly distributed acceptors. This dynamic process is dependent on two competing lengths when the donor and acceptor distribution is determined by the microstructure of the confining system: Rp, the dominant length characterizing the size of the confinement, and R0, which scales the strength of the dipolar coupling. When energy transfer processes are viewed in the context of these two competing lengths, a picture emerges of the microstructure of the confinement that is consistent with and corroborated by other structural probes."
https://openalex.org/W2073830208,"Calbindin-D28K is a constitutive Ca 2+-binding protein expressed in hippocampal neurons that are resistant to various forms of excitotoxic injury. However, the local factors controlling calbindin-D28K expression within the central nervous system are unknown. We report that neuronal excitation via the perforant path leads to an increased expression of calbindin-D28K mRNA within dentate granule cells. This response is related specifically to stimulation that induces prolonged periods of bursting afterdischarges and precedes cellular injury. The up regulation of calbindin-D28K mRNA occurs during the type of neuronal activation associated with elevated cytosolic Ca2+ and suggests that the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis includes a system of feedback control at the level of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1533112727,"The kininogens, high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and low molecular weight kininogen (LK), are multifunctional, single-gene products that contain bradykinin and identical amino-terminal heavy chains. Studies were performed to determine if LK would bind directly to platelets. 125I-LK specifically bound to gel-filtered platelets in the presence of 50 microM Zn2+. HK effectively competed with 125I-LK for the same binding site (Ki = 27 +/- 9 nM, n = 5). Similarly, the Ki for LK inhibition of 125I-LK binding was 12 +/- 1 nM (n = 3). Albumin, fibrinogen, factor XIII, and kallikrein did not inhibit 125I-LK binding to unstimulated platelets. 125I-LK (66 kDa) was not cleaved upon binding to platelets. The binding of 125I-LK to unstimulated platelets was found to be fully reversible by the addition of a 50 molar excess of unlabeled LK at both 10 and 20 min. LK binding to platelets was saturable with an apparent Kd of 27 +/- 2 nM (mean +/- S.E., n = 9) and 647 +/- 147 binding sites/platelet. Both LK and HK at plasma concentrations inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. LK and HK at about 5% of plasma concentration also inhibited thrombin-induced secretion of both stirred and unstirred platelets. Both kininogens were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors of proteolytically active thrombin binding to platelets. The kininogens did not inhibit D-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone-treated thrombin from binding to platelets. These studies indicated that both kininogens have a region on their heavy chain which allows them to bind to platelets. Further, kininogen binding by its heavy chain modulates thrombin activation of platelets since it prevents proteolytically active thrombin from binding to its receptor."

The characteristics of Ap4A binding were determined on brain membrane homogenates after development of an optimized in vitro filter-binding assay. Ap4A binding is specific for adenylated dinucleotides and for the length of the phosphate bridge. A Kd of 0.71 microM for Ap4A was determined."

Methylation analysis and 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis of the native type V polysaccharide and of its specifically degraded products permitted the determination of the repeating unit structure of the type V polysaccharide: [formula: see text] The type V polysaccharide has certain structural features in common with other group B streptococcal capsular polysaccharides but is antigenically distinct: no immunologic cross-reactivity was observed between type V and types Ia, Ib, II, III, or IV polysaccharides. Studies of antibody binding to the partially degraded forms of the type V polysaccharide indicated that the native epitope is complex, involving most if not all of the sugar residues of the repeating unit."
https://openalex.org/W1543899725,"Resident ovarian macrophages have been implicated in the regulation of ovarian function, presumably through local paracrine secretion of regulatory molecules (i.e. cytokines). One such macrophage product, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, has been shown to attenuate the gonadotropin-dependent differentiation of the somatic ovarian (estrogen-producing) granulosa cell. This study examines the possibility that TNF alpha may also regulate the adjacent androgen-producing theca interstitial cell. The basal accumulation of androsterone (the major androgenic steroid), synthesized by whole ovarian dispersates from immature rats, remained unchanged following treatment with TNF alpha (30 ng/ml) alone. In contrast, concurrent treatment with increasing concentrations of TNF alpha (0.03-30 ng/ml), yielded dose-dependent inhibition of the human chorionic gonadotropin (1 ng/ml)-stimulated accumulation of androsterone. This reversible and immunoneutralizable effect of TNF alpha was characterized by a minimal effective dose of 0.1 ng/ml, a median inhibitory dose of 0.9 ng/ml, a maximal inhibitory effect of 90%, and a minimal time requirement of less than or equal to 48 h. Comparable results were obtained when using highly purified theca interstitial cells, thereby indicating that TNF alpha is capable of exerting a direct inhibitory effect at the level of the ovarian androgen-producing cell. TNF alpha action was not accounted for by alterations in the plated viable cell mass. Instead, treatment with TNF alpha resulted in significant inhibition of the human chorionic gonadotropin-supported accumulation of cAMP, the putative second messenger of gonadotropin hormonal action. TNF alpha action at sites distal to cAMP generation was associated with profound inhibition of the conversion of the [3H]pregnanolone (3 alpha-hydroxy,5 alpha-pregnane-20-one) and [3H]17 alpha-hydroxypregnanolone (3 alpha, 17 alpha-dihydroxy,5 alpha-pregnane-20-one) substrates to androsterone, suggesting stimulation of 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, inhibition of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17:20 lyase activity, or both. Taken together, these findings indicate that TNF alpha, acting at relatively low concentrations, is capable of inhibiting gonadotropin-supported ovarian androgen biosynthesis by selectively modulating the activity of relevant key steroidogenic enzymes. As such, these observations suggest that the theca interstitial cell is a site of TNF alpha reception and action and that TNF alpha, possibly of resident ovarian macrophage origin, may partake in the regulation of ovarian androgen production, an effect due in part to inhibition of the activity of the key steroidogenic enzymes 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17:20 lyase."
https://openalex.org/W1600523041,"Previous studies have established that the Escherichia coli protein kinase/phosphatase nitrogen regulator II (NRII also known as NtrB) becomes autophosphorylated on a histidine residue when incubated with ATP. We show that the major site at which NRII was autophosphorylated was contained within a peptide consisting of amino acid residues 136-142 of NRII, and thus probably corresponds to His-139. A minor site of phosphorylation, accounting for about 2% of the phosphate in NRII-P, was found in a peptide that corresponds to residues 158-169."
https://openalex.org/W1602872751,"We have previously described the purification of a myelin basis protein (MBP) kinase from maturing sea star oocytes (Sanghera, J. S., Paddon, H. B., Bader, S. A., and Pelech, S. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 52-57). The ability of the purified 44-kDa protein to bind azido-ATP and undergo autophosphorylation on the serine residue implied that it is a protein kinase. Furthermore, partial amino acid sequence data has revealed that it is a novel protein kinase, which we have provisionally designated p44mpk. Autophosphorylation of p44mpk to 0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme was correlated with a modest (approximately 17%) increase in the MBP-phosphorylating activity of the kinase. Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified p44mpk recognized on immunoblots the protein in highly purified preparations as well as crude oocyte extracts. The affinity-purified anti-p44mpk antibody could immunoprecipitate active kinase, but a subpopulation of the antibody also appeared to be inhibitory. Using this antibody, we have demonstrated that the up to 12-fold stimulation of the cytosolic MBP-phosphorylating activity of this kinase that occurs during sea star oocyte maturation is not due to an increase in the amount of enzyme protein, either from a redistribution within the oocyte or protein synthesis. A slight retardation of the migration of the activated p44mpk on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and its tighter interaction with a MonoQ column is consistent with phosphorylation of the kinase during maturation. p44mpk underwent enhanced phosphorylation when oocytes prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate were induced to mature with 1-methyladenine. The stimulated MBP-phosphorylating activity of p44mpk in cytosols from maturing oocytes was partly stabilized by the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor beta-glycerol phosphate. Furthermore, treatment of purified p44mpk with protein phosphatase 2A and alkaline phosphatase resulted in 56 and 86% decreases, respectively, in the activity of the kinase. Together, these findings strongly implicate a role for phosphorylation of p44mpk in its activation during sea star oocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1576380564,"A recent report that mitosis-specific phosphorylation causes the nonmuscle caldesmon to dissociate from microfilaments (Yamashiro, S., Yamakita, Y., Ishikawa, R., and Matsumura, F. (1990) Nature 344, 675-678) suggests that this process may contribute to the major structural reorganization of the eukaryotic cell at mitosis. In this study we have demonstrated that smooth muscle caldesmon is phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 kinase from mitotic phase HeLa cells to 1.2 mol of phosphate/mol of caldesmon. Tryptic maps showed three major phosphorylated spots and approximately equal amounts of phosphorylated Ser and Thr were identified. F-actin or calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ blocks the phosphorylation of caldesmon. Phosphorylation of caldesmon greatly reduced its binding to F-actin. The phosphorylation sites were located in a 10,000-Da CnBr fragment at the COOH-terminal end of the caldesmon molecule known to house the binding sites for actin and calmodulin (Bartegi A., Fattoum, A., Derancourt, J., and Kassab, R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15231-15238). Our finding supports the model that phosphorylation of caldesmon by cdc2 kinase at mitosis may contribute to the disassembly of the microfilament bundles during prophase."
https://openalex.org/W2135757784,"Recent studies have demonstrated the activation of phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine both by growth factors and by the product of ras oncogene, ras p21. Also, evidence has been presented indicating that the stimulation of this phospholipid-degradative pathway is sufficient to activate mitogenesis in fibroblasts. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, microinjection of transforming ras p21 is a potent inducer of maturation, whereas microinjection of a neutralizing anti-ras p21 antibody specifically inhibits maturation induced by insulin but not by progesterone. The results presented here demonstrated that microinjection of phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C is sufficient to induce maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. Furthermore, microinjection of a neutralizing anti-phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C specifically blocks the maturation program induced by ras p21/insulin but not by progesterone."

This indicates that the interaction of the part of troponin (TnT2) with the middle of Tm near Cys-190 is weakened at high ionic strength, while the other part (TnT1) maintains its binding with the C-terminal region of Tm. The temperature dependence of the pyrene excimer fluorescence of Tm showed that troponin stabilized the whole Tm molecule with much less effect on the stability of the middle region where the TnT2 binds. TnT1, the N-terminal chymotryptic fragment of troponin T (TnT), stabilized Tm in a similar manner to troponin by inhibiting dissociation of Tm chains in the main unfolding transition. Thus, these data indicate a loose interaction of the TnT2 part of troponin with the region of Tm near Cys-190 and a tight interaction of the TnT1 part with the C-terminal region of Tm. TnT alone interacted more strongly with Tm near Cys-190 than when in the troponin complex. This was indicated by the following observations in the Tm.TnT complex compared to the Tm-troponin complex: (i) a more hydrophobic environment of pyrene at Cys-190 of Tm; (ii) stabilization against the local unfolding of Tm near Cys-190; (iii) more fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Tm and TnT. These studies indicate a loose and flexible interaction of troponin with the middle region of Tm which may be important in Ca2+ regulation by troponin.Tm."
https://openalex.org/W1504657174,"The mannitol-specific phosphotransferase system transport protein, Enzyme IIMtl, contains two catalytically important phosphorylated amino acid residues, both present on the cytoplasmic part of the enzyme. Recently, this portion has been subcloned, purified, and shown to be an enzymatically active domain. The N-terminal half has also been subcloned and shown to be the mannitol-binding domain. When combined the two domains catalyze mannitol phosphorylation at the expense of phospho-HPr (van Weeghel, R. P., Meyer, G. H., Pas, H. H., Keck, W. H., and Robillard, G. T., Biochemistry in press). The phospho-NMR spectrum of the purified phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain, taken at pH 8.0, shows two signals, one at -6.9 ppm compared with inorganic phosphate resulting from phosphohistidine and one at +11.9 ppm originating from phosphocysteine. Addition of mannitol plus membranes containing the N-terminal mannitol-binding domain results in the formation of mannitol 1-phosphate and the disappearance of the two signals at -6.9 and +11.9 ppm."
https://openalex.org/W1964421531,"Fractionation of an extract prepared from HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus resulted in the separation of factors involved in vaccinia virus intermediate transcription. Two activities, VITF-A and VITF-B, in addition to the viral RNA polymerase are necessary and sufficient to direct intermediate transcription in vitro. VITF-B confers intermediate promoter specificity to an early-specific extract prepared from virus particles. A committed complex between VITF-B and the template can sequester VITF-A and RNA polymerase into a pre-initiation complex. VITF-B is further able to melt the promoter at the start site of transcription. Open complex formation is stimulated by ATP. In contrast to prokaryotic and eukaryotic pol III transcription, promoter melting is independent of the presence of RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W2005795905,"Calcium salts are strong taste stimuli in vertebrate animals. However, the chemosensory transduction mechanisms for calcium are not known. In taste buds of Necturus maculosus (mud puppy), calcium evokes depolarizing receptor potentials by acting extracellularly on the apical ends of taste cells to block a resting potassium conductance. Therefore, divalent cations elicit receptor potentials in taste cells by modulating a potassium conductance rather than by permeating the cell membrane, the mechanism utilized by monovalent cations such as sodium and potassium ions."
https://openalex.org/W1553913360,"Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) has the unique stereoconfiguration of 3-acyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphoryl-1'-sn-[3'-acylglycerol] (Brotherus, J., Renkonen, O., Herrmann, J., and Fischer, W. (1974) Chem. Phys. Lipids 13, 178-182) which differs from other known mammalian phospholipids that have the sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl configuration. This stereochemistry may contribute to its physiologic function. Here we describe studies using the macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 designed to determined how this unique stereoconfiguration occurs. These studies show that the stereoconfiguration of BMP produced from exogenous phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by RAW 264.7 cells has the expected stereoconfiguration of 3-acyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphoryl-1'-sn-[3'-acylglycerol]. Experiments using diacyl-sn-[2-3H]glycero-3-phosphoryl-sn-1'-[2-3H]glycerol demonstrate that this unique stereoconfiguration is not produced due to an oxidation/reduction mechanism involving the sn-2-glycerol carbon. When dioleoyl-sn-[1-14C]glycero-3-phosphoryl-rac-glycerol was converted to 14C-labeled BMP, the 14C label was found esterified to the phosphate moiety. These results suggest that a stereospecific enzyme is capable of reorienting the radiolabeled glycerol backbone of this PG substrate, effectively changing the stereochemistry of the lipid. We also show that this enzyme is stereoselective with regard to the base glycerol moiety of the substrate PG used. Finally, we propose a new pathway for the synthesis of BMP from PG."
https://openalex.org/W1544792666,"This study used the rat pancreatoma AR42J as a model system to investigate the possible regulation of cholesterol esterase biosynthesis in pancreas. Initial experiments were performed to verify the synthesis of pancreatic cholesterol esterase by the AR42J cells. Results indicated that this pancreatoma cell line synthesized two forms of cholesterol esterase (Mr = 71,000 and 74,000). The 74-kDa protein is most likely the precursor protein, and the 71-kDa protein is the matured enzyme secreted by the AR42J cells. The synthesis and secretion of cholesterol esterase were stimulated 2-5-fold by incubating the cells with 0.5-4 nM of cholecystokinin or 0.5-2 nM of secretin. Analysis of the RNA isolated from the hormone-stimulated cells revealed that stimulation of cholesterol esterase biosynthesis was not due to an increase in cholesterol esterase mRNA. Furthermore, inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D has no effect on the hormone-induced cholesterol esterase biosynthesis. Therefore, the mechanism of hormone stimulation was not dependent on de novo RNA synthesis. In vitro translation studies showed that the cholesterol esterase mRNA isolated from stimulated AR42J cells were translated more efficiently than those from control cells. Thus, the increased cholesterol esterase biosynthesis induced by gastric hormones was most likely mediated by posttranscriptional modification of the cholesterol esterase mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1940755036,"The small oligomers formed from Mg-G-actin under favorable conditions were studied by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation. The critical concentration of actin at pH 7.8 in the presence of 100 microM MgCl2 and 200 microM ATP was 12.5 +/- 2.8 microM. Under these conditions, about 15% of 7.5 microM Mg-actin was converted to oligomers of subunit size four to eight in 5 h at 20 degrees C. In 100 microM MgCl2 and no free ATP, the critical concentration was about 6.5 microM, and about 22% of 7.5 microM Mg-actin was converted to dimers in 80 min. There were no detectable higher oligomers or F-actin present in either case. As determined by the analysis of ATP hydrolysis, most, if not all, of the oligomer subunits contained ATP. When 28.5 microM actin was polymerized to steady state in 100 microM MgCl2 and 200 microM ATP, about 50% of the actin was present as F-actin, consistent with the critical concentration (approximately 12.5 microM), about 50% as oligomers as large as seven subunits, and only about 5% as monomers. When solutions containing oligomers were diluted the oligomers dissociated. Alternatively, when the MgCl2 concentration was raised to 1 mM, the solutions containing oligomers polymerized more rapidly than monomeric Mg-G-actin and to the same final steady state. These data are entirely consistent with the condensation-elongation model for helical polymerization proposed by Oosawa and Kasai (Oosawa, F., and Kasai, M. (1962) J. Mol. Biol. 4, 10-21) according to which, under certain conditions, substantial amounts of short linear and helical oligomers should be formed below the critical concentration and linear oligomers should coexist with monomers and F-actin at steady state."
https://openalex.org/W2095042374,"An ab initio approach to the phase problem in macromolecular x-ray crystallography is described. A random gas of hard-sphere point scatterers is allowed to condense under the constraint of the solvent fraction and the restraint of the observed Fourier amplitude data. Two applications to real macromolecular examples are discussed. This method produces an approximate outline of the bulk solvent regions and thus yields a low-resolution picture of the unit cell that can be extended to higher resolutions in special cases, such as through the use of molecular replacement or of noncrystallographic symmetry-based phase extension."
https://openalex.org/W1508434551,"Several factors are known to stimulate cholesterol side-chain cleavage in isolated adrenal mitochondria, including steroidogenesis activator polypeptide (SAP), GTP, and sterol carrier protein2 (SCP2). All of these reportedly function at the level of the translocation of cholesterol to the inner membrane wherein side-chain cleavage to form pregnenolone occurs. We have investigated the activating effects of these factors alone and in combination. Under conditions where exogenous cholesterol is provided and multiple turnovers of a transport system are required, GTP stimulated steroidogenesis in isolated mitochondria and in adrenal homogenates, and this effect was enhanced by a GTP regenerating system. SAP alone had little effect under these conditions, but synergized with GTP to stimulate cholesterol metabolism. A truncated SAP analog and a variant from the C terminus of the minor heat-shock protein GRP78 had similar effects, but an unrelated peptide had no effect. GTP stimulated side-chain cleavage with the same EC50 in both resting mitochondria (from dexamethasone-treated rats) and in activated mitochondria (from ether-treated rats), but SAP effects were most apparent in resting mitochondria. In contrast, SCP2 stimulation was additive with other factors, suggesting an independent mechanism of action. While the data are consistent with biological roles for these factors, the relatively small magnitude of the in vitro effects may indicate that cell disruption and mitochondrial isolation disrupt important structural or other features which are necessary for the full expression of the steroidogenic response."

https://openalex.org/W1542802891,"Binding of neopentylcobalamin and benzylcobalamin to the apoprotein of a haptocorrin from chicken serum has been demonstrated spectrophotometrically. The spectra of the protein-bound cobalamins strongly resemble those of base-on alkylcobalamins and show that when unbound these sterically hindered alkylcobalamins are only approximately 75% (benzyl) and 40% (neopentyl) base-on, at neutral pH and at 5 degrees C. The haptocorrin was found to stabilize the spontaneous thermal decomposition of the neutral species of benzylcobalamin and neopentylcobalamin by 470-fold (3.6 kcal) and 166-fold (3.0 kcal), respectively, relative to the protein-free species. After correction of the activation parameters for the thermal decomposition of the protein-free, neutral alkylcobalamins for the relative proportions of base-on and base-off species, the haptocorrin was found to stabilize the base-on species of both alkylcobalamins by 275- to 1400-fold (approximately 3.3 to 4.3 kcal). From the temperature dependence of the decomposition reactions, the enthalpies of activation are found to be essentially identical for the protein-free and protein-bound species of either cobalamin. Thus, stabilization of the thermal decomposition of these sterically hindered alkylcobalamins by haptocorrin is entirely due to entropic factors."
https://openalex.org/W172688957,"The capacity of the RecA protein of Escherichia coli to promote an essential step in homologous recombination, strand transfer, was tested on DNA substrates varying in percentage GC. GC content was determined by a novel method using the polymerase chain reaction. Strand transfer activity is greatly reduced as a function of increasing GC content of the DNA. Some reduction is observed with substrates having a GC percentage similar to that of E. coli. The transfer reaction between sequences adjacent, but not distal, to GC-rich sequences is similarly decreased, suggesting that the structure of RecA-DNA complexes may differ with the GC content of DNA. Our results implicate an important role of DNA sequence in homologous recombination and suggest that many sequences are excluded due to their GC content."

https://openalex.org/W1515133446,"The N----O sulfate transfer of heparin has been investigated as an approach to chemical 3-O-sulfation of the D-glucosamine residues in heparin. The pyridinium salt of porcine heparin was heated at 90 degrees C in solid state for 90 min (in vacuo over P2O5) to effect the transfer of the N-sulfate groups to the HO groups in the polysaccharide, followed by N-resulfation. The product (N----O sulfate-transferred, N-resulfated heparin (ST heparin] was depolymerized with HONO to generate a mixture of di- and higher oligosaccharides. The borohydride-reduced oligosaccharides were separated on Bio-Gel P-4 and DEAE-Sephacel. The disaccharide trisulfate fraction (10.4% yield) was found to be a mixture of nearly equal amounts of IdoA(2-SO4)-AManR(3,6-diSO4) and IdoA(2,3-diSO4)-AManR(6-SO4), where IdoA represents L-iduronic acid and AManR represents the alditol formed by reduction of 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose with NaBH4. Chemical and NMR spectroscopic analyses revealed that the N----O sulfate transfer proceeded preferentially at HO-3 positions in both 6-O-sulfo-D-glucosamine and 2-O-sulfo-L-iduronic acid residues. Chromatography on antithrombin III-Sepharose gel indicated that the structural change involved in ST heparin resulted in an obvious increase in the ability to bind antithrombin III. Biological examination also indicated that this structural change resulted in moderate increases in all the activities (blood anti-clotting, anti-Factor IIa, and anti-Factor Xa) and in the strength of intrinsic fluorescence of antithrombin III."
