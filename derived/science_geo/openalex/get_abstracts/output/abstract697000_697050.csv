https://openalex.org/W4285730114,"SARS-CoV-2 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology is poised to provide a complementary approach to sequencing individual cases. However, robust quantification of variants and de novo detection of emerging variants remains challenging for existing strategies. We deep sequenced 3,413 wastewater samples representing 94 municipal catchments, covering >59% of the population of Austria, from December 2020 to February 2022. Our system of variant quantification in sewage pipeline designed for robustness (termed VaQuERo) enabled us to deduce the spatiotemporal abundance of predefined variants from complex wastewater samples. These results were validated against epidemiological records of >311,000 individual cases. Furthermore, we describe elevated viral genetic diversity during the Delta variant period, provide a framework to predict emerging variants and measure the reproductive advantage of variants of concern by calculating variant-specific reproduction numbers from wastewater. Together, this study demonstrates the power of national-scale WBE to support public health and promises particular value for countries without extensive individual monitoring. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at the national scale tracks emerging variants."
https://openalex.org/W4285728587,"Abstract Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable and prevalent RNAs in eukaryotic cells that arise from back-splicing. Synthetic circRNAs and some endogenous circRNAs can encode proteins, raising the promise of circRNA as a platform for gene expression. In this study, we developed a systematic approach for rapid assembly and testing of features that affect protein production from synthetic circRNAs. To maximize circRNA translation, we optimized five elements: vector topology, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, internal ribosome entry sites and synthetic aptamers recruiting translation initiation machinery. Together, these design principles improve circRNA protein yields by several hundred-fold, provide increased translation over messenger RNA in vitro, provide more durable translation in vivo and are generalizable across multiple transgenes."
https://openalex.org/W4285727841,"Retrons are prokaryotic genetic retroelements encoding a reverse transcriptase that produces multi-copy single-stranded DNA1 (msDNA). Despite decades of research on the biosynthesis of msDNA2, the function and physiological roles of retrons have remained unknown. Here we show that Retron-Sen2 of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes an accessory toxin protein, STM14_4640, which we renamed as RcaT. RcaT is neutralized by the reverse transcriptase-msDNA antitoxin complex, and becomes active upon perturbation of msDNA biosynthesis. The reverse transcriptase is required for binding to RcaT, and the msDNA is required for the antitoxin activity. The highly prevalent RcaT-containing retron family constitutes a new type of tripartite DNA-containing toxin-antitoxin system. To understand the physiological roles of such toxin-antitoxin systems, we developed toxin activation-inhibition conjugation (TAC-TIC), a high-throughput reverse genetics approach that identifies the molecular triggers and blockers of toxin-antitoxin systems. By applying TAC-TIC to Retron-Sen2, we identified multiple trigger and blocker proteins of phage origin. We demonstrate that phage-related triggers directly modify the msDNA, thereby activating RcaT and inhibiting bacterial growth. By contrast, prophage proteins circumvent retrons by directly blocking RcaT. Consistently, retron toxin-antitoxin systems act as abortive infection anti-phage defence systems, in line with recent reports3,4. Thus, RcaT retrons are tripartite DNA-regulated toxin-antitoxin systems, which use the reverse transcriptase-msDNA complex both as an antitoxin and as a sensor of phage protein activities."
https://openalex.org/W4285727773,"Common oat (Avena sativa) is an important cereal crop serving as a valuable source of forage and human food. Although reference genomes of many important crops have been generated, such work in oat has lagged behind, primarily owing to its large, repeat-rich polyploid genome. Here, using Oxford Nanopore ultralong sequencing and Hi-C technologies, we have generated a reference-quality genome assembly of hulless common oat, comprising 21 pseudomolecules with a total length of 10.76 Gb and contig N50 of 75.27 Mb. We also produced genome assemblies for diploid and tetraploid Avena ancestors, which enabled the identification of oat subgenomes and provided insights into oat chromosomal evolution. The origin of hexaploid oat is inferred from whole-genome sequencing, chloroplast genomes and transcriptome assemblies of different Avena species. These findings and the high-quality reference genomes presented here will facilitate the full use of crop genetic resources to accelerate oat improvement."
https://openalex.org/W4285606978,"Members of the ADAR family of double-stranded RNA-binding proteins regulate one of the most abundant RNA modifications in humans, the deamination of adenosine to inosine. Several transcriptome-wide studies have been carried out to identify RNA targets of the active deaminases ADAR1 and ADAR2. However, our understanding of ADAR3, the brain-specific deaminase-deficient ADAR family member, is limited to a few transcripts. In this study, we identified over 3300 transcripts bound by ADAR3 and observed that binding of ADAR3 correlated with reduced editing of over 400 sites in the glioblastoma transcriptome. We further investigated the impact of ADAR3 on gene regulation of the transcript that encodes MAVS, an essential protein in the innate immune response pathway. We observed reduced editing in the MAVS 3' UTR in cells expressing increased ADAR3 or reduced ADAR1 suggesting ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of ADAR1-mediated editing. While neither ADAR1 knockdown or ADAR3 overexpression affected MAVS mRNA expression, we demonstrate increased ADAR3 expression resulted in upregulation of MAVS protein expression. In addition, we created a novel genetic mutant of ADAR3 that exhibited enhanced RNA binding and MAVS upregulation compared with wildtype ADAR3. Interestingly, this ADAR3 mutant no longer repressed RNA editing, suggesting ADAR3 has a unique regulatory role beyond altering editing levels. Altogether, this study provides the first global view of ADAR3-bound RNAs in glioblastoma cells and identifies both a role for ADAR3 in repressing ADAR1-mediated editing and an RNA-binding dependent function of ADAR3 in regulating MAVS expression."
https://openalex.org/W4285726784,"Cellular senescence plays a causal role in ageing and, in mice, depletion of p16INK4a-expressing senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders1,2. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are RNA-editing enzymes that are also implicated as important regulators of human ageing, and ADAR inactivation causes age-associated pathologies such as neurodegeneration in model organisms3,4. However, the role, if any, of ADARs in cellular senescence is unknown. Here we show that ADAR1 is post-transcriptionally downregulated by autophagic degradation to promote senescence through p16INK4a upregulation. The ADAR1 downregulation is sufficient to drive senescence in both in vitro and in vivo models. Senescence induced by ADAR1 downregulation is p16INK4a-dependent and independent of its RNA-editing function. Mechanistically, ADAR1 promotes SIRT1 expression by affecting its RNA stability through HuR, an RNA-binding protein that increases the half-life and steady-state levels of its target mRNAs. SIRT1 in turn antagonizes translation of mRNA encoding p16INK4a. Hence, downregulation of ADAR1 and SIRT1 mediates p16INK4a upregulation by enhancing its mRNA translation. Finally, Adar1 is downregulated during ageing of mouse tissues such as brain, ovary and intestine, and Adar1 expression correlates with Sirt1 expression in these tissues in mice. Together, our study reveals an RNA-editing-independent role for ADAR1 in the regulation of senescence by post-transcriptionally controlling p16INK4a expression. Hao et al. describe an RNA-editing-independent role for ADAR1 in driving senescence. Autophagy downregulates ADAR1 in aged tissues, decreasing the binding of ADAR1 partner HuR to target mRNAs, including SIRT1. Loss of SIRT1 enhances p16INK4a levels."
https://openalex.org/W4285727759,"Abstract Glutamine is a conditionally essential nutrient for many cancer cells, but it remains unclear how consuming glutamine in excess of growth requirements confers greater fitness to glutamine-addicted cancers. By contrasting two breast cancer subtypes with distinct glutamine dependencies, we show that glutamine-indispensable triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells rely on a non-canonical glutamine-to-glutamate overflow, with glutamine carbon routed once through the TCA cycle. Importantly, this single-pass glutaminolysis increases TCA cycle fluxes and replenishes TCA cycle intermediates in TNBC cells, a process that achieves net oxidation of glucose but not glutamine. The coupling of glucose and glutamine catabolism appears hard-wired via a distinct TNBC gene expression profile biased to strip and then sequester glutamine nitrogen, but hampers the ability of TNBC cells to oxidise glucose when glutamine is limiting. Our results provide a new understanding of how metabolically rigid TNBC cells are sensitive to glutamine deprivation and a way to select vulnerable TNBC subtypes that may be responsive to metabolic-targeted therapies."

https://openalex.org/W4285603403,"Elevated DNA replication stress causes instability of the DNA replication fork and increased DNA mutations, which underlies tumorigenesis. The DNA replication stress regulator silencing-defective 2 (SDE2) is known to bind to TIMELESS (TIM), a protein of the fork protection complex, and enhances its stability, thereby supporting replisome activity at DNA replication forks. However, the DNA-binding activity of SDE2 is not well defined. Here, we structurally and functionally characterize a new conserved DNA-binding motif related to the SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS) domain in human SDE2 and establish its preference for ssDNA. Our NMR solution structure of the SDE2SAP domain reveals a helix-extended loop-helix core with the helices aligned parallel to each other, consistent with known canonical SAP folds. Notably, we have shown that the DNA interaction of this SAP domain extends beyond the core SAP domain and is augmented by two lysine residues in the C-terminal tail, which is uniquely positioned adjacent to the SAP motif and conserved in the pre-mRNA splicing factor SF3A3. Furthermore, we found that mutation in the SAP domain and extended C terminus not only disrupts ssDNA binding but also impairs TIM localization at replication forks, thus inhibiting efficient fork progression. Taken together, our results establish SDE2SAP as an essential element for SDE2 to exert its role in preserving replication fork integrity via fork protection complex regulation and highlight the structural diversity of the DNA-protein interactions achieved by a specialized DNA-binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W4285727983,"We developed and tested a method to detect COVID-19 disease, using urine specimens. The technology is based on Raman spectroscopy and computational analysis. It does not detect SARS-CoV-2 virus or viral components, but rather a urine 'molecular fingerprint', representing systemic metabolic, inflammatory, and immunologic reactions to infection. We analyzed voided urine specimens from 46 symptomatic COVID-19 patients with positive real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for infection or household contact with test-positive patients. We compared their urine Raman spectra with urine Raman spectra from healthy individuals (n = 185), peritoneal dialysis patients (n = 20), and patients with active bladder cancer (n = 17), collected between 2016-2018 (i.e., pre-COVID-19). We also compared all urine Raman spectra with urine specimens collected from healthy, fully vaccinated volunteers (n = 19) from July to September 2021. Disease severity (primarily respiratory) ranged among mild (n = 25), moderate (n = 14), and severe (n = 7). Seventy percent of patients sought evaluation within 14 days of onset. One severely affected patient was hospitalized, the remainder being managed with home/ambulatory care. Twenty patients had clinical pathology profiling. Seven of 20 patients had mildly elevated serum creatinine values (>0.9 mg/dl; range 0.9-1.34 mg/dl) and 6/7 of these patients also had estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73m2 (range 59-84 mL/min/1.73m2). We could not determine if any of these patients had antecedent clinical pathology abnormalities. Our technology (Raman Chemometric Urinalysis-Rametrix®) had an overall prediction accuracy of 97.6% for detecting complex, multimolecular fingerprints in urine associated with COVID-19 disease. The sensitivity of this model for detecting COVID-19 was 90.9%. The specificity was 98.8%, the positive predictive value was 93.0%, and the negative predictive value was 98.4%. In assessing severity, the method showed to be accurate in identifying symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe (random chance = 33%) based on the urine multimolecular fingerprint. Finally, a fingerprint of 'Long COVID-19' symptoms (defined as lasting longer than 30 days) was located in urine. Our methods were able to locate the presence of this fingerprint with 70.0% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity in leave-one-out cross-validation analysis. Further validation testing will include sampling more patients, examining correlations of disease severity and/or duration, and employing metabolomic analysis (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry [GC-MS], High Performance Liquid Chromatography [HPLC]) to identify individual components contributing to COVID-19 molecular fingerprints."
https://openalex.org/W4285726176,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a complex neuromuscular condition that may negatively influence gross motor function. Children diagnosed with CP often exhibit spasticity, weakness, reduced motor control, contracture, and bony malalignment. Despite many previous association studies, the causal impact of these impairments on motor function is unknown.In this study, we proposed a causal model which estimated the effects of common impairments on motor function in children with spastic CP as measured by the 66-item Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66). We estimated both direct and total effect sizes of all included variables using linear regression based on covariate adjustment sets implied by the minimally sufficient adjustment sets. In addition, we estimated bivariate effect sizes of all measures for comparison.We retrospectively evaluated 300 consecutive subjects with spastic cerebral palsy who underwent routine clinical gait analysis. Model data included standard information collected during this analysis.The largest causal effect sizes, as measured by standardized regression coefficients, were found for selective voluntary motor control and dynamic motor control, followed by strength, then gait deviations. In contrast, common treatment targets, such as spasticity and orthopedic deformity, had relatively small effects. Effect sizes estimated from bivariate models, which cannot appropriately adjust for other causal factors, substantially overestimated the total effect of spasticity, strength, and orthopedic deformity.Understanding the effects of impairments on gross motor function will allow clinicians to direct treatments at those impairments with the greatest potential to influence gross motor function and provide realistic expectations of the anticipated changes."
https://openalex.org/W4285605497,"Over 100 mutations in the rhodopsin gene have been linked to a spectrum of retinopathies that include retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness. Though most of these variants exhibit a loss of function, the molecular defects caused by these underlying mutations vary considerably. In this work, we utilize deep mutational scanning to quantitatively compare the plasma membrane expression of 123 known pathogenic rhodopsin variants in the presence and absence of the stabilizing cofactor 9-cis-retinal. We identify 69 retinopathy variants, including 20 previously uncharacterized variants, that exhibit diminished plasma membrane expression in HEK293T cells. Of these apparent class II variants, 67 exhibit a measurable increase in expression in the presence of 9-cis-retinal. However, the magnitude of the response to this molecule varies considerably across this spectrum of mutations. Evaluation of the observed shifts relative to thermodynamic estimates for the coupling between binding and folding suggests underlying differences in stability constrains the magnitude of their response to retinal. Nevertheless, estimates from computational modeling suggest that many of the least sensitive variants also directly compromise binding. Finally, we evaluate the functional properties of three previous uncharacterized, retinal-sensitive variants (ΔN73, S131P, and R135G) and show that two of these retain residual function in vitro. Together, our results provide a comprehensive experimental characterization of the proteostatic properties of retinopathy variants and their response to retinal."
https://openalex.org/W4285726232,"Common statistical modeling methods do not necessarily produce the most relevant or interpretable effect estimates to communicate risk. Overreliance on the odds ratio and relative effect measures limit the potential impact of epidemiologic and public health research. We created a straightforward R package, called riskCommunicator, to facilitate the presentation of a variety of effect measures, including risk differences and ratios, number needed to treat, incidence rate differences and ratios, and mean differences. The riskCommunicator package uses g-computation with parametric regression models and bootstrapping for confidence intervals to estimate effect measures in time-fixed data. We demonstrate the utility of the package using data from the Framingham Heart Study to estimate the effect of prevalent diabetes on the 24-year risk of cardiovascular disease or death. The package promotes the communication of public-health relevant effects and is accessible to a broad range of epidemiologists and health researchers with little to no expertise in causal inference methods or advanced coding."
https://openalex.org/W4285731288,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying restrictions are associated with substantial psychological distress. However, it is unclear how this increased strain translates into help-seeking behavior. Here, we aim to characterize those individuals who seek help for COVID-19 related psychological distress, and examine which factors are associated with their levels of distress in order to better characterize vulnerable groups. Methods We report data from 1269 help-seeking participants subscribing to a stepped-care program targeted at mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sample characteristics were compared to population data, and linear regression analyses were used to examine which risk factors and stressors were associated with current symptom levels. Results Seeking for help for COVID-19 related psychological distress was characterized by female gender, younger age, and better education compared to the general population. The majority reported mental health problems already before the pandemic. 74.5% of this help-seeking sample also exceeded clinical thresholds for depression, anxiety, or somatization. Higher individual symptom levels were associated with higher overall levels of pandemic stress, younger age, and pre-existing mental health problems, but were buffered by functional emotion regulation strategies. Conclusions Results suggest a considerable increase in demand for mental-healthcare in the pandemic aftermath. Comparisons with the general population indicate diverging patterns in help-seeking behavior: while some individuals seek help themselves, others should be addressed directly. Individuals that are young, have pre-existing mental health problems and experience a high level of pandemic stress are particularly at-risk for considerable symptom load. Mental-healthcare providers should use these results to prepare for the significant increase in demand during the broader aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as allocate limited resources more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4285600243,"Pumilio is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that controls development, stem cell fate, and neurological functions in Drosophila. Pumilio represses protein expression by destabilizing target mRNAs in a manner dependent on the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Three unique repression domains in the N-terminal region of Pumilio were previously shown to recruit CCR4-NOT, but how they do so was not well understood. In this study, we identified the motifs that are necessary and sufficient for the activity of the third repression domain of Pumilio, designated RD3, which is present in all isoforms and has conserved regulatory function. We identified multiple conserved regions of RD3 that are important for repression activity in cell-based reporter gene assays. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we show that RD3 contacts specific regions of the Not1, Not2, and Not3 subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex. Our results indicate that RD3 makes multivalent interactions with CCR4-NOT mediated by conserved short linear interaction motifs. Specifically, two phenylalanine residues in RD3 make crucial contacts with Not1 that are essential for its repression activity. Using reporter gene assays, we also identify three new target mRNAs that are repressed by Pumilio and show that RD3 contributes to their regulation. Together, these results provide important insights into the mechanism by which Pumilio recruits CCR4-NOT to regulate the expression of target mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4285606051,"Osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis are highly prevalent diseases with limited treatment options. In light of these unmet medical needs, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently sought. Previously, the activation of the transmembrane receptor Plexin-B1 by its ligand semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) has been shown to suppress bone formation and promote neuroinflammation in mice. However, it is unclear whether inhibition of this receptor-ligand interaction by an anti-Plexin-B1 antibody could represent a viable strategy against diseases related to these processes. Here, we raised and systematically characterized a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of human Plexin-B1, which specifically blocks the binding of Sema4D to Plexin-B1. In vitro, we show that this antibody inhibits the suppressive effects of Sema4D on human osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. To test the therapeutic potential of the antibody in vivo, we generated a humanized mouse line, which expresses transgenic human Plexin-B1 instead of endogenous murine Plexin-B1. Employing these mice, we demonstrate that the anti-Plexin-B1 antibody exhibits beneficial effects in mouse models of postmenopausal osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis in vivo. In summary, our data identify an anti-Plexin-B1 antibody as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis."

Exercise training is an excellent preventative tool against aging-related disorders and has been shown to increase mitochondrial function in muscle. Using the Sugar, Hypertension, and Physical Exercise cohorts (N = 105), we evaluated the effect of 6-months of exercise intervention on mtDNA-CN measured in blood. Although there was no significant relationship between exercise intervention and mtDNA-CN change (P = 0.29), there was a nominally significant association between mtDNA-CN and metabolic syndrome (P = 0.04), which has been seen in previous literature. We also identified a nominally significant association between higher mtDNA-CN and higher insulin sensitivity (P = 0.02)."
https://openalex.org/W4285726669,"Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present a huge threat to population health and in addition impose severe economic burden on individuals and their households. Despite this, there is no research evidence on the microeconomic impact of CVDs in Nigeria. Therefore, this study estimated the incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE), poverty headcount due to out-of-pocket (OOP) medical spending and the associated factors among the households of a cohort of CVDs patients who accessed healthcare services in public and specialized heart hospitals in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods This study adopts a descriptive cross-sectional study design. A standardized data collection questionnaire developed by the Initiative for Cardiovascular Health Research in Developing Countries was adapted to electronically collect data from all the 744 CVDs patients who accessed healthcare services in public and specialized heart hospitals in Ibadan between 4 th November 2019 to the 31 st January 2020. A sensitivity analysis, using rank-dependent thresholds of CHE which ranged from 5%-40% of household total expenditures was carried out. The international poverty line of $1.90/day recommended by the World Bank was utilized to ascertain poverty headcounts pre-and post OOP payments for healthcare services. Categorical variables like household socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, CHE and poverty headcounts, were presented using percentages and proportions. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the factors associated with CHE and poverty. Data were analyzed using STATA version 15 and estimates were validated at 5% level of significance. Results Catastrophic OOP payment ranged between 3.9%-54.6% and catastrophic overshoot ranged from 1.8% to 12.6%. Health expenditures doubled poverty headcount among households, from 8.13% to 16.4%. Having tertiary education (AOR: 0.49, CI: 0.26–0.93, p = 0.03) and household size (AOR: 0.40, CI: 0.24–0.67, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with CHE. Being female (AOR: 0.41, CI: 0.18–0.92, p = 0.03), household economic status (AOR: 0.003, CI: 0.0003–0.25, p = &lt;0.001) and having 3–4 household members (AOR: 0.30, CI: 0.15–0.61, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with household poverty status post payment for medical services. Conclusion OOP medical spending due to CVDs imposed enormous strain on household resources and increased the poverty rates among households. Policies and interventions that supports universal health coverage are highly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4285730674,"Amikacin (AK) has the largest spectrum of aminoglycosides. However, its use is constrained because of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenol present in plants. It has antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antimutagenic characteristics. Cilostazol (CTZ) is a phosphodiesterase Ш inhibitor, it is a potent vasodilator and antiplatelet drug. CTZ has an inhibitory effect on reactive oxygen species and superoxide generation in addition to hydroxyl radicals scavenging action. This study determines whether EA and cilostazol have a protective effect against AK-induced nephrotoxicity. Forty-nine rats were divided into seven equal groups: control normal; AK 400 mg/kg; EA 10 mg/kg; CTZ 10 mg/kg; AK 400 mg/kg plus EA 10 mg/kg; AK 400 mg/kg plus CTZ 10 mg/kg; AK 400 mg/kg plus EA 10 mg/kg and CTZ 10 mg/kg. For seven days, drugs were administered using gavage one hour before intramuscular injection of AK. Twenty-four hours after the last AK dosage, blood samples were collected to determine blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Kidneys were removed for histopathological examination and measurement of: malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), decreased glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and Bcl-2 associated x protein (BAX). AK caused kidney damage, inflammatory mediator elevation, and oxidative stress and apoptotic markers. Rats receiving EA or CTZ indicated significant improvement in kidney function, decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation through NF-kB down-regulation and BAX expression. The combination of EA and CTZ showed a synergistic effect. In conclusion, EA and CTZ might play a beneficial role in preventing nephrotoxicity induced by AK partially by inhibition of tissue inflammation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4285601907,"The axon initial segment (AIS) has characteristically dense clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav), cell adhesion molecule Neurofascin 186 (Nfasc), and neuronal scaffold protein Ankyrin-G (AnkG) in neurons, which facilitates generation of an action potential and maintenance of axonal polarity. However, the mechanisms underlying AIS assembly, maintenance, and plasticity remain poorly understood. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the AnkG ankyrin repeat (ANK repeat) domain in complex with its binding site in the Nfasc cytoplasmic tail that shows, in conjunction with binding affinity assays with serial truncation variants, the molecular basis of AnkG-Nfasc binding. We confirm AnkG interacts with the FIGQY motif in Nfasc, and we identify another region required for their high affinity binding. Our structural analysis revealed that ANK repeats form 4 hydrophobic or hydrophilic layers in the AnkG inner groove that coordinate interactions with essential Nfasc residues, including F1202, E1204, and Y1212. Moreover, we show disruption of the AnkG-Nfasc complex abolishes Nfasc enrichment at the AIS in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Finally, our structural and biochemical analysis indicated that L1 syndrome-associated mutations in L1CAM, a member of the L1 immunoglobulin family proteins including Nfasc, L1CAM, NrCAM, and CHL1, compromise binding with ankyrins. Taken together, these results define the mechanisms underlying AnkG-Nfasc complex formation and show that AnkG-dependent clustering of Nfasc is required for AIS integrity."
https://openalex.org/W4285603920,"Animals detect heat using thermosensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. In insects, these include TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), which in mosquitoes is crucial for noxious heat avoidance and thus is an appealing pest control target. However, the molecular basis for heat-evoked activation has not been fully elucidated, impeding both studies of the molecular evolution of temperature sensitivity and rational design of inhibitors. In TRPA1 and other thermosensitive TRPs, the N-terminal cytoplasmic ankyrin repeat (AR) domain has been suggested to participate in heat-evoked activation, but the lack of a structure containing the full AR domain has hindered our mechanistic understanding of its role. Here, we focused on elucidating the structural basis of apparent temperature threshold determination by taking advantage of two closely related mosquito TRPA1s from Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens pallens with 86.9% protein sequence identity but a 10 °C difference in apparent temperature threshold. We identified two positions in the N-terminal cytoplasmic AR domain of these proteins, E417 (A. aegypti)/Q414 (C. pipiens) and R459 (A. aegypti)/Q456 (C. pipiens), at which a single exchange of amino acid identity was sufficient to change apparent thresholds by 5 to 7 °C. We further found that the role of these positions is conserved in TRPA1 of a third related species, Anopheles stephensi. Our results suggest a structural basis for temperature threshold determination as well as for the evolutionary adaptation of mosquito TRPA1 to the wide range of climates inhabited by mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W4285605718,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3 (CEACAM3) is a human granulocyte receptor mediating the efficient phagocytosis of a subset of human-restricted bacterial pathogens. Its function depends on phosphorylation of a tyrosine-based sequence motif, but the enzyme(s) responsible for reversing this modification are unclear. Here, we identify the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRJ as a negative regulator of CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis. We show depletion of PTPRJ results in a gain-of-function phenotype, while overexpression of a constitutively active PTPRJ phosphatase strongly reduces bacterial uptake via CEACAM3. We also determined that recombinant PTPRJ directly dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of purified full-length CEACAM3 and recognizes synthetic CEACAM3-derived phosphopeptides as substrates. Dephosphorylation of CEACAM3 by PTPRJ is also observed in intact cells, thereby limiting receptor-initiated cytoskeletal re-arrangements, lamellipodia formation, and bacterial uptake. Finally, we show that human phagocytes deficient for PTPRJ exhibit exaggerated lamellipodia formation and enhanced opsonin-independent phagocytosis of CEACAM3-binding bacteria. Taken together, our results highlight PTPRJ as a bona fide negative regulator of CEACAM3-initiated phagocyte functions, revealing a potential molecular target to limit CEACAM3-driven inflammatory responses."

However, 80% of women testing positive are asymptomatic. In the Amazon region, young women, in particular, are widely exposed to the infections and their consequences.Determine the prevalence of sexual infection by HPV and C. trachomatis in young, sexually-active women treated at a university health program in a large city of the Brazilian Amazon region.We amplified the L1 gene of HPV. We amplified ompA gene of C. trachomatis by nested PCR, and the study participants filled in a questionnaire on their social, epidemiological, and reproductive health characteristics. The data were analyzed using the Odds Ratio, to evaluate the degree of association of these variables with the observed infections.The prevalence of infection by HPV was 15.5% (47/303). This infection was recorded in 32.2% of the women of less than 25 years of age (OR:3.02 [CI95%] = 1.32-6.92; p = 0.014), 17.9% of the single women (OR: 2.41 [CI95%] = 1.22-4.75; p = 0.014), 23.8% of the women that reported having first sexual intercourse at less than 15 years of age (OR: 2.22 [CI95%] = 1.16-4.23; p = 0.021), 20% of those that reported having had more than one sexual partner during their lifetime (OR: 3.83 [CI95%] = 1.56-9.37; p = 0.003), and in 28.3% that use oral contraceptives (CI95% = 1.33-5.43; p = 0.008). The prevalence of sexual infection by C. trachomatis was 4.6% (14/303), and this bacterium was present in 16.1% of the young women of less than 25 years of age (OR: 2.86 [CI95%] = 1.33-5.43; p = 0.008).We found a high prevalence of HPV in young, unmarried women who started their sex lives early, who had several sexual partners in their lives and who used oral contraceptives. The prevalence of C. trachomatis was high only in young women. Our data are in accordance with other studies in Brazil and in the world and may serve to base the formulation of diagnostic and screening measures for these infections in women in the Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W4285727085,"As measures of concentration, especially for market (industry) concentration based on market shares, a variety of different measures or indices have been proposed. However, the various indices, including the two most widely used ones, the concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI), lack an important property: the value-validity property. An alternative index with this and other desirable properties is introduced. The new index makes it permissible to properly assess the extent of the concentration and make order and difference comparisons between index values as being true representations of the real concentration characteristic (attribute). Computer simulation data and real market-share data are used in the analysis. It is shown that the new index has a close functional relationship with the HHI index and has a firm theoretical relationship with market power as measured by the price-cost margin. Corresponding modifications to existing merger guidelines are presented."
https://openalex.org/W4285727250,"Ixodes ricinus , the most common species of tick in Europe, is known to transmit major pathogens to animals and humans such as Babesia spp. or Borrelia spp. Its abundance and distribution have been steadily increasing in Europe during recent decades, due to global environmental changes. Indeed, as ticks spend most of their life in the environment, their activity and life cycle are highly dependent on environmental conditions and therefore, on climate or habitat changes. Simultaneously, wild ungulates have expanded their range and increased dramatically in abundance worldwide, in particular roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ), allowing tick populations to grow and spread. Currently, tick infestation on newborn wild ungulates is poorly documented. However, newborn ungulates are considered more sensitive to tick bites and pathogen transmission because of their immature immune systems. Thus, improving knowledge about the factors influencing tick infestation on newborns is essential to better understand their health risks. This study was conducted at Trois-Fontaines Forest, Champagne-Ardenne, France (1992–2018). Based on a long-term monitoring of roe deer fawns, we used a novel Bayesian model of the infestation of fawns to identify which biotic or abiotic factors were likely to modify the level of infestation by ticks of 965 fawns over time. We show that tick burden increased faster during the first days of life of the fawns and became constant when fawns were five days old and more, which could be explained by the depletion of questing ticks or the turnover of ticks feeding on fawns. Moreover, despite the known positive influence of humidity on tick activity, the tick burdens were weakly related to this parameter. Our results demonstrate that tick infestation was highly variable among years, particularly between 2000–2009. We hypothesize that this results from a modification of habitat caused by Hurricane Lothar."
https://openalex.org/W4285728284,"There are many advantages to liquid-based hydrothermal carbonization (L-HTC) but the need to immerse the biomass in water generates more post-process water, hindering the commercialisation of HTC. To address this issue, this study investigated the feasibility of vapour-based HTC (V-HTC), which minimizes the water required. Dairy manure was hydrothermally treated at temperatures of 200, 230, 255 and 270°C and biomass-to-water ratios (B/W) of 0.1, 0.18, 0.25, 0.43, 0.67 and 1.0 for 20 minutes, then the produced hydrochars were characterized by calorific, proximate, ultimate and thermogravimetric analyses. The results showed that the mass yields of hydrochar decreased with increasing temperature but were essentially stable at high B/W ratios. Notably, the calorific values of the hydrochars increased with increasing temperature and B/W ratio, and the energy density increased by 46%. Due to the higher mass yield and increased energy density, maximum energy yields at each temperature (86.0-97.4%) were observed at a B/W ratio of 1.0. The proximate and ultimate analyses revealed that the degree of coalification, such as the increase in carbon content and decrease in oxygen and volatile matter, progressed more under V-HTC than L-HTC conditions, likely because the lower liquid content in V-HTC facilitates the formation of secondary char and increases the reaction severity due to higher acidity. This study showed a potential approach for upgrading a semi-solid-state biomass by V-HTC."
https://openalex.org/W4285728693,"Lysine acetylation is an important regulatory post-translational modification (PTM) that occurs sub-stoichiometrically, often representing less than 1% of the target protein. This makes studying endogenous protein acetylation extremely challenging. Recent reports suggest that several post-translational modifications (PTMs), including lysine acetylation, play a major role in the regulation the programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a clinically important protein target. An enrichment step is necessary to enable identification of the acetylated species by either antibody or mass spectrometry-based detection methods. This report describes a robust lab protocol for the enrichment and detection of endogenous acetylated PD-L1 protein. A recently developed acetyl lysine affinity matrix was utilized to enrich >90% of acetylated PD-L1 species, from a variety of cell lines, spanning a fourteen-fold range of target protein levels. Western blot analysis, using a highly sensitive PD-L1 antibody and optimized transfer times, was used to determine that the endogenous level of acetylated PD-L1 is in the range of 0.02-0.07% of total PD-L1. As validation, we demonstrate that acetylation levels increase to 0.11-0.17% of total PD-L1 after a 4h treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). The method described here is simple to perform in any lab equipped with tissue culture and western blot equipment."
https://openalex.org/W4285730461,"The current global pandemic has laid bare the importance of national food security to human survival. Many cultivated lands in the hilly, mountainous, and other marginalized areas have been abandoned on a large scale, resulting in a tremendous waste of agricultural resources, thereby threatening national food security. Here, we studied abandoned farmland in Xingning City, a mountainous area in northern Guangdong province. According to the ""seeding—growing—harvesting"" life cycle of cultivated plots, spatial superposition method and remote sensing change detection method were applied to identify abandoned arable land. Logistic regression model was used to reveal the influencing factors and occurrence mechanism of abandoned cropland at plot scale, and cluster analysis was used to discuss the classification and management strategies. Result showed that 16.83% of the cultivated land in the study area was severely abandoned, attributed to poor location, poor basic conditions, and fragmentation of the land. Further, the abandoned farmland was divided into output-driving type, cultivation condition-driving type, and plot-condition driving type. Based on these types, we proposed some countermeasures, such as adjusting agricultural structures, tamping agricultural infrastructures, strengthening land circulation, popularizing appropriate scale operations. These measures provide a reference to effectively curb abandoned farmland and improving the utilization efficiency of cultivated land, especially in recent years."
https://openalex.org/W4285726365,"Globally, postpartum hemorrhage is the leading preventable cause of maternal mortality. To decrease postpartum hemorrhage-related maternal mortalities, identifying its risk factors is crucial to suggest interventions. In this regard, little is known about the link between primary postpartum hemorrhage and inter-pregnancy interval in Ethiopia, where more than half of pregnancies occur shortly after the preceding childbirth. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the association of primary postpartum hemorrhage with an inter-pregnancy interval in urban South Ethiopia.A community-based matched nested case-control study was conducted among a cohort of 2548 pregnant women. All women with primary postpartum hemorrhage during the follow-up (n = 73) were taken as cases. Women who were randomly selected from those without primary postpartum hemorrhage (n = 292) were taken as controls. Cases were individually matched with controls (1:4 ratio) for age group and location. A conditional logistic regression analysis was done using R version 4.0.5 software. Statistically, a significant association was declared using 95% CI and p-value. Attributable fraction (AF) and population attributable fraction (PAF) were used to estimate the public health impacts of the inter-pregnancy interval.This study found out that more than half (66%) of primary postpartum hemorrhage was attributed to inter-pregnancy interval <24 months (AF = 66.3%, 95% CI: 37.5, 82.5%). This could be prevented if the inter-pregnancy interval was increased to 24-60 months. Likewise, nearly half (49%) of primary postpartum hemorrhage in the study population could be prevented if the inter-pregnancy interval <24 months was prevented. Additionally, primary postpartum hemorrhage was attributed to antepartum hemorrhage, prolonged labour and multiple pregnancies.Primary postpartum hemorrhage was associated with inter-pregnancy interval under 24 months, highlighting the need to improve postpartum modern contraceptive utilization in the community. Counseling couples about how long to wait until subsequent pregnancy and the risk when the inter-pregnancy interval is short need to be underlined."

https://openalex.org/W4285727893,"Prolonged activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) due to mis-regulation of the VEGF pathway induces aberrant blood vessel expansion, which supports growth and survival of solid tumors. Therapeutic interventions that inhibit the VEGFR-2 pathway have therefore become a mainstay of cancer treatment. Non-clinical studies have recently revealed that blockade of angiogenesis can modulate the tumor microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of concurrent immune therapies. Ramucirumab is an FDA-approved anti-angiogenic antibody that inhibits VEGFR-2 and is currently being evaluated in clinical studies in combination with anti-programmed cell death (PD-1) axis checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, durvalumab, or sintilimab) across several cancer types. The purpose of this study is to establish a mechanistic basis for the enhanced activity observed in the combined blockade of VEGFR-2 and PD-1-axis pathways. Pre-clinical studies were conducted in murine tumor models known to be responsive to anti-PD-1 axis therapy, using monoclonal antibodies that block mouse VEGFR-2 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Combination therapy resulted in enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to anti-PD-L1 monotherapy. VEGFR-2 blockade at early timepoints post-anti-PD-L1 therapy resulted in a dose-dependent and transient enhanced infiltration of T cells, and establishment of immunological memory. VEGFR-2 blockade at later timepoints resulted in enhancement of anti-PD-L1-driven immune cell infiltration. VEGFR-2 and PD-L1 monotherapies induced both unique and overlapping patterns of immune gene expression, and combination therapy resulted in an enhanced immune activation signature. Collectively, these results provide new and actionable insights into the mechanisms by which concurrent VEGFR-2 and PD-L1 antibody therapy leads to enhanced anti-tumor efficacy."

In this paper, we explore whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) could work as an information channel to restrain CF or as reputation insurance to promote CF. We find a significant positive relation between CSR and CF, especially for non-SOEs and enterprises with low ownership concentration and high CSR scores. It verifies that the reputation insurance effect by CSR outweighs the information effect and denies the opposite. The results prove robust in tests including sensitivity and endogeneity test.

https://openalex.org/W4285728350,"Ecological intensification has been proposed as an alternative paradigm for intensive agriculture to boost yield sustainably through utilizing ecosystem services. A prerequisite to achieving this is to understand the relations between multiple ecosystem services and production, while taking growth conditions such as nutrient availability into consideration. Here, we conducted a pot-field experiment to study the interactive effects of soil organic matter (SOM) content and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on the production of raspberry ( Rubus idaeus L.) under four levels of fertilizer application. Raspberry flower number, fruit number and yield only significantly increased with fertilizer inputs but were not impacted by SOM content or AMF inoculation. Fruit set and single berry weight were influenced by both SOM content and AMF inoculation, in complex three-way interactions with fertilizer application. Fruit set of AMF inoculated plants increased with fertilizer inputs in low SOM soils, but decreased with fertilizer inputs under high SOM soils, with the highest fruit set occurring at no fertilizer inputs. In low SOM soils, the relation between single berry weight and fertilizer application was more pronounced in inoculated plants than in non-inoculated plants, while in high SOM soils the relative benefits of AMF inoculation on single berry weight decreased with increasing fertilizer inputs. We attribute the lack of effects of AMF inoculation and SOM content on flower number, fruit number and yield mainly to potential tradeoffs between the experimental variables that all influence resource uptake by plant root systems. Our results suggest that potentially beneficial effects of AMF and SOM can be offset by each other, probably driven by the dynamic relations between AMF and the host plants. The findings reveal fundamental implications for managing AMF inoculation and SOM management simultaneously in real-world agricultural systems."
https://openalex.org/W4285728359,"Five Camellia oleifera Abel seedling substrates were prepared using the conventional formula, but with the peat substituted by the composts of Camellia oleifera shell, pine chips, palm fiber residues, chicken manure, and sheep manure.

It was found that the survival rates of the one-year-old seedlings produced from stem cuttings on all substrates at 6 months were greater than 97.5%. As compared with the conventional substrate, the substrates formulated with the composts were able to promote the seedling growth based upon height, ground diameter, root length and root volume measurement. The substrate prepared with the compost of Camellia oleifera shell+ palm fiber residue+ chicken manure (A3), vermiculite and perlite (6:3:1) was the most optimal, which gave 100% seedling survival rate, the greatest seedling height, and the largest ground diameter.

Multiple lines of evidence indicate the existence of SM22α in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated the effect of cardiac SM22α on the membrane architecture and functions of cardiomyocytes to pressure overload.SM22α knock-out (KO) mice were utilized to assess the role of SM22α in the heart. Echocardiography was used to evaluate cardiac function, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was used to induce heart failure, cell shortening properties were measured by IonOptix devices in intact cardiomyocytes, Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments was measured in permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) techniques were used to perform functional and structural analysis.SM22α ablation did not alter cardiac function at baseline, but mRNA levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) were increased significantly compared with wild type (WT) controls. The membrane architecture was severely disrupted in SM22α KO cardiomyocytes, with disassembly and flattening of caveolae and disrupted T-tubules. Furthermore, SM22α was co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-3 (Cav3), and the interaction between Cav3 and actin was significantly reduced in SM22α KO cells. SM22α KO cardiomyocytes displayed asynchronized SR Ca2+ release, significantly increased Ca2+ spark frequency. Additionally, the kinetics of sarcomere shortening was abnormal, accompanied with increased sensitivity and reduced maximum response of myofilaments to Ca2+ in SM22α KO cardiomyocytes. SM22α KO mice were more prone to heart failure after TAC.Our findings identified that SM22α may be required for the architecture and function of caveolae and T-tubules in cardiomyocytes."

https://openalex.org/W4285731412,"Background Knowledge of the normal myocardial–myocyte orientation could theoretically allow the definition of relevant quantitative biomarkers in clinical routine to diagnose heart pathologies. A whole heart diffusion tensor template representative of the global myofiber organization over species is therefore crucial for comparisons across populations. In this study, we developed a groupwise registration and tractography framework to resolve the global myofiber arrangement of large mammalian sheep hearts. To demonstrate the potential application of the proposed method, a novel description of sub-regions in the intraventricular septum is presented. Methods Three explanted sheep (ovine) hearts (size ~12×8×6 cm3, heart weight ~ 150 g) were perfused with contrast agent and fixative and imaged in a 9.4T magnet. A group-wise registration of high-resolution anatomical and diffusion-weighted images were performed to generate anatomical and diffusion tensor templates. Diffusion tensor metrics (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, fractional anisotropy …) were computed to provide a quantitative and spatially-resolved analysis of cardiac microstructure. Then tractography was performed using deterministic and probabilistic algorithms and used for different purposes: i) Visualization of myofiber architecture, ii) Segmentation of sub-area depicting the same fiber organization, iii) Seeding and Tract Editing. Finally, dissection was performed to confirm the existence of macroscopic structures identified in the diffusion tensor template. Results The template creation takes advantage of high-resolution anatomical and diffusion-weighted images obtained at an isotropic resolution of 150 μm and 600 μm respectively, covering ventricles and atria and providing information on the normal myocardial architecture. The diffusion metric distributions from the template were found close to the one of the individual samples validating the registration procedure. Small new sub-regions exhibiting spatially sharp variations in fiber orientation close to the junctions of the septum and ventricles were identified. Each substructure was defined and represented using streamlines. The existence of a fiber-bundles in the posterior junction was validated by anatomical dissection. A complex structural organization of the anterior junction in comparison to the posterior junction was evidenced by the high-resolution acquisition. Conclusions A new framework combining cardiac template generation and tractography was applied on the whole sheep heart. The framework can be used for anatomical investigation, characterization of microstructure and visualization of myofiber orientation across samples. Finally, a novel description of the ventricular junction in large mammalian sheep hearts was proposed."
https://openalex.org/W3206919555,"In Fall 2020, several European countries reported rapid increases in COVID-19 cases along with growing estimates of the effective reproduction rates. Such an acceleration in epidemic spread is usually attributed to time-dependent effects, e.g. human travel, seasonal behavioral changes, mutations of the pathogen etc. In this case however the acceleration occurred when counter measures such as testing and contact tracing exceeded their capacity limit. Considering Austria as an example, here we show that this dynamics can be captured by a time-independent, i.e. autonomous , compartmental model that incorporates these capacity limits. In this model, the epidemic acceleration coincides with the exhaustion of mitigation efforts, resulting in an increasing fraction of undetected cases that drive the effective reproduction rate progressively higher. We demonstrate that standard models which does not include this effect necessarily result in a systematic underestimation of the effective reproduction rate."
https://openalex.org/W4285726202,"Do adults of different ages differ in their focus on positive, negative, or neutral information when making decisions? Some research suggests an increasing preference for attending to and remembering positive over negative information with advancing age (i.e., an age-related positivity effect). However, these prior studies have largely neglected the potential role of neutral information. The current set of three studies used a multimethod approach, including self-reports (Study 1), eye tracking and choice among faces reflecting negative, neutral, or positive health-related (Study 2) and leisure-related information (Study 3). Gaze results from Studies 2 and 3 as well as self-reports from Study 1 showed a stronger preference for sources of neutral than for positive or negative information regardless of age. Findings also suggest a general preference for decision-relevant information from neutral compared to positive or negative sources. Focusing exclusively on the difference between positive (happy) and negative (angry) faces, results are in line with the age-related positivity effect (i.e., the difference in gaze duration between happy and angry faces was significantly larger for older than for younger adults). These findings underscore the importance of neutral information across age groups. Thus, most research on the positivity effect may be biased in that it does not consider the strong preference for neutral over positive information."
https://openalex.org/W4285726475,"The important membrane lipid, ceramide, is generated by a family of homologous enzymes, the ceramide synthases (CerSs), multi-spanning membrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Six CerS isoforms exist in mammals with each using a subset of acyl-CoAs for (dihydro)ceramide synthesis. A number of mice have been generated in which one or other CerS has been genetically manipulated, including complete knock-outs, with each displaying phenotypes concomitant with the expression levels of the CerS in question and the presumed biological function of the ceramide species that it generates. We recently described a short C-terminal motif in the CerS which is involved in CerS dimer formation; deleting this motif had no effect on the ability of the CerS to synthesize ceramide in vitro. In the current study, we generated a CerS6 mouse using CRISPR-Cas9, in which the DDRSDIE motif was replaced by ADAAAIA. While levels of CerS6ADAAAIA expression were unaffected in the CerS6ADAAAIA mouse, and CerS6ADAAAIA was able to generate C16-ceramide in vitro, ceramide levels were significantly reduced in the CerS6ADAAAIA mouse, suggesting that replacing this motif affects an as-yet unknown mechanism of regulation of ceramide synthesis via the DDRSDIE motif in vivo. Crossing CerS6ADAAAIA mice with CerS5 null mice led to generation of viable mice in which C16-ceramide levels were reduced by up to 90%, suggesting that depletion of C16-ceramide levels is compensated for by other ceramide species with different acyl chain lengths."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the seismic performance and flexural capacity of precast prestressed efficiently fabricated frame (PPEFF) joints. Reverse cyclic load tests and flexural capacity analysis are conducted. The damage modes, hysteresis curves, skeleton curves, stiffness degradation, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity of five PPEFF joint specimens with different reinforcement rates of the energy-dissipating bars and shear reinforcement are obtained. The results show that the damage pattern of the specimen is ideal, i.e., the plastic hinge region at the end of the beam is severely damaged, whereas the remainder of the beam is slightly damaged. Increasing the reinforcement rate of the energy-consuming steel bars enhances the load capacity, energy dissipation capacity, and initial stiffness of the joint but reduces the ductility performance. The maximum change in ductility was 5.31 for the reinforcement rate of energy-consuming steel bars ranging from 0.38% to 0.59%. In addition, the flexural capacity of the PPEFF joint is evaluated, considering the influence of the shear steel on the yielding and ultimate states. An equation of the flexural capacity is derived. A good agreement is observed between the experimental and calculation results, verifying the correctness of the proposed flexural capacity equation."

It has been shown that its relocalization from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane is crucial to induce early endosomes maturation. In particular, evidences suggest that the N-terminal regulator of chromosome condensation 1 like domain (RLD) is necessary for membrane association thanks to its affinity to phosphoinositides, membrane lipids involved in the regulation of several signaling processes. Interestingly, this domain showed affinity towards phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P], which is highly expressed in endosomes membrane. However, Alsin structure has not been experimentally resolved yet and molecular mechanisms associated with its biological functions are mostly unknown. In this work, Alsin RLD has been investigated through computational molecular modeling techniques to analyze its conformational dynamics and obtain a representative 3D model of this domain. Moreover, a putative phosphoinositide binding site has been proposed and PI(3)P interaction mechanism studied. Results highlight the substantial conformational stability of Alsin RLD secondary structure and suggest the role of one highly flexible region in the phosphoinositides selectivity of this domain."

In Study 1, the objective was to explore changes, difficulties, and concerns experienced by parents of children up to six years old during the pandemic, and related associations with socio-demographic characteristics. Data were collected from 168 parents/carers via an online questionnaire, and examined using conceptual content analysis. The most frequently identified experiences related to restrictions, social isolation, negative impacts on parents' emotional and psychological well-being, negative impacts on children's emotional well-being and development, concerns with physical health, uncertainty about the future, and positive changes regarding family time and activities. Associations were found with parents' age and work situation, and family's income and composition. In Study 2, the objective was to explore the views of children, parents, and service providers about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on families' life, and relevant supports. Data were collected from 50 children aged between eight and 17 years old, 17 parents, and 20 service providers through focus group discussions, and examined using thematic analysis.

https://openalex.org/W4285727397,"Misinformation regarding the cause of an event often continues to influence an individual's event-related reasoning, even after they have received a retraction. This is known as the continued influence effect (CIE). Dominant theoretical models of the CIE have suggested the effect arises primarily from failures to retrieve the correction. However, recent research has implicated information integration and memory updating processes in the CIE. As a behavioural test of integration, we applied an event segmentation approach to the CIE paradigm. Event segmentation theory suggests that incoming information is parsed into distinct events separated by event boundaries, which can have implications for memory. As such, when an individual encodes an event report that contains a retraction, the presence of event boundaries should impair retraction integration and memory updating, resulting in an enhanced CIE. Experiments 1 and 2 employed spatial event segmentation boundaries in an attempt to manipulate the ease with which a retraction can be integrated into a participant's mental event model. While Experiment 1 showed no impact of an event boundary, Experiment 2 yielded evidence that an event boundary resulted in a reduced CIE. To the extent that this finding reflects enhanced retrieval of the retraction relative to the misinformation, it is more in line with retrieval accounts of the CIE."

Pitted erythrocytes correlated with albumin (p = 0.024), bilirubin (p&lt;0.001), international normalized ratio (INR; p = 0.004), model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (p&lt;0.001) and liver stiffness (p = 0.011). Patients with functional hyposplenism had higher MELD scores (median 13 vs. 10; p = 0.021), liver stiffness (46.4 kPa vs. 26.3 kPa; p = 0.011), INR (1.3 vs. 1.2; p = 0.008) and a higher Child-Pugh stage (Child C in 32.1% vs. 11.2%; p = 0.019) as compared to patients without functional hyposplenism. Functional hyposplenism was not associated with the etiology of cirrhosis. Importantly, 9/19 patients with Child C cirrhosis had functional hyposplenism. Conclusion A quarter of patients with liver cirrhosis and almost 50% of patients with Child C cirrhosis have functional hyposplenism. Functional hyposplenism is associated with poor liver function and the degree of portal hypertension, which is characterized by higher liver stiffness measurements in transient elastography."

Even though there are several orthodox medications used for decades in treating malaria effectively, a substantial number of individuals in developing countries are resorting to the use of herbs in the treatment of malaria. The study aim at exploring the practices of herbal management of malaria among trading mothers in Shai Osudoku District, Accra.A qualitative approach with an exploratory, descriptive design was adopted in analyzing the research problem. Purposive sampling technique was used to select twenty (20) participants to partake in a face-face interview, guided by a semi-structured interview guide. The data were transcribed verbatim and analysed by adopting content analysis.Two significant themes and seven subthemes were generated following the analysis of this study. The main themes were; preferences for herbal malaria treatment and the practices and effectiveness of herbal medicine used for malaria treatment. It was worth noting that the women's cultural beliefs did not influence their preference for herbal malaria treatment. The main challenge associated with the herbal malaria treatment was inappropriate dosage specification.This study discovered that several factors influenced participants' preferences for malaria treatment. Participants further listed some traditional ways of treating malaria which implies that there is herbal malaria practice. However, literature in this area is inadequate, and most herbs lack specifications for use. It is therefore recommended that future research focus on scientific herbal malaria treatment. Also, regulating bodies should ensure that quality herbal drugs are sold for consumption."

https://openalex.org/W4285730363,"Lichen Planopilaris (LPP) is a lymphatic disease affecting the scalp that is characterized by a chronic and destructive inflammation process, named as 'cicatricial alopecia' in which the hair follicles are targeted and may involve predominantly lymphocytes or neutrophils. Scalp and biopsy layers have never been used to investigate microbial community composition and its relative taxa abundances in LPP. We sought to examine the significant taxa of this chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease, together with inspect the existing connections with metabolic pathways featuring this microbial community. We used a multilevel analysis based on 16S rRNA marker sequencing in order to detect OTU abundances in pathologic/healthy samples, real time PCR for measuring the levels of IL-23 interleukin expression and urinary metabolomics to find out volatile organic metabolites (VOMs). By using a linear regression model, we described peculiar taxa that significantly differentiated LPP and healthy samples. We inspected taxa abundances and interleukin mRNA levels and the Microbacteriaceae family resulted negatively correlated with the IL-23 expression. Moreover, starting from 16S taxa abundances, we predicted the metabolic pathways featuring this microbial community. By inspecting microbial composition, sample richness, metabolomics profiles and the relative metabolic pathways in a cohort of LPP and healthy samples we deepened the contribution of significant taxa that are connected to inflammation maintenance and microbiota plasticity in LPP pathology."
