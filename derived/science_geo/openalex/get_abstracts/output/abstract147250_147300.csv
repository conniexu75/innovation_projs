https://openalex.org/W2140630012,"In late summer 1999, an outbreak of human encephalitis occurred in the northeastern United States that was concurrent with extensive mortality in crows (Corvus species) as well as the deaths of several exotic birds at a zoological park in the same area. Complete genome sequencing of a flavivirus isolated from the brain of a dead Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), together with partial sequence analysis of envelope glycoprotein (E-glycoprotein) genes amplified from several other species including mosquitoes and two fatal human cases, revealed that West Nile (WN) virus circulated in natural transmission cycles and was responsible for the human disease. Antigenic mapping with E-glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies and E-glycoprotein phylogenetic analysis confirmed these viruses as WN. This North American WN virus was most closely related to a WN virus isolated from a dead goose in Israel in 1998."

Both sexes of alphabeta estrogen receptor knockout (alphabetaERKO) mutants exhibit normal reproductive tract development but are infertile. Ovaries of adult alphabetaERKO females exhibit follicle transdifferentiation to structures resembling seminiferous tubules of the testis, including Sertoli-like cells and expression of Müllerian inhibiting substance, sulfated glycoprotein-2, and Sox9. Therefore, loss of both receptors leads to an ovarian phenotype that is distinct from that of the individual ERKO mutants, which indicates that both receptors are required for the maintenance of germ and somatic cells in the postnatal ovary."
https://openalex.org/W2115650832,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a substantial inflammatory component, and activated microglia may play a central role in neuronal degeneration. CD40 expression was increased on cultured microglia treated with freshly solublized amyloid-beta (Abeta, 500 nanomolar) and on microglia from a transgenic murine model of AD (Tg APPsw). Increased tumor necrosis factor alpha production and induction of neuronal injury occurred when Abeta-stimulated microglia were treated with CD40 ligand (CD40L). Microglia from Tg APPsw mice deficient for CD40L demonstrated reduction in activation, suggesting that the CD40-CD40L interaction is necessary for Abeta-induced microglial activation. Finally, abnormal tau phosphorylation was reduced in Tg APPsw animals deficient for CD40L, suggesting that the CD40-CD40L interaction is an early event in AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1967798978,"The structure of a T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) initiation complex captured transcribing a trinucleotide of RNA from a 17-base pair promoter DNA containing a 5-nucleotide single-strand template extension was determined at a resolution of 2.4 angstroms. Binding of the upstream duplex portion of the promoter occurs in the same manner as that in the open promoter complex, but the single-stranded template is repositioned to place the +4 base at the catalytic active site. Thus, synthesis of RNA in the initiation phase leads to accumulation or ""scrunching"" of the template in the enclosed active site pocket of T7 RNAP. Only three base pairs of heteroduplex are formed before the RNA peels off the template."
https://openalex.org/W2161329181,"West Nile (WN) virus, a mosquito-transmitted virus native to Africa, Asia, and Europe, was isolated from two species of mosquitoes, Culex pipiens and Aedes vexans , and from brain tissues of 28 American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos , and one Cooper's hawk, Accipiter cooperii , in Connecticut. A portion of the genome of virus isolates from four different hosts was sequenced and analyzed by comparative phylogenetic analysis. Our isolates from Connecticut were similar to one another and most closely related to two WN isolates from Romania (2.8 and 3.6 percent difference). If established in North America, WN virus will likely have severe effects on human health and on the health of populations of birds."
https://openalex.org/W2000079492,"The PTEN/MMAC1/TEP (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene at 10q23.3 is mutated in multiple types of sporadic tumors including breast cancers and also in the germline of patients with the Cowden's breast cancer predisposition syndrome. The PTEN gene encodes a multifunctional phosphatase capable of dephosphorylating the same sites in membrane phosphatidylinositols phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K). We demonstrate herein that loss of PTEN function in breast cancer cells results in an increase in basal levels of phosphorylation of multiple components of the P13K signaling cascade as well as an increase in duration of ligand-induced signaling through the P13K cascade. These alterations are reversed by wild-type but not phosphatase inactive PTEN. In the presence of high concentrations of serum, enforced expression of PTEN induces a predominant G1 arrest consistent with the capacity of PTEN to evoke increases in the expression of the p27Kip1 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor. In the presence of low concentrations of serum, enforced PTEN expression results in a marked increase in cellular apoptosis, a finding which is consistent with the capacity of PTEN to alter the phosphorylation, and presumably function, of the AKT, BAD, p70S6 kinase and GSK3 alpha apoptosis regulators. Under anchorage-independent conditions, PTEN also induces anoikis, a form of apoptosis that occurs when cells are dissociated from the extracellular matrix, which is enhanced in conjunction with low serum culture conditions. Together, these data suggest that PTEN effects on the PI3K signaling cascade are influenced by the cell stimulatory context, and that depending on the exposure to growth factors and other exogenous stimuli such as integrin ligation, PTEN can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or anoikis in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1987588414,"This study challenges the use of adult neuropsychological models for explaining developmental disorders of genetic origin. When uneven cognitive profiles are found in childhood or adulthood, it is assumed that such phenotypic outcomes characterize infant starting states, and it has been claimed that modules subserving these abilities start out either intact or impaired. Findings from two experiments with infants with Williams syndrome (a phenotype selected to bolster innate modularity claims) indicate a within-syndrome double dissociation: For numerosity judgments, they do well in infancy but poorly in adulthood, whereas for language, they perform poorly in infancy but well in adulthood. The theoretical and clinical implications of these results could lead to a shift in focus for studies of genetic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2019397682,"Adiabatically rocked electron ratchets, defined by quantum confinement in semiconductor heterostructures, were experimentally studied in a regime where tunneling contributed to the particle flow. The rocking-induced electron flow reverses direction as a function of temperature. This result confirms a recent prediction of fundamentally different behavior of classical versus quantum ratchets. A wave-mechanical model reproduced the temperature-induced current reversal and provides an intuitive explanation."
https://openalex.org/W2068652435,"Recently we found that NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, was linked covalently to human cullin-4A (abbreviated Cul-4A) by a new ubiquitin-related pathway that is analogous to but distinct from the ligating system for SUMO1, another ubiquitin-like protein. However, it remained unknown whether the other five members of the family of human cullin/Cdc53 proteins are modified by NEDD8. Here we report that all Hs-Cul family proteins, such as Cul-1, Cul-2, Cul-3, Cul-4B, and Cul-5, in addition to Cul-4A, were modified by covalent attachment of NEDD8 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Moreover, by comprehensive Northern-blot analyses, we examined multiple tissue distributions of the messages for all Cul-family proteins, NEDD8, and the NEDD8-ligating system consisting of APP-BP1/hUba3, and hUbc12, which function as E1- and E2-like enzymes, respectively. The expressions of Cul-1, Cul-2, and Cul-3 resembled each other and were apparently correlated to those of NEDD8 and the NEDD8-ligating system in various human cells and tissues. However, the mRNA levels of Cul-4A, Cul-4B, and Cul-5 differed considerably from each other as well as from other Cul-family proteins. The enhanced expression of all Cul-family proteins except Cul-5 was observed in a variety of tumor cell lines."

Three-dimensional atom probe techniques were used to image these so-called Cottrell atmospheres directly. Ordered iron-aluminum alloys (40 atomic percent aluminum) doped with boron (400 atomic parts per million) were investigated on an atomic scale along the <001> direction. A boron enrichment was observed in the vicinity of an <001> edge dislocation. The enriched region appeared as a three-dimensional pipe 5 nanometers in diameter, tangent to the dislocation line. The dislocation was found to be boron-enriched by a factor of 50 (2 atomic percent) relative to the bulk. The local boron enrichment is accompanied by a strong aluminum depletion of 20 atomic percent."
https://openalex.org/W2023496336,"Storage and retrieval of excitons were demonstrated with semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots (QDs). The optically generated excitons were dissociated and stored as separated electron-hole pairs in coupled QD pairs. A bias voltage restored the excitons, which recombined radiatively to provide a readout optical signal. The localization of the spatially separated electron-hole pair in QDs was responsible for the ultralong storage times, which were on the order of several seconds. The present limits of this optical storage medium are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1970535781,"The phenomenon of posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), which occurs when a transgene is introduced into a cell, is poorly understood. Here, the qde-3 gene, which is required for the activation and maintenance of gene silencing in the fungus Neurospora crassa, was isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that the qde-3 gene belongs to the RecQ DNA helicase family. The QDE3 protein may function in the DNA-DNA interaction between introduced transgenes or with an endogenous gene required for gene-silencing activation. In animals, genes that are homologous to RecQ protein, such as the human genes for Bloom's syndrome and Werner's syndrome, may also function in PTGS."

A small seed matter wave was created with coherent optical Bragg diffraction. Amplification of this seed matter wave was achieved by using the initial condensate as a gain medium through the superradiance effect. The coherence properties of the amplified matter wave, studied with a matter-wave interferometer, were shown to be locked to those of the initial seed wave. The active matter-wave device demonstrated here has great potential in the fields of atom optics, atom lithography, and precision measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2048139253,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein activates many viral and cellular genes in trans and functional disruption of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product occurs when X protein is transiently expressed in the cytoplasm of cultured cells. We have carried out investigations to determine the exact location of X protein in X gene transfected cells by using a fluorescent staining technique as well as by biochemical analyses. Aggregation of mitochondrial structures became evident at the periphery of nucleus in the cytoplasm of X transfected cells. X protein was found associated with the aggregated mitochondrial structures. Furthermore, transiently expressed p53 protein co-localized with X protein in X transfected cells. However, the appearance of aggregated mitochondrial structures at the nuclear periphery was independent of the presence of p53 protein in X transfected cells. X protein expression also caused an appearance of TUNEL positive nucleus, cytochrome c release from mitochondrial, the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and the membrane blebbing of X transfected cells, which are characteristic of cell death. Our data suggest that X protein causes an abnormal aggregation of mitochondrial structures in the cell, which may be eventually connected with cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2022842289,"Ribosome recycling factor (RRF), together with elongation factor G (EF-G), catalyzes recycling of ribosomes after one round of protein synthesis. The crystal structure of RRF was determined at 2.55 angstrom resolution. The protein has an unusual fold where domain I is a long three-helix bundle and domain II is a three-layer beta/alpha/beta sandwich. The molecule superimposes almost perfectly with a transfer RNA (tRNA) except that the amino acid-binding 3' end is missing. The mimicry suggests that RRF interacts with the posttermination ribosomal complex in a similar manner to a tRNA, leading to disassembly of the complex. The structural arrangement of this mimicry is entirely different from that of other cases of less pronounced mimicry of tRNA so far described."
https://openalex.org/W2031184810,"The SGS1 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a DNA helicase with homology to the human Bloom's syndrome gene BLM and the Werner's syndrome gene WRN . The SRS2 gene of yeast also encodes a DNA helicase. Simultaneous deletion of SGS1 and SRS2 is lethal in yeast. Here, using a conditional mutation of SGS1 , it is shown that DNA replication and RNA polymerase I transcription are drastically inhibited in the srs2 Δ sgs1-ts strain at the restrictive temperature. Thus, SGS1 and SRS2 function in DNA replication and RNA polymerase I transcription. These functions may contribute to the various defects observed in Werner's and Bloom's syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W1996105881,"Dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases are a burgeoning family of enzymes, some of which, the MKPs, are implicated in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. MKPs have been shown to reverse the activation of the MAP kinases by hydrolyzing phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues present in the substrates. Here we describe the characterization of a novel member of the MKP family, MKP5. The MKP5 gene, which maps to human chromosome 1q32, is expressed tissue-specifically as two transcripts of approximately 3.4 and 2.4 kb in human liver and skeletal muscle. When expressed in mammalian cells, MKP5 blocks the enzymatic activation of MAP kinases with the selectivity p38 approximately JNK/SAPK >> ERK. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous MAP kinases by the catalytically inactive transfected MKP5 demonstrates that it preferentially binds to the p38 and JNK/SAPK kinases. These findings suggest that the selectivity of this phosphatase may be determined at least in part at the level of substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1988714320,"Cadherins are major cell – cell adhesion molecules in both tumor and normal tissues. Although serum levels of soluble E-cadherin have been shown to be higher in the cancer patients than in healthy volunteers, the detail mechanism regulating release of soluble E-cadherin remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the ectodomain of E-cadherin is proteolytically cleaved from some cancer cells by a membrane-bound metalloprotease to yield soluble form, and the residual membrane-tethered cleavage product is subsequently degraded by intracellular proteolytic pathway. Futhermore, we show that extracellular calcium influx, that is induced by mechanical scraping of cells or ionomycin treatment, enhances the metalloprotease-mediated E-cadherin cleavage and the subsequent degradation of the cytoplasmic domain. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrates that the sequential proteolysis of E-cadherin triggered by the calcium influx results in translocation of β-catenin from the cell – cell contacts to cytoplasm. Our data suggest that calcium influx-induced proteolysis of E-cadherin not only disrupts the cell – cell adhesion but also activates β-catenin-mediated intracellular signaling pathway, potentially leading to alterations in motility and proliferation activity of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087202652,"Colloidal particles can form unexpected two-dimensional ordered colloidal crystals when they interact with surfactants of the opposite charge. Coulomb interactions lead to self-limited adsorption of the particles on the surface of vesicles formed by the surfactants. The adsorbed particles form ordered but fluid rafts on the vesicle surfaces, and these ultimately form robust two-dimensional crystals. This use of attractive Coulomb interaction between colloidal particles and surfactant structures offers a potential new route to self-assembly of ordered colloidal structures."

Comparison with highly related progesterone and Diels-Alderase antibodies that arose from the same primordial germ line template shows the relatively subtle mutational steps that were able to evolve both structural complementarity and catalytic efficiency.

To divert grains out of the 2- to 4-astronomical unit region, the solar radiation pressure must be 1.4 to 1.8 times the force of solar gravity. These figures are consistent with the optical properties of spherical or elongated grains that consist of astronomical silicates or organic refractory material. Pure graphite grains with diameters of 0.2 to 0.4 micrometer experience a solar radiation pressure force as much as twice the force of solar gravity."
https://openalex.org/W2322768926,"Oncogenic variants of the cellular Ras protein are often associated with different types of human cancers. However, the mechanisms by which oncogenic Ras induces transformation are not fully established. Expression of the transcriptional repressor Par-4 was down-regulated by oncogenic Ras via the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Restoration of Par-4 levels by abrogation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway with the MEK-inhibitor PD98059 or by ectopic Par-4, that acted to inhibit ERK expression and activation, was sufficient to suppress oncogenic Ras-induced transformation. These findings identify Par-4 as a novel target that has to be down-modulated by oncogenic Ras for successful transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2077389876,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by a block in myeloid cell differentiation. As a result of a chromosomal translocation in these patients, the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML is disrupted as are the nuclear bodies it forms. Disruption of PML and PML nuclear bodies in APL is linked to a loss of growth control and subsequent leukemogenesis. PML contains a zinc-binding domain known as the RING which is required for formation of these bodies. Using yeast 2-hybrid techniques, we found that PML and a related RING protein, Z, bind the proline rich homeodomain protein (PRH) through their RING domains. Previous reports indicate that PRH functions in hematopoiesis and may act as a transcriptional repressor. Our data indicate that PML and Z both bind the repressor domain of PRH and are the first protein partners reported for PRH. We observe that PRH has a punctate pattern in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and in the APL cell line, NB4. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies indicate that PML and PRH interact in both cell lines. The effect on cell growth by PML and the hematopoietic actions of PRH raises the possibility that the interaction between PML and PRH represents a link between growth control and hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2322407842,"The effects of antagonists of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) on the growth of human malignant glioblastoma cell line U-87MG xenografted into nude mice were evaluated. Nude mice bearing s.c. implanted U-87MG tumors were treated with bombesin/GRP antagonists RC-3095 and RC-3940-II. RC-3095 and RC-3940-II administered s.c. at a dose of 20 micrograms/day for 4 weeks decreased the volume of U-87MG xenografts by 60 and 74%, respectively, compared with controls. RT-PCR analysis showed that U-87MG xenografts expressed mRNA for bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-1 (GRP receptor) and BRS-2 (neuromedin-B receptor), but the mRNA for GRP ligand was not detected in U-87MG cells suggesting that GRP may stimulate the growth of U-87MG glioblastomas by a paracrine mechanism. The levels of mRNA for c-fos oncogene were decreased by 30-40% in U-87MG tumors treated with RC-3095 or RC-3940-II. In U-373MG glioblastoma cells, which also express BRS-1, and U-87MG cells, cultured in vitro, GRP(14-27) induced the expression of c-fos mRNA, and some c-jun mRNA, in a time-dependent manner with the maximal effect occurring 2 h after the stimulation and a return to basal levels after 8 h. Antagonist RC-3940-II inhibited the stimulation of c-fos by GRP(14-27). Our results indicate that antagonists of bombesin/GRP inhibit the growth of U-87MG glioblastomas by a mechanism that may involve the downregulation of c-fos oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1973444064,"Proteins containing formin homology domains, FH1 and FH2, are involved in cytokinesis or establishment of cell polarity in a variety of organisms. Bni1p and Bnr1p are FH proteins and potential targets of the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins in S. cerevisiae. We have shown that Bnr1p is localized at the bud neck to interact with Hof1p, involved in cytokinesis. We report here that the overexpression of BNR1 causes a cytokinesis deficiency which is similar to the phenotypes of the septin mutants, including cdc3, cdc10, cdc11, and cdc12. The region required for the septin mutant phenotypes was mapped to Bnr1p (35-500), which coincided with the region required for the bud-neck localization. To further isolate a gene interacting with BNI1 or BNR1, a multicopy suppressor of the bni1 bnr1 mutant was isolated. This gene encoded Smy1p, a kinesin-related protein. Bnr1p, but not Bni1p, directly interacted with the C-terminal region of Smy1p. The Smy1p-interacting region of Bnr1p was mapped to a region containing the FH2 domain. Bnr1p also directly interacted with Bud6p, a novel actin-binding protein. Bnr1p is thus a multifunctional protein which interacts with the septin system, a microtubule-dependent motor protein, and the actin system, to regulate cytoskeletal functions in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2330138367,"We previously reported the presence of mitotic checkpoint impairment in about 40% of lung cancer cell lines. To gain an insight into the molecular basis of this impairment, we examined 49 lung cancer specimens for alterations in the hMAD1 mitotic checkpoint gene and identified a somatic, non-conservative missense mutation, which substitutes alanine (GCG) for threonine (ACG) at codon 299, together with a number of amino acid substituting, single nucleotide polymorphisms. This is the first demonstration of hMAD1 mutation in any type of human cancers. The present finding marks hMAD1 as a potential target, although with low frequency, for genetic alterations in lung cancer. Thus, further studies of hMAD1 dysfunction caused by other mechanisms appear to be warranted, as well as potential involvement of other components of the mitotic checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2330552300,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase and a major phosphotyrosine-containing protein. FAK is found in cell-matrix attachment sites (focal adhesions), and is activated on integrin-ligand binding and by other signaling pathways. Several roles have been proposed for FAK; here we report a novel function. We observed abundant FAK protein in all human melanoma cell lines tested except COLO839, a line that grows predominantly in suspension and was derived from peripheral blood. Five adherent lines, isolated from solid metastases in the same patient as COLO839, did express FAK. We derived four adherent sublines from COLO839. These did express FAK, even when plated on bacteriological plastic, to which they did not adhere. Thus, substrate attachment was not required for FAK expression. Three of the adherent sublines were then grown in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides to the initial FAK coding sequence. All showed substantially reduced FAK expression and, interestingly, the cells largely detached from the substrate while continuing to grow. Similar results were obtained with an independent melanoma line, DX3. Thus, FAK expression appears to be required by melanoma cells for substrate adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2095310460,"CD27, a member of the TNFR family known to provide essential co-stimulatory signals for T cell growth and B cell Ig synthesis, can also mediate cell death. Using the CD27 cytoplasmic tail as the bait in yeast two hybrid assay, we previously cloned human Siva, a pro-apoptotic molecule. Here we report the characterization of the mouse Siva gene as a 4 kb sequence containing 4 exons and 3 introns. RT-PCR has revealed the presence of two forms of mouse Siva mRNA, the longer full length form Siva-1 and the shorter Siva-2 lacking the sequence coded by exon 2. Immunoblotting with anti-Siva (human) antibodies clearly demonstrate the presence of both Siva-1 and Siva-2. Cotransfection experiments in 293T cells reveal that mouse CD27 receptor can interact with both forms of Siva. Although mouse Siva-1 can trigger apoptosis in Rat-1 cells and in some of the mouse cell lines in transient transfection experiments, similar to the observation made with human Siva, intriguingly its alternate splice form, Siva-2 appears to be much less toxic. It is therefore likely that Siva-2 could regulate the function of Siva-1."

https://openalex.org/W2056298578,"SIAH-1, the human homologue of the drosophila seven in absentia gene, is a p53-p21Waf-1 inducible gene. We report that stable transfection with SIAH-1 of the epithelial breast cancer cell line MCF-7 blocks its growth process. The transfectants show a redistribution of SIAH-1 protein within the nucleus, more specifically to the nuclear matrix, associated to dramatic changes in cell morphology and defective mitosis. Multinucleated giant cells (2 – 12 nuclei in more than 50% cells) were a most striking observation associated with tubulin spindle disorganization and defective cytokinesis. There were also present at high frequency abortive mitotic figures, DNA bridges and persistance of intercellular bridges and midbodies, along with an increased expression of p21Waf-1. These results indicate that the mechanism of growth arrest induced by SIAH-1 in MCF-7 cells involves disorganization of the mitotic program, mainly during nuclei separation and cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W1997577055,"The t(5;12) translocation, associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, generates a novel gene encoding a protein, TEL-PDGF beta R, composed of the 154 amino-terminal amino acids of the transcription factor TEL and the transmembrane and intracellular part of the PDGF beta-receptor (PDGF beta R). TEL also occurs as a tumor-associated fusion partner for the tyrosine kinases c-ABL, JAK2 and TRK-C. Previous studies have demonstrated growth promoting activity of TEL-PDGF beta R and also indicated that the TEL moiety activates the tyrosine kinase of the PDGF beta R through the formation of TEL-PDGF beta R oligomers. We demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the fusion protein can be attenuated through overexpression of the TEL part of TEL-PDGF beta R, suggesting a strategy for antagonizing the signaling of TEL-PDGF beta R, and other TEL-fusion proteins containing tyrosine kinase domains. Comparison of BaF/3 cell lines expressing TEL-PDGF beta R and ligand-stimulated PDGF beta R revealed that only TEL-PDGF beta R expression conferred IL-3-independent growth, suggesting differences in signaling capacity of the two proteins. Finally, tyrosine residues 17 and 27 in TEL-PDGF beta R was identified as autophosphorylation sites in TEL-PDGF beta R."

https://openalex.org/W2335117622,"γ-Heregulin was identified as an isoform resulting from alternate splicing of the neuregulin-1 gene, after cloning of its cDNA from the MDA-MB-175 breast cancer cell line. γ-Heregulin was shown to promote growth of cultured MDA-MB-175 cells resulting from activation of its cognate ErbB tyrosine kinase reporters. We show here that γ-heregulin is transcribed from a fusion gene resulting from a chromosome translocation in MDA-MB-175 cells. The fusion chromosome is described as dic(8:11)(8qter→8p12::11q13→11pter). As a result, the 5′ end of the γ-heregulin gene is derived from the stress-induced gene, DOC-4 (11q13), while the 3′ end is from the neuregulin-1 gene (8p12). Thus, expression of γ-heregulin is under the control of the DOC-4 promoter. By contrast with MDA-MB-175 cells, RT – PCR failed to detect a γ-heregulin transcript in either E9.5 to E13.5 embryonic mouse tissues, adult mouse tissues or other human tumour cell lines. We conclude, therefore, that γ-heregulin is not a native isoform of the neuregulin-1 gene, but a novel growth factor that may contribute to tumour cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2022788823,"We previously reported that `high risk' human papillomaviruses (HPV) induce genetic instability in human oral keratinocytes. To understand the mechanisms of HPV-induced genetic instability, we determined the nucleotide excision repair (NER) capacity of normal (NHOK) and human papillomavirus type-16 immortalized oral keratinocytes (HOK-16B) by strand-specific removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) from a 16 Kb fragment of the p53 gene. In NHOK the NER activity was initiated in both DNA strands immediately, although the process in the non-transcribed strand was notably slower than that of the transcribed strand. In HOK-16B cells the initiation of CPDs removal was delayed for at least 8 h in both DNA strands, and the process was significantly slower than that in NHOK. UV-irradiation enhanced the p53 protein level more than 30-fold in NHOK, but it did not significantly alter the protein level in the HOK-16B cells. UV-irradiation also increased the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein level only in NHOK. These data indicate that `high risk' HPV induces genetic instability by impairing NER capacity of cells. Impaired NER activity of HOK-16B cells may be implicated with their inability to enhance active p53 when challenged by genotoxic stress."

RNA binding is inhibited by zinc (Zn2+) and stimulated by Escherichia coli NusA. To study these interactions, the Nun carboxyl terminus was extended by a cysteine residue conjugated to a photochemical cross-linker. The carboxyl terminus contacted NusA and made Zn2+-dependent intramolecular contacts. When Nun was added to a paused transcription elongation complex, it cross-linked to the DNA template. Nun may arrest transcription by anchoring RNAP to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2328557020,"Topoisomerase II alpha (topo II alpha) is a major target of antitumor treatments. In an effort to determine why this protein might be a better target in tumor cells than in normal cells, we attempted to determine if the altered proliferative signaling in a tumor cell might effect the levels of expression of the topo II alpha gene. In support of this idea, it was found that topo II alpha was elevated following microinjection of oncogenic Ras protein. Oncogenic ras was further shown to stimulate the topo II alpha promoter. Stimulation by ras was independent of the normal cell cycle regulation of this promoter. Transactivation of topo II alpha by ras required both the MEK/ERK pathway, and the stress-associated protein kinase (SAPK) signaling pathway. As a direct confirmation that both ERK and SAPK were involved in topo II alpha regulation, a constitutively active MEKK that stimulates these two kinases simultaneously was shown to strongly induce topo II alpha promoter activity. Activation of either pathway alone, on the other hand, only slightly stimulated the topo II alpha promoter. Deletion analyses showed that elements near both the 5' and 3' ends of the promoter were responsible for the ras stimulation. Site-directed mutagenesis further demonstrated that an Ets-like binding site near the 5' end (-480 to -475) was one of the responsive elements. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the direct role of Ras signaling in stimulation of topo II alpha expression, and thereby establish a link between the action of a common tumor mutation and the target of multiple anti-tumor reagents."

https://openalex.org/W2317322219,"The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) oncogene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is selectively expressed in the Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells of EBV-associated Hodgkin's disease (HD). However, no differences in clinical presentation and course are found between EBV positive and EBV negative forms of HD suggesting a common pathogenetic mechanism. We have studied the LMP1 associated signaling pathways and their dominant negative inhibition in the myelomonocytic HD-MyZ and the B-lymphoid L-428 HD cell lines. In both EBV negative cell lines expression of LMP1 is associated with the formation of multinuclear RS cells. Dominant negative inhibition of NF-kappa B mediated signaling at the step of I kappa B-alpha phosphorylation results in increased cell death with only a few typical RS cells resistant to overexpression of the dominant negative inhibitor I kappa B-alpha-N delta 54. However, dominant negative inhibition of NF-kappa B mediated signaling at the early step of TRAF2 interaction results in the formation of multinuclear cells in both cell lines and, in addition, in clusters of small mononuclear cells in the HD-MyZ cell line. In HD-MyZ cells overexpression of the powerful JBD-inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway is restricted to small cells and never observed in RS cells. These small cells undergo apoptosis as shown by the TUNEL technique. Apoptosis of small cells is still observed after co-transfection of JBD and LMP1 but in addition a few apoptotic HD-MyZ cells with large fused nuclear masses are identified suggesting that specific inhibition of JNK leads also to apoptosis of LMP1 induced RS cells. Thus, activation of the JNK signaling pathway is also important in the formation of Reed-Sternberg cells. Our findings are consistent with a model where all three LMP1 associated functions, i.e. NF-kappa B mediated transcription, TRAF2 dependent signaling, and c-Jun activation act as a common pathogenetic denominator of both EBV negative and EBV positive HD."

In this report, we examined the role of JNK in LLnL-induced S phase checkpoint by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1 (JNK1-APF) in Calu-1 cells. Expression of high levels of JNK1-APF blocked the growth-inhibitory effects of LLnL and abrogated S phase arrest induced by LLnL. These results support the role of JNK in the activation of cell cycle checkpoint induced by LLnL."
https://openalex.org/W2330751016,"The mdm2 protein interacts with a number of proteins involved in cell growth control. Such interactions favour cell proliferation and may explain the oncogenic potential of mdm2 when over-expressed in cells. Interaction with the tumour suppressor p53 involves the N-terminus of mdm2 and targets p53 for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin pathway. We now describe a novel, highly conserved exon of mdm2 (exon α) which includes an in-frame UGA stop codon. Expression of exon α disrupts in vitro translation of the p53 binding domain of mdm2. We propose that exon α induces translation re-initiation at an internal AUG codon within the mdm2α mRNA isoform. The putative mdm2α protein lacks the N-terminus of mdm2 and shows little, if any, binding capacity for p53. Mdm2α mRNA is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is observed predominantly in testis and peripheral blood lymphocytes. We propose that mdm2α expression may provide a mechanism for uncoupling mdm2-p53 interaction in certain cell types and/or under specific conditions of cell growth."

Retrograde reaction-enhanced permeability assisted influx of meteoric-hydrothermal fluids into the deep-seated anorthosite. Isotopic gradients of about 14 per mil over 600 micrometers in single crystals require short-lived (about 10(4) years) diffusional exchange of oxygen and locally large effective water:rock ratios, followed by rapid loss of water and cessation of oxygen diffusion in the anorthosite."
https://openalex.org/W2323234088,"Muscle founder cells are uniquely specified cells that fuse with neighboring myoblasts to generate the complex pattern of body wall muscles in the Drosophila embryo. We have investigated the positional specification of founder cells for ventral oblique muscles, marked by the restricted expression of tinman RNA and the activity of a D-mef2 enhancer. The formation of these ventral myoblasts requires the function of the Heartless FGF receptor in the mesoderm and the presence of ventral neuroblasts in the central nervous system. Overproduction of ventral neuroblasts due to the forced expression of the homeodomain protein Vnd leads to increased numbers of founder cells. These results suggest the use of a neuroectoderm-to-mesoderm signaling pathway in the specification of ventral muscle precursors."
