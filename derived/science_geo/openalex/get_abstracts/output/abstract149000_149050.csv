https://openalex.org/W2025922492,"To elucidate the role of the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein in neurodegenerative disorders, transgenic mice expressing wild-type human alpha-synuclein were generated. Neuronal expression of human alpha-synuclein resulted in progressive accumulation of alpha-synuclein-and ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions in neurons in the neocortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra. Ultrastructural analysis revealed both electron-dense intranuclear deposits and cytoplasmic inclusions. These alterations were associated with loss of dopaminergic terminals in the basal ganglia and with motor impairments. These results suggest that accumulation of wild-type alpha-synuclein may play a causal role in Parkinson's disease and related conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2058670155,"Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing."
https://openalex.org/W1977685900,"The invariant properties of human cortical neurons cannot be studied directly by fMRI due to its limited spatial resolution. Here, we circumvented this limitation by using fMR adaptation, namely, reduction of the fMR signal due to repeated presentation of identical images. Object-selective regions (lateral occipital complex [LOC]) showed a monotonic signal decrease as repetition frequency increased. The invariant properties of fMR adaptation were studied by presenting the same object in different viewing conditions. LOC exhibited stronger fMR adaptation to changes in size and position (more invariance) compared to illumination and viewpoint. The effect revealed two putative subdivisions within LOC: caudal-dorsal (LO), which exhibited substantial recovery from adaptation under all transformations, and posterior fusiform (PF/LOa), which displayed stronger adaptation. This study demonstrates the utility of fMR adaptation for revealing functional characteristics of neurons in fMRI studies."

https://openalex.org/W2096594220,"Steroid receptors bind to site-specific response elements in chromatin and modulate gene expression in a hormone-dependent fashion. With the use of a tandem array of mouse mammary tumor virus reporter elements and a form of glucocorticoid receptor labeled with green fluorescent protein, targeting of the receptor to response elements in live mouse cells was observed. Photobleaching experiments provide direct evidence that the hormone-occupied receptor undergoes rapid exchange between chromatin and the nucleoplasmic compartment. Thus, the interaction of regulatory proteins with target sites in chromatin is a more dynamic process than previously believed."
https://openalex.org/W2083441835,"Repetition priming has been characterized neurophysiologically as a decreased response following stimulus repetition. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether this repetition-related response is sensitive to stimulus familiarity. A right fusiform region exhibited an attenuated response to the repetition of familiar stimuli, both faces and symbols, but exhibited an enhanced response to the repetition of unfamiliar stimuli. Moreover, both repetition effects were modulated by lag between successive presentations. Further experiments replicated the interactions between repetition, familiarity, and lag and demonstrated the persistence of these effects over multiple repetitions. Priming-related responses are therefore not unitary but depend on the presence or absence of preexisting stimulus representations."
https://openalex.org/W2021631954,"Energy stores are held relatively constant in many mammals. The circuitry necessary for maintaining energy homeostasis should (1) sense the amount of energy stored in adipose tissue, (2) sense and integrate the multiple opposing signals regarding nutritional state, and (3) provide output regulating energy intake and expenditure to maintain energy homeostasis. We demonstrate that individual neurons within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) are capable of detection and integration of orexigenic (neuropeptide Y [NPY]) and anorexigenic (melanocortin) signals, that NPY and melanocortins are functional antagonists of each other within the PVH in the regulation of feeding behavior, and that melanocortin administration within the PVH regulates both feeding behavior and energy expenditure. These data provide a cellular basis for the adipostat within neurons in the PVH that appear to be jointly regulated by NPY- and melanocortin-responsive neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1973556415,"There is great interest in discovering new targets for pain therapy since current methods of analgesia are often only partially successful. Although protein kinase C (PKC) enhances nociceptor function, it is not known which PKC isozymes contribute. Here, we show that epinephrine-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and acetic acid-associated hyperalgesia are markedly attenuated in PKCepsilon mutant mice, but baseline nociceptive thresholds are normal. Moreover, epinephrine-, carrageenan-, and nerve growth factor- (NGF-) induced hyperalgesia in normal rats, and epinephrine-induced enhancement of tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ current (TTX-R I(Na)) in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, are inhibited by a PKCepsilon-selective inhibitor peptide. Our findings indicate that PKCepsilon regulates nociceptor function and suggest that PKCepsilon inhibitors could prove useful in the treatment of pain."
https://openalex.org/W2094109627,"Gene targeting was used to delete exon 2 of mouse DOR-1, which encodes the δ opioid receptor. Essentially all 3H-[D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (3H-DPDPE) and 3H-[D-Ala2,D-Glu4]deltorphin (3H-deltorphin-2) binding is absent from mutant mice, demonstrating that DOR-1 encodes both δ1 and δ2 receptor subtypes. Homozygous mutant mice display markedly reduced spinal δ analgesia, but peptide δ agonists retain supraspinal analgesic potency that is only partially antagonized by naltrindole. Retained DPDPE analgesia is also demonstrated upon formalin testing, while the nonpeptide δ agonist BW373U69 exhibits enhanced activity in DOR-1 mutant mice. Together, these findings suggest the existence of a second delta-like analgesic system. FinallyDOR-1 mutant mice do not develop analgesic tolerance to morphine, genetically demonstrating a central role for DOR-1 in this process."

https://openalex.org/W2010042337,"Accelerated telomere loss has been proposed to be a factor leading to end-stage organ failure in chronic diseases of high cellular turnover such as liver cirrhosis. To test this hypothesis directly, telomerase-deficient mice, null for the essential telomerase RNA (mTR) gene, were subjected to genetic, surgical, and chemical ablation of the liver. Telomere dysfunction was associated with defects in liver regeneration and accelerated the development of liver cirrhosis in response to chronic liver injury. Adenoviral delivery of mTR into the livers of mTR(-/-) mice with short dysfunctional telomeres restored telomerase activity and telomere function, alleviated cirrhotic pathology, and improved liver function. These studies indicate that telomere dysfunction contributes to chronic diseases of continual cellular loss-replacement and encourage the evaluation of ""telomerase therapy"" for such diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2144810130,"Functional neuroimaging was used to investigate three factors that affect reading performance: first, whether a stimulus is a word or pronounceable non-word (lexicality), second, how often a word is encountered (frequency), and third, whether the pronunciation has a predictable spelling-to-sound correspondence (consistency). Comparisons between word naming (reading) and visual fixation scans revealed stimulus-related activation differences in seven regions. A left frontal region showed effects of consistency and lexicality, indicating a role in orthographic to phonological transformation. Motor cortex showed an effect of consistency bilaterally, suggesting that motoric processes beyond high-level representations of word phonology influence reading performance. Implications for the integration of these results into theoretical models of word reading are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2091287207,"We show that a thermosensitive splicing event in the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA from the period (per) gene plays an important role in how a circadian clock in Drosophila adapts to seasonally cold days (low temperatures and short day lengths). The enhanced splicing of this intron at low temperatures advances the steady state phases of the per mRNA and protein cycles, events that significantly contribute to the preferential daytime activity of flies on cold days. Because the accumulation of PER is also dependent on the photosensitive TIMELESS (TIM) protein, long photoperiods partially counteract the cold-induced advances in the oscillatory mechanism by delaying the daily increases in the levels of TIM. Our findings also indicate that there is a temperature-dependent switch in the molecular logic governing cycles in per mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1996990492,"A steady progression of motor dysfunction takes place in Huntington's disease (HD). The origin of this disturbance with relation to the motor control process is not understood. Here we studied reaching movements in asymptomatic HD gene-carriers (AGCs) and subjects with manifest HD. We found that movement jerkiness, which characterizes the smoothness and efficiency of motion, was a sensitive indicator of presymptomatic HD progression. A large fraction of AGCs displayed elevated jerk even when more than seven years remained until predicted disease onset. Movement termination was disturbed much more than initiation and was highly variable from trial to trial. Analysis of this variability revealed that the sensitivity of end-movement jerk to subtle, self-generated early-movement errors was greater in HD subjects than in controls. Additionally, we found that HD corrective responses to externally-generated force pulses were greatly disturbed, indicating that HD subjects display aberrant responses to both external and self-generated errors. Because feedback corrections are driven by error and are delayed such that they predominantly affect movement termination, these findings suggest that a dysfunction in error correction characterizes the motor control deficit in early HD. This dysfunction may be observed years before clinical disease onset and grows worse as the disease progresses."
https://openalex.org/W1968399538,"Nonvoltage-gated cation currents, which are activated following stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC), appear to be major modes for Ca2+ and Na+ entry in mammalian cells. The TRPC channels may mediate some of these conductances since their expression in vitro leads to PLC-dependent cation influx. We found that the TRPC3 protein was highly enriched in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). The temporal and spatial distribution of TRPC3 paralleled that of the neurotrophin receptor TrkB. Activation of TrkB by brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) led to production of a PLC-dependent, nonselective cation conductance in pontine neurons. Evidence is provided that TRPC3 contributes to this current in vivo. Thus, activation of TrkB and PLC leads to a TRPC3-dependent cation influx in CNS neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2162081980,"It has been suggested that as much as 90% of the discharge from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is drained through a small number of fast-moving ice streams and outlet glaciers fed by relatively stable and inactive catchment areas. Here, evidence obtained from balance velocity estimates suggests that each major drainage basin is fed by complex systems of tributaries that penetrate up to 1000 kilometers from the grounding line into the interior of the ice sheet. This finding has important consequences for the modeled or estimated dynamic response time of past and present ice sheets to climate forcing."
https://openalex.org/W2129501023,"Because of a critical shortage in suitable organs, many patients with terminal liver disease die each year before liver transplantation can be performed. Transplantation of isolated hepatocytes has been proposed for the temporary metabolic support of patients awaiting liver transplantation or spontaneous reversion of their liver disease. A major limitation of this form of therapy is the present inability to isolate an adequate number of transplantable hepatocytes. A highly differentiated cell line, NKNT-3, was generated by retroviral transfer in normal primary adult human hepatocytes of an immortalizing gene that can be subsequently and completely excised by Cre/Lox site-specific recombination. When transplanted into the spleen of rats under transient immunosuppression, reversibly immortalized NKNT-3 cells provided life-saving metabolic support during acute liver failure induced by 90% hepatectomy."
https://openalex.org/W1999679029,"Endophilin/SH3p4 is a protein highly enriched in nerve terminals that binds the GTPase dynamin and the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin, two proteins implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. We show here that antibody-mediated disruption of endophilin function in a tonically stimulated synapse leads to a block in the invagination of clathrin-coated pits adjacent to the active zone and therefore to a block of synaptic vesicle recycling. We also show that in a cell-free system, endophilin is not associated with clathrin coats and is a functional partner of dynamin. Our findings suggest that endophilin is part of a biochemical machinery that acts in trans to the clathrin coat from early stages to vesicle fission."

https://openalex.org/W1977925481,"We show that serotonin inhibits synaptic transmission at C. elegans neuromuscular junctions, and we describe a signaling pathway that mediates this effect. Release of acetylcholine from motor neurons was assayed by measuring the sensitivity of intact animals to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb. By this assay, exogenous serotonin inhibited acetylcholine release, whereas serotonin antagonists stimulated release. The effects of serotonin on synaptic transmission were mediated by GOA-1 (a Gαo subunit) and DGK-1 (a diacylglycerol [DAG] kinase), both of which act in the ventral cord motor neurons. Mutants lacking goa-1 Gαo accumulated abnormally high levels of the DAG-binding protein UNC-13 at motor neuron nerve terminals, suggesting that serotonin inhibits synaptic transmission by decreasing the abundance of UNC-13 at release sites."

https://openalex.org/W1969529608,"The binding problem, or constellation of problems, concerns our capacity to integrate information across time, space, attributes, and ideas. The goal of research in this area is to understand how we can respond to relations within relevant subsets of the world but not to relations between arbitrarily selected parts or properties. Language comprehension and thinking critically depend on correct binding of syntactic and semantic structures. Binding is required when we select an action to perform in a particular context. We must, for example, reach in the right direction, lift the glass with the correct muscle tension, and drink the water it contains rather than eat or inhale it. The mediating “event file” binds stimulus to response (Hommel, 1998; Shadlen and Movshon, 1999 [this issue of Neuron]). The most extensive discussion so far has focused on the problem of binding in visual perception. How does the brain segregate the correct sensory data to represent the objects that are actually present and not some illusory recombinations of their features? In considering perceptual binding, it is important to note that “seeing” an object is not the same as identifying it (268Kahneman D. Treisman A. Gibbs B. The reviewing of object files object-specific integration of information.Cogn. Psychol. 1992; 24: 175-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 613Treisman A. Perceiving and reperceiving objects.Am. Psychol. 1992; 47 (a): 862-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 621Treisman A. Kanwisher N.K. Perceiving visually-presented objects recognition, awareness, and modularity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To generate a perceptual experience and to be able to act on it, we need to specify the current details of how an object looks, where it is, how it is oriented, and many other often arbitrary details of its current instantiation. Thus we must construct a temporary token (“object file”) that binds together these current features with the more permanent identifying characteristics of its type. The present papers have dealt mostly with this perceptual version of the binding problem, although many ideas can apply more broadly to binding at all levels. Why should a binding problem arise in vision, both for the brain and for the scientist attempting to understand it? A number of factors could contribute to create binding failures in vision. One is that various properties of objects appear to be separately analyzed by specialized subsystems. Thus, while information from the same location is implicitly bound by the cells that respond to it initially (allowing the selective adaptation to conjunctions of features described by McCollough, 1965; see also Wolfe and Cave, 1999 [this issue of Neuron]), at later stages the information from these cells appears to be routed to different neural populations, forming a distributed representation of an object's different properties. Another is that receptive fields at higher levels are large enough to generalize across a wide range of locations. Because visual scenes typically contain multiple objects, the question of which features belong to which objects could frequently arise. To aggravate the problem, different parts of a single object occupy different locations, and there may be occluding objects that break their continuity. Coarse coding of different stimulus dimensions also creates representations that may depend on ratios of activity in neurons with different but overlapping tuning. Whenever the perceptual representations of simultaneously present objects depend on distributed patterns of firing in populations of cells, the risk of superposition ambiguities within the same neural network will arise, creating a need to identify and to signal which units belong to the same representation. For any case of binding, the binding problem can actually be dissected into three separable problems. Different theories have focused primarily on one of the three. (1) Parsing. How are the relevant elements to bind as a single entity selected and segregated from those belonging to other objects, ideas, or events? (2) Encoding. How is the binding encoded so that it can be signaled to other brain systems and used? (3) Structural description. How are the correct relations specified between the bound elements within a single object? The second and third operations are not necessarily sequential, and in fact some models combine all three as part of the same process. I will discuss each of these three aspects of the binding problem in turn. There are a number of different ways in which the initial parsing of objects might be accomplished. In particular, the selection of parts and of properties may depend on different mechanisms. Different attributes of the same object, such as its color, orientation, and direction of motion, must occupy the same location. However, different parts, like the arms and legs of a child or the two colors of her shirt and pants, occupy different locations and, if she is partly occluded, may not even be spatially linked in the retinal image. Possible ways of parsing objects and backgrounds include the selection of sensory data that share the same temporal parameters (onset, offset, flicker rate), or that match a prestored template (e.g., 93Chelazzi L. Miller E.K. Duncan J. Desimone R.C. A neural basis for visual search in inferior temporal cortex.Nature. 1993; 363: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), or that occupy the same or adjacent locations, or finally that share one or more Gestalt properties, such as their color or texture, common fate, collinearity, good continuation, symmetry, and convexity. In cases where objects have different temporal onset or offset times, the externally imposed synchrony of the initial neural response to one object may solve the parsing problem as well as the encoding problem (see below). The evidence suggests that temporal modulations can be used to separate figure and ground (323Leonards U. Singer W. Fahle M. The influence of temporal phase differences on texture segmentation.Vision Res. 1996; 36: 2689-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, when pitted against spatial cues temporal modulations do not disrupt selection by location (164Fahle M. Koch C. Spatial displacement, but not temporal asynchrony, destroys figural binding.Vision Res. 1995; 35: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 282Kiper D.C. Gegenfurtner K.R. Movshon J.A. Cortical oscillatory responses do not affect visual segmentation.Vision Res. 1996; 36: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), so they cannot always be the dominant cue. When one of the objects is known or expected, the selection may be mediated by a match to this familiar or cued object. The best-known example is the Dalmatian dog to be extracted from a background of black and white patches (Figure 1). One of two superimposed movies of real life scenes (like a ball game and a hand game) can be selected so efficiently that a salient event in the unattended movie (a lady with an umbrella walking across the field) is completely missed (414Neisser U. Becklen R. Selective looking attending to visually specified events.Cogn. Psychol. 1975; 7: 480-494Crossref Google Scholar). This type of segregation no doubt uses other grouping cues such as common fate, collinearity, and shared colors, but top-down predictions are also likely to play a role. 708Zhang, X. (1999). Anticipatory inhibition: an intentional non-spatial mechanism revealed with the distractor previewing technique. PhD thesis, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ.Google Scholar showed recently that suppression of irrelevant stimuli can also be helped by precueing the template of the unwanted stimulus, even when it occupies the same location as the target, ensuring that suppression is not mediated by location but by a representation of the object itself. Most of the research on binding has been devoted to the last two forms of selection—by location and by shared features. Feature Integration Theory (FIT; e.g., 619Treisman A. Gelade G. A feature-integration theory of attention.Cogn. Psychol. 1980; 12: 97-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 615Treisman, A. (1993). The perception of features and objects. In Attention: Selection, Awareness and Control: A Tribute to Donald Broadbent, A. Baddeley and L. Weiskrantz, eds. (Oxford: Clarendon Press).Google Scholar, 618Treisman A. Feature binding, attention and object perception.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 1295-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) uses both. It was developed to account for a number of empirical findings: (1) that search for targets that need binding to distinguish them from the nontargets often requires attention; (2) that when attention is directed elsewhere, illusory conjunctions wrongly recombining features of different objects are frequently seen; (3) that precueing the relevant location helps much more when a conjunction must be reported than when the targets are defined as a disjunction of separate features; and (4) that grouping by single features occurs in parallel across the field, whereas grouping by conjunctions is much less salient and also seems to require attention. In early papers, we proposed that binding is achieved by directing spatial attention serially to the locations of different objects (or homogeneous groups of objects). Features of objects in unattended locations are thereby excluded and cannot form illusory conjunctions with the features of the attended object. The relevant locations are selected in a “master map” of locations by an externally directed “window of attention” serially focused on single filled locations or contiguous clusters that might correspond to “objects.” The attention window gives access to the features in the corresponding locations in the different feature maps and allows the information from those locations to be assembled in a single object file for further analysis and identification. The separation of explicit access to features and to locations may correspond to the separation of ventral “what” and dorsal “where” pathways, although there must be implicit links between the two as well as implicit location information in the feature maps. The fact that patients with bilateral parietal lesions (Balints' syndrome) have major problems with binding is consistent with the idea that the master map of locations is associated with parietal function (496Robertson L. Treisman A. Freidman-Hill S. Grabowecky M. The interaction of spatial and object pathways evidence from Balint's syndrome.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 254-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If our model of the deficit is correct, the simultanagnosia that these patients also suffer is evidence for the importance of binding to normal object perception. If only one object can be bound, it seems that only one object is seen. 611Treisman A. Features and objects the fourteenth Bartlett memorial lecture.Quart. J. Exp. Psychol. 1988; 40A: 201-237Crossref Google Scholar, 622Treisman A. Sato S. Conjunction search revisited.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1990; 16: 459-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar added a feature-based selection process to the original version of FIT to account for cases where highly discriminable features appear to group and allow rapid or parallel conjunction search. The idea was that the binding process could be bypassed if connections from the separate feature maps responding to the target features were used to signal the corresponding locations within the master map and to suppress all others, thus excluding all nontargets from further processing. For example, if a target of a search is known to be red and vertical among green vertical and red horizontal lines, all the active locations in a color map for red and an orientation map for vertical could select the corresponding locations in the master map through the implicit links connecting them, and temporarily inhibit all other locations. 691Wolfe J.M.

The psychophysical evidence for a binding problem in human vision.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar report evidence supporting the feature-based account. This form of selection may also be responsible for grouping the parts of partially occluded objects. In a different form of grouping by Gestalt properties, edges or elements that are continuous or collinear appear to be linked by horizontal connections in area V1 (271Kapadia M.K. Ito M. Gilbert C.D. Westheimer G. Improvement in visual sensitivity by changes in local context parallel studies in human observers and in V1 of alert monkeys.Neuron. 1995; 15: 843-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may increase the salience of object boundaries (695Yen S.-C. Finkel L.H. Extraction of perceptually salient contours by striate cortical networks.Vision Res. 1998; 38: 719-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These connections might also be used to define the locations to be selected or suppressed in the master map of locations. Constraints on the shape of the attention window could also bias the selection in favor of simple, symmetrical, convex objects. Several papers in this issue develop similar ideas to explain selection by location or feature grouping. Wolfe and Cave present their Guided Search model (691Wolfe J.M. Cave K.R. Franzel S.L. Guided Search an alternative to the Feature Integration model for visual search.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1989; 15: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 91Cave K.R. Wolfe J.M. Modeling the role of parallel processing in visual search.Cogn. Psychol. 1990; 22: 225-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Wolfe and Bennett, 1997), which extended FIT. They recently modified the earliest stages to include an initial loose “bundling” by location, as opposed to the “tight binding” achieved through attention. Shadlen and Movshon favor the related computational model proposed by 435Olshausen B.A. Anderson C.H. Van Essen D.C. A neurobiological model of visual attention and invariant pattern recognition based on dynamic routing of information.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4700-4719PubMed Google Scholar, using shifter circuits to achieve the same goal of serial processing by locations. Reynolds and Desimone adopt the idea that spatial attention is the main mechanism for binding, combining it with their biased competition account and linking it to evidence from single unit-recordings (see also 354Luck S.J. Girelli M. McDermott M.T. Ford M.A. Bridging the gap between monkey neurophysiology and human perception an ambiguity resolution theory of visual selective attention.Cogn. Psychol. 1997; 33 (b): 64-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 486Reynolds J.H. Desimone R. The role of neural mechanisms of attention in solving the binding problem.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar( [this issue of Neuron]) also propose salience and grouping as supplementary binding mechanisms that could, by the increased activation they cause, select a winner in a competitive interaction with other objects. One concern with this hypothesis is that, without additional specification of the selection process, it seems to require the binding problem to be at least partly solved in order to contribute to its solution. The attribute on which the stimuli are salient (e.g., luminance or color contrast), or on which they are grouped (e.g., color, orientation, shared motion), must be bound to the other attributes of the same stimuli before their greater activation can be transmitted to those other dimensions. This “catch 22” might be resolved in cases where salience and grouping are determined at the early levels of processing, before the stimulus attributes are segregated into separate specialized visual areas. At these earliest stages, high contrast may ensure high firing rates for holistic stimuli rather than for particular attributes, so that subsequently each attribute wins out in the competition within its own specialized area. The mechanism is less clear for cognitively determined or learned salience and grouping (such as the salience of one's own name in a list of other names). The identity of the name might not be available at stages that precede the specialized processing of separate attributes. In order to make progress in understanding, it is useful to sharpen the disagreements so that clear distinctions in empirical data can decide between them. As I understand it, Reynolds and Desimone's biased competition model differs from FIT primarily in the source of suppression of unwanted stimuli, ideas, or responses. (The main difference claimed by Reynolds and Desimone was that illusory conjunctions, in their model but not mine, arise from spatial uncertainty within receptive fields, but this was in fact the model proposed by Treisman and Gormican, 1988 [see pp. 45–46]. I also proposed additional mechanisms besides spatial attention that can be used to select stimuli and deal with the binding problem, one being grouping and one being object tracking by reentrant connections [Treisman, 1995]). Both accounts assume an external source of control by selective attention, presumably directed by prefrontal and parietal areas. But Reynolds and Desimone restrict this control to biasing the competition that would occur between objects anyway. They assume that selection of one stimulus or response from many is directly determined by suppressive links between their neural substrates, with the more active winning over the less active. Attention in their model biases the competition by adding top-down activation to one of the competing sets of cells. FIT, on the other hand, attributes an inhibitory as well as an activating role to the external control system that we label attention. The evidence Reynolds and Desimone cite is the observation that when a second stimulus is introduced within the receptive field of a visual neuron, its response is a weighted average rather than the sum of the two separate responses (see also 391Miller E.C. Gochin P.M. Gross C.G. Suppression of visual responses of neurons in inferior temporal cortex of the awake macaque monkey by addition of a second stimulus.Brain Res. 1993; 616: 25-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with a direct suppressive interaction between the two afferent inputs to the cell, but it could also result from external selection of one and inhibition of the other to reduce cross-talk and binding errors. Intrinsic competition may be difficult to distinguish from the effects of dividing or focusing an extrinsic source of attention. One piece of evidence that favors the biased competition model is the finding by 487Reynolds J. Chelazzi L. Desimone R. Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1736-1753PubMed Google Scholar that when two unattended stimuli are presented in the same receptive field, the response is still lower than the response to the more effective of the two presented alone, even though they are not competing with each other for attention. Of course, this does not preclude the idea that attention also inhibits unwanted stimuli when binding errors might otherwise occur. If the idea of intrinsic competition is correct, it raises many interesting questions for research. How do the cells “know” that they are being activated by different objects rather than by one complex object? There may be some feedback from higher object recognition areas, but when both objects are unattended, this is likely to be limited. Does similarity play a role in determining the degree of competition? What other factors affect the competition and its outcome? Several of the present papers deal primarily with the second problem: how the feature bundles, once selected, are encoded to be used for thinking, deciding, and acting. Essentially, this is a special case of the central question, “What, in neural terms, corresponds to the final representation of what we see?” Is it the activation of particular labeled cells, or particular cell assemblies, or particular temporal patterns of activity within or across cells, independent of which cells implement the pattern? Or is it a combination of place and temporal pattern? We are far from having an answer, which is quite a handicap in devising models of object perception, but the question has not been discussed much. One constraint, of course, is that the codes should remain distinct when several objects are present at once (the binding problem). The focal hypothesis debated in the present issue is the proposal by 392Milner P. A model for visual shape recognition.Psychol.

(Berlin: Springer).Google Scholar that the neurons coding elements that belong to the same object are distinguished from others by firing in synchrony. Oscillations in the range of 30–60 Hz are thought to assist and perpetuate the synchronization, especially for widely separated neurons.

Maunsell J. Specialized representations in visual cortex a role for binding?.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar point out some problems for the synchrony account, including the supposedly limited precision of temporal and spatial coding by neurons, the need to use timing relations to represent real temporal differences (in such discriminations as the perceived direction of sounds or the syllables of speech), and the failure in several studies to observe the predicted oscillations in visual areas (e.g., 604Tovee M. Rolls E. Oscillatory activity is not evident in the primate temporal visual cortex with static stimuli.Neuroreport. 1992; 3 (a): 369-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 702Young M.P. Tanaka K. Yamane S. On oscillating neuronal responses in the visual cortex of the monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 67: 1464-1474PubMed Google Scholar). The binding-by-synchrony hypothesis has created considerable interest and excitement, since it provides a means of disambiguating superimposed distributed codes in neural networks, thus greatly increasing their flexibility. It also provides a plausible reason for the attentional limit of around four objects that is widely observed in the perception of brief displays and in studies of visual working memory: the different firing rates that can be easily discriminated on a background of inherent noise and accidental synchronies may set a low limit to the number of objects that can be simultaneously bound. 658von der Malsburg C. The what and why of binding the modeler's perspective.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar(see also 554Singer W. Neuronal synchrony a versatile code for the definition of relations?.Neuron. 1999; 24 (b this issue,): 49-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) points out another important advantage to temporal binding which is not often discussed: it allows coarse coding within dimensions. Coding intermediate values on perceptual dimensions by ratios of activity in differently tuned but overlapping populations of cells can maximize both neural economy and discriminability. However, if different values are signaled by particular combinations of cells, the binding problem reemerges as soon as more than one coarsely coded feature is present. While exploring the effects of coarse coding and of similarity on binding, we had found that the predicted illusory conjunctions can indeed arise within dimensions (e.g., illusory purple with brief presentations of red and blue), and that attention seems to play the same role for within-dimension binding as for between-dimension binding (612Treisman A. Search, similarity and the integration of features between and within dimensions.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1991; 27: 652-676Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 614Treisman A. Spreading suppression or feature integration? A reply to Duncan and Humphreys.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1992; 18 (b): 589-593Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The main alternative hypothesis for signaling the outputs of the binding process is a place code, which represents different objects or parts of objects by the firing of different labeled conjunction coding or “cardinal” cells at the top of a hierarchical perceptual system (34Barlow H.B. Single units and cognition a neurone doctrine for perceptual psychology.Perception. 1972; 1: 371-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Barlow H.B. The twelfth Bartlett memorial lecture the role of single neurons in the psychology of perception.Quart. J. Exp. Psychol. 1985; 37: 121-145Crossref Google Scholar). The cardinal cells could be replaced by cell assemblies, provided that the coding is sufficiently sparse for overlap between cells taking part in different assemblies not to be a problem. The place or “labeled line” hypothesis is developed in this issue by Shadlen and Movshon, by Ghose and Maunsell, and by Riesenhuber and Poggio, who created a model to demonstrate its feasibility. There is considerable evidence for coding of specific percepts by specialized cells. Single units in monkeys respond to faces better than to other stimuli (e.g., 447Perrett D.I. Smith P.A.J. Potter D.D. Mistlin A.J. Head A.S. Milner A.D. Jeeves M.A. Visual cells in the temporal cortex sensitive to face view and gaze direction.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1985; 223: 293-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The behavioral discriminations of motion made by a monkey can be predicted from the activity of individual cells in area MT (419Newsome W.T. Britten K.H. Movshon J.A. Neuronal correlates of a perceptual decision.Nature. 1989; 341: 52-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 69Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Shadlen M.N. Celebrini S. Movshon J.A. A relationship between behavioral choice and the visual responses of neurons in macaque MT.Vis. Neurosci. 1996; 13: 87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)—quite strong evidence for cardinal cells in the case of directions of motion. However, faces may be a special case, highly significant from the evolutionary point of view, and objects are typically more complex than directions of motion. Ghose and Maunsell suggest that the number of objects we can actually identify is only in the tens of thousands, but we can also see thousands of differences between individual tokens and views of these objects. The cardinal cell hypothesis does run into combinatorial explosion problems if all discriminable instantiations of all objects must have unique cells to signal their presence. A related difficulty is that this account allows no distinction between identifying and “seeing,” or between types and tokens (268Kahneman D. Treisman A. Gibbs B. The reviewing of object files object-specific integration of information.Cogn. Psychol. 1992; 24: 175-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 613Treisman A. Perceiving and reperceiving objects.Am. Psychol. 1992; 47 (a): 862-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using cardinal cells, feature binding can be coded only by identifying prestored conjunctions. It is not clear, therefore, how a new and unexpected conjunction would be bound and perceived. Consider seeing a three-legged camel with wings, or a triangular book with a hole through it, or a new object like an electron microscope picture of a cell that we have never seen before. All these would be instantly visible and bound, even when we have no idea what they are. The plasticity of the nervous system may allow new cardinal cells to be created through learning and experience—for example, to signal familiar configurations like letters, digits, and grandmothers. But novel objects can clearly be “seen” under good conditions the first time they appear. Another deficiency is that cardinal cells have no way to represent the hierarchical structure of the object, the different momentary constellations of articulated parts in a given token as seen on a particular occasion. These could perhaps be read from the complete pathway through the hierarchy that culminates in the cardinal cell. 197Ghose G"

Two families of siderophores were isolated from strains belonging to two different genera of marine bacteria. The aquachelins, from Halomonas aquamarina strain DS40M3, and the marinobactins, from Marinobacter sp. strains DS40M6 and DS40M8, each contain a unique peptidic head group that coordinates iron(III) and an appendage of one of a series of fatty acid moieties. These siderophores have low critical micelle concentrations (CMCs). In the absence of iron, the marinobactins are present as micelles at concentrations exceeding their CMC; upon addition of iron(III), the micelles undergo a spontaneous phase change to form vesicles. These observations suggest that unique iron acquisition mechanisms may have evolved in marine bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2148837383,"Since its original formulation as a theoretical problem (653von der Malsburg, C. (1981). The correlation theory of brain function. MPI Biophysical Chemistry, Internal Report 81–2. Reprinted in Models of Neural Networks II (1994), E. Domany, J.L. van Hemmen, and K. Schulten, eds. (Berlin: Springer).Google Scholar), “the binding problem” has captured the attention of researchers across many disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, computational modeling, and even philosophy. Despite the issue's prominence in these fields, what “binding” means is rarely made explicit. In this paper, I will briefly survey the many notions of binding and will introduce some issues that will be explored more fully in the reviews that follow. The canonical example of binding is the one suggested by 511Rosenblatt F Principles of Neurodynamics. Spartan Books, Washington, CD1961Google Scholar(see also 658von der Malsburg C. The what and why of binding the modeler's perspective.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar [this issue of Neuron]), in which one sort of visual feature, such as an object's shape, must be correctly associated with another feature, such as its location, to provide a unified representation of that object. Such explicit association, or “binding,” becomes especially important when more than one visual object is present, in order to avoid incorrect combinations of features belonging to different objects, otherwise known as “illusory conjunctions” (Triesman and Schmidt, 1982). Considerable psychological evidence exists for the occurrence of illusory conjunctions (see Wolfe and Cave, 1999 [this issue]), suggesting that in certain cases, binding is indeed a problem for the brain. In addition, evidence from neuroanatomy and neurophysiology indicates that processing streams in the visual system are segregated, so that feature dimensions such as color, motion, location, and object identity are processed in separate brain regions. It should be noted, however, that while earlier characterizations of anatomical processing streams emphasized their segregation, more recent studies increasingly show a large degree of cross-talk between brain regions and more evidence for sensitivity to dimensions other than the preferred one for many brain regions (see Ghose and Maunsell, 1999 [this issue]). Thus, although neuroanatomical information will be central to understanding how the brain processes stimuli and forms representations, our current knowledge of neuroanatomy is sufficient to constrain neither the problem of binding nor its solution. The singular term “problem” suggests that binding is a unitary problem. In fact, the binding problem is a class of problems, and some of the confusion in discussions of binding may stem from the fact that different phenomena are being referred to by a single name. Besides visual binding, which includes binding information across visual space, binding information across types of features, and binding neural signals across cortical space, binding occurs in other modalities. For instance, auditory binding may be needed to discriminate the sound of a single voice in a crowd; binding across time is required for interpreting object motion; and cross-modal binding is required to associate the sound of a ball striking a bat with the visual percept of it, so that both are effortlessly perceived as being aspects of a single event. I like to refer to these sorts of problems as perceptual binding problems, since they involve unifying aspects of percepts. In addition, there are cognitive binding problems: they include relating a concept to a percept, such as linking the visual representation of an apple to all the semantic knowledge stored about it (it is edible, how it tastes, used in pies, etc.); cross-modal identification, such as being able to identify an item that has previously only been seen by how it feels; and memory reconstruction, the linking of previously encoded information to form a structured and unified representation. While this perceptual/cognitive distinction is somewhat artificial, it serves to highlight the fact that binding occurs in many different kinds of brain processes. The reviews that follow tend to focus on the visual binding problem, although not exclusively. It behooves us to be as explicit as possible about the nature of the particular problem under investigation, for while it is likely that most different forms of binding problems are solved via common mechanisms, that is only a parsimonious assumption, and ultimately it is an empirical issue. On the other side of the coin, it is worthwhile to remember that something as complex as binding, writ large, may not have a single mechanistic solution. The potential mechanisms for binding suggested in these reviews are not mutually exclusive: there is ample room for attentional, temporal, and combinatorial coding mechanisms to work together in the brain to process information, and there may well be other as yet undiscovered mechanisms at work as well. There are two types of indications that binding is a problem. The first is an indication that the brain has difficulty in binding. This can occur in normal brains when there are temporal or capacity limitations, which lead to errors such as illusory conjunctions (see Wolfe and Cave, 1999; Treisman, 1999 [this issue]). It can also occur in damaged brains, when deficits appear that make it clear that binding is critical for normal cognitive operation. For example, in Balint's syndrome, bilateral parietal damage causes simultagnosia, the inability to perceive more than one object at a time. Other experiments show unexpected dissociations between pathways. For instance, 211Goodale M.A. Milner A.D. Jakobson L.S. Carey D.P. A neurological dissociation between perceiving objects and grasping them.Nature. 1991; 349: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 212Goodale M.A. Meenan J.P. Bulthoff H.H. Nicolle D.A. Murphy K.J. Racicot C.I. Separate neural pathways for visual analysis of object shape in perception and prehension.Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 604-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar report evidence for a double dissociation between a vision-for-perception and a vision-for-action pathway: patients with lesions restricted to occipitoparietal cortex can discriminate objects according to shape, but cannot properly grasp them in accordance with the visual percept, while others with lesions in ventral cortex fail at the discrimination task, but can respond perfectly well to that stimulus with an appropriate grasping action (211Goodale M.A. Milner A.D. Jakobson L.S. Carey D.P. A neurological dissociation between perceiving objects and grasping them.Nature. 1991; 349: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 212Goodale M.A. Meenan J.P. Bulthoff H.H. Nicolle D.A. Murphy K.J. Racicot C.I. Separate neural pathways for visual analysis of object shape in perception and prehension.Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 604-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this case, it is not entirely clear whether binding normally takes place between these pathways, but the fact that similar dissociations are not seen in undamaged brains suggests that information is shared between pathways, and this may be accomplished through binding. Thus, both experiments and case studies reveal that the brain does engage in some operations responsible for appropriately combining neural signals. The second indication that binding is a problem is a conceptual one: even if the brain usually does not appear to have a problem in correctly binding signals, we as scientists still lack an understanding of how information variously distributed in patterns of neural firing results in coherent representations. Thus, binding is a problem in that it requires an explanation. Several of the papers in this issue of Neuron treat, in detail, possible mechanisms of binding. 486Reynolds J.H. Desimone R. The role of neural mechanisms of attention in solving the binding problem.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar explain how attentional mechanisms could be indispensible for binding, and indeed much evidence from psychology and neurology suggests that attention and binding are intimately related (689Wolfe J.M. Cave K.R. The psychophysical evidence for a binding problem in human vision.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both 217Gray C.M. The temporal correlation hypothesis of visual feature integration still alive and well.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 31-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar and 554Singer W. Neuronal synchrony a versatile code for the definition of relations?.Neuron. 1999; 24 (b this issue,): 49-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar discuss how temporal synchrony (or temporal correlation) could be used to bind neural signals and describe the evidence for and against temporal binding. They bring to the fore an impressive amount of evidence from diverse neuroscientific approaches, and provide a perspective on temporal aspects of neural coding from the cellular to the systems levels. From the data presented, I think it is clear that neural oscillations and synchronous signals are present in the brain and that neurons have the machinery to exploit these signals (for instance, in changing synaptic strengths). However, there is only suggestive but not yet incontrovertible evidence that these signals are used for binding, or that they play any critical role in brain function. These proponents of temporal correlation are extremely measured in their discussion, and are careful to emphasize that available evidence is consistent with, but does not prove, that temporal correlation is used for binding. In the other camp, 539Shadlen M.N. Movshon J.A. Synchrony unbound a critical evaluation of the temporal bining hypothesis.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar offer an incisive critique of the temporal binding hypothesis, arguing that temporal signals do not have the capability of encoding binding relations. Several of the reviews suggest experiments that could help cement or destroy the case for temporal synchrony in perceptual binding, although executing these experiments properly will be a great challenge. 197Ghose G.M. Maunsell J. Specialized representations in visual cortex a role for binding?.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 493Riesenhuber M. Poggio T. Are cortical models really bound by the “binding problem”?.Neuron. 1999; 24 (a this issue,): 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, in contrast to the others, argue that there is really no binding problem, in the sense that the classical hierarchical scheme of neural coding, going back to Hubel and Weisel, can encode the combinatorial information required for perception without leading to a combinatorial explosion. While Ghose and Maunsell claim that specialized groups of cells are at least as powerful as temporal correlations could be for supporting rich representations, they nonetheless suggest that an explanation for unitary representations is lacking and that some form of binding must exist. Riesenhuber and Poggio do not address this larger issue, but they outline a model that stands as a plausibility proof for combinatorial coding being sufficient for object recognition. Their model uses a moderate number of broadly tuned neurons to perform an object recognition task, and it is successful even in the presence of other objects. Although their model is consistent with neurophysiological data, it remains to be seen whether an extended model could deal with the diversity of stimuli and complexity of tasks that brains handle easily every day. In addition, the model's metric for object recognition is that a tuned unit responds more to the object it is tuned for than to distractors. It will be interesting to see how robust the performance is when the number of units and the number of distractors grows. 658von der Malsburg C. The what and why of binding the modeler's perspective.Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, in his review, makes two particularly important points that add perspective to the discussion. The first is that the flexibility of brain function sets it apart from network models, and the second is that learning or plasticity must be a fundamental component of whatever the mechanisms are that bind neural signals. While the goal of a model is often to simulate a single task that the brain can perform, the “goal” of the brain is to be able to handle whatever complex stimuli or situations it might encounter. 511Rosenblatt F Principles of Neurodynamics. Spartan Books, Washington, CD1961Google Scholar solution to the binding problem demonstrates that solving any given problem is often rather straightforward, and complex mechanisms such as temporal binding can appear to be unnecessary. However, difficulties such as combinatorial explosions (but see Ghose and Maunsell, 1999 [this issue]) and ontogenetic factors arise when trying to model a more general-purpose device, and the necessity of binding becomes apparent. How general is Riesenhuber and Poggio's model? Can it also be the framework for other visual tasks besides recognition? How flexible is this type of network? Until issues of scaling and task specificity are more thoroughly explored, it is difficult to say how applicable such a model may be for understanding brain function. Both Ghose and Maunsell and Shadlen and Movshon point out what is perhaps the fundamental problem with the binding hypothesis: even supposing that temporal coding is the vehicle for signaling which neural populations should be bound together, the theory does not adequately address how those combinations are computed. In a sense, the binding problem is pushed back one level, for it must be solved at least partially for the necessary temporal correlations to be established. Are neurons with appropriate receptive field properties and anatomical connectivity a sufficient basis for the generation of correlated signals? What is the role of top-down connections in establishing proper synchrony? These questions are difficult to answer and difficult to model with biological realism. A similar problem rests with the output side of the temporal binding hypothesis—if correlations are the signal for binding, how are those signals read out? The readout problem is one of the most puzzling and fundamental problems for systems neuroscience in general: how is the firing of populations of neurons interpreted and transformed by other neurons to result in decision, action, perception, etc? This problem plagues most, if not all, models of brain function, for in modeling it is the modeler that attributes semantics to nodes in a network. One way to potentially avoid that problem would be to close the loop between the model and the world, so that the world impinges upon the network, which then acts upon and affects the world, thus generating semantics through action. This brings me to mention (by virtue of my editorial license) what is perhaps the most mystifying binding problem of all: the problem of consciousness. How does something as simple and mechanistic as neural firing add up to subjectivity, raw feelings, a self? Are the mechanisms that allow us to attribute the correct color and shape to an object the same ones that lead to the unity of phenomenal experience? Will the solution of the binding problem be the solution to the mystery of consciousness? I will not belabor the point, since answers will be long in coming, but although none of the scientists who authored the reviews that follow discuss binding with respect to consciousness, I will wager that the a good part of the interest, excitement, and contentiousness that surrounds the binding debate is attributable to the magnitude of the issues with which it is connected. The following pieces provide a comprehensive review of the status of the binding problem at the dawn of the new millenium. It will be extremely interesting to repeat this exercise in a decade or two, to chart the progress that we as scientists make on one of the most puzzling and fascinating issues that the brain and cognitive sciences have ever faced."

The trajectory of these axons toward the FP is guided in part by netrins. The mechanisms that guide the early phase of C axon extension, however, have not been resolved. We show that the roof plate (RP) expresses a diffusible activity that repels C axons and orients their growth within the dorsal spinal cord. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) appear to act as RP-derived chemorepellents that guide the early trajectory of the axons of C neurons in the developing spinal cord: BMP7 mimics the RP repellent activity for C axons in vitro, can act directly to collapse C growth cones, and appears to serve an essential function in RP repulsion of C axons."

Raup argued that plots of the diversification of life were an illustration of bias: the older the rocks, the less we know. The debate was partially resolved by the observation that different data sets gave similar patterns of rising diversity through time. Here we show that new assessment methods, in which the order of fossils in the rocks (stratigraphy) is compared with the order inherent in evolutionary trees (phylogeny), provide a more convincing analytical tool: stratigraphy and phylogeny offer independent data on history. Assessments of congruence between stratigraphy and phylogeny for a sample of 1,000 published phylogenies show no evidence of diminution of quality backwards in time. Ancient rocks clearly preserve less information, on average, than more recent rocks. However, if scaled to the stratigraphic level of the stage and the taxonomic level of the family, the past 540 million years of the fossil record provide uniformly good documentation of the life of the past."

Brains of DRPLA patients contained apparently identical 120 kDa nuclear fragments.

https://openalex.org/W2027682121,"Modeling of the x-ray spectra of the Galactic superluminal jet sources GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40 reveals a three-layered atmospheric structure in the inner region of their accretion disks. Above the cold and optically thick disk with a temperature of 0.2 to 0.5 kiloelectron volts, there is a warm layer with a temperature of 1.0 to 1.5 kiloelectron volts and an optical depth around 10. Sometimes there is also a much hotter, optically thin corona above the warm layer, with a temperature of 100 kiloelectron volts or higher and an optical depth around unity. The structural similarity between the accretion disks and the solar atmosphere suggests that similar physical processes may be operating in these different systems."
