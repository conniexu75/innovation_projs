https://openalex.org/W3155611002,"This work addresses the ability to manage the distribution of heat transmission for fluid flow occurs upon a paraboloid thin shaped hot needle by using hybrid nanoparticles containing Copper Oxide ( CuO ) and Silver ( Ag ) with water as pure fluid. The needle is placed horizontally in nanofluid with an application of Hall current and viscous dissipation. The popular Buongiorno model has employed in the current investigation in order to explore the impact of Brownian and thermophoretic forces exerted by the fluid. The modeled equations with boundary conditions are transformed to non-dimensional form by incorporating a suitable group of similarity variables. This set of ordinary differential equations is then solved by employing homotopy analysis method (HAM). After detail study of the current work, it has established that the flow of fluid reduces with growth in magnetic effects and volume fractions of nanoparticles. Thermal characteristics increase with augmentation of Eckert number, magnetic field, volume fractions of nanoparticles, Brownian motion parameter and decline with increase in Prandtl number. Moreover, concentration of nanoparticles reduces with corresponding growth in Lewis number and thermophoresis, chemical reaction parameters while increases with growth in Brownian motion parameter."
https://openalex.org/W3155807682,"Purpose Monocyte distribution width (MDW) has been suggested as an early biomarker of sepsis, but few studies have compared MDW with conventional biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). This study evaluated MDW as a biomarker for sepsis and compared it with CRP and PCT. Materials and methods Patients aged 18–80 years who visited the emergency department were screened and prospectively enrolled in a tertiary medical center. Complete blood count, MDW, CRP, and PCT were examined. Diagnostic performance for sepsis was tested using the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and specificity. Results In total, 665 patients were screened, and 549 patients with valid laboratory test results were included in the analysis. The patients were categorized into three groups according to the Sepsis-3 criteria: non-infection, infection, and sepsis. MDW showed the highest value in the sepsis group (median [interquartile range], 24.0 [20.8–27.8]). The AUC values for MDW, CRP, PCT, and white blood cells for predicting sepsis were 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67–0.75), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.71–0.78], 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72–0.79, and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.57–0.65), respectively. With the optimal cutoff value of the cohort, the sensitivity was 83.0% for MDW (cutoff, 19.8), 69.7% for CRP (cutoff, 4.0), and 76.6% for PCT (cutoff, 0.05). The combination of quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) with MDW improved the AUC (0.76; 95% CI, 0.72–0.80) to a greater extent than qSOFA alone (0.67; 95% CI, 0.62–0.72). Conclusions MDW reflected a diagnostic performance comparable to that of conventional diagnostic markers, implying that MDW is an alternative biomarker. The combination of MDW and qSOFA improves the diagnostic performance for early sepsis."

This study tested the relationship between spiritual wellbeing and symptoms of psychological disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) among Chinese university students in Hong Kong. Cross-sectional data were collected from N = 500 students (aged 17–24; 279 women). The participants were asked to complete the Spiritual Health and Life-Orientation Measure (SHALOM) to evaluate the status of their spiritual wellbeing in the personal and communal, environmental, and transcendental domains, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) to assess their emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. All domains of spiritual wellbeing were negatively associated with psychological distress. Hierarchical Multiple Regression showed that together the three domains of spirituality explained 79.9%, 71.3% and 85.5% of the variance in students’ depression, anxiety and stress respectively. The personal and communal domain of spiritual wellbeing was the strongest predictor of psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W3155761820,"This study analysed spatio-temporal fluctuations in rainfall to assess drought and wet spells in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Temporal changes in rainfall were assessed using a linear regression method, while aridity conditions at each meteorological station were measured using the United Nations Environment Programme climate aridity index. In this study, drought and wet spell patterns were identified using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The Spearman’s Rho (SR) test was applied to find trends in the temporal 1-month and 12-month SPEI data. Balakot, Dir, Kakul, Kalam, Malam Jabba, Parachinar, Patan and Saidu were humid whereas Cherat and Timergara were sub-humid meteorological stations while Bannu, Chitral, Drosh and Peshawar were semi-arid and D.I. Khan was found to be the only arid meteorological station in the study area. The regression results revealed that the amount of rainfall is decreasing at Balakot, Kakul and Dir, while in the southern part of the province the amount of rainfall is increasing, such as in Parachinar and Cherat. The SPEI results revealed distinct drought spells in 1971–1974, 1984–1989, 1998–2004 and recently in 2017–2018, in almost all met-stations results. The SR results indicated a significant wet trend at met-station Parachinar, located in the west, while a significant drying trend has been noted at Balakot in the north-eastern part of the study area. Detailed knowledge about rainfall variability can provide a foundation for the planning and use of water resources."
https://openalex.org/W3155950045,"Background Current intensive care unit (ICU) sedation guidelines recommend strategies using non-benzodiazepine sedatives. This survey was undertaken to explore inhaled ICU sedation practice in France. Methods In this national survey, medical directors of French adult ICUs were contacted by phone or email between July and August 2019. ICU medical directors were questioned about the characteristics of their department, their knowledge on inhaled sedation, and practical aspects of inhaled sedation use in their department. Results Among the 374 ICUs contacted, 187 provided responses (50%). Most ICU directors (73%) knew about the use of inhaled ICU sedation and 21% used inhaled sedation in their unit, mostly with the Anaesthetic Conserving Device ( AnaConDa , Sedana Medical). Most respondents had used volatile agents for sedation for &lt;5 years (63%) and in &lt;20 patients per year (75%), with their main indications being: failure of intravenous sedation, severe asthma or bronchial obstruction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sevoflurane and isoflurane were mainly used (88% and 20%, respectively). The main reasons for not using inhaled ICU sedation were: “device not available” (40%), “lack of medical interest” (37%), “lack of familiarity or knowledge about the technique” (35%) and “elevated cost” (21%). Most respondents (80%) were overall satisfied with the use of inhaled sedation. Almost 75% stated that inhaled sedation was a seducing alternative to intravenous sedation. Conclusion This survey highlights the widespread knowledge about inhaled ICU sedation in France but shows its limited use to date. Differences in education and knowledge, as well as the recent and relatively scarce literature on the use of volatile agents in the ICU, might explain the diverse practices that were observed. The low rate of mild adverse effects, as perceived by respondents, and the users’ satisfaction, are promising for this potentially important tool for ICU sedation."
https://openalex.org/W3156905059,"As social distancing policies and recommendations went into effect in response to COVID-19, people made rapid changes to the places they visit. These changes are clearly seen in mobility data, which records foot traffic using location trackers in cell phones. While mobility data is often used to extract the number of customers that visit a particular business or business type, it is the frequency and duration of concurrent occupancy at those sites that governs transmission. Understanding the way people interact at different locations can help target policies and inform contact tracing and prevention strategies. This paper outlines methods to extract interactions from mobility data and build networks that can be used in epidemiological models. Several measures of interaction are extracted: interactions between people, the cumulative interactions for a single person, and cumulative interactions that occur at particular businesses. Network metrics are computed to identify structural trends which show clear changes based on the timing of stay-at-home orders. Measures of interaction and structural trends in the resulting networks can be used to better understand potential spreading events, the percent of interactions that can be classified as close contacts, and the impact of policy choices to control transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3154978839,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two different types of exercise methods in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Methods In total, 28 subjects with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a mild curve magnitude (10°–26°) were randomly divided into two groups: the Schroth group (n = 14) and the core group (n = 14). The patients in the Schroth group were treated with supervised Schroth exercises, and the patients in the core group were treated with supervised core stabilization exercises; both groups performed the exercises for three days per week for a total of 10 weeks, and both were given additional traditional exercises to perform. Assessment included Cobb angle (Radiography), trunk rotation (Adam’s test), cosmetic trunk deformity (Walter Reed Visual Assessment Scale), spinal mobility (Spinal Mouse), peripheral muscle strength (Biodex System 4-Pro), and quality of life (Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire). Results It was found that patients in the Schroth group showed greater improvement in Cobb angles, thoracic trunk rotation angle, cosmetic trunk deformity, spinal mobility, and quality of life than those in the core group (p&lt;0.05), except for in lumbar trunk rotation angle. Peripheral muscle strength improvement was greater in the core group than in the Schroth group (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion Schroth exercises are more effective than core stabilization exercises in the correction of scoliosis and related problems in mild adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and core stabilization exercises are more effective than Schroth exercises in the improvement of peripheral muscle strength.

https://openalex.org/W3155114445,"Background Inappropriate antimicrobial use (AMU) is a global concern. Opinions of veterinarians regarding AMU and its role in the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) may influence their prescription practices. It is important to understand these opinions, prescription practices and their potential impact on the development of AMR in order to guide efforts to curb the problem. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial prescription practices and opinions of veterinarians in Kentucky regarding AMU and AMR. Methods This cross-sectional study used a 30-question survey questionnaire administered to veterinarians who were members of the Kentucky Veterinary Medical Association. Survey responses from 101 participants were included in the study. Descriptive statistics were computed and associations between categorical variables assessed using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Firth logistic models were used to investigate predictors of “Compliance with prescription policies” and “Cost of antimicrobial affects prescription decisions”. Results Almost all (93%) respondents indicated that improper AMU contributed to selection for AMR. A total of 52% of the respondents believed that antimicrobials were appropriately prescribed, while the remaining 48% believed that antimicrobials were inappropriately prescribed. Significant predictors of compliance with prescription policies were availability of prescription policy at the veterinary facility (Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.2; p&lt;0.001) and over-prescription (OR = 0.35; p = 0.025). Similarly, significant predictors of cost of antimicrobials affecting prescription decisions were lack of post-graduate training (OR = 8.3; p = 0.008) and practice type, with large animal practices having significantly lower odds of the outcome (OR = 0.09; p = 0.004) than small animal practices. Conclusion Most veterinarians indicated that improper AMU contributed to selection for AMR. Since the odds of compliance with prescription policies were 4-times higher among veterinarians working at facilities that had prescription policies compared to those at facilities that didn’t, more veterinary facilities should be encouraged to adopt prescription policies to help improve compliance and reduce AMR. Veterinarians would also benefit from continued professional education to help improve prescription practices, antimicrobial stewardship and curb AMR."
https://openalex.org/W3155534289,"Objective To establish whether one can build a mortality prediction model for COVID-19 patients based solely on demographics and comorbidity data that outperforms age alone. Such a model could be a precursor to implementing smart lockdowns and vaccine distribution strategies. Methods The training cohort comprised 2337 COVID-19 inpatients from nine hospitals in The Netherlands. The clinical outcome was death within 21 days of being discharged. The features were derived from electronic health records collected during admission. Three feature selection methods were used: LASSO, univariate using a novel metric, and pairwise (age being half of each pair). 478 patients from Belgium were used to test the model. All modeling attempts were compared against an age-only model. Results In the training cohort, the mortality group’s median age was 77 years (interquartile range = 70–83), higher than the non-mortality group (median = 65, IQR = 55–75). The incidence of former/active smokers, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, dementia, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic cardiac disease, chronic neurological disease, and chronic kidney disease was higher in the mortality group. All stated differences were statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. LASSO selected eight features, novel univariate chose five, and pairwise chose none. No model was able to surpass an age-only model in the external validation set, where age had an AUC of 0.85 and a balanced accuracy of 0.77. Conclusion When applied to an external validation set, we found that an age-only mortality model outperformed all modeling attempts (curated on www.covid19risk.ai ) using three feature selection methods on 22 demographic and comorbid features."
https://openalex.org/W3154968705,"Amino acid metabolism plays an important role in controlling blood pressure by regulating the production of NO and ROS. The present study examined amino acid levels in the serum of Dahl SS rats and SS.13 BN rats fed a low or high salt diet. We observed that 8 of 27 amino acids responded to a high salt diet in SS rats. Thus, we hypothesized that a defect in amino acids may contribute to the development of salt-induced hypertension. L-phenylalanine was used to treat SS rats with a low or high salt diet. The results demonstrated that L-phenylalanine supplementation significantly enhanced the serum nitrite levels and attenuated the high salt-induced hypertension in SS rats. Low levels of BH 4 and nitrite and the impaired vascular response to acetylcholine were rescued by L-phenylalanine supplementation. Moreover, increased GTP cyclohydrolase (GCH1) mRNA, levels of BH 4 and nitrite, and reduced superoxide production were observed in the kidneys of hypertensive SS rats with L-phenylalanine. The antihypertensive effects of L-phenylalanine might be mediated by enhancing BH 4 biosynthesis and decreasing superoxide production from NO synthase, thereby protecting vascular and kidney function with reduced ROS and elevated NO levels. The present study demonstrated that L-phenylalanine supplementation restored vascular function, suggesting L-phenylalanine represented a potential target to attenuate high salt-sensitive hypertension through GCH1-BH 4 ."
https://openalex.org/W3155443126,"Truth-Default Theory (TDT) predicts that across countries and cultures, a few people tell most of the lies, while a majority of people lie less frequently than average. This prediction, referred to as “a few prolific liars,” is tested in Japan. The study further investigated the extent to which the Dark Triad personality traits predict the frequency of lying. University students ( N = 305) reported how many times they lied in the past 24 hours and answered personality questions. Results indicate that the few prolific liars pattern is evident in Japan thereby advancing TDT. Results also show that Japanese frequent liars tend to have Dark Triad personality traits, but the nature of the findings may be unique to Japan. Results of the generalized linear model suggest that the Dark Triad components of Machiavellianism and psychopathy exacerbate lying behavior by reducing the guilt associated with lying. However, narcissism encourages guilt and therefore inhibits lying behavior with both direct and indirect effects. These narcissism findings appear to contradict prior studies but stem from use of a more appropriate statistical analysis or the Japanese context."
https://openalex.org/W3154571025,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rosuvastatin treatment on memory impairment, and anxiogenic-like effects in mice chronically infected with Toxoplasma gondii . For this, Balb/c mice were infected orally with chronic ME-49 strain of Toxoplasma gondii . Oral treatment with rosuvastatin (40mg/kg/day) started on the 51 st day post-infection and was performed daily for 21 days. After completion of treatment, anxiety-like effects and locomotion were investigated in the open field (OF) test, whereas novel object recognition (NOR) test was used for evaluation of short- and long-term memory. At the end of the experiments, the brain was collected for Toxoplasma gondii DNA quantification and histopathological analysis. Infection with ME-49 strain decreased the time spent in the center of OF, indicating an anxiogenic effect, without affecting total and peripheral locomotion. Rosuvastatin treatment inhibited the change in the center time. Besides, pharmacological treatment increased total and central locomotion in both non-infected and infected animals. Infection also impaired both short- and long-term memory in the NOR test, and these effects were reverted by rosuvastatin treatment. In addition to effects in behavioral changes, rosuvastatin also reduced parasite load in the brain and attenuated signs of brain inflammation such as perivascular cuffs, inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue damage. These findings indicate for the first time the efficacy of rosuvastatin in treatment of memory impairment and anxiogenic effect evoked by infection with Toxoplasma gondii . These effects might be mediated by reduced cyst load, which in turn decrease inflammation and damage in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3154973199,"Biogenic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were synthesized using the aqueous crude extract of mangrove leaves, Avicennia marina (CE). GC-MS metabolite profiling of CE showed that their carbohydrates are mainly composed of D-mannose (29.21%), D-fructose, (18.51%), L-sorbose (12.91%), D-galactose (5.47%) and D-Talose (5.21%). Ultra-fine nanoparticles of 11.60 ±4.65 nm comprising Cu 2 O and Cu(OH) 2 species were obtained with a carbohydrate and phenolic content of 35.6±3.2% and 3.13±0.05 mgGA/g, respectively. The impact of the biogenic Cu NPs on wheat seedling growth was dose-dependent. Upon treatment with 0.06 mg/mL of Cu NPs, the growth was promoted by 172.78 ± 23.11 and 215.94 ± 37.76% for wheat root and shoot, respectively. However, the lowest relative growth % of 81.94 ± 11.70 and 72.46 ± 18.78% were recorded for wheat root and shoot, respectively when applying 0.43 mg/mL of Cu NPs. At this concentration, peroxidase activity (POX) of the germinated wheat seeds also decreased, while ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities increased. Higher uptake of copper was observed in the root relative to the shoot implying the accumulation of the nanoparticles in the former. The uptake was also higher than that of the commercial Cu NPs, which showed an insignificant effect on the seedling growth. By treating the wheat leaves in foliar application with 0.06 mg/mL of Cu NPs, their contents of Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll were enhanced after 21 days of application. Meanwhile, the high concentration (0.43 mg/mL) of Cu NPs was the most effective in reducing the leaf content of chlorophyll (a, b, and total) after the same time of application. The findings of this study manifest the potential of utilizing controlled doses of the prepared biogenic Cu NPs for inhibition or stimulation of seedling growth."
https://openalex.org/W3153293980,"Molecular basis of protein stability at different temperatures is a fundamental problem in protein science that is substantially far from being accurately and quantitatively solved as it requires an explicit knowledge of the temperature dependence of folding free energy of amino acid residues. In the present study, we attempted to gain insights into the thermodynamic stability of SazCA and its implications on protein folding/unfolding. We report molecular dynamics simulations of water solvated SazCA in a temperature range of 293-393 K to study the relationship between the thermostability and flexibility. Our structural analysis shows that the protein maintains the highest structural stability at 353 K and the protein conformations are highly flexible at temperatures above 353 K. Larger exposure of hydrophobic surface residues to the solvent medium for conformations beyond 353 K were identified from H-bond analysis. Higher number of secondary structure contents exhibited by SazCA at 353 K corroborated the conformations at 353 K to exhibit the highest thermal stability. The analysis of thermodynamics of protein stability revealed that the conformations that denature at higher melting temperatures tend to have greater maximum thermal stability. Our analysis shows that 353 K conformations have the highest melting temperature, which was found to be close to the experimental optimum temperature. The enhanced protein stability at 353 K due the least value of heat capacity at unfolding suggested an increase in folding. Comparative Gibbs free energy analysis and funnel shaped energy landscape confirmed a transition in folding/unfolding pathway of SazCA at 353 K."
https://openalex.org/W3153746706,"Objective The chest X-ray (CXR) is the most readily available and common imaging modality for the assessment of pneumonia. However, detecting pneumonia from chest radiography is a challenging task, even for experienced radiologists. An artificial intelligence (AI) model might help to diagnose pneumonia from CXR more quickly and accurately. We aim to develop an AI model for pneumonia from CXR images and to evaluate diagnostic performance with external dataset. Methods To train the pneumonia model, a total of 157,016 CXR images from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Korean National Tuberculosis Association (KNTA) were used (normal vs. pneumonia = 120,722 vs.36,294). An ensemble model of two neural networks with DenseNet classifies each CXR image into pneumonia or not. To test the accuracy of the models, a separate external dataset of pneumonia CXR images (n = 212) from a tertiary university hospital (Gachon University Gil Medical Center GUGMC, Incheon, South Korea) was used; the diagnosis of pneumonia was based on both the chest CT findings and clinical information, and the performance evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Moreover, we tested the change of the AI probability score for pneumonia using the follow-up CXR images (7 days after the diagnosis of pneumonia, n = 100). Results When the probability scores of the models that have a threshold of 0.5 for pneumonia, two models (models 1 and 4) having different pre-processing parameters on the histogram equalization distribution showed best AUC performances of 0.973 and 0.960, respectively. As expected, the ensemble model of these two models performed better than each of the classification models with 0.983 AUC. Furthermore, the AI probability score change for pneumonia showed a significant difference between improved cases and aggravated cases (Δ = -0.06 ± 0.14 vs. 0.06 ± 0.09, for 85 improved cases and 15 aggravated cases, respectively, P = 0.001) for CXR taken as a 7-day follow-up. Conclusions The ensemble model combined two different classification models for pneumonia that performed at 0.983 AUC for an external test dataset from a completely different data source. Furthermore, AI probability scores showed significant changes between cases of different clinical prognosis, which suggest the possibility of increased efficiency and performance of the CXR reading at the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation for pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3154937563,"Multidomain proteins can have a complex evolutionary history that may involve de novo domain evolution, recruitment and / or recombination of existing domains and domain losses. Here, the domain evolution of the plant-specific Ca 2+ -permeable mechanosensitive channel protein, MID1-COMPLEMENTING ACTIVITY (MCA), was investigated. MCA, a multidomain protein, possesses a Ca 2+ -influx-MCA func domain and a PLAC8 domain. Profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of domains were assessed in 25 viridiplantae proteomes. While PLAC8 was detected in plants, animals, and fungi, MCA func was found in streptophytes but not in chlorophytes. Full MCA proteins were only found in embryophytes. We identified the MCA func domain in all streptophytes including charophytes where it appeared in E3 ubiquitin ligase-like proteins. Our Maximum Likelihood (ML) analyses suggested that the MCA func domain evolved early in the history of streptophytes. The PLAC8 domain showed similarity to Plant Cadmium Resistance ( PCR ) genes, and the coupling of MCA func and PLAC8 seemed to represent a single evolutionary event. This combination is unique in MCA, and does not exist in other plant mechanosensitive channels. Within angiosperms, gene duplications increased the number of MCAs. Considering their role in mechanosensing in roots, MCA might be instrumental for the rise of land plants. This study provides a textbook example of de novo domain emergence, recombination, duplication, and losses, leading to the convergence of function of proteins in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3155913708,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is frequently associated with gastrointestinal manifestations. Herein we evaluated the interest in measuring the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), a biomarker of intestinal injury, in COVID-19 patients. Methods Serum I-FABP was analyzed in 28 consecutive patients hospitalized for a PCR-confirmed COVID-19, in 24 hospitalized patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases, and 79 patients admitted to the emergency room for abdominal pain. Results I-FABP serum concentrations were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19, as compared to patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases [70.3 pg/mL (47–167.9) vs. 161.1 pg/mL (88.98–305.2), respectively, p = 0 . 008 ]. I-FABP concentrations in these two populations were significantly lower than in patients with abdominal pain without COVID-19 [344.8 pg/mL (268.9–579.6)]. I-FABP was neither associated with severity nor the duration of symptoms. I-FABP was correlated with polymorphonuclear cell counts. Conclusions In this pilot study, we observed a low I-FABP concentration in COVID-19 patients either with or without gastrointestinal symptoms, of which the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical impact remain to be established. Further explorations on a larger cohort of patients will be needed to unravel the molecular mechanism of such observation, including the effects of malabsorption and/or abnormal lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3156538086,"Aim To evaluate quantitatively the effects of the Epi-Off-CXL irradiance dose on the stromal stiffening of pig corneas. Setting Laboratory of Biological structures (LaBS), Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy. Methods Inflation tests have been carried on 90 excised and de-epithelized pig corneas, monitoring the change of configuration of the corneal dome at specific pressures. Test have been carried out twice on each cornea, once before and once after Epi-Off-CXL performed at a constant irradiance of 9 mW/cm 2 and variable UV-A exposure times. Corneas were grouped according to the exposure time (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min), proportional to the irradiation dose (1.35, 2.7, 5.4, 8.1, and 10.8 J/cm 2 ). A theoretical model based on linearized shell theory has been used to estimate the increment of the corneal stiffness. Results The linearized shell theory allowed to establish a quantitative relation between the increment of the stiffness parameters and the irradiation dose. Relative to the pre-treatment values, in all experiments the post-treatment corneal stiffness revealed a pronounced increase. In general, the stiffness gain increased with the exposure time. No significant differences in stiffening was observed between tests conducted at 2.5, 5, and 10 min exposure. Conclusions Qualitatively, the effectiveness of accelerated CXL treatments observed in pig corneas complies very well with in-vivo clinical results in humans, suggesting that experimental data in pigs can be very useful for the design of the procedure in humans. A larger irradiation dose provides a larger increment of the corneal stiffness. Due to the biological variability of the tissues, however, it is difficult to distinguish quantitatively the level of the reinforcement induced by accelerated protocols (low doses with &lt; = 10 min exposure), less prone to induce damage in the corneal tissue. Therefore, the definition of personalized treatments must be related to the actual biomechanics of the cornea."
https://openalex.org/W3155150351,"Human ORP3 belongs to the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family of lipid transfer proteins and is involved in lipid trafficking and cell signaling. ORP3 localizes to the ER-PM interfaces and is implicated in lipid transport and focal adhesion dynamics. Here, we report the 2.6–2.7 Å structures of the ORD (OSBP-related domain) of human ORP3 in apo-form and in complex with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. The ORP3 ORD displays a helix grip β-barrel fold with a deep hydrophobic pocket which is conserved in the OSBP gene family. ORP3 binds PI(4)P by the residues around tunnel entrance and in the hydrophobic pocket, whereas it lacks sterol binding due to the narrow hydrophobic tunnel. The heterologous expression of the ORDs of human ORP3 or OSBP1 rescued the lethality of seven ORP (yeast OSH1-OSH7 ) knockout in yeast. In contrast, the PI(4)P-binding site mutant of ORP3 did not complement the OSH knockout cells. The N-terminal PH domain and FFAT motif of ORP3 are involved in protein targeting but are not essential in yeast complementation. This observation suggests that the essential function conserved in the ORPs of yeast and human is mediated by PI(4)P-binding of the ORD domain. This study suggests that the non-vesicular PI(4)P transport is a conserved function of all ORPs in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W3156586545,"Background Hypofibrinolysis resulting from the up-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) usually occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), rendering them hypercoagulable. This study assessed the plasma antigen and activity levels of the PAI-1 enzyme in T2DM patients in a district hospital in Ghana. Methods This was a hospital-based case-control study conducted from December 2018 to May 2019 at Nkenkaasu District Hospital. Sixty subjects with T2DM (30 T2DM subjects with good glycemic control and 30 with poor glycemic control), and 30 apparently healthy blood donors were recruited into the study. Blood specimens were collected for complete blood count, lipid profile, PAI-1 Ag and PAI-1 activity levels. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to obtain demographic and clinical information. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 22.0. Results Elevated PAI-1 Ag and activity levels were observed in the T2DM subjects compared to the healthy controls, with the levels and activity significantly higher (PAI-1 Ag; p &lt; 0.001, PAI-1 activity level; p = 0.004) in the T2DM subjects with poor glycemic control in comparison to those with good glycemic control. A significant positive correlation was observed between HbA1c and PAI-1 enzymes. PAI-1 Ag levels significantly increased along with increased total cholesterol ( Β = 0.262, p = 0.033), triglyceride ( Β = -0.273, p = 0.034) and HbA1c ( Β = 0.419, p = 0.001). Similarly, PAI-1 activity level was associated with total cholesterol ( Β = 0.325, p = 0.009), triglyceride ( Β = -0.262, p = 0.042), HbA1c ( Β = 0.389, p = 0.003) and VLDL-c ( Β = -0.227, p = 0.029). Conclusion PAI-1 antigen/activity is enhanced in poorly controlled Ghanaian T2DM subjects. The hypercoagulable state of the affected individuals put them at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Good glycemic control to regulate plasma PAI-1 levels is essential during T2DM lifelong management. Markers of fibrinolysis should be assessed in these individuals and appropriate anticoagulants given to prevent thrombosis and adverse cardiovascular diseases."

Especially when the argument stimulate the emotionality of users, the content on Twitter is shared with extreme speed and thus studying the tweet sentiment if of utmost importance to predict the evolution of the discussions and the register of the relative narratives. In this article, we present a model able to reproduce the dynamics of the sentiments of tweets related to specific topics and periods and to provide a prediction of the sentiment of the future posts based on the observed past. The model is a recent variant of the Pólya urn, introduced and studied in Aletti and Crimaldi (2019, 2020), which is characterized by a “local” reinforcement, i.e. a reinforcement mechanism mainly based on the most recent observations, and by a random persistent fluctuation of the predictive mean. In particular, this latter feature is capable of capturing the trend fluctuations in the sentiment curve. While the proposed model is extremely general and may be also employed in other contexts, it has been tested on several Twitter data sets and demonstrated greater performances compared to the standard Pólya urn model. Moreover, the different performances on different data sets highlight different emotional sensitivities respect to a public event."
https://openalex.org/W3153338493,"Purpose Glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma represent the most commonly encountered high-grade-glioma (HGG) in adults. Although both neoplasms are very distinct entities in context of epidemiology, clinical course and prognosis, their appearance in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very similar. In search for additional information aiding the distinction of potentially confusable neoplasms, histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps recently proved to be auxiliary in a number of entities. Therefore, our present exploratory retrospective study investigated whether ADC histogram profile parameters differ significantly between anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma, reflect the proliferation index Ki-67, or are associated with the prognostic relevant MGMT (methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase) promotor methylation status. Methods Pre-surgical ADC volumes of 56 HGG patients were analyzed by histogram-profiling. Association between extracted histogram parameters and neuropathology including WHO-grade, Ki-67 expression and MGMT promotor methylation status was investigated due to comparative and correlative statistics. Results Grade IV gliomas were more heterogeneous than grade III tumors. More specifically, ADCmin and the lowest percentile ADCp10 were significantly lower, whereas ADCmax, ADC standard deviation and Skewness were significantly higher in the glioblastoma group. ADCmin, ADCmax, ADC standard deviation, Kurtosis and Entropy of ADC histogram were significantly correlated with Ki-67 expression. No significant difference could be revealed by comparison of ADC histogram parameters between MGMT promotor methylated and unmethylated HGG. Conclusions ADC histogram parameters differ significantly between glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma and show distinct associations with the proliferative activity in both HGG. Our results suggest ADC histogram profiling as promising biomarker for differentiation of both, however, further studies with prospective multicenter design are wanted to confirm and further elaborate this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W3153593740,"Background An intervention to potentiate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may reduce intrapulmonary shunt and hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation. Previous animal studies reported that repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli potentiated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, but no clinical study has examined the effects of this intervention on hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation. We thus performed a single-center, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli to the operative lung reduce hypoxemia during the subsequent one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery. Methods Patients undergoing one-lung ventilation were randomized into two groups (n = 68 each). Before one-lung ventilation, in the intermittent hypoxia group, the nondependent lung was not ventilated for 2 min and then ventilated for 2 min while the dependent lung was continuously ventilated. This was repeated five times. In the continuous normoxia group, both lungs were ventilated for 20 min. We measured SpO 2 , PaO 2 , FiO 2 , PaCO 2 , SaO 2 , and central venous oxygen saturation during one-lung ventilation. The primary outcome was the number of patients with hypoxemia defined as a SpO 2 &lt;95% during one-lung ventilation, which was analyzed with a chi-squared test. Results Hypoxemia was less frequent in the intermittent hypoxia group than in the continuous normoxia group during OLV [6/68 (8.8%) vs 17/68 (25.0%), risk ratio (95% CI) 0.35 (0.15–0.84), p = 0.012]. The PaO 2 (p = 0.008 for 30 min and 0.007 for 60 min) and PaO 2 /FiO 2 (p = 0.008 for both) were higher 30 and 60 min after starting one-lung ventilation, and the alveolar-arterial pressure gradient (p = 0.010) and shunt index (p = 0.008) were lower 30 min after starting one-lung ventilation in the intermittent hypoxia group than in the continuous normoxia group. Postoperative adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions Repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli to the operative lung seemed to potentiate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and thus reduced hypoxemia during the subsequent one-lung ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W3156563306,"Compartmentalization of animal and human skeletal muscle by multiple motor nerve branches known as the neuromuscular compartment (NMC) has been observed primarily in muscles that participate in a plane of motion. In this context, the peroneus longus muscle contributes to eversion and plantarflexion of the ankle and the presence of NMCs has been reported. However, no research has reported the selective activation of the compartments of the peroneus longus during the performance of different ankle movements. The purpose of this research was to determine the contribution of peroneus longus NMCs, through multi-channel surface electromyography (sEMG), to eversion and plantarflexion movements. Multi-channel sEMG was recorded from the peroneus longus muscle by using an electrode grid during eversion and plantarflexion of the ankle at 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). The root mean square and displacement of the center of mass position in the X (COMx) and Y (COMy) components were calculated. The primary finding was that eversion showed significantly higher sEMG amplitude than plantarflexion in the posterior compartment in low, moderate, and high percentages of MVIC. However, no significant difference in sEMG amplitude was observed in the anterior compartment between eversion and plantarflexion. In addition, a posterior displacement of the COMx in eversion compared to plantarflexion in all MVIC percentages, with greater topographic distancing of the COMx at higher levels of activation. In conclusion, the peroneus longus muscle presented NMCs; the anterior compartment contributed to both eversion and plantarflexion movements, whereas the posterior compartment mainly contributed to the eversion movement of the ankle in low, moderate, and high percentages of MVIC."
https://openalex.org/W3153848700,"Background Missing values are a key issue in the statistical analysis of proteomic data. Defining the strategy to address missing values is a complex task in each study, potentially affecting the quality of statistical analyses. Results We have developed OptiMissP, a dashboard to visually and qualitatively evaluate missingness and guide decision making in the handling of missing values in proteomics studies that use data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. It provides a set of visual tools to retrieve information about missingness through protein densities and topology-based approaches, and facilitates exploration of different imputation methods and missingness thresholds. Conclusions OptiMissP provides support for researchers’ and clinicians’ qualitative assessment of missingness in proteomic datasets in order to define study-specific strategies for the handling of missing values. OptiMissP considers biases in protein distributions related to the choice of imputation method and helps analysts to balance the information loss caused by low missingness thresholds and the noise introduced by selecting high missingness thresholds. This is complemented by topological data analysis which provides additional insight to the structure of the data and their missingness. We use an example in Chronic Kidney Disease to illustrate the main functionalities of OptiMissP."
https://openalex.org/W3154523409,"Pathological narcissism is a term often applied to former President Donald Trump, but it has been less examined as a potential predictor of voting for him. Trump projects a grandiose and omnipotent self-image during press conferences and rallies, and his followers at these events often respond with both effusive admiration and an inflated sense of their own self-regard, all of which are aspects of narcissism. However, while Trump’s personal narcissism has been well documented, there is little research on the narcissism of his supporters. In this study we conducted an exploratory analysis examining the hierarchical structure of pathological narcissism and which aspects of narcissism within that structure were associated with intended voting for Trump in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in a sample of U.S. residents collected online ( N = 495) using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Results indicated that an eight-echelon hierarchy best fit the data. Within this hierarchy, antagonistic and indifferent aspects of narcissism within the fifth echelon best predicted intended voting for Trump over and above relevant demographic variables. These results have implications for the study of narcissism and, especially given the results of the 2020 election, the degree to which one can make use of narcissistic aspects of personality in political contests."
https://openalex.org/W3154926188,"Atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3 (formerly CXCR7) is a scavenging receptor that has recently been implicated in murine lymphatic development. Specifically, ACKR3-deficiency was shown to result in lymphatic hyperplasia and lymphedema, in addition to cardiac hyperplasia and cardiac valve defects leading to embryonic lethality. The lymphatic phenotype was attributed to a lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-intrinsic scavenging function of ACKR3 for the vascular peptide hormone adrenomedullin (AM), which is also important during postnatal lymphangiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the expression of ACKR3 in the lymphatic vasculature of adult mice and its function in postnatal lymphatic development and function. We show that ACKR3 is widely expressed in mature lymphatics and that it exerts chemokine-scavenging activity in cultured murine skin-derived LECs. To investigate the role of LEC-expressed ACKR3 in postnatal lymphangiogenesis and function during adulthood, we generated and validated a lymphatic-specific, inducible ACKR3 knockout mouse. Surprisingly, in contrast to the reported involvement of ACKR3 in lymphatic development, our analyses revealed no contribution of LEC-expressed ACKR3 to postnatal lymphangiogenesis, lymphatic morphology and drainage function."
https://openalex.org/W3155213739,"Background Poor mental health often interrupts people’s regular activities making them unable to work effectively resulting in poor performance and high turnover intention. We examined the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress among waiters in upscale restaurants. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study involved 384 waiters in upscale restaurants in the Accra Metropolis. Data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire which embedded DASS-21 (Cronbach Alpha = 0.815). The analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics using STATA 15. Statistical significance was set at p-value &lt;0.05 at 95% confidence interval. Results The prevalence of depression was 38.3%, while anxiety and stress were 52.3% and 34.4% respectively. Females (AOR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.02–2.79), waiters who foresee a better remuneration (AOR = 3.09, 95%CI = 1.95–4.87), consume caffeine (AOR = 1.44, 95%CI = 0.90–2.32), and use non-prescription drugs (AOR = 2.22, 95%CI = 1.39–3.55) were more likely to have depression. Females (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI = 1.17–2.96), those who foresee better remuneration (AOR = 2.85, 95%CI = 1.82–4.49), and those who use non-prescription drugs (AOR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.38–3.28) were more likely to have anxiety. Females (AOR = 1.74, 95%CI = 1.01–2.99), waiters who are positive of career success (AOR = 1.70, 95%CI = 0.99–2.91), who foresee better remuneration (AOR = 2.99, 95%CI = 1.85–4.83), consume caffeine (AOR = 1.54, 95%CI = 0.93–2.54), and who use non-prescription drugs (AOR = 3.16, 95%CI = 1.93–5.17) were more likely to be stressed. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of poor mental health among waiters. Urgent intervention by hospitality stakeholders is needed to improve their working conditions and psychosocial health to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal of promoting mental health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3156240274,"Hypospadias (H) is a common birth defect affecting the male urinary tract. It has been suggested that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals might increase the risk of H by altering urethral development. However, whether H risk is increased in places heavily exposed to agricultural pesticides, such as vineyards, remains debated and difficult to ascertain. The objective of the work is to test the possible association of H with residential proximity to vineyards. Residential address at birth of 8,766 H cases born 1980–2011 was taken from 17 specialized surgery centers. The geographical distribution of vineyards was obtained from the European Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) and the distance of address to the nearest vineyard was computed. A first estimate of the variation of H relative risk with distance to vineyards was obtained using as controls 13,105 cryptorchidism (C) cases operated during the same period in the same centers. A separate estimate was obtained from a case-control study using “virtual controls” (VC) defined as points of the map sampled to match the demographic distribution of births within the recruitment territories of the study centers. Non-exposed patients were defined as those with a residence between 5,000 and 10,000 m from the closest vineyard. The residential distance to vineyard was smaller for H than for C cases (p&lt;10 −4 ). We found 42/8766 H cases (0.48%) and 50/13,105 C cases (0.38%) born to mothers living within 20 m of a vineyard. The odds ratios for H were 2.48 (CI: 1.0 to 5.1) and 2.4 (CI: 1.3 to 4.4), vs C or vs VC, respectively, when pregnant mothers lived 10–20 m from a vineyard. In conclusion, our study supports that children born to mothers living close to a vineyard have a two-fold increased risk of H. For environmental research, the use of VC provides an alternative to classical case control technique."
https://openalex.org/W3156678664,"A loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay combined with a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LAMP-LFB) was established for the rapid and accurate detection of the mobilized colistin resistance gene ( mcr-1 ), which causes the loss of colistin antibacterial efficacy in clinical treatments. The amplification stage of the assay was completed in 60 min at 63°C, and the reaction products could be visually detected by employing the LFB, which provided a fast (within 2 min) and objective method to evaluate the amplification results. The LAMP assay amplified the target sequences of mcr-1 with high specificity. In pure strains, the detection limit of the LAMP-LFB assay was 360 fg plasmid DNA/reaction, and in spiked feces samples the value was approximately 6.3×10 3 CFU/mL (~6.3 CFU/reaction), which was tenfold more sensitive than the PCR assay. The results show that the developed LAMP-LFB assay will be a worthy tool for the simple, rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of mcr-1 gene in clinical settings and resource-limited areas."
https://openalex.org/W3153868553,"We investigated the impact of visual impairment on balance control. We measured the center of pressure (COP) between the two feet and plantar surface pressures on each foot in 18 normal-sighted participants and compared their data with measures from 18 legally blind participants, either acquired or congenital. Pressures were measured in open- and closed-eye conditions using a baropodometric resistive plate. In the eyes-open condition, there were no differences between the sighted and legally blind groups in COP displacement. However, participants with visual loss had significantly increased pressures in two metatarsal regions (M1 and M2 zones) of the plantar surface in both viewing conditions (p &lt; 0.05). The differences in pressure measures between the normally sighted and legally blind groups could be attributed mainly to the subgroup of subjects with acquired impairment. Our findings suggest that subjects with visual impairment present increased metatarsal pressures (i.e. forefoot), not yet associated to anterior displacement of COP or impaired balance control."
https://openalex.org/W3154024952,"Gastric carcinogenesis is associated with alterations of microRNAs (miRNAs) and reversal of these alterations may be a crucial element in cancer prevention. Here we evaluate the influence of H . pylori eradication, low-dose aspirin (LDA), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) on modification of inflammatory mucosal miRNAs miR-155 and miR-223 in Helicobacter pylori -infected and non-infected subjects. The study was performed in two parts: 1) interventional study in 20 healthy subjects with and without H . pylori infection or following eradication (each n = 10) where LDA (100 mg) was given daily for 7 days; 2) prospective case-control observational study (n = 188). MiR-155 and miR-223 expression was strongly linked to H . pylori -infection and in short-term view showed a trend for reversal after eradication. Daily LDA as well as regular NSAIDs showed no influence on miRNAs expression both in healthy subjects and patients, while regular PPI intake was associated with lower miR-155 expression in antrum of patients with chronic gastritis independent of density of neutrophils and mononuclear infiltrate. In summary, PPI but not LDA or NSAIDs were associated with modification of inflammatory miRNAs miR-155 and miR-223 in an H . pylori dependent manner. The functional role of inflammatory miR-155 and miR-223 in understanding of H . pylori -related diseases needs further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3156085726,"Following curative immunotherapy of B16F10 tumors, ~60% of mice develop a strong antibody response against cell-surface tumor antigens. Their antisera confer prophylactic protection against intravenous challenge with B16F10 cells, and also cross-react with syngeneic and allogeneic tumor cell lines MC38, EL.4, 4T1, and CT26. We identified the envelope glycoprotein (env) of a murine endogenous retrovirus (ERV) as the antigen accounting for the majority of this humoral response. A systemically administered anti-env monoclonal antibody cloned from such a response protects against tumor challenge, and prophylactic vaccination against the env protein protects a majority of naive mice from tumor establishment following subcutaneous inoculation with B16F10 cells. These results suggest the potential for effective prophylactic vaccination against analogous HERV-K env expressed in numerous human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3156366494,"Vaporization of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds pollutes the air and causes health hazards at gasoline stations. This study revealed the risk of BTEX exposure according to the hazardous area classification at gasoline stations. The risk assessment of gasoline workers from a representative group of 47 stations, which followed the United States Environmental Protection Agency-IRIS method of assessing BTEX exposure, was expressed as the hazard index (HI). A result of matrix multipliers of the hazardous exposure index and fire possibility from flammable gas classified hazardous area-I and area-II at the fuel dispensers. BTEX concentrations were actively sampled in ambient air and a flammable gas detector was used to measure the flammability level. Results showed that the BTEX concentrations from ambient air monitoring were in the range of 0.1–136.9, 8.1–406.0, 0.8–24.1 and 0.4–105.5 ppb for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, respectively, which exceeded the NIOSH exposure limit of 100 ppb of benzene concentration. The risk assessment indicated that five stations reached an unacceptable risk of worker exposure to BTEX (HI&gt;1), which correlated with the numbers of gasoline dispensers and daily gasoline sold. The risk matrix classified hazardous area-I at 4 meters and hazardous area-II at 4–8 meters in radius around the fuel dispensers. This study revealed the hazardous areas at gasoline stations and suggests that entrepreneurs must strictly control the safety operation practice of workers, install vapor recovery systems on dispenser nozzles to control BTEX vaporization and keep the hazardous areas clear of fire ignition sources within an eight-meter radius of the dispensers."
https://openalex.org/W3153349210,"A central goal in systems neuroscience is to understand the functions performed by neural circuits. Previous top-down models addressed this question by comparing the behaviour of an ideal model circuit, optimised to perform a given function, with neural recordings. However, this requires guessing in advance what function is being performed, which may not be possible for many neural systems. To address this, we propose an inverse reinforcement learning (RL) framework for inferring the function performed by a neural network from data. We assume that the responses of each neuron in a network are optimised so as to drive the network towards ‘rewarded’ states, that are desirable for performing a given function. We then show how one can use inverse RL to infer the reward function optimised by the network from observing its responses. This inferred reward function can be used to predict how the neural network should adapt its dynamics to perform the same function when the external environment or network structure changes. This could lead to theoretical predictions about how neural network dynamics adapt to deal with cell death and/or varying sensory stimulus statistics."
https://openalex.org/W3154259851,"A major challenge for cell-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is to distinguish individual presumptive fetal cells from maternal cells in female pregnancies. We have sought a rapid, robust, versatile, and low-cost next-generation sequencing method to facilitate this process. Toward this goal, single isolated cells underwent whole genome amplification prior to genotyping. Multiple highly polymorphic genomic regions (including HLA-A and HLA-B) with 10–20 very informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a 200 bp interval were amplified with a modified method based on other publications. To enhance the power of cell identification, approximately 40 Human Identification SNP (Applied Biosystems) test amplicons were also utilized. Using SNP results to compare to sex chromosome data from NGS as a reliable standard, the true positive rate for genotyping was 83.4%, true negative 6.6%, false positive 3.3%, and false negative 6.6%. These results would not be sufficient for clinical diagnosis, but they demonstrate the general validity of the approach and suggest that deeper genotyping of single cells could be completely reliable. A paternal DNA sample is not required using this method. The assay also successfully detected pathogenic variants causing Tay Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, and hemoglobinopathies in single lymphoblastoid cells, and disease-causing variants in three cell-based NIPT cases. This method could be applicable for any monogenic diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3155226631,"This paper examines the impact of widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) on urban structure worldwide. Has it offset agglomeration benefits and led to more dispersed spatial structures, or has it strengthened urban externalities and thus resulted in more concentrated spatial structures? Theoretical and empirical studies on this question have produced contradictory findings. The present study recognizes that assumptions made earlier about the evolution of technological capabilities do not necessarily hold today. As cutting-edge digital technologies have matured considerably, a fresh look at this question is called for. The paper addresses this issue by means of several data sets using instrumental variable methods. One is the UN data on Urban Settlements with more than 300, 000 inhabitants. Estimation methods with these data show that increased adoption of ICT has resulted in national urban systems that are less uniform in terms of city sizes and are characterized by higher population concentrations in larger cities, when concentration is proxied the Pareto (Zipf) coefficient for national city size distributions. Two, is disaggregated data for the urban systems of the US, defined as Micropolitan and Metropolitan Areas, and for the UK, defined as Built-up Areas in England and Wales, respectively. These data allow for the impacts to be studied for cities smaller than those included in the cross-country data. Increased internet usage improved a city’s ranking in the US urban system. Similarly, increased download speed improves a built-up area’s ranking in England and Wales."
https://openalex.org/W3154226193,"Introduction Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is increasingly being implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Kenya contribute more than half of all new infections among young people aged 15–24 years, highlighting the need for evidence on the cost of PrEP in real-world implementation to inform the budget impact, cost-effectiveness, and financial sustainability of PrEP programs. Methods We estimated the cost of delivering PrEP to AGYW enrolled in a PrEP implementation study in two family planning clinics in Kisumu county, located in western Kenya. We derived total annual costs and the average cost per client-month of PrEP by input type (variable or fixed) and visit type (initiation or follow-up). We estimated all costs as implemented in the study, and under implementation by the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH), both at the program volume observed and if the facilities were delivering PrEP at full capacity (scaled-MoH). Results For the costing period between March 2018 and March 2019, 615 HIV-negative women contributed 1,128 (502 initiation and 626 follow-up) visits. The average cost per client-month of PrEP dispensed per study protocol and per the MoH scenario was $28.92 and $14.52, respectively. If the MoH scaled the program so that facilities could see PrEP clients at capacity, the average cost per client-month of PrEP was $10.88. Medication costs accounted for the largest proportion of the total annual costs (48% in MoH scenario and 65% in the scaled-MoH scenario). Conclusions Using data from a PrEP implementation program, we found that the cost per client-month of PrEP dispensed is reduced by 62% if PrEP delivery at the two clinics is scaled up by the MoH. Our findings are valuable for informing local resource allocation and budgetary cost projections for scale-up of PrEP delivery to AGYW. Additionally, previous cost-effectiveness studies have been limited by the use of fixed assumptions of the cost of PrEP per person-month. Our study provides cost estimates from practical data which will better inform cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses."

While a substantial gender gap in overconfidence is observed, it only correlates with some sub-indices of gender equality. We conclude that there is likely a weak relationship between OC gender gap and gender inequality."
https://openalex.org/W3155704888,"Visual characteristics are among the most important features for characterizing the phenotype of biological organisms. Color and geometric properties define population phenotype and allow assessing diversity and adaptation to environmental conditions. To analyze geometric properties classical morphometrics relies on biologically relevant landmarks which are manually assigned to digital images. Assigning landmarks is tedious and error prone. Predefined landmarks may in addition miss out on information which is not obvious to the human eye. The machine learning (ML) community has recently proposed new data analysis methods which by uncovering subtle features in images obtain excellent predictive accuracy. Scientific credibility demands however that results are interpretable and hence to mitigate the black-box nature of ML methods. To overcome the black-box nature of ML we apply complementary methods and investigate internal representations with saliency maps to reliably identify location specific characteristics in images of Nile tilapia populations. Analyzing fish images which were sampled from six Ethiopian lakes reveals that deep learning improves on a conventional morphometric analysis in predictive performance. A critical assessment of established saliency maps with a novel significance test reveals however that the improvement is aided by artifacts which have no biological interpretation. More interpretable results are obtained by a Bayesian approach which allows us to identify genuine Nile tilapia body features which differ in dependence of the animals habitat. We find that automatically inferred Nile tilapia body features corroborate and expand the results of a landmark based analysis that the anterior dorsum, the fish belly, the posterior dorsal region and the caudal fin show signs of adaptation to the fish habitat. We may thus conclude that Nile tilapia show habitat specific morphotypes and that a ML analysis allows inferring novel biological knowledge in a reproducible manner."
https://openalex.org/W3156099644,"While there is substantial literature about the socio-cultural characteristics and values associated with recreational and commercial fisheries in the U.S., studies directed at those who ‘fish for food’—those who depend on consuming their catch to various degrees—are relatively sparse. Using qualitative data collected through 80 semi-structured interviews with fishers in the summer and fall of 2018 in Carteret County, North Carolina, this study aims to better understand the group of recreational fishers who consume their catch by describing social and cultural dimensions and values associated with fishing for food, examining the role of infrastructure in facilitating access to benefits associated with this activity, and considering how knowledge of existing licensing regulations surrounding subsistence license waivers affect this fishing community. Interviews conducted at free public fishing structures in the region revealed that fishers derive a variety of values and benefits from fishing at these sites, including access to recreation, nutrition, a social community, and mental health benefits, which were found to be negatively impacted by Hurricane Florence in September 2018. We also found an informal economy of sharing catch on- and off-site that extends the reach and benefits facilitated by public infrastructure to people beyond those using it directly. Overall, we call for conceptualizations of ‘fishing for food’ that include aspects that go beyond traditional definitions of ‘subsistence’ or ‘recreational’ fishing such as food security, access, and less obvious social and cultural motivations behind the activity. These findings are a compelling rationalization for the creation and maintenance of formal and informal fishing places locally and, by extension, in other coastal areas, given the array of benefits provided by access to these types of locations."

A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among five hundred and five (505) healthcare providers and facility managers across the three levels of healthcare delivery. An adapted questionnaire from NoMad instrument was used to collect data on the integration of EmONC from the study participants. Ethical approval was obtained and informed consents taken from the participants. Both descriptive (frequency, percentage, mean and median) and inferential analyses (Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney tests) were done with statistical significance level of p&lt;0.05 using STATA 14. The mean age of respondents was 38.68±8.27. The results showed that the EmONC integration median score at the three levels of healthcare delivery was high (77 (IQR = 83–71)). The EmONC integration median score were 76 (IQR = 84–70), 76 (IQR = 80–68) and 78 (IQR = 84–74) in the primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities respectively. Integration of EmONC was highest (83 (IQR = 87–78)) among healthcare providers who had EmONC training and also had EmONC guidelines made available to them. There were significant differences in EmONC integration at the three levels of healthcare delivery ( p = 0.046), among healthcare providers who had EmONC training and those with EmONC guidelines available in their maternity units ( p = 0.001). EmONC integration was reportedly high and significantly associated with EmONC training and availability of guidelines. However, the congruence of reported and actual extent of integration of EmONC at the three levels of healthcare delivery still need validation as such would account for the implementation success and maternal-neonatal outcomes."

Out of 27 treatment-naïve patients, 17 NS5B sequences (amino acids 221–345) from treatment-naïve patients and one sample of non-responders were successfully amplified. Nucleotide sequences have been aligned, translated into amino acids, and compared to drug resistance mutations reported in the literature. Results NS5B amino acid sequence analysis ensures several novel NS5B mutations existence (more than 40 substitution mutations) that have not been previously documented to be correlated with a resistant phenotype. It was found that K304R (82.4%), E327D and P300T (76.5% each) substitutions were the most distributed in the tested samples, respectively. S282T, the major resistance mutation that induces high sofosbuvir-resistance level in addition to other reported mutations (L320F/C) and (C316Y/N) were not recognized. Q309R mutation is a ribavirin-associated resistance, which was recognized in one strain (5.9%) of genotype 1g sequences. Besides, one substitution mutation (E237G) was identified in the successfully amplified non-responder sample. Conclusion Our study showed various combinations of mutations in the analyzed NS5B genes which could enhance the possibility of therapy failure in patients administered regimens including multiple DAA."
https://openalex.org/W3085184538,"As discussed in previous studies, the efficacy of evolutionary or reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous control optimization can be enhanced by including a neural module dedicated to feature extraction trained through self-supervised methods. In this paper we report additional experiments supporting this hypothesis and we demonstrate how the advantage provided by feature extraction is not limited to problems that benefit from dimensionality reduction or that involve agents operating on the basis of allocentric perception. We introduce a method that permits to continue the training of the feature-extraction module during the training of the policy network and that increases the efficacy of feature extraction. Finally, we compare alternative feature-extracting methods and we show that sequence-to-sequence learning yields better results than the methods considered in previous studies."

C57BL/6 mice and Balb/c mice are fed Bifidobacterium longum , a well-characterized probiotic bacterial species shown to change behavior and improve sociability of Balb/c mice. After feeding, RNA was extracted from whole brains and PCR arrays were utilized to determine changes in the gene expression of brain-specific miRNAs. The results of these PCR arrays reveal that the relative gene expression of mmu-mir-652-3p is sensitive to B . longum probiotic treatment in C57BL/6 mice. qPCR was performed to measure expression of Dab1, an mRNA target of this miRNA. Dab1 expression is also dependent on B . longum . The goal of this study is to further understand the relationship between the gut microbiota and its impacts on neurological gene expression and brain function."
https://openalex.org/W3152545247,"Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage kidney failure, but transplanted allograft could be affected by viral and bacterial infections and by immune rejection. The standard test for the diagnosis of acute pathologies in kidney transplants is kidney biopsy. However, noninvasive tests would be desirable. Various methods using different techniques have been developed by the transplantation community. But these methods require improvements. We present here a cost-effective method for kidney rejection diagnosis that estimates donor/recipient-specific DNA fraction in recipient urine by sequencing urinary cell DNA. We hypothesized that in the no-pathology stage, the largest tissue types present in recipient urine are donor kidney cells, and in case of rejection, a larger number of recipient immune cells would be observed. Extensive in-silico simulation was used to tune the sequencing parameters: number of variants and depth of coverage. Sequencing of DNA mixture from 2 healthy individuals showed the method is highly predictive (maximum error &lt; 0.04). We then demonstrated the insignificant impact of familial relationship and ethnicity using an in-house and public database. Lastly, we performed deep DNA sequencing of urinary cell pellets from 32 biopsy-matched samples representing two pathology groups: acute rejection (AR, 11 samples) and acute tubular injury (ATI, 12 samples) and 9 samples with no pathology. We found a significant association between the donor/recipient-specific DNA fraction in the two pathology groups compared to no pathology (P = 0.0064 for AR and P = 0.026 for ATI). We conclude that deep DNA sequencing of urinary cells from kidney allograft recipients offers a noninvasive means of diagnosing acute pathologies in the human kidney allograft."
https://openalex.org/W3152909049,"Background The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has global impact, Wuhan in Hubei province is a high-risk area. And the older people in nursing homes are the most susceptible group to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to describe the practice and experience of the first-line medical team, to provide insights of coping with COVID-19 in China. Method This qualitative study used a descriptive phenomenological design to describe the experience of medical staff supported the nursing homes in Wuhan fighting against COVID-19. Unstructured interviews via online video were conducted with seven medical staffs who supported the nursing homes in Wuhan. Data were analyzed using content analysis in five main themes: for nursing homes, we interviewed the difficulties faced at the most difficult time, services for the older people, and prevention and management strategies, for the medical staff, the psychological experience were interviewed, and the implications for public health emergencies were also reported. Conclusions It is imperative that effective preventive and response measures be implemented to face the outbreak of COVID-19 and meet the care needs of older people in the context of COVID-19. Implications Findings will inform managers of some reasonable instructional strategies for implementing effective infection management. Nursing homes need to provide targeted services to help alleviating their bad psychology for residents."
https://openalex.org/W3153935769,"Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), evolved rapidly in the United States. This report describes the demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of 544 U.S. persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 with complete SARS-CoV-2 testing in the beginning stages of the pandemic from January 17 through February 29, 2020. Methods In this surveillance cohort, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided consultation to public health and healthcare professionals to identify PUI for SARS-CoV-2 testing by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of PUI were reported by public health and healthcare professionals during consultation with on-call CDC clinicians and subsequent submission of a CDC PUI Report Form. Characteristics of laboratory-negative and laboratory-positive persons were summarized as proportions for the period of January 17−February 29, and characteristics of all PUI were compared before and after February 12 using prevalence ratios. Results A total of 36 PUI tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were classified as confirmed cases. Confirmed cases and PUI testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 had similar demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics. Consistent with changes in PUI evaluation criteria, 88% (13/15) of confirmed cases detected before February 12, 2020, reported travel from China. After February 12, 57% (12/21) of confirmed cases reported no known travel- or contact-related exposures. Conclusions These findings can inform preparedness for future pandemics, including capacity for rapid expansion of novel diagnostic tests to accommodate broad surveillance strategies to assess community transmission, including potential contributions from asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections."
https://openalex.org/W3154831708,"Objectives Emotional manipulation is an important strategy in social interaction. The English version of MEOS-SF has been developed to make the measurement of such manipulation ability more efficient. The purpose of the current study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of MEOS-SF. Methods Explore factor analysis and Confirmatory factor analysis were adopted to examine the Chinese version of the MEOS-SF factor structure in 645 Chinese participants (mean age = 24.68 ± 6.01 years) recruited online. Results Factor analysis supported a new three-factor model that included Conceal, Prosocial, and Non-prosocial, different from the original English MEOS-SF. Enhance and Divert merged to Prosocial factor while Worsen and Inauthentic merged to Non-prosocial factor because both prosocial and non-prosocial pairs had similar objectives, which would be perceived as the same thing by people in Eastern culture. As expected, MEOS-SF factors were found to be correlated with the Big Five, psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism, and trait EI. Conclusions Our results suggested that the Chinese version of MEOS-SF had acceptable psychometric properties and could be used to assess emotional manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W3155343741,"When people confuse and reject a non-word that is created by switching two adjacent letters from an actual word, is called the transposition confusability effect (TCE). The TCE is known to occur at the very early stages of visual word recognition with such unit exchange as letters or syllables, but little is known about the brain mechanisms of TCE. In this study, we examined the neural correlates of TCE and the effect of a morpheme boundary placement on TCE. We manipulated the placement of a morpheme boundary by exchanging places of two syllables embedded in Korean morphologically complex words made up of lexical morpheme and grammatical morpheme. In the two experimental conditions, the transposition syllable within-boundary condition (TSW) involved exchanging two syllables within the same morpheme, whereas the across-boundary condition (TSA) involved the exchange of syllables across the stem and grammatical morpheme boundary. During fMRI, participants performed the lexical decision task. Behavioral results revealed that the TCE was found in TSW condition, and the morpheme boundary, which is manipulated in TSA, modulated the TCE. In the fMRI results, TCE induced activation in the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The IPS activation was specific to a TCE and its strength of activation was associated with task performance. Furthermore, two functional networks were involved in the TCE: the central executive network and the dorsal attention network. Morpheme boundary modulation suppressed the TCE by recruiting the prefrontal and temporal regions, which are the key regions involved in semantic processing. Our findings propose the role of the dorsal visual pathway in syllable position processing and that its interaction with other higher cognitive systems is modulated by the morphological boundary in the early phases of visual word recognition."
