Most CNS macrophages emerge during development, with the exception of choroid plexus and dural macrophages, which are replaced by monocytes in adulthood. Whether microglia and BAMs share a developmental program or arise from separate lineages remains unknown. Here, we identified two phenotypically, transcriptionally, and locally distinct brain macrophages throughout development, giving rise to either microglia or BAMs. Two macrophage populations were already present in the yolk sac suggesting an early segregation. Fate-mapping models revealed that BAMs mostly derived from early erythro-myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. The development of microglia was dependent on TGF-β, whereas the genesis of BAMs occurred independently of this cytokine. Collectively, our data show that developing parenchymal and non-parenchymal brain macrophages are separate entities in terms of ontogeny, gene signature, and requirement for TGF-β.

Microglia are the resident macrophages in the CNS parenchyma and are derived from primitive macrophages (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F. Greter M. Leboeuf M. Nandi S. See P. Gokhan S. Mehler M.F.

With the establishment of the blood circulation, these primitive macrophages migrate into the developing brain at E9.5 where they give rise to microglia (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F. Greter M.

The molecular signature of microglia is shaped by a combination of CNS-derived signals and ontogeny (Bennett et al., 2018Bennett F.C. Bennett M.L. Yaqoob F. Mulinyawe S.B. Grant G.A.

In addition, recent reports revealed microglia heterogeneity across different regions and different ages in the healthy brain (Hammond et al., 2019Hammond T.R. Dufort C. Dissing-Olesen L. Giera S.

In comparison to microglia, the ontogeny, function, and transcriptome of non-parenchymal brain macrophages (i.e., border-associated macrophages [BAMs]) during embryogenesis or adulthood is less well characterized. Non-parenchymal macrophages reside at the borders of the CNS, namely, the choroid plexus, meninges, and perivascular spaces. It was suggested that subdural and perivascular macrophages arise from the same embryonic precursor as microglia, while choroid plexus macrophages have a dual origin being replaced with time by adult bone marrow (BM) monocytes (Goldmann et al., 2016Goldmann T. Wieghofer P. Jordão M.J. Prutek F. Hagemeyer N. Frenzel K. Amann L. Staszewski O. Kierdorf K. Krueger M. et al.Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces.Nat.

Neurosci. 2019; 22: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Yet, precursors emerging after the appearance of early EMPs and the initial wave of primitive hematopoiesis appear to contribute to some extent to the pool of macrophages in the choroid plexus and the pia mater (Goldmann et al., 2016Goldmann T. Wieghofer P. Jordão M.J. Prutek F. Hagemeyer N. Frenzel K. Amann L. Staszewski O. Kierdorf K. Krueger M. et al.Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the origin of macrophages in the dura mater, which contains a more permissive barrier harboring a network of lymphatic and blood vessels is to date unknown (Antila et al., 2017Antila S. Karaman S. Nurmi H. Airavaara M. Voutilainen M.H. Mathivet T. Chilov D. Li Z. Koppinen T. Park J.H. et al.Development and plasticity of meningeal lymphatic vessels.J. Exp.

Lee K.S. et al.Structural and functional features of central nervous system lymphatic vessels.Nature. 2015; 523: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Similar to most other macrophage populations, both BAMs and microglia are dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) signaling (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F. Greter M. Leboeuf M. Nandi S. See P. Gokhan S. Mehler M.F. Conway S.J. Ng L.G.

Neurosci. 2019; 22: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, the differentiation of microglia and BAMs relies on the transcription factors PU.1 and IRF8 (Goldmann et al., 2016Goldmann T. Wieghofer P. Jordão M.J. Prutek F. Hagemeyer N. Frenzel K. Amann L. Staszewski O. Kierdorf K. Krueger M. et al.Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces.Nat.

Neurosci. 2019; 22: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It was also previously suggested that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is critical for microglia development including the induction of microglia signature genes (Butovsky et al., 2014Butovsky O. Jedrychowski M.P. Moore C.S. Cialic R. Lanser A.J. Gabriely G. Koeglsperger T. Dake B. Wu P.M. Doykan C.E. et al.Identification of a unique TGF-β-dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Postnatal deletion of Tgfbr2 in microglia leads to their activation (Arnold et al., 2019Arnold T.D. Lizama C.O. Cautivo K.M. Santander N. Lin L. Qiu H. Huang E.J. Liu C. Mukouyama Y.S. Reichardt L.F. et al.Impaired αVβ8 and TGFβ signaling lead to microglial dysmaturation and neuromotor dysfunction.J. Exp.

Commun. 2018; 9: 4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) indicating that this pathway regulates microglial homeostatic functions. As a consequence, long-term loss of TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR) signaling in microglia or monocyte-derived microglia-like cells caused fatal demyelinating disease or neuromotor dysfunction (Arnold et al., 2019Arnold T.D. Lizama C.O. Cautivo K.M. Santander N. Lin L. Qiu H. Huang E.J. Liu C. Mukouyama Y.S. Reichardt L.F. et al.Impaired αVβ8 and TGFβ signaling lead to microglial dysmaturation and neuromotor dysfunction.J. Exp.

Hedlund E. et al.Fatal demyelinating disease is induced by monocyte-derived macrophages in the absence of TGF-β signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, whether TGF-β is a critical player in regulating BAM development or function has not been addressed so far. Microglia appear to maintain CNS homeostasis, participate in neuronal circuit formation, and regulate synaptic plasticity and transmission and are involved in neurogenesis in the developing and adult CNS (Schafer and Stevens, 2015Schafer D.P.

Kettenmann H. Microglia in Physiology and Disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79: 619-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of microglia has been linked to developmental and neurodegenerative diseases (Colonna and Butovsky, 2017Colonna M. Butovsky O. Microglia Function in the Central Nervous System During Health and Neurodegeneration.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35: 441-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). In such neuropathologies, a fraction of microglia alters its molecular signature and phenotypic appearance and is referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAMs) (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H.

Assigning specific contributions of microglia and BAMs to CNS development, integrity, and pathology has been difficult in the past due to the lack of unambiguous distinctive features between them. In addition, in neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative conditions, peripheral myeloid cells invade the brain concomitant with a change of marker expression on resident macrophages, further complicating their identification. However, recent advances in multi-parametric single-cell analysis of myeloid cells in the adult CNS revealed new markers for BAMs (Goldmann et al., 2016Goldmann T. Wieghofer P. Jordão M.J. Prutek F. Hagemeyer N. Frenzel K. Amann L. Staszewski O. Kierdorf K. Krueger M. et al.Origin, fate and dynamics of macrophages at central nervous system interfaces.Nat.

For example, adult BAMs can be distinguished from microglia by differential expression of Siglec1 (CD169), the mannose receptor CD206, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (Lyve1), CD38, MHCII, CD11c, and the scavenger receptor CD163 (Mrdjen et al., 2018Mrdjen D.

On the other hand, microglia are negative for these markers but express Tmem119, P2ry12, Sall3, and Sall1 (Butovsky et al., 2014Butovsky O. Jedrychowski M.P. Moore C.S. Cialic R. Lanser A.J.

Coenen V.A. et al.Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of mouse and human microglia at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2019; Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Whether BAMs and microglia constitute distinct lineages or acquire their specific features locally, through interaction with their respective niches remains unknown. Here, we profiled murine embryonic microglia and BAMs using high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry combined with in-depth transcriptome analysis. We found two phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct macrophages in the developing brain, which independently gave rise to BAMs and microglia, respectively. Two separate macrophage populations could also be distinguished in the yolk sac, suggestive of an early developmental hard wiring. Supporting the notion that the development of these two macrophage populations stems from an early bifurcation of primitive macrophages, only microglia are dependent on TGF-β, whereas BAMs arise and maintain independently. Our study reveals that BAMs and microglia arise from the same primitive progenitors that separate early into two distinct macrophage populations (CD206+ and CD206–). To interrogate whether microglia and BAMs represent independent populations already in embryogenesis, we first profiled all macrophages from wild-type (WT) brains at E16.5 using scRNA-seq. We chose E16.5 as a time point at which microglia already start differentiating and expressing signature genes (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016Matcovitch-Natan O. Winter D.R. Giladi A. Vargas Aguilar S. Spinrad A. Sarrazin S. Ben-Yehuda H. David E. Zelada González F.

This unbiased single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed two distinct clusters of macrophages (Figure 1A). One cluster was enriched in microglia signature genes such as Sall1, P2ry12, Hexb, Trem2, Fcrls, and Siglech and expressed higher levels of Itgam (CD11b) and Cx3cr1 (Figures 1B and 1C) (Butovsky et al., 2014Butovsky O.

These data demonstrate the coexistence of two transcriptionally distinct populations of macrophages in the embryonic brain already at E16.5, which may correspond to microglia and BAMs, respectively. We next assessed the emergence and phenotypic profile of embryonic brain macrophages by flow cytometry to validate our observations from scRNA-seq. We were able to distinguish two distinct macrophage populations by CD11b and F4/80, or CX3CR1 and CD206, respectively (Figure 2A; Figure S1A). Both populations were present at similar ratios and numbers throughout development (Figures 2A and 2B).

Using Sall1-reporter mice (Sall1GFP/+), we found the CD206– population to initiate Sall1 (GFP) expression from E14.5 onward confirming that they are microglia, whereas the CD206+ population remained negative for GFP throughout embryogenesis (Figures 2C and 2D; Figure S1B). Conversely, the CX3CR1lo population expressed CD206 at all time points and acquired Lyve1 from E12.5 onward (Figures 2C and 2D; Figure S1B), likely representing BAMs. Both populations expressed common macrophage markers MerTK, CD64, CX3CR1, and CD16/32 (Figure 2D), and macrophage-associated transcription factors such as PU.1, IRF8, and IRF4 (Figure S1C).

During embryogenesis, however, macrophages in the brain were negative for MHCII and only few BAMs expressed CD11c (Figure S1D).

https://openalex.org/W3014773636,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) evolve more rapidly than mRNAs. Whether conserved lncRNAs undergo conserved processing, localization, and function remains unexplored. We report differing subcellular localization of lncRNAs in human and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). A significantly higher fraction of lncRNAs is localized in the cytoplasm of hESCs than in mESCs. This turns out to be important for hESC pluripotency. FAST is a positionally conserved lncRNA but is not conserved in its processing and localization. In hESCs, cytoplasm-localized hFAST binds to the WD40 domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP and blocks its interaction with phosphorylated β-catenin to prevent degradation, leading to activated WNT signaling, required for pluripotency. In contrast, mFast is nuclear retained in mESCs, and its processing is suppressed by the splicing factor PPIE, which is highly expressed in mESCs but not hESCs. These findings reveal that lncRNA processing and localization are previously under-appreciated contributors to the rapid evolution of function."

Our resource nominates genetic diseases whose severity may be modulated by oxygen and links hundreds of genes to oxygen homeostasis. Oxygen is the most commonly used substrate across all known biochemical reactions, surpassing even ATP and NADH (Raymond and Segrè, 2006Raymond J. Segrè D. The effect of oxygen on biochemical networks and the evolution of complex life.Science. 2006; 311: 1764-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The evolution of photosynthesis nearly two billion years ago led to a critical turning point for the earth’s atmosphere—the rise of oxygen. The availability of oxygen facilitated new types of chemistry (e.g., sterol synthesis) while simultaneously boosting energy yields by providing a thermodynamically favorable terminal electron acceptor. However, the “great oxygenation event” also resulted in the increased production of toxic free radicals. This balance between the beneficial and deleterious effects of oxygen imparted a strong selective pressure on the evolution of different lifeforms. Humans are regularly exposed to different oxygen tensions. We live at altitudes ranging from sea-level (21% O2) to 4,500 m (11% O2) and can even visit the peak of Mt. Everest (5% O2) while breathing atmospheric air. Acutely, humans can adapt to rapid O2 fluctuations via changes in ventilation and an increase in erythropoiesis. Over evolutionary timescales, there has been genetic selection for adaptive pathways in high altitude populations. These studies have identified polymorphisms in the canonical vHL-PHD-HIF O2 sensing pathways (Beall et al., 2010Beall C.M. Cavalleri G.L. Deng L. Elston R.C. Gao Y. Knight J. Li C. Li J.C. Liang Y.

Even at a fixed altitude, most metabolites are maintained at a relatively stable steady state in the human body (Ivanisevic et al., 2015Ivanisevic J. Elias D. Deguchi H. Averell P.M. Kurczy M. Johnson C.H. Tautenhahn R. Zhu Z. Watrous J. Jain M. et al.Arteriovenous Blood Metabolomics: A Readout of Intra-Tissue Metabostasis.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, oxygen levels vary drastically from the arterial (100 mmHg) to venous circulation (40 mmHg), and even within a given tissue can span a wide range of tensions (Ast and Mootha, 2019Ast T. Mootha V.K. Oxygen and mammalian cell culture: are we repeating the experiment of Dr. Ox?.Nat.

Why is the partial oxygen pressure of human tissues a crucial parameter? Small molecules and hypoxia.J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2011; 15: 1239-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). It follows that humans must have cellular programs to cope with fluctuating oxygen levels. Extreme fluctuations in oxygen availability can exceed our body’s adaptive capacity, resulting in organ damage. Oxygen limitation contributes to some of the leading causes of death in developed countries, including stroke, ischemic heart disease, and kidney injury (Semenza, 2014Semenza G.L. Oxygen sensing, hypoxia-inducible factors, and disease pathophysiology.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2014; 9: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). At the opposite extreme, excess oxygen can lead to retinopathy of prematurity (Hartnett and Penn, 2012Hartnett M.E. Penn J.S. Mechanisms and management of retinopathy of prematurity.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 2515-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), seizures, and acute respiratory distress (Wertlake and Winter, 1965Wertlake P.T. Winter T.S. Oxygen Poisoning.N. Engl. J.

Recent epidemiological studies are beginning to demonstrate detrimental effects of excess supplemental oxygen in critically ill patients (Chu et al., 2018Chu D.K. Kim L.H. Young P.J. Zamiri N.

We also showed that neurological symptoms in a mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia can be prevented with hypoxia (Ast et al., 2019Ast T. Meisel J.D. Patra S. Wang H. Grange R.M.H. Kim S.H. Calvo S.E.

Despite the fundamental importance of oxygen in evolutionary biology, human physiology, and disease, we currently lack a complete understanding of human genes and pathways that are sensitive to fluctuations in oxygen tensions. In recent times, this field has primarily focused on the role of the vHL-PHD-HIF system in hypoxic adaptation. In contrast, a systematic investigation may highlight other pathways that inform our understanding of oxygen homeostasis as well as clinical conditions of ischemia, hypoxia, and oxygen toxicity. Importantly, such work will help prioritize genetic diseases that may benefit from modulating oxygen availability. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to systematically identify human genes and pathways that exhibit different fitness in high and low oxygen environments, namely 21% O2 versus 5% and 1% O2. This contrasts with all recent databases of essential genes in proliferating cell lines, which were performed in standard tissue culture conditions of 21% O2 (Blomen et al., 2015Blomen V.A. Májek P. Jae L.T. Bigenzahn J.W. Nieuwenhuis J. Staring J. Sacco R. van Diemen F.R. Olk N.

Gene Essentiality Profiling Reveals Gene Networks and Synthetic Lethal Interactions with Oncogenic Ras.Cell. 2017; 168: 890-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) even though most tissues are exposed to less than 10% O2 (Carreau et al., 2011Carreau A. El Hafny-Rahbi B. Matejuk A. Grillon C. Kieda C. Why is the partial oxygen pressure of human tissues a crucial parameter? Small molecules and hypoxia.J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2011; 15: 1239-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Our resource identifies pathways differentially essential in high and low oxygen and nominates genes likely to be involved in oxygen sensing, signaling, and metabolism. Tissue oxygen levels vary from less than 1% O2 in the lumen of the large intestine to just under 21% O2 in trachea (Carreau et al., 2011Carreau A. El Hafny-Rahbi B. Matejuk A. Grillon C. Kieda C. Why is the partial oxygen pressure of human tissues a crucial parameter? Small molecules and hypoxia.J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2011; 15: 1239-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Ultimately, a balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption sets the local partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). To span the full spectrum of physiologically relevant oxygen tensions, we focused on 1%, 5%, and 21% O2 exposure. We generated a genome-wide pool of K562 knockout (KO) cells using the Brunello library, targeting ∼20,000 genes using >76,000 guide RNAs (Figure 1B) (Doench, 2016Doench J.G. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing special issue.FEBS J. 2016; 283: 3160-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Following puromycin selection, cells were split into the three different oxygen tensions. Samples were collected at days 9 and 15 post-infection to track the gradual depletion or accumulation of a given gene KO in the various oxygen tensions. Of note, all experiments were performed in magnetic spinner flasks to ensure rapid gas equilibration and to ensure a near-equal oxygenation across cells in each condition. A doubling time of ∼24 h was maintained at 21% and 5% O2, whereas 1% O2 exposure resulted in a doubling time of ∼36 h (Figure 1C). To identify metabolic pathways that exhibit differential fitness as a function of oxygen tension, we used the MAGeCK algorithm to find gene KOs that are differentially abundant in 21% versus 1% O2 at the 15-day time point (Li et al., 2014Li W. Xu H. Xiao T. Cong L. Love M.I. Zhang F. Irizarry R.A. Liu J.S. Brown M. Liu X.S. MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 554Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) (Table S1). We identified 213 gene KOs that showed significant depletion in 21% versus 1% O2, and 109 gene KOs that showed significant depletion at 1% versus 21% O2, at a 0.1 false discovery rate (FDR) (Figure 1D; Table S1). The vast majority of these differentially abundant KOs were significantly depleted compared to the early time points, and therefore we refer to hits as being “selectively essential” in 21% or 1% oxygen. However, a small subset are not truly essential at either oxygen tension but rather exhibit a growth advantage in one oxygen tension and hence are high scoring (see Table S1). Although we use the term “selectively essential” in this resource, careful comparison to initial guide counts, and follow-up experiments, are required to formally determine the nature of the interaction (synthetic lethal, buffering, etc.) between the gene KO and ambient oxygen. We sought to determine if any biological pathways emerge from the screening hits. Interestingly, oxygen-consuming enzymes as defined by the KEGG reactions database were not selectively essential in high or low oxygen (Table S1). We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P. Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26834) Google Scholar) on the rank-ordered lists using a custom database of 92 metabolism gene sets defined from KEGG metabolism and cellular process (Kanehisa et al., 2016Kanehisa M. Sato Y. Kawashima M. Furumichi M. Tanabe M. KEGG as a reference resource for gene and protein annotation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D457-D462Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) (Table S2; STAR Methods). The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene set was the most enriched for being selectively essential at high oxygen tensions (Figures 1D and 1E). We further subdivided this gene set into complex I versus complex II-V, finding that the signal arose primarily from complex I subunits. At the opposite side of the analysis, peroxisome gene sets were the most selectively essential at low oxygen tensions. Subdividing this category further demonstrated that the signal arose primarily from peroxisome biogenesis genes and peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis. We asked whether the canonical hypoxia adaptation pathways are enriched at either extreme in our CRISPR screen. We examined genes that are under recent natural selection in humans adapted to high altitude (Yang et al., 2017Yang J. Jin Z.B. Chen J. Huang X.F. Li X.M. Liang Y.B. Mao J.Y. Chen X. Zheng Z. Bakshi A. et al.Genetic signatures of high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these genes (Table S3) do not appear to be selectively essential in high or low oxygen in our screening dataset (Figure 2A). The most reproducibly identified SNPs associated with high altitude are found in the canonical cellular oxygen sensing pathway of vHL-PHD-HIF (Yang et al., 2017Yang J. Jin Z.B. Chen J. Huang X.F. Li X.M. Liang Y.B. Mao J.Y. Chen X. Zheng Z. Bakshi A. et al.Genetic signatures of high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These variants of PHD2 and HIF2α are believed to dampen the endogenous hypoxia transcriptional program and limit extreme polycythemia. Interestingly, while vHL KOs show a fitness advantage in 21% oxygen, other key members of the hypoxia transcriptional response (HIF, PHD1-3, and ARNT) do not appear to be selectively essential in our screen (Table S1). We next asked whether targets of the vHL-PHD-HIF pathway are selectively essential in high versus low oxygen. Using previously curated lists of HIF targets (Benita et al., 2009Benita Y. Kikuchi H. Smith A.D. Zhang M.Q. Chung D.C. Xavier R.J. An integrative genomics approach identifies Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1)-target genes that form the core response to hypoxia.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4587-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), we did not find any enrichment for HIF targets being selectively essential in our dataset (Figure 2B). Notably, glycolytic enzymes are key targets of the HIF program, however, the core glycolytic machinery is essential at all oxygen tensions, whereas other glycolytic components have paralogs and thus are insensitive to knockout at any oxygen tension. To better compare the transcriptional response in our experimental system, we performed a matched RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) time course to accompany the CRISPR screening conditions. As expected, known HIF targets (including the glycolysis pathway) were upregulated at 1% and 5% O2 at the 3-day time point (Figures 2C and 2D). However, due to a known regulatory negative feedback loop (Henze and Acker, 2010Henze A.T. Acker T. Feedback regulators of hypoxia-inducible factors and their role in cancer biology.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2749-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), some key HIF targets returned to baseline expression after 6 days at 1% O2. Because our genetic screen was performed over a 15-day time frame, such transcriptional dynamics were collectively integrated into our final readout of gene essentiality. Although key HIF targets were transcriptionally upregulated during acute hypoxia (Figure 2D), the genes that we found to be selectively essential as a function of oxygen tension were not transcriptionally regulated and were indistinguishable from the background distribution of all expressed genes, even when employing a less conservative FDR of <0.3 (Figure 2D, black versus gray curves). The incongruence between gene essentiality and the canonical HIF transcriptional program may result from cell autonomous versus non-cell autonomous components of the hypoxia response (e.g., control of red blood cell mass, catecholamine release, changes in capillary density, etc.) or differences in timescales (e.g., acute and chronic hypoxia adaptations). We previously demonstrated the benefit of breathing 11% O2 in a mouse model of complex I deficiency (Ferrari et al., 2017Ferrari M. Jain I.H. Goldberger O. Rezoagli E. Thoonen R. Cheng K.H. Sosnovik D.E. Scherrer-Crosbie M. Mootha V.K. Zapol W.M. Hypoxia treatment reverses neurodegenerative disease in a mouse model of Leigh syndrome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Meisel J.D. Patra S. Wang H. Grange R.M.H. Kim S.H. Calvo S.E. Orefice L.L. Nagashima F. Ichinose F. et al.Hypoxia Rescues Frataxin Loss by Restoring Iron Sulfur Cluster Biogenesis.Cell. 2019; 177: 1507-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A key motivation for the current study was to understand which genetic disorders may be buffered or exacerbated by variations in oxygen levels. Of the 213 genes that are selectively essential in 21% versus 1% O2 (Table S1), 76 underlie Mendelian disorders (Figure 3A). Strikingly, 52 of these genes are associated with primary or secondary mitochondrial disease (Frazier et al., 2019Frazier A.E. Thorburn D.R. Compton A.G. Mitochondrial energy generation disorders: genes, mechanisms, and clues to pathology.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 5386-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). Indeed, 103 of the 213 genes encode mitochondrial proteins, reflecting a near 10-fold enrichment compared to non-mitochondrial genes (Figure 3A). Notably, our screen recovers the majority of core complex I subunits and FXN as selectively essential in 21% O2 (Figures 3B and 3C). However, NDUFS4 (the specific complex I disease gene whose loss we previously rescued in mice with hypoxia therapy) was not a hit in this screen, because this accessory subunit is not essential for K562 cell proliferation. Dozens of additional human mitochondrial disorders are now predicted to be sensitive to oxygen (Figure 3B), including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency, autosomal dominant optic atrophy (OPA1), Charcot-Marie-Tooth (MFN2), sideroblastic anemia (GLRX5), and Barth syndrome (TAZ). Our screen prioritizes other disease genes including monogenic forms of Parkinson’s disease (HTRA2) and several non-mitochondrial genes underlying porphyrias (PPOX and UROD). Of course, these screening results only generate hypotheses that would require extensive additional preclinical studies to further substantiate the beneficial effects of hypoxia. Our screen shows a striking enrichment for certain mitochondrial pathways being selectively essential at 21% versus 1% O2: complex I of the electron transport chain, the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter (MPC), type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII), CoQ biosynthesis, and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis (Figures 3C and S1). Specifically, five Fe-S cluster biosynthesis genes were high-scoring (FXN, HSCB, NARFL, NFU1, and NUBPL). NFS1 shows oxygen sensitivity in other contexts (Alvarez et al., 2017Alvarez S.W. Sviderskiy V.O. Terzi E.M. Papagiannakopoulos T. Moreira A.L. Adams S. Sabatini D.M. Birsoy K. Possemato R. NFS1 undergoes positive selection in lung tumours and protects cells from ferroptosis.Nature. 2017; 551: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) but was not significant in our screen because its KO led to a fitness defect in all oxygen tensions. Intriguingly, not all mitochondrial pathways were selectively essential in high oxygen. Using the classic experimental paradigm of glucose versus galactose media (in which cells rely primarily on glycolysis and OXPHOS metabolism, respectively), we previously showed that all OXPHOS complexes are essential for survival in glucose-free media (Arroyo et al., 2016Arroyo J.D. Jourdain A.A. Calvo S.E. Ballarano C.A. Doench J.G. Root D.E. Mootha V.K. A Genome-wide CRISPR Death Screen Identifies Genes Essential for Oxidative Phosphorylation.Cell Metab. 2016; 24: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), as well as many genes required for mitochondrial genome maintenance and expression. In contrast, we observe that only genes encoding OXPHOS complex I (and not other complexes) are selectively essential in 21% versus 1% O2 (Figure 3C). Notably, ∼70% (25 of 37) of nuclear-encoded complex I subunit deficiencies were buffered by hypoxia (i.e., the combined growth defect of gene loss and hypoxia was less than expected in an additive model). But almost none of complex II-V subunit deficiencies were buffered at 1% O2 (Figures 3C and 3D). This effect was validated in follow-up experiments in a second cell type (HEK293T) where lentivirus-infected pools of individual subunit KOs were tested for growth in 21%, 5%, and 1% O2 (Figure 3E). Even after only 3 days in 1% O2, complex I mutants grew at a similar rate as wild-type (WT) cells in hypoxia, whereas the other mutants displayed impaired growth (Figure 3E). We then turned to the opposite side of the screen to explore the 109 genes whose loss causes a growth defect in 1% versus 21% O2 (Figures 1 and 4). This side of the list contains a large number of genes related to lipid metabolism and peroxisomal metabolism. The former pointed us to literature linking oxygen availability to membrane fluidity (Ackerman and Simon, 2014Ackerman D. Simon M.C.

Membrane fluidity is a dynamic parameter known to be influenced by variables such as lipid composition, temperature, and oxygen. In normoxia, membrane fluidity is maintained by the production of unsaturated fatty acids. However, desaturase enzymes are oxygen-dependent, and hypoxic inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase (SCD) can decrease the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. This leads to impaired cell growth, likely via increasing membrane rigidity (Kamphorst et al., 2013Kamphorst J.J. Cross J.R. Fan J. de Stanchina E. Mathew R. White E.P. Thompson C.B. Rabinowitz J.D.

Dysfunction of laryngeal neurons is life-threatening, causing pulmonary aspiration, dysphagia, and choking, yet relevant sensory pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we discover rare throat-innervating neurons (∼100 neurons/mouse) that guard the airways against assault. We used genetic tools that broadly cover a vagal/glossopharyngeal sensory neuron atlas to map, ablate, and control specific afferent populations. Optogenetic activation of vagal P2RY1 neurons evokes a coordinated airway defense program-apnea, vocal fold adduction, swallowing, and expiratory reflexes. Ablation of vagal P2RY1 neurons eliminates protective responses to laryngeal water and acid challenge. Anatomical mapping revealed numerous laryngeal terminal types, with P2RY1 neurons forming corpuscular endings that appose laryngeal taste buds. Epithelial cells are primary airway sentinels that communicate with second-order P2RY1 neurons through ATP. These findings provide mechanistic insights into airway defense and a general molecular/genetic roadmap for internal organ sensation by the vagus nerve."

Our results uncover a simple design principle of organ growth where progenitors and differentiated cells expand in harmony with their surrounding tissues. Organism growth is a key process that needs to be orchestrated harmoniously throughout development. Animal development starts from a single cell to form a multicellular organism composed of tissues containing different cell types. After the different cell types have been specified during embryonic development, the organs and tissues have to grow during postnatal life to achieve their final size at the end of puberty. In adult animals, cells lost by differentiation and cell death must be compensated by cell division in a process called tissue homeostasis. Over the last decade, great efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms controlling tissue homeostasis in adulthood. Lineage-tracing and clonal analyses have been instrumental in defining the clonal dynamics ensuring asymmetric renewal at the population level, maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation (Blanpain and Simons, 2013Blanpain C. Simons B.D. Unravelling stem cell dynamics by lineage tracing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little is known about the mechanisms that ensure postnatal growth from birth until animals reach their final size at the end of puberty. During postnatal growth, an imbalance between proliferation and differentiation is required to generate the excess of cells that fuels tissue expansion. How this imbalance is controlled and achieved is largely unknown. The skin is the first barrier that protects animals against their microenvironment. The epidermis is composed of hair follicles (HFs) and their surrounding interfollicular epidermis (IFE). The IFE contains a single proliferative layer of basal cells (BCs) expressing keratin 14 and 5 (K14 and K5, respectively) and several suprabasal layers of terminally differentiated cells expressing K1 and K10 that progressively become enucleated and are shed as squames at the skin surface (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal stem cells of the skin.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 339-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To compensate for the loss of terminally differentiated cells, the IFE is constantly renewed by the proliferation of stem cells (SCs) and progenitors (Blanpain and Simons, 2013Blanpain C. Simons B.D. Unravelling stem cell dynamics by lineage tracing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The tail epidermis is a well-described tissue composed of two distinct regions (the scale and interscale) in which the clonal dynamics mediating adult tissue homeostasis have been studied extensively. Mouse tail IFE homeostasis is ensured by SCs and committed progenitors (CPs), which together balance self-renewal and differentiation in a stochastic manner at the population level (Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E. Doupé D.P. Klein A.M. Winton D.J. Simons B.D. Jones P.H.

Defining the clonal dynamics leading to mouse skin tumour initiation.Nature. 2016; 536: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, during postnatal growth and the concomitant expansion of the skin, SCs and/or progenitors need to adjust the balance between renewal and differentiation to expand the numbers of basal and suprabasal cells. The mechanisms responsible for controlling the imbalance of self-renewal over differentiation, which mediates skin expansion, are currently unknown. Here we used the murine tail and paw epidermis to unravel the mechanisms that mediate postnatal skin expansion. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we define the pattern of cell fate decisions during tissue growth. We show that postnatal tail and paw skin expansion is mediated by a single population of equipotent developmental progenitors (DPs) that present a fixed fate imbalance of renewing divisions coupled with an ever-decreasing proliferation rate. We show that this strategy is optimal to ensure expansion of the basal progenitor cell pool while maintaining constant suprabasal thickness. We validate the model via clonal analysis performed at different time points during postnatal development. Finally, we demonstrate that the direction of clonal growth does not follow large-scale cues from anisotropic tail growth but local cues from the underlying collagen fiber orientation. The mouse tail epidermis is composed of two regions that follow distinct differentiation programs: the interscale surrounds triplets of HFs and is characterized by suprabasal cells expressing K1 and K10, and the scale is characterized by expression of K31, K36, and K84 in differentiated cells (Didierjean et al., 1983Didierjean L.

In adult mice, these two regions behave as independent compartments that are sustained by their own pool of stem and progenitor cells (Gomez et al., 2013Gomez C. Chua W. Miremadi A. Quist S. Headon D.J. Watt F.M. The interfollicular epidermis of adult mouse tail comprises two distinct cell lineages that are differentially regulated by Wnt, Edaradd, and Lrig1.Stem Cell Reports. 2013; 1: 19-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Sánchez-Danés et al., 2016Sánchez-Danés A.

Defining the clonal dynamics leading to mouse skin tumour initiation.Nature. 2016; 536: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, how and when these SCs, progenitors, and their compartmentalization are specified during development remains unclear. To address these questions, we first assessed macroscopic tail expansion by measuring the length, width, and total area of the tail from post-natal day 1 (P1) to P60. The results showed that the tail surface grew linearly from P1 to P30 by about 12-fold and then slowly reached a plateau. Most of the expansion was due to tail elongation (7-fold from P1 to P60), whereas its diameter increased only by 2.5-fold during the same period (Figures 1A–1E). Altogether, our data show that the tail surface increases 17-fold in a highly anisotropic fashion during neonatal growth. We then defined postnatal tail expansion at the microscopic level. Using HF triplets as a reference frame, we measured the area of IFE covered by the scale and half of the two adjacent interscale regions, which we defined as the HF area (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A–S1D). Because de novo HF formation does not occur after birth, the length and width of HF areas can be used as a proxy to measure local tissue expansion. We found that the distance between two HF lines along the antero-posterior (AP) axis increased more (7-fold from P1 to P60) than the distance between two adjacent HF follicle triplets along the left-right (LR) axis (2.3-fold from P1 to P60) (Figures 1F–1H). Altogether, the HF area expands around 16-fold from P1 to P60. Thus, macroscopic and microscopic measurements give statistically similar results, showing that the IFE surface expands uniformly from P1 to P60, with a linear increase from P1 to P30 (Figure 1I). To define the spatio-temporal dynamics of IFE expansion at single-cell resolution, we performed clonal analysis using a multicolor lineage-tracing approach (Figures 2A and 2B ). Tamoxifen (TAM) was administrated to K14-CreER/Rosa-Confetti mice at P1 at a dose that leads to fluorescent reporter expression in BCs sufficiently isolated from each other to be able to follow the fate and expansion of targeted individual cells. The numbers of BCs and suprabasal cells per clone were quantified at different time points in the scale and interscale (Figures 2C and 2D). In both compartments, clones grew rapidly from P1 to P30 and then more slowly from P30 to P60 (Figures 2E and 2F), mirroring the tail surface, with clone survival (or persistence) being globally stable from P7 to P60 in both scale and interscale (Figure 2G), a hallmark of unbalanced clonal expansion via self-renewing divisions of BCs. Importantly, the overall increase in clone size well matched the overall tissue expansion (Figure 2H), and the BC size did not change over time (Figure S1D), demonstrating that the cells we targeted in our lineage-tracing experiments are representative of those that drive whole-tissue expansion. Interestingly, we found that scale clones were consistently larger than interscale clones at all time points (21-fold versus 10-fold expansion from P1 to P30; P7, p = 0.007; P15, p < 0.0001; P30, p < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney test), which could not be attributed to differential clone loss (Figure 2G). Moreover, the cumulative basal clone size distributions of interscale and scale clones fitted well with a single exponential dependence at all time points (Figures 2I and 2J). This observation arises as a hallmark of stochastic cell fate choices from single populations of DPs, which mediate post-natal growth reliant (Klein and Simons, 2011Klein A.M. Simons B.D. Universal patterns of stem cell fate in cycling adult tissues.Development. 2011; 138: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To ensure the quasi-linear growth of tissue supported by a single population of DPs, these cells must either progressively decrease the proportion of self-renewing division over commitment to terminal differentiation or smoothly adjust their proliferation rate and transit time from the basal layer to the cornified layer (or potentially both). To discriminate between these possibilities, we performed quantitative label dilution experiments using K5tetOFF/Tet-O-H2BGFP mice (Mascré et al., 2012Mascré G. Dekoninck S. Drogat B. Youssef K.K. Broheé S. Sotiropoulou P.A. Simons B.D. Blanpain C.

In the absence of doxycycline (Dox), H2B-GFP was homogenously expressed at a high level in all BCs (Figures S2A–S2C). H2B-GFP expression was chased by administration of Dox starting at P1, P7, P21, or P30, and the level of H2B-GFP label dilution in BCs, representing the number of cell divisions accomplished during the chase period, was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at different time points (Figures S2D–S2G). These data showed that the rate of cell division decreased during postnatal development, with an average cell cycle time estimated to be around 1.2 days between P1 and P7, 1.9 days between P7 and P15, 4.1 days between P21 and P28 (Figures S2H and S2I), and 6.5 days at P60 (Mascré et al., 2012Mascré G. Dekoninck S. Drogat B. Youssef K.K. Broheé S. Sotiropoulou P.A. Simons B.D. Blanpain C. Distinct contribution of stem and progenitor cells to epidermal maintenance.Nature. 2012; 489: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Of note, we did not observe a significant slowly cycling population of BCs during post-natal tissue expansion (Figures S2D and S2E), in support of the idea of a single population of DPs. Although the H2B-GFP label dilution data show that the rate of DP cell division decreases over time, FACS quantification cannot discriminate whether differential expansion of clones in the scale and interscale regions is mediated by a difference in the rate of cell proliferation or a different imbalance toward symmetrical division. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we turned to cell proliferation kinetics measurements using 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU)/bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) double-labeling experiments allowing us to define whether cell cycle time is regulated in a region-specific manner during postnatal development. EdU was administrated first at P4, P7, P15, P30, and P60, and then BrdU was given continuously to measure the proportion of double-labeled cells (and the proportion of suprabasal EdU+ cells) at different time points in the scale and interscale (Figures 3A–3O and S2J), which fitted well with a single population of dividing cell with a refractory period in each region. These results confirmed that the rate of cell cycle re-entry decreases over time and demonstrated that DPs consistently cycle faster in the scale than in the interscale (Figures 3N–3P), similar to their differential proliferation rate during adult homeostasis (Gomez et al., 2013Gomez C.

The effects of subcutaneous saline injections on growth and keratinization of mouse tail epidermis.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1966; 46: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Indeed, we reasoned that the progressive and constant decrease in DP proliferation rate during postnatal growth could explain the linear rather than exponential growth of the tail epidermis and the differential scale-interscale growth. To determine whether a cell-autonomous or non-autonomous mechanism controls the ever-decreasing rate of proliferation observed during postnatal development, we assessed the proliferation rate of primary keratinocytes freshly isolated from mice of different ages and cultured in vitro for 48 h on fibronectin- and collagen-coated plates. Quantification of BrdU incorporation by FACS analysis showed that proliferation of cultured keratinocytes decreased with the age of the mice, similar to what we found in vivo (Figures 3Q, S2K, and S2L). These data suggest that the decrease in proliferation of keratinocytes is not a consequence of a higher level of growth hormones in the serum of young mice but a consequence of keratinocyte-autonomous mechanisms. These results do not rule out the possibility that growth hormones modify the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of the keratinocytes, rendering them more responsive to growth factors. The increase in the number of BCs per clone combined with stable clonal persistence can only be achieved if DPs increase their number of symmetric renewing divisions at the expense of symmetric differentiation, creating an imbalance in favor of self-renewal. To test whether adjustment of the proliferation rate over time is sufficient to quantitatively explain the spatio-temporal dynamics of postnatal growth, we turned to quantitative modeling of the lineage tracing data (STAR Methods). Taking the experimentally measured proliferation rate as input to the model and considering the observation that rescaled clone size distributions are consistently well-fitted by a single exponential, we explored whether the average clone size and clonal persistence could be explained by a minimal model consisting of a single equipotent DP population characterized by stochastic fate behavior. In an out-of-homeostasis setting, clonal dynamics are only weakly dependent on the probability of asymmetric division (1-2r) and pre-dominantly dependent on the product of Δλ, where Δ is the degree of imbalance between symmetric divisions (here, self-renewing and differentiation divisions), and λ is the cell division rate (STAR Methods). One should note that the results of these models are also largely insensitive to the nature of fate regulation (for instance, intrinsic versus extrinsic fate choices or whether differentiation feeds back on or is mediated by cellular proliferation events). Interestingly, based on the measured cell division rate, we found that a constant fate imbalance of Δ = 24% ± 4% (best fit ± 95% confidence interval) provided a very good fit for the quasi-linear P1 to P30 growth dynamics of interscale clones (Figures 4A and 4B ). Moreover, the model also provided a good prediction for clonal persistence, showing an initial decrease followed by a plateau (Figure 4C), characteristic of imbalanced cell fates (STAR Methods). Even more surprisingly, modeling of scale clones showed that the same constant fate imbalance, Δ = 24% ± 2% (best fit ± 95% confidence interval) provided a very good fit for the clone size across the course of postnatal growth (Figures 4D–4F). This means that the 2-fold enhancement of clonal growth in scale could be explained by the observed faster proliferation rate compared with interscale. These data suggest that scale and interscale compartments are each sustained by a single population of DPs that undergo an excess of symmetric renewing divisions and acquire different proliferation rates during post-natal development, depending on their localization. To experimentally challenge this simple constant fate imbalance model, we performed an additional lineage-tracing experiment at P15, chasing clones for 4 and 14 days (Figures 4G–4U). In interscale, clones increased their average basal size by a factor of 1.9 and their average total size by a factor of 4.1 in 2 weeks (Figures 4J, 4L, 4N, and 4O). Interestingly, this average clone size expansion, together with the persistence evolution from P4 to P15, fitted well with the model prediction (Figures 4R–4T). Similarly, scale clones increased their basal content by a factor of 2.9 and their total content by a factor of 6.2, which also fitted well with the model prediction in terms of average clone size and persistence (Figures 4K, 4M, 4P, 4Q, 4S, and 4U). These data confirm that epidermal cells do not change their cell fate imbalance during the growth process. We then assessed whether this mechanism of tissue growth (fixed imbalance of self-renewal combined with a progressively decreasing proliferation rate) uncovered in the tail epidermis is a general strategy of stratified epithelial postnatal expansion. To this end, we studied, at single-cell resolution, the cellular mechanisms that mediate postnatal growth in the paw epidermis. We performed clonal analysis using K14-CreER/Rosa-Confetti mice induced at P1 and assessed the clonal behavior of individual BCs at P4, P7, P15, P30, and P60 in relation to the length and width of the paw area. The paw area expanded by a factor of 6.1 from P1 to P60 and in a more isotropic manner compared with the tail (2.7× in length, 2.4× in width) (Figures S3A–S3D). Most of the paw expansion occurred in a nearly linear manner, although it reached its plateau earlier than in the tail (Figure 1I). We performed a single BrdU pulse and quantified the proportion of labeled cells after 4 h, which can be used to approximate the proliferation rate (Figure S3E; STAR Methods). Interestingly, the proportion of BrdU-labeled cells decreased from P1 to P15, going from 29.8% ± 2.3% of labeled cells at P1 to 12.0% ± 1.9% at P15 and then remained stable from P15 to P60 (Figure S3F). Clonal analysis of the paw epidermis showed that the basal content of the clones expanded 5.8× from P1 to P15 (Figures S3G–S3K), mirroring the paw tissue expansion, and that clone size distributions were well fitted at all time points by a single exponential, a hallmark of a single population of DPs being responsible for the skin expansion (Figure S3L). Implementing a similar theoretical model as before (with the proliferation rates measured in the paw) showed that the clone size and persistence time course data were well fitted by the same constant imbalance model proposed for the tail, with an imbalance of 20% from P1 to P15 (STAR Methods; Figures S3M–S3O), demonstrating that the design principles uncovered in the tail epidermis also account for skin expansion in the paw epidermis. Our data and modeling approaches suggest that DPs adjust only their division rate to match the spatio-temporally varying patterns of tissue growth while keeping their imbalance in fate choices approximately constant. Why would such a strategy be implemented and selected in several epidermal compartments? One possibility is that such a state of constant imbalance toward symmetric renewal represents a stable, cell-intrinsic ground state for DPs (Mojtahedi et al., 2016Mojtahedi M. Skupin A. Zhou J. Castaño I.G. Leong-Quong R.Y. Chang H. Trachana K. Giuliani A. Huang S. Cell Fate Decision as High-Dimensional Critical State Transition.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14: e2000640Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, we postulated that the observed growth strategy could also be explained mechanistically by considering a simple optimality criterion for epidermal growth. We reasoned that, if the only constraint in the system is expansion of the basal layer at a prescribed speed, then this can be achieved in many ways (Figures 5A–5D; STAR Methods). For instance, DPs could retain balanced cell fate choices throughout development, similar to homeostasis but with a higher division rate, producing only differentiated cells that would accumulate both in the basal and suprabasal layer and, thus, lead to dilution of the basal DP pool, as observed in Drosophila intestinal regeneration (Jin et al., 2017Jin Y. Patel P.H. Kohlmaier A. Pavlovic B. Zhang C. Edgar B.A. Intestinal Stem Cell Pool Regulation in Drosophila.Stem Cell Reports. 2017; 8: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; Figure 5A). However, our H2B-GFP dilution experiments did not show such an accumulation of differentiated cells (Figure S2). A second possibility would be that DPs first undergo a phase of purely symmetric divisions to rapidly expand the DP pool and then switch to a second phase of asymmetrical divisions to generate differentiated cells. This so-called “bang-bang” mechanism has been proposed to be optimal for rapid formation of mouse intestinal crypts after birth (Itzkovitz et al., 2012Itzkovitz S. Blat I.C. Jacks T. Clevers H. van Oudenaarden A. Optimality in the development of intestinal crypts.Cell. 2012; 148: 608-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; Figure 5B). However, our clonal data initiated at P1 show that differentiated cells are produced early after birth (Figures 2E and 2F). Finally, although our proliferation experiments rule out this hypothesis, a constant division rate similar to homeostasis (one division every 4–5 days) would be sufficient to give rise to the observed linear growth if the imbalance was close to 100% around birth and subsequently continuously decreases (Figure 5C). Interestingly, all of these scenarios lead either to dilution of the DP (Figure 5A) or to a phase in which very few suprabasal cells are produced, leading to skin thinning during expansion and potentially compromising skin barrier function (Figures 5B and 5C; see more explanations in STAR Methods). We thus explored the consequences of a very simple design principle of epidermal growth: that the basal area must grow (in response to the growth of the underlying tissue) by a prescribed amount but also that the ratio of suprabasal cells to BCs must remain constant (to ensure sufficient epidermal thickness throughout the expansion phase). Strikingly, imposing these two constraints was only compatible with a single theoretical growth scenario characterized by (1) near-constant fate imbalance and (2) continually decreasing division rates to adjust to growth characteristics (Figure 5D; STAR Methods). This design principle thus provides a simple and robust explanation for the experimentally observed clonal dynamics, which we explored quantitatively. Before going further toward a quantitative comparison of this optimality criterion with the data, we sought to verify whether its assumptions apply. For this, we measured the ratio of suprabasal cells to BCs at all time points in tail scale and interscale as well as in the paw. Importantly, we found that this ratio was approximately constant across the growth phase (Figures 5E and 5F), validating the key assumption of the model. Moreover, in the tail, the ratio was equivalent in tail scale and interscale, although both regions displayed a 2-fold difference in the degree of growth (Figures 2E, 2F, and 2H). We then sought to test the hypothesis of constant imbalance by fitting the clonal data piece-wise to infer different values of imbalance (STAR Methods). Interestingly, we found that the inferred imbalance at each time point was close to its globally fitted value (Figures 5G and 5H). Finally, to see whether the other possible scenario could also fit our experimental data, we performed a sensitivity analysis to predict the time evolution of the BC density and suprabasal/basal ratio for each scenario (Figures S4A–S4D). Strikingly, this analysis confirmed that our constant imbalance model was the best-fitting scenario (STAR Methods). With a single fitting parameter (suprabasal loss rate, which we set as constant across compartments but which has only weak effects on the resulting dynamics), our design principle could then quantitatively predict the following data: (1) the experimentally inferred imbalance at each time point (i.e., the fa"

The present study based on a detailed analysis of sugarcane root transcriptome by using the HiSeq-Illumina platform in response to the strain MYSP113. The bacterium was initially isolated from the rhizosphere of sugarcane. To better understand biological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms, a de novo transcriptomic assembly of sugarcane root was performed. HiSeq-Illumina platformwas employed for the sequencing of an overall of 16 libraries at a 2×100 bp configuration. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis identified altered gene expression in 370 genes (total of 199 up-regulated genes and 171 down-regulated genes). Deciphering the huge datasets, concerning the functioning and production of biological systems, a high throughput genome sequencing analysis was attempted with Gene ontology functional analyses and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. The report revealed a total of 148930 unigenes. 70414 (47.28%) of them were annotated successfully to Gene Ontology (GO) terms. 774 at 45 days, 4985 of 30 days and 15 days of 6846 terms were significantly regulated. GO analysis revealed that many genes involved in the metabolic, oxidation-reduction process and biological regulatory processes in response to strain MYSP113 and significantly enriched as compare to the control. Moreover, KEGG enriched results show that differentially expressed genes were classified into different pathway categories involved in various processes, such as nitrogen metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, etc. The sample correlation analyses could help examine the similarity at the gene expression level. The reliability of the observed differential gene expression patterns was validated with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Additionally, plant enzymes activities such as peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were significantly increased in plant roots after the inoculation of strain MYSP113. The results of the research may help in understanding the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and plant interaction."

The imported cystine is reduced to cysteine and used for synthesis of GSH, one of the most important antioxidants in cancer cells. Because cancer cells have increased levels of reactive oxygen species, xCT, responsible for cystine–glutamate exchange, is overexpressed in many cancers, including glioblastoma. However, under glucose-limited conditions, xCT overexpression induces reactive oxygen species accumulation and cell death. Here we report that cell survival under glucose deprivation depends on cell density. We found that high cell density (HD) down-regulates xCT levels and increases cell viability under glucose deprivation. We also found that growth of glioblastoma cells at HD inactivates mTOR and that treatment of cells grown at low density with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1 down-regulates xCT and inhibits glucose deprivation-induced cell death. The lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 suppressed xCT down-regulation in HD-cultured glioblastoma cells and in Torin 1–treated cells grown at low density. Additionally, bafilomycin A1 exposure or ectopic xCT expression restored glucose deprivation–induced cell death at HD. These results suggest that HD inactivates mTOR and promotes lysosomal degradation of xCT, leading to improved glioblastoma cell viability under glucose-limited conditions.

We assessed the prevalence of diabetes and the roles of HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and traditional risk factors among adults in Tanzania. Methods We analysed diabetes-relevant baseline data from 1,947 adult participants in the CICADA study in Mwanza, Tanzania: 655 HIV-uninfected, 956 HIV-infected ART-naïve, and 336 HIV-infected persons on ART. WHO guidelines for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were used to define diabetes and prediabetes. Risk factors were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Relative risk ratios (RRR) were generated comparing participants with diabetes and prediabetes against the reference of those with no diabetes. Results Mean age was 41 (SD 12) years; 59% were women. The prevalence of diabetes was 13% by HbA1c and 6% by OGTT, with partial overlap among participants identified by the two tests. Relative to HIV-uninfected, HIV-infected ART-naïve persons had increased relative risks of diabetes (HbA1c: RRR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.25–3.03; OGTT: RRR = 1.90, 95% CI 0.96–3.73) and prediabetes (HbA1c: RRR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.93–4.34; OGTT: RRR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.22–2.13). HIV-infected participants on ART showed increased risk of prediabetes (RRR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09, 2.94) by HbA1c, but not diabetes. CD4 count < 200 cell/μL at recruitment increased risk and physical activity decreased risk of diabetes by both HbA1c and OGTT. Conclusions The prevalence of diabetes was high, especially among HIV-infected ART-naïve adults. Being more physically active was associated with lower risk of diabetes. HbA1c and OGTT identified different participants as having diabetes or prediabetes. Overall, the finding of high burden of diabetes among HIV-infected persons suggests that health systems should consider integrating diabetes screening and treatment in HIV clinics to optimize the care of HIV patients and improve their health outcomes."

The parents and doubled haploid lines of crosses Carberry/AC Cadillac, Carberry/Vesper, Vesper/Lillian, Vesper/Stettler and Stettler/Red Fife were assessed for leaf rust severity and infection response in field nurseries in Canada near Swift Current, SK from 2013 to 2015, Morden, MB from 2015 to 2017 and Brandon, MB in 2016, and in New Zealand near Lincoln in 2014. The populations were genotyped with the 90K Infinium iSelect assay and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed. A high density consensus map generated based on 14 doubled haploid populations and integrating SNP and SSR markers was used to compare QTL identified in different populations. AC Cadillac contributed QTL on chromosomes 2A, 3B and 7B (2 loci), Carberry on 1A, 2B (2 loci), 2D, 4B (2 loci), 5A, 6A, 7A and 7D, Lillian on 4A and 7D, Stettler on 2D and 6B, Vesper on 1B, 1D, 2A, 6B and 7B (2 loci), and Red Fife on 7A and 7B. Lillian contributed to a novel locus QLr.spa-4A, and similarly Carberry at QLr.spa-5A. The discovery of novel leaf rust resistance QTL QLr.spa-4A and QLr.spa-5A, and several others in contemporary Canada Western Red Spring wheat varieties is a tremendous addition to our present knowledge of resistance gene deployment in breeding. Carberry demonstrated substantial stacking of genes which could be supplemented with the genes identified in other cultivars with the expectation of increasing efficacy of resistance to leaf rust and longevity with little risk of linkage drag."
https://openalex.org/W3015091965,"Population size estimation is performed for several reasons including disease surveillance and control, for example to design adequate control strategies such as vaccination programs or to estimate a vaccination campaign coverage. In this study, we aimed at investigating the possibility of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to estimate the size of free-roaming domestic dog (FRDD) populations and compare the results with two regularly used methods for population estimations: foot-patrol transect survey and the human: dog ratio estimation. Three studies sites of one square kilometer were selected in Petén department, Guatemala. A door-to-door survey was conducted in which all available dogs were marked with a collar and owner were interviewed. The day after, UAV flight were performed twice during two consecutive days per study site. The UAV's camera was set to regularly take pictures and cover the entire surface of the selected areas. Simultaneously to the UAV's flight, a foot-patrol transect survey was performed and the number of collared and non-collared dogs were recorded. Data collected during the interviews and the number of dogs counted during the foot-patrol transects informed a capture-recapture (CR) model fit into a Bayesian inferential framework to estimate the dog population size, which was found to be 78, 259, and 413 in the three study sites. The difference of the CR model estimates compared to previously available dog census count (110 and 289) can be explained by the fact that the study population addressed by the different methods differs. The human: dog ratio covered the same study population as the dog census and tended to underestimate the FRDD population size (97 and 161). Under the conditions within this study, the total number of dogs identified on the UAV pictures was 11, 96, and 71 for the three regions (compared to the total number of dogs counted during the foot-patrol transects of 112, 354 and 211). In addition, the quality of the UAV pictures was not sufficient to assess the presence of a mark on the spotted dogs. Therefore, no CR model could be implemented to estimate the size of the FRDD using UAV. We discussed ways for improving the use of UAV for this purpose, such as flying at a lower altitude in study area wisely chosen. We also suggest to investigate the possibility of using infrared camera and automatic detection of the dogs to increase visibility of the dogs in the pictures and limit workload of finding them. Finally, we discuss the need of using models, such as spatial capture-recapture models to obtain reliable estimates of the FRDD population. This publication may provide helpful directions to design dog population size estimation methods using UAV."

The human gut microbial composition is known to be altered in disease conditions. Considering the important role of the gut microbiome in maintaining homeostasis and overall health, it is important to understand the microbial diversity and the functional metagenome of the healthy gut. Here, we characterized the microbiota of 31 fecal samples from healthy individuals of Indian ethnic tribes from Ladakh, Jaisalmer and Khargone by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed that Bifidobacterium and Prevotella were the key microbes contributing to the differences among Jaisalmer, Khargone and Ladakh samples at the genus level. Our correlation network study identified carbohydrate-active enzymes and carbohydrate binding proteins that are associated with specific genera in the different Indian geographical regions studied. Network analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes and genus abundance revealed that the presence of different carbohydrate-active enzymes is driven by differential abundance of genera. The correlation networks were different in the different geographical regions, and these interactions suggest the role of less abundant genera in shaping the gut environment. We compared our data with samples from different countries and found significant differences in taxonomic composition and abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the gut microbiota as compared to the other countries."

Two interventions to reduce production diseases were studied. A generic chain diagram of linkages between stakeholders and value-added dimensions was designed. Data on structure and financial performance were collected for the sector. The production parameters and financial effects of the interventions were then described to illustrate impact on the supply chain. The effects of the interventions were also assessed at market level using economic welfare analysis. The sectors in Finland and the UK are small in farm numbers and few companies produced much of the output in a largely vertically-integrated structure. The most beneficial intervention in financial terms to farmers was improved hygiene in pig fattening (around +50% in gross margin). It was calculated to reduce the consumer price for pig meat by up to 5% when applied at large, whereas for improved management measures, it would reduce consumer price by less than 0.5%. However, the latter added value also through food quality attributes. We show that good hygiene and animal care can add value. However, evaluation of the financial and social viability of the interventions is needed to decide what interventions are adopted. The structure of supply chains influences which policy measures could be applied. Of the two interventions, improved pig hygiene had the largest potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The studied interventions can also provide new business opportunities to farms, slaughterhouses and food sector companies. More evidence is needed to support public policies and business decision-making in the sector. For this, evidence on consumer attitudes to production diseases is needed.

The use of biological agents that can fix atmospheric N has shown potential to improve nutrient availability in grass crops. This research was developed to investigate if inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense in combination with silicon (Si) can enhance N use efficiency (NUE) in maize. The study was set up in a Rhodic Hapludox under a no-till system, in a completely randomized block design with four replicates. Treatments were tested in a full factorial design and included: i) five side dress N rates (0 to 200 kg ha-1); ii) two liming sources (Ca and Mg silicate and dolomitic limestone); and iii) with and without seed inoculation with A. brasilense. Inoculation with A. brasilense was found to increase grain yield by 15% when N was omitted and up to 10% when N was applied. Inoculation also increased N accumulation in plant tissue. Inoculation and limestone application were found to increase leaf chlorophyll index, number of grains per ear, harvest index, and NUE. Inoculation increased harvest index and NUE by 9.5 and 19.3%, respectively, compared with non-inoculated plots. Silicon application increased leaf chlorophyll index and N-leaf concentration. The combination of Si and inoculation provided greater Si-shoot accumulation. This study showed positive improvements in maize growth production parameters as a result of inoculation, but the potential benefits of Si use were less evident. Further research should be conducted under growing conditions that provide some level of biotic or abiotic stress to study the true potential of Si application."

The Theil index is used to explore the sources of the provincial gap of green water use inefficiency, and a random-effect panel Tobit model is applied to test the impact of the influencing factors of green water use inefficiency in the YREB. It is found that green water use inefficiency of the YREB is relatively low and regional differences is significant during the sample period, indicating a large potential of water-saving and water pollution reduction, and narrowing BGAP and WGAP of the Upstream is the key for improving green water use inefficiency in the YREB. The panel Tobit regression results show that economic development, technological innovation, water use structure, water resources endowment, environmental regulation and regional differences all play positive/negative effects on green water use inefficiency in the YREB, while these factors’ influencing direction, degree and significance are significantly different.

https://openalex.org/W3014590847,"The ovarian tumor domain (OTU) deubiquitinylating cysteine proteases OTUB1 and OTUB2 (OTU ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1 and 2) are representative members of the OTU subfamily of deubiquitinylases. Deubiquitinylation critically regulates a multitude of important cellular processes, such as apoptosis, cell signaling, and growth. Moreover, elevated OTUB expression has been observed in various cancers, including glioma, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. Here, using molecular dynamics simulation approaches, we found that both OTUB1 and OTUB2 display a catalytic triad characteristic of proteases but differ in their configuration and protonation states. The OTUB1 protein had a prearranged catalytic site, with strong electrostatic interactions between the active-site residues His265 and Asp267. In OTUB2, however, the arrangement of the catalytic triad was different. In the absence of ubiquitin, the neutral states of the catalytic-site residues in OTUB2 were more stable, resulting in larger distances between these residues. Only upon ubiquitin binding did the catalytic triad in OTUB2 rearrange and bring the active site into a catalytically feasible state. An analysis of water access channels revealed only a few diffusion trajectories for the catalytically active form of OTUB1, whereas in OTUB2 the catalytic site was solvent-accessible, and a larger number of water molecules reached and left the binding pocket. Interestingly, in OTUB2, the catalytic residues His224 and Asn226 formed a stable hydrogen bond. We propose that the observed differences in activation kinetics, protonation states, water channels, and active-site accessibility between OTUB1 and OTUB2 may be relevant for the selective design of OTU inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3014686468,"Accessibility of emergency medical care is one of the crucial factors in evaluating national primary medical care systems. While many studies have focused on this issue, there was a fundamental limit to the measurement of accessibility of emergency rooms, because the commonly used census-based population data are difficult to provide realistic information in terms of time and space. In this study, we evaluated the geographical accessibility of emergency rooms in South Korea by using dynamic population counts from mobile phone data. Such population counts were more accurate and up-to-date because they are obtained by aggregating the number of mobile phone users in a 50-by-50 m grid of a locational field, weighted by stay time. Considering both supply and demand of emergency rooms, the 2-step floating catchment analysis was implemented. As a result, urban areas, including the capital city Seoul, showed lower accessibility to emergency rooms, whereas rural areas recorded higher accessibility. This result was contrary to the results analyzed by us based on census-based population data: higher accessibility in urban areas and lower in rural. This implies that using solely census data for accessibility analysis could lead to certain errors, and adopting mobile-based population data would represent the real-world situations for solving problems of social inequity in primary medical care."

The main objective was to determine the prevalence of HIV and the rates of asymptomatic infection by TB, and the social and behavioral risk factors associated. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to June 2017 using a simple random sampling methodology. Eligible participants were individuals who were living in the community at the time the survey was conducted, which included adult mine workers and members of their families aged 18 and above. A socio-behavioral questionnaire was administered, blood specimens were collected for HIV testing (Determine/Unigold) and sputum for TB (GeneXpert MTB/RIF) was collected. The statistical analysis was performed using the R studio software to produce means, proportion and odds ratio at 95% confidence intervals. Results A total of 1012 participants were enrolled, 75.2% were females, with a median age of 34. The overall prevalence of HIV found in the two communities was 24.2% (CI: 21.6–27.0) and was higher in the rural community (31.6%; 95% CI: 27.0–35.3). The prevalence of active TB was found to be 0.3% (n = 3) while 7.5% of the participants self-reported to have been previously diagnosed with TB at some point in their life. Only 2.8% of participants had knowledge of the basic principles of TB transmission. Condom use at last sexual intercourse with a regular partner was low among both sexes (17.3% male and 12.6% female). A considerable proportion of participants had not been aware of their HIV positive serostatus(31.1% female and 25.0% male). About 1/3 of the participants had had a history of STIs. Conclusion The results of this survey confirm a high prevalence of HIV in communities of origin of migrant miners in Gaza province. Findings also demonstrated low levels of awareness/ knowledge and prevention of TB and HIV. It is important to strengthen strategies that encourage regular HIV testing and TB screening. Appropriate communication interventions on methods of transmission and prevention of HIV and TB in these communities must be intensified, as well as ensuring ongoing linkage to TB and HIV social and healthcare services."

https://openalex.org/W3014848114,"Using Brownian dynamics simulations, the motion of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in the presence of fuel (or 'food') sources is studied. It is an established fact that within confined stationary systems, the activity of ABPs generates density profiles that are enhanced in regions of low activity, which is generally referred to as 'anti-chemotaxis'. We demonstrate that -- contrary to common believes -- in non-stationary setups, emerging here as a result of short fuel bursts, our model ABPs do instead exhibit signatures of chemotactic behavior. In direct competition with inactive, but otherwise identical Brownian particles (BPs), the ABPs are shown to fetch a larger amount of food. From a biological perspective, the ability to turn active would, despite of the absence of sensoric devices, encompass an evolutionary advantage."
https://openalex.org/W3014475237,"People with sickle cell disease (SCD) are reported to have low rates of HIV infection, slower progression to AIDS and lower HIV-associated mortality compared to the general population. Mechanisms of potential resistance to HIV in SCD are incompletely understood. We retrospectively reviewed the Transfusion Safety Study to compare HIV status between people with SCD and other congenital anemias who were routinely exposed to blood products during the high-risk period before HIV screening implementation. Non-SCD congenital anemia diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of HIV acquisition compared to SCD (OR 13.1 95%CI 1.6–108.9). In addition, we prospectively enrolled 30 SCD cases and 30 non-SCD controls to investigate potential mechanisms of resistance to HIV in SCD. CCR5 and CCR7 expression was lower and CD4 expression was higher on CD4+ T cells from SCD cases compared to controls. Surface expression of CD4+ T cell CXCR4, CD38 and HLA-DR did not differ between the groups. SCD CD4+ T cells were not less susceptible to HIV infection than controls. Levels of multiple cytokines were elevated in the SCD plasma, but SCD plasma compared to control plasma did not inhibit HIV infection of target cells. In conclusion, our epidemiological data support people with SCD being resistant to HIV infection. Potential mechanisms include lower CD4+ T cell expression of CCR5 and CCR7, balanced by increased CD4 expression and cytokine levels, which did not result in in vitro resistance to HIV infection. Further study is needed to define the risk and pathophysiology of HIV in persons with SCD."
https://openalex.org/W3015007162,"Disrupted clearance of all-trans-retinal (atRAL), a component of the visual (retinoid) cycle in the retina, may cause photoreceptor atrophy in autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the mechanisms underlying atRAL-induced photoreceptor loss remain elusive. Here, we report that atRAL activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling at least partially through reactive oxygen species production, which promoted mitochondria-mediated caspase- and DNA damage-dependent apoptosis in photoreceptor cells. Damage to mitochondria in atRAL-exposed photoreceptor cells resulted from JNK activation, leading to decreased expression of Bcl2 apoptosis regulator (Bcl2), increased Bcl2 antagonist/killer (Bak) levels, and cytochrome c (Cyt c) release into the cytosol. Cytosolic Cyt c specifically provoked caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and thereby initiated apoptosis. Phosphorylation of JNK in atRAL-loaded photoreceptor cells induced the appearance of γH2AX, a sensitive marker for DNA damage, and was also associated with apoptosis onset. Suppression of JNK signaling protected photoreceptor cells against atRAL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, photoreceptor cells lacking Jnk1 and Jnk2 genes were more resistant to atRAL-associated cytotoxicity. The Abca4−/− Rdh8−/− mouse model displays defects in atRAL clearance that are characteristic of STGD1 and dry AMD. We found that JNK signaling was activated in the neural retina of light-exposed Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice. Of note, intraperitoneal administration of JNK–IN-8, which inhibits JNK signaling, effectively ameliorated photoreceptor degeneration and apoptosis in light-exposed Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice. We propose that pharmacological inhibition of JNK signaling may represent a therapeutic strategy for preventing photoreceptor loss in retinopathies arising from atRAL overload.

However, whether aberrant aggregation of atRAL activates JNK signaling in photoreceptor cells and its potential relationship to photoreceptor loss remain unclarified. In this study, we further elucidated the mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration in retinopathies correlated with disrupted atRAL clearance. The health of 661W photoreceptor cells exposed to atRAL for 6 h was examined. atRAL decreased viability of 661W photoreceptor cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The IC50 value for atRAL incubated with 661W photoreceptor cells for 6 h was 5.68 μm. Additionally, treatment of 661W photoreceptor cells with atRAL for 6 h at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 μm caused significant decreases in cell viability of ∼40.5, 80.5, and 92.4%, respectively. Based on the results of these cytotoxicity tests, 661W photoreceptor cells were treated for 6 h with 5 μm atRAL in subsequent experiments. TUNEL staining, 6 h after incubating 661W photoreceptor cells with 5 μm atRAL, revealed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Imaging of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) using rhodamine-123 showed that the treatment of 661W photoreceptor cells with 5 μm atRAL for 6 h significantly reduced the levels of ΔΨm (Fig. 1D). Immunoblot analysis indicated that atRAL stimulated a significant decline in the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 in lysates of 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1, E and F). 661W photoreceptor cells treated for 6 h with 5 μm atRAL or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) serving as a vehicle control were fractionated to collect mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions for Western blot analysis of Bak and cytochrome c (Cyt c), respectively. The data manifested significant increases in protein levels of mitochondrial Bak (Fig. 1G) and cytosolic Cyt c (Fig. 1H) in atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells, suggesting that increased Bak protein may escape suppression by Bcl2 protein (27Panaretakis T. Pokrovskaja K. Shoshan M.C. Grandér D. Activation of Bak, Bax, and BH3-only proteins in the apoptotic response to doxorubicin.J. Biol.

Protein levels of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 were found be clearly elevated in lysates of atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1I). Immunofluorescence staining also showed that 5 μm atRAL significantly increased protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 in 661W photoreceptor cells after 6 h of exposure (Fig. 1J). Overexpression of Bcl2 protein in 661W photoreceptor cells was done at a level that was very far above the level in control cells (Fig. 1K), and attenuated protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 in lysates of atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1K). However, with such a huge overexpression of Bcl2 protein, we still observed a certain level of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 1K) in atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells and only a marginal effect on restoration of cell viability (Fig. 1L), thus suggesting that the role of Bcl-2 decrease may not be crucial in this particular mitochondrial apoptotic process. Moreover, treatment with 20 μm caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK decreased protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 by ∼28% in lysates of atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1M) and increased cell viability by ∼29% (Fig. 1N). Taken together, these findings indicate that atRAL stimulates an apoptotic cell death in photoreceptor cells through the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Analyses using Western blotting and confocal microscopy with immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that protein levels of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), an active form of JNK, were significantly up-regulated in lysates of 661W photoreceptor cells treated for 6 h with 5 μm atRAL (Fig. 2, A and B), indicative of the ability of atRAL to activate JNK signaling in 661W photoreceptor cells. Given that the phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK, is an indicator of JNK activation, we also examined c-Jun activation status in 661W photoreceptor cells in response to atRAL by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. As expected, protein levels of phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun), a downstream transcription factor directly activated by JNK, were clearly elevated in atRAL-treated 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Because JNK–IN-8 is considered as an efficient, specific, and irreversible JNK inhibitor that inhibits c-Jun phosphorylation (28Zhang T. Inesta-Vaquera F. Niepel M. Zhang J. Ficarro S.B. Machleidt T. Xie T. Marto J.A. Kim N. Sim T. Laughlin J.D. Park H. LoGrasso P.V. Patricelli M. Nomanbhoy T.K. et al.Discovery of potent and selective covalent inhibitors of JNK.Chem.

Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that JNK–IN-8 at a concentration of 1 μm clearly decreased protein levels of p-c-Jun and cleaved caspase-3 in lysates of atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 2E). Notably, the results of the CellTiter 96 AQueous One-Solution Cell Proliferation assay (MTS) showed that treatment with 1 μm JNK–IN-8 effectively rescued 661W photoreceptor cells from apoptosis caused by atRAL (Fig. 2F). Collectively, these findings disclose that atRAL evokes photoreceptor apoptosis at least in part via activating JNK signaling. Protein levels of γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks, were significantly increased in 661W photoreceptor cells treated with 5 μm atRAL for 6 h, as determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3, A and B). Given that ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM), a serine/threonine protein kinase, is recruited, autophosphorylated, and activated at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (29Shiloh Y. The ATM-mediated DNA-damage response: taking shape.Trends Biochem.

As expected, the p-ATM fluorescence intensity was markedly elevated in 661W photoreceptor cells exposed to 5 μm atRAL for 6 h (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that atRAL induces DNA damage response in photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that treatment with 1 μm JNK–IN-8 significantly reduced protein levels of γH2AX in atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 3D). To further ascertain the role of JNK activation in apoptosis caused by atRAL, Jnk1 and Jnk2 genes were knocked out in 661W photoreceptor cells using the CRISPR–CAS9 system. As expected, immunoblot analysis revealed a deficient expression of JNK protein in lysates of 661W photoreceptor cells lacking Jnk1 and Jnk2 genes (Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− 661W photoreceptor cells) (Fig. 4A). Also by Western blotting, a significant decrease in protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and γH2AX (Fig. 4, B and C), and a deficiency of p-JNK, JNK, and p-c-Jun (Fig. 4, B and D) were observed in lysates of atRAL-loaded Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− versus wildtype (WT) 661W photoreceptor cells. Moreover, in contrast to the finding that atRAL stimulated a significant decline in protein levels of Bcl2 in atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1, E and F), protein expression of Bcl2 was remarkably elevated in Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− over WT 661W photoreceptor cells regardless of atRAL exposure (Fig. 4E). Conversely, exposure of Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− 661W photoreceptor cells to 5 μm atRAL for 6 h resulted in significant decreases in protein levels of mitochondrial Bak and cytosolic Cyt c (Fig. 4, F and G), revealing that Bak is the downstream factor that damages mitochondria after JNK activation. More importantly, the results of MTS assay showed that the viability of Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− 661W photoreceptor cells, 6 h after exposure to 5 μm atRAL, was clearly increased compared with that of WT 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 4H). These findings indicate that, after atRAL loading, inactivation of JNK signaling in 661W photoreceptor cells attenuates mitochondria-mediated caspase-/DNA damage-dependent apoptosis. To provide further evidence for the involvement of JNK activation in atRAL-induced apoptosis of 661W photoreceptor cells, we re-expressed JNK1, JNK2, or both in Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− 661W photoreceptor cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that protein levels of p-JNK, cleaved caspase-3, γH2AX, and p-c-Jun were significantly increased in atRAL-loaded Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− 661W photoreceptor cells re-expressing JNK1, JNK2, or both (Fig. 4, I and J). Re-expression of JNK1, JNK2, or both caused a decreased viability in atRAL-loaded Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 4K). Interestingly, re-expression of JNK1 and JNK2 significantly aggravated apoptotic cell death caused by atRAL in Jnk1−/−Jnk2−/− 661W photoreceptor cells than that of either JNK1 or JNK2 (Fig. 4K). Considering that ROS can induce apoptosis by activating JNK signaling (31Mao X. Yu C.R. Li W.H. Li W.X. Induction of apoptosis by shikonin through a ROS/JNK-mediated process in Bcr/Abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells.Cell Res. 2008; 18 (18663379): 879-88810.1038/cr.2008.86Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), intracellular ROS generation was measured by flow cytometry and confocal laser-scanning microscopy after atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells were incubated with the fluorescent probe H2DCFDA. Exposure of 5 μm atRAL to 661W photoreceptor cells for 6 h dramatically stimulated the production of intracellular ROS (Fig. 5, A–C), with an ∼7.8-fold increase over control cells (Fig. 5B). MitoSOX Red is a specific dye for mitochondrial ROS (32Johnson-Cadwell L.I. Jekabsons M.B. Wang A. Polster B.M. Nicholls D.G. 'Mild Uncoupling' does not decrease mitochondrial superoxide levels in cultured cerebellar granule neurons but decreases spare respiratory capacity and increases toxicity to glutamate and oxidative stress.J.

After incubating atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells with MitoSOX Red, confocal microscopy was used to examine fluorescently-stained cells and revealed that ROS induced by atRAL were at least in part localized to mitochondria (Fig. 5D). Treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) at a concentration of 2 mm effectively reduced ROS production in 661W photoreceptor cells after 6 h of exposure to 5 μm atRAL (Fig. 6, A and B), and it promoted cellular survival (Fig. 6C) against apoptosis caused by atRAL. Western blot analysis indicated that 2 mm NAC significantly decreased the ratio of the p-JNK/JNK protein level and protein levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, γH2AX, and p-c-Jun in lysates of atRAL-loaded 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 6, D–F). Moreover, treatment with 2 mm NAC resulted in a significant decrease in protein levels of Cyt c in the cytosol of atRAL-exposed 661W photoreceptor cells (Fig. 6G). These findings suggest that attenuation of JNK signaling in atRAL-exposed 661W photoreceptor cells by suppressing the ROS generation alleviates mitochondria-mediated caspase-/DNA damage-dependent apoptosis and thereby increases cell viability. Previous studies have indicated that exposure of Abca4−/− Rdh8−/− mice featuring defective atRAL clearance to intense light increases atRAL levels in the retina and leads to severe photoreceptor degeneration (5Maeda A.

https://openalex.org/W3014620591,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health problem and is the leading cause of death from a single bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains aggravate the problem, especially in tuberculosis high burden countries such as Ethiopia. The supposedly high initial cost of laboratory diagnosis coupled with scarce financial resources has limited collection of information about drug resistance patterns and circulating strains in peripheral and emerging regions of Ethiopia. Here, we investigated drug susceptibility and genetic diversity of mycobacterial isolates among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in the Benishangul Gumuz region and its surroundings in northwest Ethiopia. Methods and material In a cross-sectional study, 107 consecutive sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients diagnosed at two hospitals and seven health centers were enrolled between October 2013 and June 2014. Sputum samples were cultured at Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) TB laboratory, and drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed against Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol, and Streptomycin using the indirect proportion method. Isolates were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)based Region of Difference 9 (RD9) testing and spoligotyping. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows version 24.0. Results Of 107 acid-fast-bacilli (AFB) smear-positive sputum samples collected, 81.3% (87/107) were culture positive. A PCR based RD9 testing revealed that all the 87 isolates were M. tuberculosis. Of these isolates, 16.1% (14/87) resistance to one or more drugs was observed. Isoniazid monoresistance occurred in 6.9% (6/87). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in two isolates (2.3%), one of which was resistant to all the four drugs tested. Spoligotyping revealed that the majority, 61.3% (46/75) of strains could be grouped into ten spoligotype patterns containing two to 11 isolates each while the remaining 38.7% (29/75) were unique. SIT289 (11 isolates) and SIT53 (nine isolates) constituted 43.5% (20/46) among clustered isolates while 29.3% (22/75) were ‘‘New” to the database. The dominant families were T, 37% (28/75), CAS, 16.0% (12/75), and H, 8% (6/75), adding up to 51.3% (46/75) of all isolates identified. Conclusion and recommendations The current study indicates a moderate prevalence of MDR TB. However, the observed high monoresistance to Isoniazid, one of the two proxy drugs for MDR-TB, reveals the hidden potential threat fora sudden increase in MDR-TB if resistance to Rifampicin would increase. Clustered spoligotype patterns suggest ongoing active tuberculosis transmission in the area. The results underscore the need for enhanced monitoring of TB drug resistance and epidemiological studies in this and other peripheral regions of the country using robust molecular tools with high discriminatory power such as the Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units -Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)."

Fibroblasts are the major nonmalignant cell type in the stroma of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this study, we investigated whether the chronological aging of normal human fibroblasts (NHFs), a previously underappreciated area in pancreatic cancer research, influences the progression and therapeutic outcomes of PDAC. Results from experiments with murine xenografts and 2D and 3D co-cultures of NHFs and PDAC cells revealed that older NHFs stimulate proliferation of and confer resistance to radiation therapy of PDAC. MS-based metabolite analysis indicated that older NHFs have significantly increased arachidonic acid 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) expression and elevated levels of its mitogenic metabolite, 12-(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-(S)-HETE) compared with their younger counterparts. In co-cultures with older rather than with younger NHFs, PDAC cells exhibited increases in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cellular metabolism, as well as a lower oxidation state that correlated with their enhanced proliferation and resistance to radiation therapy. Expression of ALOX12 was found to be significantly lower in PDAC cell lines and tumor biopsies, suggesting that PDAC cells rely on a stromal supply of mitogens for their proliferative needs. Pharmacological (hydroxytyrosol) and molecular (siRNA) interventions of ALOX12 in older NHFs suppressed their ability to stimulate proliferation of PDAC cells. We conclude that chronological aging of NHFs contributes to PDAC progression and that ALOX12 and 12-(S)-HETE may be potential stromal targets for interventions that seek to halt progression and improve therapy outcomes.

Metabolism of quiescent cultures of NHFs from younger (newborn to 1 year old) donors were found to be more glycolytic compared with NHFs from older (29–70 years old) donors that exhibited significant increases in mitochondrial respiration. These previously published results led us to the novel hypothesis that an age-related change in metabolism of the stroma contributes to the progression of epithelial cancer. An increase in mitochondrial respiration and decrease in glycolysis in older NHFs suggest that changes in lipid metabolism during aging can influence stroma-directed progression of PDAC.

Results from this study show that the chronological aging of the stroma regulates progression and radiation therapy resistance of PDAC. ALOX12 and 12-(S)-HETE are potential targets of the aging stroma that can be considered to halt progression and improve therapy of PDAC. To determine whether chronological aging of NHFs regulates progression of PDAC, we used a novel murine xenograft approach where co-cultures of CellTracker Green-labeled NHFs and luciferase expressing MIA PaCa-2 cells (10:1) embedded in injectable tissue-like 3D gel matrix were injected into the flank of 30-day-old athymic female nude mice (Foxn1nu). Bioluminescence imaging system (Xenogen IVIS-200) was used to measure proliferation. Results clearly show the presence of CellTracker Green-labeled NHFs and luciferase expressing MIA PaCa-2 cells in the xenograft (Fig. 1A). The presence of NHFs in tumors was also evident from the confocal microscopy analysis of excised tumor tissues (Fig. 1B) and flow cytometry analysis of cell suspensions prepared from resected tumors (Fig. 1C). Measurements of tumor volume showed 2× tumor volume in xenografts carrying co-cultures of MIA PaCa-2 cells and NHFs from a 61-year-old healthy donor compared with tumor volume in co-cultures of MIA PaCa-2 cells and NHFs from a 3-day-old healthy donor. Increases in tumor volume correlated with a shorter median survival of a 34-day-old compared with a median survival of 44 days of mice carrying xenograft of MIA PaCa-2 cells and NHFs from a 3-day-old donor (Fig. 1, D and E). An age-related stimulation of proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 cells in co-cultures of older compared with young NHFs was also observed in an orthotopic xenograft approach (Fig. S1). Overall, these results support our novel hypothesis that chronological aging of the stroma regulates progression of PDAC. Results from these in vivo experiments were also recapitulated in 3D and 2D co-cultures in vitro. A mixture of luciferase expressing MIA PaCa-2-Luc cells and quiescent cultures of NHFs (10:1) were embedded into the Cell Mate 3D matrix and co-cultured for different days. Photon counts showed approximately a 4-fold increase of MIA PaCa-2-Luc cells co-cultured with quiescent cultures of NHFs from a 61-year-old healthy donor (Fig. 2, A and B). The doubling time of MIA PaCa-2-Luc cells co-cultured with NHFs from a 61-year-old donor was ∼20 h compared with a doubling time of 60 h for MIA PaCa-2-Luc cells co-cultured with NHFs from a 3-day-old donor (Fig. 2B). Similar to the co-existence of MIA PaCa-2-Luc cells and NHFs in tumor xenograft in vivo (Fig. 1, A–C), results from H&E staining and fluorescence microscopy also showed the presence of NHFs (black arrow) and MIA PaCa-2 cells (white arrow) in the 3D co-cultures (Fig. 2B, inset), suggesting that the 3D co-culture method can partially mimic the tumor microenvironment in vitro. To determine whether the age of the stroma can also influence therapy of PDAC, 3D co-cultures of quiescent NHFs and PDAC-Luc cells were irradiated with a shortened clinical protocol, 2 Gy × 5 days. Results showed that the rate of proliferation of MIA PaCa-2-Luc cells is consistently higher in irradiated co-cultures of NHFs from a 61-year-old donor at 4–12 days post-irradiation compared with co-cultures with NHFs from a 3-day-old healthy donor (Fig. 2C). Comparable results were also obtained from co-cultures using a separate PDAC cell line, PANC-1-Luc (Fig. 2D). These results support the hypothesis that chronological aging of the stroma significantly affects proliferation and radiation therapy of PDAC cells. The age difference between the two NHFs (61 years old versus 3 days old) and our earlier observation of chronological aging of NHFs stimulating proliferation of breast cancer cells (13Sarsour E.H.

To further investigate this hypothesis, quiescent cultures of NHFs from a 3-day-old donor were aged in vitro for 7 (early) and 60 (late) days. CellTracker Green-labeled MIA PaCa-2 cells were then added on top of the unlabeled quiescent lawns of NHFs. 2D co-cultures of MIA PaCa-2 cells and NHFs were continued in vitro for an additional 2–6 days. Microscopy imaging and flow cytometry methods (13Sarsour E.H. Goswami M. Kalen A.L. Lafin J.T. Goswami P.C. Hydroxytyrosol inhibits chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 mediated aged quiescent fibroblast-induced stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation.Age. 2014; 36 (24691968): 964510.1007/s11357-014-9645-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were used to measure proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 cells in co-cultures of NHFs. Microscopy evaluation of the density of MIA PaCa-2 cells showed a significant increase in proliferation of MIA PaCa-2 cells co-cultured with late-NHFs (3-fold increase at 6 days of co-culture) (Fig. 3A). The doubling time for MIA PaCa-2 cells co-cultured with quiescent cultures of late-NHFs was calculated to be 23 h compared with a doubling time of 33 h for MIA PaCa-2 cells co-cultured with early-NHFs (Fig. 3B). These results were further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of the percentage of MIA PaCa-2 cells in co-cultures of early- and late-NHFs; there was more than 60% increase in the number of MIA PaCa-2 cells co-cultured with late-NHFs compared with early-NHFs (Fig. 3C). These results clearly show that quiescent cultures of NHFs that are chronologically aged in vitro also promote proliferation of PDAC cells. To rigorously test this novel observation of chronological aging affecting progression of PDAC, additional 2D co-culture experiments were performed using NHFs from donors of different ages. Results showed a significant increase in the percentage of MIA PaCa-2 cells from 7% in co-cultures of quiescent cultures of NHFs from a 3-day-old donor to 18 and 30% in co-cultures with NHFs from 12- and 61-year-old healthy donors, respectively (Fig. 3, D and E). Comparable results were also observed in co-cultures of NHFs and PANC-1 and BxPC-3 PDAC cell lines (Fig. 3E). Additionally, a small but statistically significant increase in proliferation of nonmalignant H6c7 pancreatic ductal epithelial cells was also observed in co-cultures of NHFs from a 61-year-old donor (Fig. 3E). These results showed that the chronological aging of NHFs promotes proliferation of both malignant and nonmalignant pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, but the growth stimulatory effects are significantly higher in malignant compared with nonmalignant cells. Results from the 3D co-culture experiments demonstrating radiation resistance of PDAC cells in co-cultures of old compared with young NHFs (Fig. 2D) were also recapitulated in experiments using 2D co-cultures. CellTracker Green-labeled MIA PaCa-2 cells were layered upon confluent cultures of NHFs from 3-day-old and 12- and 61-year-old healthy donors. Co-cultures at 5 days post-plating were irradiated with 0, 2, and 4 Gy ionizing radiation and continued in culture. The percentage of CellTracker Green-labeled MIA PaCa-2 cells in control and irradiated co-cultures was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results showed a significant increase in the percentage of MIA PaCa-2 cells in un-irradiated control co-cultures of 12- and 61-year-old compared with 3-day-old NHFs; approximately, 15 and 30% MIA PaCa-2 cells in co-cultures of 12- and 61-year-old NHFs compared with 5% MIA PaCa-2 cells in co-cultures of 3-day-old NHFs (Fig. 4A). Co-cultures irradiated with 4 Gy radiation showed a significant decrease in the percentage of MIA PaCa-2 cells in all co-cultures compared with their respective un-irradiated controls (Fig. 4A). However, the decrease in the percentage of MIA PaCa-2 cells in irradiated co-cultures of 61-year-old NHFs was significantly less than co-cultures with 12-year-old and 3-day-old NHFs (Fig. 4A), further suggesting that aging NHFs confer radiation resistance of MIA PaCa-2 cells. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis of radiation-induced toxicity of MIA PaCa-2 cells in co-cultures of NHFs showed maximal cell death in co-cultures of 3-day compared with 12- and 61-year-old NHFs (Fig. 4B). Overall, these results showed that quiescent cultures of NHFs from donors of older compared with younger healthy individuals stimulate proliferation and induce radiation therapy resistance of PDAC cells (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). We previously reported significant increases in mitochondrial respiration rates and decreases in glycolytic flux in NHFs from 29–70–year-old healthy donors (14Son J.M. Sarsour E.H. Kakkerla Balaraju A. Fussell J. Kalen A.L. Wagner B.A. Buettner G.R. Goswami P.C. Mitofusin 1 and optic atrophy 1 shift metabolism to mitochondrial respiration during aging.Aging Cell. 2017; 16 (28758339): 1136-114510.1111/acel.12649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), demonstrating that changes in cellular metabolism occur during chronological aging of NHFs. To determine whether specific metabolic processes are altered during chronological aging, metabolomics profiling was performed (University of Iowa Metabolomics Core Facility). A semi-targeted high-resolution GC-MS protocol was used to quantitatively measure metabolites of the TCA cycle, glycolytic intermediates, amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids. Results showed significant increases in fatty acids levels of NHFs from older healthy donors, mostly in the 18–22 carbon fatty acids (Fig. 5A). Among this group of fatty acids, levels of AA (C20:4) showed an increase of ∼2-fold. AA is converted to eicosanoids by cyclooxygenase and ALOX enzymes. Initially, a RT-qPCR assay was performed to determine whether an age-related increase in AA metabolism could be due to an increase in the expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS-1 and -2) and arachidonic acid lipoxygenase (ALOX5, -12, and -15) enzymes. Results showed no significant difference in the expression of PTGS-1 and -2, and ALOX5 and ALOX15 between the 61-year- and 3-day-old NHFs. However, a significant difference in the expression of ALOX12 was observed in the 61-year-old NHFs: a ∼6-fold increase in mRNA levels (Fig. 5B) and 2-fold increase in protein levels (Fig. 5B, inset). This intriguing observation of an age-related increase in ALOX12 expression was further evident from a corresponding increase in its secreted metabolite, 12-(S)-HETE. Levels of 12-(S)-HETE were significantly lower (<10 fg cell−1) in NHFs from a 3-day- and 5-month-old healthy donor compared with 10–35 fg cell−1 in NHFs from the 58–70–year-old group (Fig. 5C). To further verify that the increases in 12-(S)-HETE levels are true representation of the chronological aging process, NHFs from a 3-day healthy donor were aged in quiescence for 7 (early) and 60 (late) days. Consistent with the results of 12-(S)-HETE levels in NHFs from donors of different ages (Fig. 5C), early-NHFs showed significantly lower levels of 12-(S)-HETE (<10 fg cell−1) compared with more than 20 fg cell−1 in late-NHFs (Fig. 5D). Overall, these results showed significant increases in the expression of ALOX12 and its metabolite, 12-(S)-HETE during the chronological aging of NHFs. Considering the mitogenic property of 12-(S)-HETE (28Ding X.Z. Tong W.G. Adrian T.E. 12-lipoxygenase metabolite 12(S)-HETE stimulates human pancreatic cancer cell proliferation via protein tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK activation.Int. J.

Chem. 1987; 262 (2826426): 17613-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesize that 12-(S)-HETE secreted from the aging stroma stimulates proliferation of PDAC cells via a paracrine signaling pathway. To test this novel hypothesis, we first measured mRNA levels of ALOX12 in established PDAC cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1), recently generated patient-derived PDAC cell lines (339 and 403), and a transformed but nonmalignant (H6c7) human pancreatic epithelial cell line. Expression of ALOX12 in all four PDAC cell lines was significantly lower compared with its expression in the nonmalignant cell line, H6c7 (Fig. 5, E and F). Next, we examined whether the receptor for 12-(S)-HETE, GPR31, is differentially expressed in normal compared with PDAC cells. Expression of GPR31 was found to be significantly lower in NHFs and H6c7 cells compared with a 6–14–fold increase in the PDAC cell lines (Fig. 5G). These results suggest that whereas 12-(S)-HETE secreted from NHFs may not affect their own proliferation because of significantly lower expression of GPR31 and quiescent growth state, they can have a paracrine effect on neighboring PDAC cells that have significantly higher expression of GPR31. This premise is supported from results presented in Fig. 5H. A dose-dependent increase in the number of MIA PaCa-2 cells was observed when different concentrations (1–10 fg cell−1) of 12-(S)-HETE were added to the medium and cells were cultured for 24–48 h (Fig. 5H). Overall, these results suggest that 12-(S)-HETE secreted from the aging stroma initiates a paracrine mitogenic effect that results in enhanced proliferation of PDAC cells. We have previously shown that quiescent cultures of 3-day NHFs aged in vitro induced ERK1/2-cyclin D1 proliferative pathway in human breast cancer cells resulting in their enhanced proliferation (13Sarsour E.H. Goswami M. Kalen A.L. Lafin J.T. Goswami P.C. Hydroxytyrosol inhibits chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 mediated aged quiescent fibroblast-induced stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation.Age. 2014; 36 (24691968): 964510.1007/s11357-014-9645-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine whether older NHFs-induced proliferation of PDAC cells (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) is associated with the induction of MAPK pathways, MIA PaCa-2 cells were first separated from co-cultures of NHFs by flow cytometry-based cell sorting. RayBiotech MAPK pathway phosphorylation arrays were used to measure the phosphorylation status of pro-proliferative signaling proteins. Although phosphorylation (active form) of most of the proliferative-signaling proteins increased in MIA PaCa-2 cells co-cultured with 61-year-old compared with 3-day-young NHFs, increases in the ERK1/2, and mTOR signaling pathways were more pronounced (Fig. 6). These results suggest that increases in the ERK1/2 and mTOR signaling pathways can mediate enhanced proliferation of PDAC cells in co-cultures of old compared with young NHFs. Increases in glucose and mitochondrial metabolism during progression from G0-G1 to S-G2-M phases suggest that cellular metabolism is intimately linked to cellular proliferation (30Sarsour E.H.

This increase was positively correlated with both the change in the percentage of CD4+ T-cells and with the decrease of CD38+ molecules on Central Memory CD8+ and negatively correlated with the change in the percentage of CD4+ Effector Memory cells. Increase in TL could be an expression of immune reconstitution and the associated decrease in immune activation. We acknowledge for the low statistical power due to the small sample size and the potential for false positive results due to multiple testing. Hence, further studies are needed to confirm these observations."
https://openalex.org/W3014565097,"Humans are accustomed to Earth’s constant gravitational acceleration of 1g. Here we assessed if complex movements such as jumps can be adapted to different acceleration levels in a non-constant force field elicited through centrifugation. Kinematics, kinetics and muscle activity of 14 male subjects (age 27±5years, body mass 77±6kg, height 181±7cm) were recorded during repetitive hopping in a short-arm human centrifuge for five different acceleration levels (0.5g, 0.75g, 1g, 1.25g, 1.5g). These data were compared to those recorded during normal hops on the ground, and hops in a previously validated sledge jump system. Increasing acceleration from 0.5g to 1.5g resulted in increased peak ground reaction forces (+80%, p<0.001), rate of force development (+100%, p<0.001) and muscle activity (+30 to +140%, depending on phase, side and muscle). However, most of the recorded parameters did not attain the level observed for jumps on the ground or in the jump system. For instance, peak forces during centrifugation with 1g amounted to 60% of the peak forces during jumps on the ground, ground contact time was prolonged by 90%, and knee joint excursions were reduced by 50%. We conclude that in principle, a quick adaptation to acceleration levels other than the normal constant gravitational acceleration of 1g is possible, even in the presence of a non-constant force field and Coriolis forces. However, centrifugation introduced additional constraints compared to a constant force field without rotation, resulting in lower peak forces and changes in kinematics. These changes can be interpreted as a movement strategy aimed at reducing lower limb deflections caused by Coriolis forces."

Turnaround Time (TAT) is one of the most important measures when judging the efficiency of any laboratory and care system. Few studies on TAT exist for inpatient care settings within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We evaluated therapeutic TAT for a tertiary hospital in Western Kenya, using a time-motion study focusing specifically on common hematology and biochemistry orders. The aim was to determine significant bottlenecks in diagnostic testing processes at the institution. Results A total of 356 (155 hematology and 201 biochemistry) laboratory tests were fully tracked from the time of ordering to availability of results to care providers. The total therapeutic TAT for all tests was 21.5 ± 0.249 hours (95% CI). The therapeutic TAT for hematology was 20.3 ± 0.331 hours (95% CI) while that for biochemistry tests was 22.2 ± 0.346 hours (95% CI). Printing, sorting and dispatch of the printed results emerged as the most significant bottlenecks, accounting for up to 8 hours of delay (Hematology—8.3 ± 1.29 hours (95% CI), Biochemistry—8.5 ± 1.18 hours (95% CI)). Time of test orders affected TAT, with orders made early in the morning and those in the afternoon experiencing the most delays in TAT. Conclusion Significant inefficiencies exist at multiple steps in the turnaround times for routine laboratory tests at a large referral hospital within an LMIC setting. Multiple opportunities exist to improve TAT and streamline processes around diagnostic testing in this and other similar settings."

The effect of process parameter estimation on the expected cost of the synthetic np chart is investigated with the imposed statistical constraints. The minimum number of preliminary subgroups is determined where an almost similar expected cost to the known process parameter case is desired for the given cost model parameters. However, the available number of preliminary subgroups in practice is usually limited, especially when the number of preliminary subgroups is large. Consequently, the optimal chart parameters of the synthetic np chart are computed by considering the practical number of preliminary subgroups in which the cost function is minimized. This leads to a lower expected cost compared to that of adopting the optimal chart parameter corresponding to the known process parameter case."

This study determined patterns of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) among HIV-1 isolates from patients receiving first-line ART in South-eastern Nigeria. Blood samples were collected from HIV-1 infected patients accessing antiretroviral treatment centers at General Hospital Awo-Omamma, Imo state, State Hospital Asaba, Delta state and St Joseph's Catholic Hospital Adazi, Anambra state and used for HIV-1 DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. DRMs were scored using combination of Stanford algorithm and the 2015 International Antiviral Society-USA list while drug susceptibility was predicted using Stanford algorithm. Twenty eight of the HIV-1 isolates were sequenced and identified as subtypes G (35.7%), CRF02_AG (57.1%) and unclassifiable, UG (7.1%). Major PI resistance-associated mutations were identified at two sites including M46L (16.7% of subtype G/UG) and V82L (6.3% of CRF02_AG). Minor PI resistance-associated mutations identified among subtype G/UG are L10V/I (8.3%) and K20I (100%) while L10V/I (50%), K20I (100%), L33F (6.3%) and N88D (6.3%) were identified among CRF02_AG. Other polymorphisms found include; I13V/A, E35Q, M36I/L, N37D/S/E/H, R57K/G, L63T/P/S/Q, C67E/S, H69K/R, K70R, V82I and L89M in the range of 28.6% to 100% among the different subtypes. Interpretation based on Stanford algorithm showed that Darunavir/ritonavir is the only regimen whose potency was not compromised by the circulating mutations. Identification of major and minor PI resistance mutations in this study underscores the need for drug resistance testing prior to initiation of second line antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3014419670,"Influenza B virus (IBV) belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and generally causes sporadic epidemics but is occasionally deadly to individuals. The current research mainly focuses on clinical and pathological characteristics of IBV. However, to better prevent or treat the disease, one must determine the strategies developed by IBV to invade and disrupt cellular proteins and approach to replicate itself, to suppress antiviral innate immunity, and understand how the host responds to IBV infection. The B/Shanghai/PD114/2018 virus was able to infect alveolar epithelial cells (A549) cells, with good potential for replication. To identify host cellular responses against IBV infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained using RNA sequencing. The GO and KEGG pathway term enrichment analyses with the DEGs were performed, and we found that the DEGs were primary involved in metabolic processes and cellular function, which may be related to the host response, including the innate immune response against the virus. Our transcriptome analysis results demonstrated robust induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated gene expression by IBV in human cells during the early stages of infection, providing a foundation for further studies focused on antiviral drug development and interactions between the virus and host."

In the corn flour preparations, the cake had the highest retention (99%) when compared to couscous (97%). Besides, the cake showed higher retention when compared to the wheat flour preparations due to the interactions of the folic acid with the hydrophobic amino acids of the Zein, a protein found in corn. In wheat flour preparations, vitamin retention was 87%, 80% and 57% in bread, cake, and White sauce respectively. These findings relate to the change of the physicochemical properties of food components that occurs during mixing and cooking of the ingredients."

This work aims to assess health hazards of high-power microwaves and helps to define hazard threshold levels of modulated radiofrequency exposures such as those emitted by the first generations of mobile phones. Rats were exposed to the highest possible field levels, under single acute or repetitive exposures for eight weeks. Intense microwave electric fields at 1 MV m-1 of nanoseconds duration were applied from two sources at different carrier frequencies of 10 and 3.7 GHz. The repetition rate was 100 pps, and the duration of train pulses lasted from 10 s to twice 8 min. The effects on the central nervous system were evaluated, by labelling brain inflammation marker GFAP and by performing different behavioural tests: rotarod, T-maze, beam-walking, open-field, and avoidance test. Long-time survival was measured in animals repeatedly exposed, and anatomopathological analysis was performed on animals sacrificed at two years of life or earlier in case of precocious death. Control groups were sham exposed. Few effects were observed on behaviour. With acute exposure, an avoidance reflex was shown at very high thermal level (22 W kg-1); GFAP was increased some days after exposure. Most importantly, with repeated exposures, survival time was 4-months shorter in the exposed group, with eleven animals exhibiting a large sub-cutaneous tumour, compared to two in the sham group. A residual X-ray exposure was also present in the beam (0.8 Gy), which is probably not a bias for the observed result. High power microwaves below thermal level in average, can increase cancer prevalence and decrease survival time in rats, without clear effects on behaviour. The parameters of this effect need to be further explored, and a more precise dosimetry to be performed."
https://openalex.org/W3014636908,"Members of the phylum Bathyarchaeota and the class Thermoplasmata are widespread in marine and freshwater sediments where they have been recognized as key players in the carbon cycle. Here, we tested the responsiveness of archaeal communities on settled plant debris and sediment from a karstic lake to different organic carbon amendments (amino acids, plant-derived carbohydrates, and aromatics) using a lab-scale microcosm. Changes in the composition and abundance of sediment and biofilm archaeal communities in both DNA and RNA fractions were assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, respectively, after 7 and 30 days of incubation. Archaeal communities showed compositional changes in terms of alpha and beta diversity in relation to the type of carbon source (amino acids vs. plant-derived compounds), the nucleic acid fraction (DNA vs. RNA), and the incubation time (7 vs. 30 days). Distinct groups within the Bathyarchaeota (Bathy-15 and Bathy-6) and the Thermoplasmata (MBG-D) differently reacted to carbon supplements as deduced from the analysis of RNA libraries. Whereas Bathyarchaeota in biofilms showed a long-term positive response to humic acids, their counterparts in the sediment were mainly stimulated by the addition of tryptophan, suggesting the presence of different subpopulations in both habitats. Overall, our work presents an in vitro assessment of the versatility of archaea inhabiting freshwater sediments towards organic carbon and introduces settled leaf litter as a new habitat for the Bathyarchaeota and the Thermoplasmata."
https://openalex.org/W3014745851,"Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) uses the B1 mapping technique to provide the high-frequency conductivity distribution at Larmor frequency that simultaneously reflects the intracellular and extracellular effects. In biological tissues, the electrical conductivity can be described as the concentration and mobility of charge carriers. For the water molecule diffusivity, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) measures the random Brownian motion of water molecules within biological tissues. The DWI data can quantitatively access the mobility of microscopic water molecules within biological tissues. By measuring multi-b-value DWI data and the recovered high-frequency conductivity at Larmor frequency, we propose a new method to decompose the conductivity into the total ion concentration and mobility in the extracellular space (ECS) within a routinely applicable MR scan time. Using the measured multi-b-value DWI data, a constrained compartment model is designed to estimate the extracellular volume fraction and extracellular mean diffusivity. With the extracted extracellular volume fraction and water molecule diffusivity, we directly reconstruct the low-frequency electrical properties including the extracellular mean conductivity and extracellular conductivity tensor. To demonstrate the proposed method by comparing the ion concentration and the ion mobility, we conducted human experiments for the proposed low-frequency conductivity imaging. Human experiments verify that the proposed method can recover the low-frequency electrical properties using a conventional MRI scanner."
https://openalex.org/W3014116790,"A new species of encyrtid wasp, Metaphycus macadamiae Polaszek & Noyes sp. n., (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae: Encyrtinae) is described as a solitary endoparasitoid of the invasive macadamia felted coccid, Acanthococcus ironsidei (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae) in Hawaii. This parasitoid is native to Australia, and the species description is based on material collected from a Macadamia integrifolia Maiden & Betche (Proteaceae) plantation in New South Wales, Australia, the native region of the host tree and insect. It is described here because it is a potential biological control agent against this pest where it has recently invaded Hawaii and South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3014260211,"Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are long-lived mammals that can develop chronic aging-associated conditions similar to humans, including metabolic syndrome. Initial studies suggest that these conditions may be attenuated in dolphins using a modified fish diet. Serum metabolomics, fatty acid panels, and blood-based health indices were compared between 20 dolphins on a modified, 50% wild-type diet (50% mullet, 25% capelin, and 25% squid and/or herring) and 10 dolphins on a baseline diet (75% capelin and 25% squid and/or herring). Blood samples were collected at Months 0, 1, 3 and 6. Dolphins on the modified diet had lower insulin (7.5 ± 4.0 and 14.8 ± 14.0 μIU/ml, P = 0.039), lower cholesterol (160 ± 26 and 186 ± 24 mg/dl, P = 0.015) and higher hematocrit (46 ± 3 and 44 ± 3%, P = 0.043) by Month 1 compared to controls. Dolphins with anemia (hemoglobin ≤ 12.5 g/dl, n = 6) or low-normal hemoglobin (12.5–13.5 g/dl, n = 3) before placed on the modified diet had normal hemoglobin concentrations (> 13.5 g/dl) by Month 3. The modified diet caused a significant shift in the metabolome, which included 664 known metabolites. Thirty prioritized metabolites at Months 1 and 3 were 100% predictive of dolphins on the modified diet. Among 25 prioritized lipids, 10 (40%) contained odd-chain saturated fatty acids (OCFAs); C15:0 was the highest-prioritized OCFA. Increased dietary intake of C15:0 (from 1.3 ± 0.4 to 4.5 ± 1.1 g/day) resulted in increased erythrocyte C15:0 concentrations (from 1.5 ± 0.3 to 5.8 ± 0.8 μg/ml, P < 0.0001), which independently predicted raised hemoglobin. Further, increasing age was associated with declining serum C15:0 (R2 = 0.14, P = 0.04). While higher circulating OCFAs have been previously associated with lower risks of cardiometabolic diseases in humans, further studies are warranted to assess potential active roles of OCFAs, including C15:0, in attenuating anemia."
https://openalex.org/W3014352353,"As the outermost organ, the skin can be damaged following injuries such as wounds and bacterial or viral infections, and such damage should be rapidly restored to defend the body against physical, chemical, and microbial assaults. However, the wound healing process can be delayed or prolonged by health conditions, including diabetes mellitus, venous stasis disease, ischemia, and even stress. In this study, we developed a vibrational cell culture model and investigated the effects of mechanical vibrations on human keratinocytes. The HaCaT cells were exposed to vibrations at a frequency of 45 Hz with accelerations of 0.8g for 2 h per day. The applied mechanical vibration did not affect cell viability or cell proliferation. Cell migratory activity did increase following exposure to vibration, but the change was not statistically significant. The results of immunostaining (F-actin), western blot (ERK1/2), and RT-qPCR (FGF-2, PDGF-B, HB-EGF, TGF-β1, EGFR, and KGFR) analyses demonstrated that the applied vibration resulted in rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, leading to activation of ERK1/2, one of the MAPK signaling pathways, and upregulation of the gene expression levels of HB-EGF and EGFR. The results suggest that mechanical vibration may have wound healing potential and could be used as a mechanical energy-based treatment for enhancing wound healing efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3014381796,"DNA replication is essential for cell proliferation and is one of the cell cycle stages where DNA is more vulnerable. Replication stress is a prominent property of tumor cells and an emerging target for cancer therapy. Although it is not directly involved in nucleotide incorporation, Claspin is a protein with relevant functions in DNA replication. It harbors a DNA-binding domain that interacts preferentially with branched or forked DNA molecules. It also acts as a platform for the interaction of proteins related to DNA damage checkpoint activation, DNA repair, DNA replication origin firing, and fork progression. In order to find new proteins potentially involved in the regulation of DNA replication, we performed a two-hybrid screen to discover new Claspin-binding proteins. This system allowed us to identify the zinc-finger protein OZF (ZNF146) as a new Claspin-interacting protein. OZF is also present at replication forks and co-immunoprecipitates not only with Claspin but also with other replisome components. Interestingly, OZF depletion does not affect DNA replication in a normal cell cycle, but its depletion induces a reduction in the fork progression rate under replication stress conditions. Our results suggest that OZF is a Claspin-binding protein with a specific function in fork progression under replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W3014729945,"Ctenidae represents one of the most representative spider families in the tropical forests of Brazil. Its largest genus, Ctenus, has approximately 220 species out of the more than 520 Ctenidae species described, and several authors consider it polyphyletic. Chromosomal data are only available for four species of Ctenus, representing a large gap in the cytogenetic knowledge about the group. This study provided cytogenetic data on two Ctenus species and one Guasuctenus (previously described as Ctenus). All showed 2n♂ = 28 (26+X1X20). Guasuctenus longipes presented two chromosome pairs containing 18S rDNA genes and C. medius, however C. ornatus showed only one chromosome pair with the 18S rDNA gene. Hybridization data using histone H3 probe indicated specific profiles: histone H3 genes were found in one chromosome pair in G. longipes, in three pairs in C. medius, and in four pairs in C. ornatus. Furthermore, supernumerary chromosomes were identified in C. ornatus presenting a meiotic behavior similar to that of sex chromosomes; and a trivalent was found in C. medius, formed by the association of one sex chromosome and an autosomal bivalent, indicating the importance of these events for the diversification of sex chromosomes in spiders. The C-banding pattern was similar between C. medius and C. ornatus with regard to the number and locations of heterochromatic bands, suggesting that heterochromatin amplification and dispersion, affect karyotypic evolution in the genus. Cytogenetic data showed similarity between C. medius and C. ornatus, and differentiation of G. longipes congruent with morphological data. Moreover, although more comparative analyses are needed to specify composition of the dispersed heterochromatin in Ctenus, the mapping of heterochromatic bands provided insights about the evolution of the karyotypes in this genus."
https://openalex.org/W3015058410,"We here report on fossil remains of the earliest known crown-Testudo, an extant clade of Mediterranean testudinid tortoises from the late Miocene (Vallesian, MN 10) from the hominoid locality Ravin de la Pluie (RPl) in Greece. The material studied is a small, nearly complete carapace with a clearly distinct hypo-xiphiplastral hinge. This supports the sensu stricto generic assignment. This new terrestrial testudinid specimen is characterized by a possible tectiform, narrow, elongated shell with a pentagonal pygal and a long, posteriorly elevated, lenticular and rounded dorsal epiplastral lip. These unique features differ from those of other known Mediterranean hinged forms and allow the erection of the new species Testudo hellenica sp. nov. This taxon is phylogenetically close to two Greek species, the extant T. marginata and the fossil T. marmorum (Turolian, around 7.3 Ma). This record provides evidence for the first appearance of the genus Testudo sensu stricto at a minimum age of 9 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W3014718557,"Cancer patients who undergo tumor removal, and reconstructive surgery by transfer of a free tissue flap, are at high risk of surgical site infection and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Complement activation through the lectin pathway (LP) may contribute to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a recent experimental treatment targeting ischemia-reperfusion injury. The study aims were to investigate LP protein plasma levels in head and neck cancer patients compared with healthy individuals, to explore whether RIPC affects LP protein levels in head and neck cancer surgery, and finally to examine the association between postoperative LP protein levels and the risk of surgical site infection.Head and neck cancer patients (n = 60) undergoing tumor resection and reconstructive surgery were randomized 1:1 to RIPC or sham intervention administered intraoperatively. Blood samples were obtained preoperatively, 6 hours after RIPC/sham, and on the first postoperative day. LP protein plasma levels were measured utilizing time-resolved immunofluorometric assays.H-ficolin and M-ficolin levels were significantly increased in cancer patients compared with healthy individuals (both P ≤ 0.02). Conversely, mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)-1, MASP-3, collectin liver-1 (CL-L1), and MBL-associated protein of 44 kilodalton (MAp44) levels were decreased in cancer patients compared with healthy individuals (all P ≤ 0.04). A significant reduction in all LP protein levels was observed after surgery (all P < 0.001); however, RIPC did not affect LP protein levels. No difference was demonstrated in postoperative LP protein levels between patients who developed surgical site infection and patients who did not (all P > 0.13).The LP was altered in head and neck cancer patients. LP protein levels were reduced after surgery, but intraoperative RIPC did not influence the LP. Postoperative LP protein levels were not associated with surgical site infection."
https://openalex.org/W3015034144,"Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) plays versatile roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. TAZ activity changes in response to the cellular environment such as mechanic and nutritional stimuli, osmolarity, and hypoxia. To understand the physiological roles of TAZ, chemical compounds that activate TAZ in cells are useful as experimental reagents. Kaempferol, TM-25659, and ethacridine are reported as TAZ activators. However, as each TAZ activator has a distinct property in cellular functions, additional TAZ activators are awaiting. We screened for TAZ activators and previously reported IB008738 as a TAZ activator that promotes myogenesis in C2C12 cells. In this study, we have characterized IBS004735 that was obtained in the same screening. IBS004735 also promotes myogenesis in C2C12 cells, but is not similar to IBS008738 in the structure. IBS004735 activates TAZ via Akt and has no effect on TAZ phosphorylation, which is the well-described key modification to regulate TAZ activity. Thus, we introduce IBS004735 as a novel TAZ activator that regulates TAZ in a yet unidentified mechanism."
