https://openalex.org/W2048921281,"Anxiety is common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with specific fears and phobias one of the most frequent subtypes. Specific fears and phobias can have a serious impact on young people with ASD and their families. In this study we developed and evaluated a unique treatment combining cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with graduated exposure in a virtual reality environment (VRE). Nine verbally fluent boys with an ASD diagnosis and no reported learning disability, aged 7 to 13 years old, were recruited. Each had anxiety around a specific situation (e.g. crowded buses) or stimulus (e.g. pigeons). An individualised scene was recreated in our ‘wrap-around’ VRE. In the VRE participants were coached by a psychologist in cognitive and behavioural techniques (e.g. relaxation and breathing exercises) while the exposure to the phobia/fear stimulus was gradually increased as the child felt ready. Each child received four 20–30 minute sessions. After participating in the study, eight of the nine children were able to tackle their phobia situation. Four of the participants completely overcame their phobia. Treatment effects were maintained at 12 months. These results provide evidence that CBT with VRE can be a highly effective treatment for specific phobia/fear for some young people with ASD. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN58483069."
https://openalex.org/W2070927069,"Background Non-invasive characterization of a tumor's molecular features could enhance treatment management. Quantitative computed tomography (CT) based texture analysis (QTA) has been used to derive tumor heterogeneity information, and the appearance of the tumors has been shown to relate to patient outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers. In this study, we examined the potential of tumoral QTA to differentiate K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors and its prognostic potential using baseline pre-treatment non-contrast CT imaging in NSCLC. Methods Tumor DNA from patients with early-stage NSCLC was analyzed on the LungCarta Panel. Cases with a K-ras mutation or pan-wildtype for 26 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were selected for QTA. QTA was applied to regions of interest in the primary tumor. Non-parametric Mann Whitney test assessed the ability of the QTA, clinical and patient characteristics to differentiate between K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype. A recursive decision tree was developed to determine whether the differentiation of K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors could be improved by sequential application of QTA parameters. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed the ability of these markers to predict survival. Results QTA was applied to 48 cases identified, 27 had a K-ras mutation and 21 cases were pan-wildtype. Positive skewness and lower kurtosis were significantly associated with the presence of a K-ras mutation. A five node decision tree had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values (95% CI) of 96.3% (78.1–100), 81.0% (50.5–97.4), and 89.6% (72.9–97.0); respectively. Kurtosis was a significant predictor of OS and DFS, with a lower kurtosis value linked with poorer survival. Conclusions Lower kurtosis and positive skewness are significantly associated with K-ras mutations. A QTA feature such as kurtosis is prognostic for OS and DFS. Non-invasive QTA can differentiate the presence of K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype NSCLC and is associated with patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2067537818,"Mutations in the cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) occur in several types of cancer, and altered cellular metabolism associated with IDH1 mutations presents unique therapeutic opportunities. By altering IDH1, these mutations target a critical step in reductive glutamine metabolism, the metabolic pathway that converts glutamine ultimately to acetyl-CoA for biosynthetic processes. While IDH1-mutated cells are sensitive to therapies that target glutamine metabolism, the effect of IDH1 mutations on reductive glutamine metabolism remains poorly understood. To explore this issue, we investigated the effect of a knock-in, single-codon IDH1-R132H mutation on the metabolism of the HCT116 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. Here we report the R132H-isobolome by using targeted (13)C isotopomer tracer fate analysis to trace the metabolic fate of glucose and glutamine in this system. We show that introduction of the R132H mutation into IDH1 up-regulates the contribution of glutamine to lipogenesis in hypoxia, but not in normoxia. Treatment of cells with a d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG) ester recapitulated these changes, indicating that the alterations observed in the knocked-in cells were mediated by d-2HG produced by the IDH1 mutant. These studies provide a dynamic mechanistic basis for metabolic alterations observed in IDH1-mutated tumors and uncover potential therapeutic targets in IDH1-mutated cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2039118309,"A critical role of the Toll-like receptor(TLR) and its downstream molecules, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1(IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor- associated factor 6(TRAF6), in the pathogenesis of liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been documented. Recently a microRNA, miR-146a, was identified as a potent negative regulator of the TLR signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-146a to attenuate TLR signaling and liver I/R injury in vivo and in vitro. miR-146a was decreased in mice Kupffer cells following hepatic I/R, whereas IRAK1 and TRAF6 increased. Overexpression of miR-146a directly decreased IRAK1 and TRAF6 expression and attenuated the release of proinflammatory cytokines through the inactivation of NF-κB P65 in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced macrophages, RAW264.7 cells. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that IRAK1 and TRAF6 are two potential targets for reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, co-culture assays indicated that miR-146a decreases the apoptosis of hepatocytes after H/R. In vivo administration of Ago-miR-146a, a stable version of miR-146a in vivo, protected against liver injury in mice after I/R via inactivation of the TLR signaling pathway. We conclude that miR-146a ameliorates liver ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in vitro by directly suppressing IRAK1 and TRAF6."
https://openalex.org/W2040863085,"Anesthetics are drugs that reversibly relieve pain, decrease body movements and suppress neuronal activity. Most drugs only cover one of these effects; for instance, analgesics relieve pain but fail to block primary fiber responses to noxious stimuli. Alternately, paralytic drugs block synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions, thereby effectively paralyzing skeletal muscles. Thus, both analgesics and paralytics each accomplish one effect, but fail to singularly account for all three. Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) is structurally similar to benzocaine, a typical anesthetic for anamniote vertebrates, but contains a sulfate moiety rendering this drug more hydrophilic. MS-222 is used as anesthetic in poikilothermic animals such as fish and amphibians. However, it is often argued that MS-222 is only a hypnotic drug and its ability to block neural activity has been questioned. This prompted us to evaluate the potency and dynamics of MS-222-induced effects on neuronal firing of sensory and motor nerves alongside a defined motor behavior in semi-intact in vitro preparations of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Electrophysiological recordings of extraocular motor discharge and both spontaneous and evoked mechanosensory nerve activity were measured before, during and after administration of MS-222, then compared to benzocaine and a known paralytic, pancuronium. Both MS-222 and benzocaine, but not pancuronium caused a dose-dependent, reversible blockade of extraocular motor and sensory nerve activity. These results indicate that MS-222 as benzocaine blocks the activity of both sensory and motor nerves compatible with the mechanistic action of effective anesthetics, indicating that both caine-derivates are effective as single-drug anesthetics for surgical interventions in anamniotes."
https://openalex.org/W2067509496,"Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have unique immunosuppressive properties enabling them to evade host rejection and making them valuable tools for cell therapy. We previously showed that human UMSCs survive xenograft transplantation and successfully correct the corneal clouding defects associated with the mouse model for the congenital metabolic disorder mucopolysaccharidosis VII. However, the precise mechanism by which UMSCs suppress the immune system remains elusive. This study aimed to determine the key components involved in the ability of the UMSCs to modulate the inflammatory system and to identify the inflammatory cells that are regulated by the UMSCs. Our results show that human UMSCs transplanted into the mouse stroma 24 h after an alkali burn suppress the severe inflammatory response and enable the recovery of corneal transparency within 2 weeks. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vitro that UMSCs inhibit the adhesion and invasion of inflammatory cells and also the polarization of M1 macrophages. UMSCs also induced the maturation of T-regulatory cells and led to inflammatory cell death. Moreover, UMSCs exposed to inflammatory cells synthesize a rich extracellular glycocalyx composed of the chondroitin sulfate-proteoglycan versican bound to a heavy chain (HC)-modified hyaluronan (HA) matrix (HC-HA). This matrix also contains TNFα-stimulated gene 6 (TSG6), the enzyme that transfers HCs to HA, and pentraxin-3, which further stabilizes the matrix. Our results, both in vivo and in vitro, show that this glycocalyx confers the ability for UMSCs to survive the host immune system and to regulate the inflammatory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039319209,"The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), one of the most common food contaminants, primarily targets the gastrointestinal tract to affect animal and human health. This study was conducted to examine the protective function of glutamic acid on intestinal injury and oxidative stress caused by DON in piglets. Twenty-eight piglets were assigned randomly into 4 dietary treatments (7 pigs/treatment): 1) uncontaminated control diet (NC), 2) NC+DON at 4 mg/kg (DON), 3) NC+2% glutamic acid (GLU), and 4) NC+2% glutamic acid + DON at 4 mg/kg (DG). At day 15, 30 and 37, blood samples were collected to determine serum concentrations of CAT (catalase), T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity), H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), NO (nitric oxide), MDA (maleic dialdehyde), DAO (diamine oxidase) and D-lactate. Intestinal morphology, and the activation of Akt/mTOR/4EBP1 signal pathway, as well as the concentrations of H2O2, MDA, and DAO in kidney, liver and small intestine, were analyzed at day 37. Results showed that DON significantly (P<0.05) induced oxidative stress in piglets, while this stress was remarkably reduced with glutamic acid supplementation according to the change of oxidative parameters in blood and tissues. Meanwhile, DON caused obvious intestinal injury from microscopic observations and permeability indicators, which was alleviated by glutamic acid supplementation. Moreover, the inhibition of DON on Akt/mTOR/4EBP1 signal pathway was reduced by glutamic acid supplementation. Collectively, these data suggest that glutamic acid may be a useful nutritional regulator for DON-induced damage manifested as oxidative stress, intestinal injury and signaling inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2126262061,"Ocean acidification (OA) is occurring across a backdrop of concurrent environmental changes that may in turn influence species' responses to OA. Temperature affects many fundamental biological processes and governs key reactions in the seawater carbonate system. It therefore has the potential to offset or exacerbate the effects of OA. While initial studies have examined the combined impacts of warming and OA for a narrow range of climate change scenarios, our mechanistic understanding of the interactive effects of temperature and OA remains limited. Here, we use the blue mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, as a model species to test how OA affects the growth of a calcifying invertebrate across a wide range of temperatures encompassing their thermal optimum. Mussels were exposed in the laboratory to a factorial combination of low and high pCO2 (400 and 1200 µatm CO2) and temperatures (12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 24°C) for one month. Results indicate that the effects of OA on shell growth are highly dependent on temperature. Although high CO2 significantly reduced mussel growth at 14°C, this effect gradually lessened with successive warming to 20°C, illustrating how moderate warming can mediate the effects of OA through temperature's effects on both physiology and seawater geochemistry. Furthermore, the mussels grew thicker shells in warmer conditions independent of CO2 treatment. Together, these results highlight the importance of considering the physiological and geochemical interactions between temperature and carbonate chemistry when interpreting species' vulnerability to OA."
https://openalex.org/W2014188767,"Background The molecular mechanism between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and gastric cancer remained largely unknown. In this study, we determined the role of miRNA in H. pylori induced gastric cancer. Methods and Results We found that miR-204 was decreased in H. pylori positive tissues by qRT-PCR. Knockdown of miR-204 enhanced the invasion and proliferation ability of gastric cancer cells in vitro. Luciferase assay revealed that SOX4 was target gene of miR-204, which was found up-regulated in H. pylori positive tissues. Down-regulation of miR-204 and over-expression of SOX4 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Conclusion Taken together, our findings demonstrated that miR-204 may act as a tumor suppressor in H. pylori induced gastric cancer by targeting SOX4."
https://openalex.org/W1989489745,"A striking but unexplained pattern in biology is the promiscuous mating behaviour in socially monogamous species. Although females commonly solicit extra-pair copulations, the adaptive reason has remained elusive. We use evolutionary modelling of breeding ecology to show that females benefit because extra-pair paternity incentivizes males to shift focus from a single brood towards the entire neighbourhood, as they are likely to have offspring there. Male-male cooperation towards public goods and dear enemy effects of reduced territorial aggression evolve from selfish interests, and lead to safer and more productive neighbourhoods. The mechanism provides adaptive explanations for the common empirical observations that females engage in extra-pair copulations, that neighbours dominate as extra-pair sires, and that extra-pair mating correlates with predation mortality and breeding density. The models predict cooperative behaviours at breeding sites where males cooperate more towards public goods than females. Where maternity certainty makes females care for offspring at home, paternity uncertainty and a potential for offspring in several broods make males invest in communal benefits and public goods. The models further predict that benefits of extra-pair mating affect whole nests or neighbourhoods, and that cuckolding males are often cuckolded themselves. Derived from ecological mechanisms, these new perspectives point towards the evolution of sociality in birds, with relevance also for mammals and primates including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2046196179,"The localization and activities of DbpA/ZONAB and YAP transcription factors are in part regulated by the density-dependent assembly of epithelial junctions. DbpA activity and cell proliferation are inhibited by exogenous overexpression of the tight junction (TJ) protein ZO-1, leading to a model whereby ZO-1 acts by sequestering DbpA at the TJ. However, mammary epithelial cells and mouse tissues knock-out for ZO-1 do not show increased proliferation, as predicted by this model. To address this discrepancy, we examined the localization and activity of DbpA and YAP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells depleted either of ZO-1, or one of the related proteins ZO-2 and ZO-3 (ZO proteins), or all three together. Depletion of only one ZO protein had no effect on DbpA localization and activity, whereas depletion of ZO-1 and ZO-2, which is associated with reduced ZO-3 expression, resulted in increased DbpA localization in the cytoplasm. Only depletion of ZO-2 reduced the nuclear import of YAP. Mammary epithelial (Eph4) cells KO for ZO-1 showed junctional DbpA, demonstrating that ZO-1 is not required to sequester DbpA at junctions. However, further depletion of ZO-2 in Eph4 ZO-1KO cells, which do not express ZO-3, caused decreased junctional localization and expression of DbpA, which were rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In vitro binding assays showed that full-length ZO-1 does not interact with DbpA. These results show that ZO-2 is implicated in regulating the nuclear shuttling of YAP, whereas ZO proteins redundantly control the junctional retention and stability of DbpA, without affecting its shuttling to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1964662526,"Main Objective We examine the extent of taxonomic and biogeographical uncertainty in a well-studied group of Australian Lepidoptera, the hawkmoths (Sphingidae). Methods We analysed the diversity of Australian sphingids through the comparative analysis of their DNA barcodes, supplemented by morphological re-examinations and sequence information from a nuclear marker in selected cases. The results from the analysis of Australian sphingids were placed in a broader context by including conspecifics and closely related taxa from outside Australia to test taxonomic boundaries. Results Our results led to the discovery of six new species in Australia, one case of erroneously synonymized species, and three cases of synonymy. As a result, we establish the occurrence of 75 species of hawkmoths on the continent. The analysis of records from outside Australia also challenges the validity of current taxonomic boundaries in as many as 18 species, including Agrius convolvuli (Linnaeus, 1758), a common species that has gained adoption as a model system. Our work has revealed a higher level of endemism than previously recognized. Most (90%) Australian sphingids are endemic to the continent (45%) or to Australia, the Pacific Islands and the Papuan and Wallacean regions (45%). Only seven species (10%) have ranges that extend beyond this major biogeographical boundary toward SE Asia and other regions of the Old World. Main Conclusions This study has established that overlooked cryptic diversity and inaccurate species delineation produced significant misconceptions concerning diversity and distribution patterns in a group of insects that is considered well known taxonomically. Because DNA barcoding represents a straightforward way to test taxonomic boundaries, its implementation can improve the accuracy of primary diversity data in biogeography and conservation studies."
https://openalex.org/W1992749885,"The construction of linear transport infrastructure has severe effects on ecosystem functions and properties, and the restoration of the associated roadslopes contributes to reduce its impact. This restoration is usually approached from the perspective of plant cover regeneration, ignoring plant-soil interactions and the consequences for plant growth. The addition of a 30 cm layer of topsoil is a common practice in roadslope restoration projects to increase vegetation recovery. However topsoil is a scarce resource. This study assesses the effects of topsoil spreading and its depth (10 to 30 cm) on two surrogates of microbial activity (β-glucosidase and phosphatase enzymes activity and soil respiration), and on plant cover, plant species richness and floristic composition of embankment vegetation. The study also evaluates the differences in selected physic-chemical properties related to soil fertility between topsoil and the original embankment substrate. Topsoil was found to have higher values of organic matter (11%), nitrogen (44%), assimilable phosphorous (50%) and silt content (54%) than the original embankment substrate. The topsoil spreading treatment increased microbial activity, and its application increased β-glucosidase activity (45%), phosphatase activity (57%) and soil respiration (60%). Depth seemed to affect soil respiration, β-glucosidase and phosphatase activity. Topsoil application also enhanced the species richness of restored embankments in relation to controls. Nevertheless, the depth of the spread topsoil did not significantly affect the resulting plant cover, species richness or floristic composition, suggesting that both depths could have similar effects on short-term recovery of the vegetation cover. A significant implication of these results is that it permits the application of thinner topsoil layers, with major savings in this scarce resource during the subsequent slope restoration work, but the quality of topsoil relative to the original substrate should be previously assessed on a site by site basis."
https://openalex.org/W2085895841,"Oncogene induced senescence (OIS) is a sustained anti-proliferative response acutely induced in primary cells via activation of mitogenic oncogenes such as Ras/BRAF. This mechanism acts as an initial barrier preventing normal cells transformation into malignant cell. Besides oncogenic activation and DNA damage response (DDR), senescence is modulated by a plethora of other factors, and one of the most important one is oxygen tension of the tissue. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of hypoxia on RasV12-induced senescence in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). We showed here that hypoxia prevents execution of oncogene induced senescence (OIS), through a strong down-regulation of senescence hallmarks, such as SA- β-galactosidase, H3K9me3, HP1γ, p53, p21CIP1 and p16INK4a in association with induction of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In addition, hypoxia also decreased marks of H-RasV12-induced DDR in both cell lines through down-regulation of ATM/ATR, Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation as well as decreased γ-H2AX positivity. Utilizing shRNA system targeting HIF-1α we show that HIF-1α is directly involved in down regulation of p53 and its target p21CIP1 but not p16INK4a. In line with this finding we found that knock down of HIF-1α leads to a strong induction of apoptotic response, but not restoration of senescence in Ras expressing HDFs in hypoxia. This indicates that HIF-1α is an important player in early steps of tumorigenesis, leading to suppression of senescence through its negative regulation of p53 and p21CIP1. In our work we describe a mechanism through which hypoxia and specifically HIF-1α preclude cells from maintaining senescence-driven anti proliferative response. These findings indicate the possible mechanism through which hypoxic environment helps premalignant cells to evade impingement of cellular failsafe pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1966787465,"X-ray diffraction has provided extensive information about the arrangement of lipids and proteins in multilamellar myelin. This information has been limited to the abundant inter-nodal regions of the sheath because these regions dominate the scattering when x-ray beams of 100 µm diameter or more are used. Here, we used a 1 µm beam, raster-scanned across a single nerve fiber, to obtain detailed information about the molecular architecture in the nodal, paranodal, and juxtaparanodal regions. Orientation of the lamellar membrane stacks and membrane periodicity varied spatially. In the juxtaparanode-internode, 198–202 Å-period membrane arrays oriented normal to the nerve fiber axis predominated, whereas in the paranode-node, 205–208 Å-period arrays oriented along the fiber direction predominated. In parts of the sheath distal to the node, multiple sets of lamellar reflections were observed at angles to one another, suggesting that the myelin multilayers are deformed at the Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. The calculated electron density of myelin in the different regions exhibited membrane bilayer profiles with varied electron densities at the polar head groups, likely due to different amounts of major myelin proteins (P0 glycoprotein and myelin basic protein). Scattering from the center of the nerve fibers, where the x-rays are incident en face (perpendicular) to the membrane planes, provided information about the lateral distribution of protein. By underscoring the heterogeneity of membrane packing, microdiffraction analysis suggests a powerful new strategy for understanding the underlying molecular foundation of a broad spectrum of myelinopathies dependent on local specializations of myelin structure in both the PNS and CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1968445688,"Although the introduction of semi-dwarf trait into rice has led to improved lodging resistance making it capable of supporting high grain yield, lodging still remains a concern when attempting to further increase the grain yield of rice. However, improving the lodging resistance in rice by depending on the semi-dwarf trait alone is possible only up to a certain limit, beyond which other traits may be needed for reinforcement. To search for alternative traits relating to high lodging resistance, we identified 9 rice mutant lines possessing improved culm strength. To evaluate whether such lines can be useful for breeding lodging resistant rice, small organ size1 (smos1) mutant having increased lodging resistance but low tiller number and low grain yield, was chosen as a representative for a breeding trial. smos1 was crossed with ST-4 (from the Stock rice collection of Nagoya University Togo field #4), a cultivar with high tiller number and high grain yield, and from their progeny, LRC1 (lodging resistance candidate-1) was selected. Although the low tiller number trait of smos1 was not fully reversed in LRC1, this was compensated by an increase in grain weight per panicle, thereby resulting in high grain yield per plant. This important attribute of LRC1 was further enhanced by the improved lodging resistance trait inherited from smos1. Such improved lodging resistance in LRC1 and smos1 was revealed to be mainly due to increased culm diameter and culm thickness, which led to a high section modulus (SM) value, a parameter defining the physical strength of the culm. Since smos1 possesses high breaking-type lodging resistance which is different from semi-dwarf plants with high bending-type lodging resistance, an alternative approach of using thick culm lines for the creation of rice with increased lodging resistance is hereby proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2039243271,"Clinical significance of Staphylococcus aureus colonization has been demonstrated in hospital settings; however, studies in the community have shown contrasting results regarding the relevance of colonization in infection by community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). In Colombia there are few studies on S. aureus colonization. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular and epidemiological characteristics of nasal colonization by S. aureus (MSSA-MRSA) in children from a university hospital and day care centers (DCCs) of Medellin, Colombia.An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in 400 children (200 in each setting), aged 0 months to 5 years, during 2011. Samples were collected from each nostril and epidemiological information was obtained from the parents. Genotypic analysis included spa typing, PFGE, MLST, SCCmec typing, detection of genes for virulence factors and agr groups.Frequency of S. aureus colonization was 39.8% (n = 159) (hospital 44.5% and DCCs 35.0%) and by MRSA, 5.3% (n = 21) (hospital 7.0% and DCCs 3.5%). Most S. aureus colonized children were older than two years (p = 0.005), the majority of them boys (59.1%), shared a bedroom with a large number of people (p = 0.028), with history of β-Lactamase inhibitors usage (p = 0.020). MSSA strains presented the greatest genotypic diversity with 15 clonal complexes (CC). MRSA isolates presented 6 CC, most of them (47.6%) belonged to CC8-SCCmec IVc and were genetically related to previously reported infectious MRSA strains.Differences in epidemiological and molecular characteristics between populations may be useful for the understanding of S. aureus nasal colonization dynamics and for the design of strategies to prevent S. aureus infection and dissemination. The finding of colonizing MRSA with similar molecular characteristics of those causing infection demonstrates the dissemination capacity of S. aureus and the risk of infection among the child population."
https://openalex.org/W2051817881,"Biological motion stimuli, such as orthographically projected stick figure walkers, are ambiguous about their orientation in depth. The projection of a stick figure walker oriented towards the viewer, therefore, is the same as its projection when oriented away. Even though such figures are depth-ambiguous, however, observers tend to interpret them as facing towards them more often than facing away. Some have speculated that this facing-the-viewer bias may exist for sociobiological reasons: Mistaking another human as retreating when they are actually approaching could have more severe consequences than the opposite error. Implied in this hypothesis is that the facing-towards percept of biological motion stimuli is potentially more threatening. Measures of anxiety and the facing-the-viewer bias should therefore be related, as researchers have consistently found that anxious individuals display an attentional bias towards more threatening stimuli. The goal of this study was to assess whether physical exercise (Experiment 1) or an anxiety induction/reduction task (Experiment 2) would significantly affect facing-the-viewer biases. We hypothesized that both physical exercise and progressive muscle relaxation would decrease facing-the-viewer biases for full stick figure walkers, but not for bottom- or top-half-only human stimuli, as these carry less sociobiological relevance. On the other hand, we expected that the anxiety induction task (Experiment 2) would increase facing-the-viewer biases for full stick figure walkers only. In both experiments, participants completed anxiety questionnaires, exercised on a treadmill (Experiment 1) or performed an anxiety induction/reduction task (Experiment 2), and then immediately completed a perceptual task that allowed us to assess their facing-the-viewer bias. As hypothesized, we found that physical exercise and progressive muscle relaxation reduced facing-the-viewer biases for full stick figure walkers only. Our results provide further support that the facing-the-viewer bias for biological motion stimuli is related to the sociobiological relevance of such stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2052776048,"As Plasmodium falciparum prevalence decreases in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, so does immunity resulting in larger at risk populations and increased risk of malaria resurgence. In Bissau, malaria prevalence decreased from ∼50% to 3% between 1995 and 2003. The epidemiological characteristics of P. falciparum malaria within Bandim health and demographic surveillance site (population ∼100,000) between 1995 and 2012 are described.The population was determined by census. 3603 children aged <15 years that were enrolled in clinical trials at the Bandim health centre (1995-2012) were considered incident cases. The mean annual malaria incidence per thousand children in 1995-1997, 1999-2003, 2007, 2011, 2012 were as follows; age <5 years 22→29→4→9→3, age 5-9 years 15→28→4→33→12, age 10-14 years 9→15→1→45→19. There were 4 campaigns (2003-2010) to increase use of insecticide treated bed nets (ITN) amongst children <5 years. An efficacious high-dose chloroquine treatment regime was routinely used until artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) was introduced in 2008. Long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLIN) were distributed in 2011. By 2012 there was 1 net per 2 people and 97% usage. All-cause mortality decreased from post-war peaks in 1999 until 2012 in all age groups and was not negatively affected by malaria resurgence.The cause of decreasing malaria incidence (1995-2007) was probably multifactorial and coincident with the use of an efficacious high-dose chloroquine treatment regime. Decreasing malaria prevalence created a susceptible group of older children in which malaria resurged, highlighting the need to include all age groups in malaria interventions. ACT did not hinder malaria resurgence. Mass distribution of LLINs probably curtailed malaria epidemics. All-cause mortality was not negatively affected by malaria resurgence."
https://openalex.org/W2113598529,"The internal transcribed spacers of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster, termed ITS1 and ITS2, are the most frequently used nuclear markers for phylogenetic analyses across many eukaryotic groups including most plant families. The reasons for the popularity of these markers include: 1.) Ease of amplification due to high copy number of the gene clusters, 2.) Available cost-effective methods and highly conserved primers, 3.) Rapidly evolving markers (i.e. variable between closely related species), and 4.) The assumption (and/or treatment) that these sequences are non-functional, neutrally evolving phylogenetic markers. Here, our analyses of ITS1 and ITS2 for 50 species suggest that both sequences are instead under selective constraints to preserve proper secondary structure, likely to maintain complete self-splicing functions, and thus are not neutrally-evolving phylogenetic markers. Our results indicate the majority of sequence sites are co-evolving with other positions to form proper secondary structure, which has implications for phylogenetic inference. We also found that the lowest energy state and total number of possible alternate secondary structures are highly significantly different between ITS regions and random sequences with an identical overall length and Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content. Lastly, we review recent evidence highlighting some additional problematic issues with using these regions as the sole markers for phylogenetic studies, and thus strongly recommend additional markers and cost-effective approaches for future studies to estimate phylogenetic relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1969755957,"Persistent organic pollutants are a concern for species occupying high trophic levels since they can cause immunosuppression and impair reproduction. Mass mortalities due to canine distemper virus (CDV) occurred in Caspian seals (Pusa caspica), in spring of 1997, 2000 and 2001, but the potential role of organochlorine exposure in these epizootics remains undetermined. Here we integrate Caspian seal mortality data spanning 1971-2008, with data on age, body condition, pathology and blubber organochlorine concentration for carcases stranded between 1997 and 2002. We test the hypothesis that summed PCB and DDT concentrations contributed to CDV associated mortality during epizootics. We show that age is the primary factor explaining variation in blubber organochlorine concentrations, and that organochlorine burden, age, sex, and body condition do not account for CDV infection status (positive/negative) of animals dying in epizootics. Most animals (57%, n = 67) had PCB concentrations below proposed thresholds for toxic effects in marine mammals (17 µg/g lipid weight), and only 3 of 67 animals had predicted TEQ values exceeding levels seen to be associated with immune suppression in harbour seals (200 pg/g lipid weight). Mean organonchlorine levels were higher in CDV-negative animals indicating that organochlorines did not contribute significantly to CDV mortality in epizootics. Mortality monitoring in Azerbaijan 1971-2008 revealed bi-annual stranding peaks in late spring, following the annual moult and during autumn migrations northwards. Mortality peaks comparable to epizootic years were also recorded in the 1970s-1980s, consistent with previous undocumented CDV outbreaks. Gompertz growth curves show that Caspian seals achieve an asymptotic standard body length of 126-129 cm (n = 111). Males may continue to grow slowly throughout life. Mortality during epizootics may exceed the potential biological removal level (PBR) for the population, but the low frequency of epizootics suggest they are of secondary importance compared to anthropogenic sources of mortality such as fishing by-catch."
https://openalex.org/W2003341580,"Ciliates (protozoa) are ubiquitous components of plankton community and play important roles in aquatic ecosystems in regards of their abundance, biomass, diversity and energy turnover. Based on the stratified samples collected from the northern Beibu Gulf in August 2011, species composition, abundance, biomass, diversity and spatial pattern of planktonic ciliates were studied. Furthermore the main environmental factors controlling ciliate communities were determined. A total of 101 species belonging to 44 genera and 7 orders (i.e., Oligotrichida, Haptorida, Euplotida, Sessilida, Pleurostomatida, Scuticociliatida and Tintinnida) were identified. The variation of ciliate communities was significant at horizontal level, but that was not at vertical level. Based on cluster analysis, ciliate communities were divided into three main groups. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that Group A, existing in the waters with higher concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen, was dominated by Tintinnidium primitivum. Group B in the waters with lower temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration, was dominated by Leegaardiella ovalis. Group C, existing in the waters with higher temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration, was dominated by large Strombidium spp. and Mesodinium rubrum. Combining multiple analytic methods, our results strongly supported that phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll-a were the most significant factors affecting the ciliate communities in the northern Beibu Gulf in summer. Concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen primarily influenced ciliate biomass, implying a potential impact of eutrophication on ciliate growth. The correlation with chlorophyll-a concentration, on one hand indicate the response of ciliates to the food availability, and on the other hand, the ciliates containing chloroplasts or endosymbionts may contribute greatly to the chlorophyll-a."

Based on the morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, the isolate PT-11 was postulated to be a novel species identified as Oceanobacillus rekensis PT-11. The lipase was purified 2.50-fold by Q-Sepharose FF and SP-Sepharose FF chromatography and its molecular mass was estimated to be 23.5 kDa by SDS-PAGE. It was highly active over the broad temperature ranging from 10 to 35°C and showed up to 80% of the maximum activity at 10°C indicating the lipase to be a typical cold-adapted enzyme. The enzyme activity was slightly enhanced by Na+, Li+ and K+. Incubation with detergents, such as Tween-20 and Tween-80, slightly inhibited the enzyme activity; while Triton X-100decreased the enzyme activity. The enzyme was fairly stable in the presence of long-chain alcohols but was highly denatured in hydrophilic solvents such as acetone or short-chain alcohols (C1-C3)."
https://openalex.org/W2055231040,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been implicated to play a pathogenic role in diabetic nephropathy (DN) but its source remains unlcear. To elucidate whether mPGES-1, the best characterized PGE2 synthase, was involved in the development of DN, we examined the renal phenotype of mPGES-1 KO mice subjected to STZ-induced type-1 diabetes. After STZ treatment, mPGES-1 WT and KO mice presented the similar onset of diabetes as shown by similar elevation of blood glucose. Meanwhile, both genotypes of mice exhibited similar increases of urinary and renal PGE2 production. In parallel with this comparable diabetic status, the kidney injury indices including the urinary albumin excretion, kidney weight and the kidney histology (PAS staining) did not show any difference between the two genotypes. By Western-blotting and quantitative qRT-PCR, mPGES-1, mPGES-2, cPGES and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) remain unaltered following six weeks of diabetes. Finally, a selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (50 mg/kg/day) was applied to the STZ-treated KO mice, which resulted in significant reduction of urinary albumin excretion (KO/STZ: 141.5±38.4 vs. KO/STZ + Celebrex: 48.7±20.8 ug/24 h, p<0.05) and the blockade of renal PGE2 induction (kidney: KO/STZ: 588.7±89.2 vs. KO/STZ + Celebrex: 340.8±58.7 ug/24 h, p<0.05; urine: KO/STZ 1667.6±421.4 vs. KO/STZ + Celebrex 813.6±199.9 pg/24 h, p<0.05), without affecting the blood glucose levels and urine volume. Taken together, our data suggests that an as yet unidentified prostaglanind E synthase but not mPGES-1 may couple with COX-2 to mediate increased renal PGE2 sythsesis in DN."

Recent studies have found that the cellular trafficking receptor sortilin 1 (Sort1) inhibits hepatic apolipoprotein B secretion and reduces plasma lipid levels in mice, and its hepatic expression was negatively associated with plasma lipids in humans. This study investigated the regulation of hepatic Sort1 under diabetic conditions and by lipid-lowering fish oil and fenofibrate. Results showed that hepatic Sort1 protein, but not mRNA, was markedly lower in Western diet-fed mice. Knockdown of hepatic Sort1 increased plasma triglyceride in mice. Feeding mice a fish oil-enriched diet completely restored hepatic Sort1 levels in Western diet-fed mice. Fenofibrate also restored hepatic Sort1 protein levels in Western diet-fed wild type mice, but not in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) knock-out mice. PPARα ligands did not induce Sort1 in hepatocytes in vitro. Instead, fish oil and fenofibrate reduced circulating and hepatic fatty acids in mice, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids prevented palmitate inhibition of Sort1 protein in HepG2 cells. LC/MS/MS analysis revealed that Sort1 phosphorylation at serine 793 was increased in obese mice and in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells. Mutations that abolished phosphorylation at Ser-793 increased Sort1 stability and prevented palmitate inhibition of Sort1 ubiquitination and degradation in HepG2 cells. In summary, therapeutic strategies that prevent posttranslational hepatic Sort1 down-regulation in obesity and diabetes may be beneficial in improving dyslipidemia.

https://openalex.org/W2095777014,"Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 alpha (GSK3A) and beta (GSK3B) isoforms are encoded by distinct genes, are 98% identical within their kinase domain and perform similar functions in several settings; however, they are not completely redundant and, depending on the cell type and differentiative status, they also play unique roles. We recently identified a role for GSK3B in drug resistance by demonstrating that its inhibition enables necroptosis in response to chemotherapy in p53-null drug-resistant colon carcinoma cells. We report here that, similarly to GSK3B, also GSK3A silencing/inhibition does not affect cell proliferation or cell cycle but only abolishes growth after treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapy. In particular, blocking GSK3A impairs DNA repair upon exposure to DNA-damaging drugs. As a consequence, p53-null cells overcome their inability to undergo apoptosis and mount a necroptotic response, characterized by absence of caspase activation and RIP1-independent, PARP-dependent AIF nuclear re-localization. We therefore conclude that GSK3A is redundant with GSK3B in regulating drug-resistance and chemotherapy-induced necroptosis and suggest that inhibition of only one isoform, or rather partial inhibition of overall cellular GSK3 activity, is enough to re-sensitize drug-resistant cells to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2016677475,"Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease characterized by the progressive loss of alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord. Trichostatin A (TSA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with beneficial effects in spinal muscular atrophy mouse models that carry the human SMN2 transgene. It is currently unclear whether TSA specifically targets the SMN2 gene or whether other genes respond to TSA and in turn provide neuroprotection in SMA mice. We have taken advantage of the Smn2B/- mouse model that does not harbor the human SMN2 transgene, to test the hypothesis that TSA has its beneficial effects through a non-SMN mediated pathway. TSA increased the median lifespan of Smn2B/- mice from twenty days to eight weeks. As well, there was a significant attenuation of weight loss and improved motor behavior. Pen test and righting reflex both showed significant improvement, and motor neurons in the spinal cord of Smn2B/- mice were protected from degeneration. Both the size and maturity of neuromuscular junctions were significantly improved in TSA treated Smn2B/- mice. Of interest, TSA treatment did not increase the levels of Smn protein in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or myoblasts obtained from the Smn2B/- mice. In addition, no change in the level of Smn transcripts or protein in the brain or spinal cord of TSA-treated SMA model mice was observed. Furthermore, TSA did not increase Smn protein levels in the hind limb muscle, heart, or liver of Smn2B/- mice. We therefore conclude that TSA likely exerts its effects independent of the endogenous mouse Smn gene. As such, identification of the pathways regulated by TSA in the Smn2B/- mice could lead to the development of novel therapeutics for treating SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2076873303,"The relationship between intake rate and food density can provide the foundation for models that predict the spatiotemporal distribution of organisms across a range of resource densities. The functional response, describing the relationship between resource density and intake rate is often interpreted mechanistically as the relationships between times spend searching and handling. While several functional response models incorporate anti-predator vigilance (defined here as an interruption of feeding or some other activity to visually scan the environment, directed mainly towards detecting potential predators), the impacts of environmental factors influencing directly anti-predator vigilance remains unclear. We examined the combined effects of different scenarios of predation risk and food density on time allocation between foraging and anti-predator vigilance in a granivorous species. We experimentally exposed Skylarks to various cover heights and seed densities, and measured individual time budget and pecking and intake rates. Our results indicated that time devoted to different activities varied as a function of both seed density and cover height. Foraging time increased with seed density for all cover heights. Conversely, an increased cover height resulted in a decreased foraging time. Contrary to males, the decreased proportion of time spent foraging did not translate into a foraging disadvantage for females. When vegetation height was higher, females maintained similar pecking and intake rates compared to intermediate levels, while males consistently decreased their energy gain. This difference in anti-predator responses suggests a sexually mediated strategy in the food-safety trade-off: when resource density is high a females would adopt a camouflage strategy while an escape strategy would be adopted by males. In other words, males would leave risky-areas, whereas females would stay when resource density is high. Our results suggest that increased predation risk might generate sexually mediated behavioural responses that functional response models should perhaps better consider in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2033946143,"The conspicuousness of animal signals is influenced by their contrast against the background. As such, signal conspicuousness will tend to vary in nature because habitats are composed of a mosaic of backgrounds. Variation in attractiveness could result in variation in conspecific mate choice and risk of predation, which, in turn, may create opportunities for balancing selection to maintain distinct polymorphisms. We quantified male coloration, the absorbance spectrum of visual pigments and the photic environment of Poecilia parae, a fish species with five distinct male color morphs: a drab (i.e., grey), a striped, and three colorful (i.e., blue, red and yellow) morphs. Then, using physiological models, we assessed how male color patterns can be perceived in their natural visual habitats by conspecific females and a common cichlid predator, Aequidens tetramerus. Our estimates of chromatic and luminance contrasts suggest that the three most colorful morphs were consistently the most conspicuous across all habitats. However, variation in the visual background resulted in variation in which morph was the most conspicuous to females at each locality. Likewise, the most colorful morphs were the most conspicuous morphs to cichlid predators. If females are able to discriminate between conspicuous prospective mates and those preferred males are also more vulnerable to predation, variable visual habitats could influence the direction and strength of natural and sexual selection, thereby allowing for the persistence of color polymorphisms in natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W1971588556,"DNA damage induced by numerous exogenous or endogenous factors may have irreversible consequences on the cell leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence and cell death. The DNA damage response (DDR) is powerful signaling machinery triggered in response to DNA damage, to provide DNA damage recognition, signaling and repair. Most anticancer drugs induce DNA damage, and DNA repair in turn attenuates therapeutic efficiency of those drugs. Approaches delaying DNA repair are often used to increase efficiency of treatment. Recent data show that ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for signaling and repair of DNA damage. However, mechanisms providing regulation of proteasome intracellular localization, activity, and recruitment to DNA damage sites are elusive. Even less investigated are the roles of extranuclear signaling proteins in these processes. In this study, we report the involvement of the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in DDR-associated regulation of proteasome. We show that in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) uPAR activates DNA single strand break repair signaling pathway. We provide evidence that uPAR is essential for functional assembly of the 26S proteasome. We further demonstrate that uPAR mediates DNA damage-induced phosphorylation, nuclear import, and recruitment of the regulatory subunit PSMD6 to proteasome. We found that deficiency of uPAR and PSMD6 delays DNA repair and leads to decreased cell survival. These data may offer new therapeutic approaches for diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1980584252,"There is increasing evidence that global climate change will alter the spatiotemporal occurrences and abundances of many species at continental scales. This will have implications for efficient conservation of biodiversity. We investigate if the general public in Denmark are willing to pay for the preservation of birds potentially immigrating and establishing breeding populations due to climate change to the same extent that they are for native species populations currently breeding in Denmark, but potentially emigrating due to climate change. We find that Danish citizens are willing to pay much more for the conservation of birds currently native to Denmark, than for bird species moving into the country – even when they are informed about the potential range shifts associated with climate change. The only exception is when immigrating species populations are under pressure at European level. Furthermore, people believing climate change to be man-made and people more knowledgeable about birds tended to have higher WTP for conservation of native species, relative to other people, whereas their preferences for conserving immigrant species generally resembled those of other people. Conservation investments rely heavily on public funding and hence on public support. Our results suggest that cross-country coordination of conservation efforts under climate change will be challenging in terms of achieving an appropriate balance between cost-effectiveness in adaptation and the concerns of a general public who seem mostly worried about protecting currently-native species."
https://openalex.org/W2060965519,"Introduction It has been reported that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with secondary spouse/partner (S/P) emotional distress and relationship violence. Objective To investigate the relationships between PTSD, S/P emotional distress and relationship violence among police recruits using a prospective design. Methods Two hypotheses were tested in 71 S/Ps: (1) Police officer reports of greater PTSD symptoms after 12 months of police service will be associated with greater secondary trauma symptoms among S/Ps; (2) Greater secondary trauma symptoms among S/Ps at 12 months will be associated with S/P reports of greater relationship violence. Methods 71 police recruits and their S/Ps were assessed at baseline and 12 months after the start of police officer duty. Using linear and logistic regression, we analyzed explanatory variables for 12 month S/P secondary traumatic stress symptoms and couple violence, including baseline S/P variables and couple violence, as well as exposure and PTSD reports from both S/P and officer. Results S/P perception of officer PTSD symptoms predicted S/P secondary traumatic stress. OS/P secondary trauma was significantly associated with both total couple violence (.34, p = .004) and S/P to officer violence (.35, p = .003). Conclusions Although results from this relatively small study of young police officers and their S/Ps must be confirmed by larger studies in general populations, findings suggest that S/P perception of PTSD symptoms may play a key role in the spread of traumatic stress symptoms across intimate partner relationships and intimate partner violence in the context of PTSD."

Reduction in reproductive potential in evolutionary derived Hymenoptera is often facilitated by advanced behavioral mechanisms and nesting strategies. Here we describe a surprising nesting behavior that was previously unknown in the entire animal kingdom: the use of a vestibular cell filled with dead ants in a new spider wasp (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae) species collected with trap nests in South-East China. We scientifically describe the 'Bone-house Wasp' as Deuteragenia ossarium sp. nov., named after graveyard bone-houses or ossuaries. We show that D. ossarium nests are less vulnerable to natural enemies than nests of other sympatric trap-nesting wasps, suggesting an effective nest protection strategy, most likely by utilizing chemical cues emanating from the dead ants."

Emotional processing in BN has not been often studied and has not been considered from a broad perspective. This study aimed at examining the implicit and explicit emotional expression in BN patients, in the acute state and after recovery. Sixty-three female participants were included: 22 BN, 22 recovered BN (R-BN), and 19 healthy controls (HC). The clinical cases were drawn from consecutive admissions and diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria. Self reported (explicit) emotional expression was measured with State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Symptom Check List-90 items-Revised. Emotional facial expression (implicit) was recorded by means of an integrated camera (by detecting Facial Feature Tracking), during a 20 minutes therapeutic video game. In the acute illness explicit emotional expression [anxiety (p<0.001) and anger (p<0.05)] was increased. In the recovered group this was decreased to an intermediate level between the acute illness and healthy controls [anxiety (p<0.001) and anger (p<0.05)]. In the implicit measurement of emotional expression patients with acute BN expressed more joy (p<0.001) and less anger (p<0.001) than both healthy controls and those in the recovered group. These findings suggest that there are differences in the implicit and explicit emotional processing in BN, which is significantly reduced after recovery, suggesting an improvement in emotional regulation."

Typically, CBS domains bind adenine nucleotides, such as S-adenosylmethionine, AMP, ADP, and ATP, as regulatory ligands (10.Baykov A.A. Tuominen H.K. Lahti R.

Oyenarte I. Martínez-Cruz L.A. The crystal structure of protein MJ1225 fromMethanocaldococcus jannaschii shows strong conservation of key structural features seen in the eukaryal γ-AMPK.J. Mol.

Structure of mammalian AMPK and its regulation by ADP.Nature. 2011; 472: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), each pair of CBS domains generally binds only one adenylate ligand. The structural and kinetic basis for regulation through CBS domains is still unknown for any protein, and CBS domain-containing PPases represent a good model enzyme for exploring this general phenomenon. We reported previously that mtPPase (18.Jämsen J. Tuominen H. Salminen A. Belogurov G.A. Magretova N.N. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. A CBS domain-containing pyrophosphatase ofMoorella thermoacetica is regulated by adenine nucleotides.Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the CBS domain-containing PPase of Clostridium perfringens (cpPPase) (19.Tuominen H. Salminen A. Oksanen E. Jämsen J. Heikkilä O. Lehtiö L. Magretova N.N. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Crystal structures of the CBS and DRTGG domains of the regulatory region ofClostridium perfringens pyrophosphatase complexed with the inhibitor, AMP, and activator, diadenosine tetraphosphate.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 400-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) are highly sensitive to micromolar concentrations of adenine nucleotides. Remarkably, AMP and ADP acted as inhibitors, whereas ATP and AP4A were activators. We also determined the three-dimensional structures of an isolated regulatory insert of cpPPase comprising two CBS domains and one DRTGG domain in complexes with AMP and AP4A (19.Tuominen H. Salminen A. Oksanen E. Jämsen J. Heikkilä O. Lehtiö L. Magretova N.N. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Crystal structures of the CBS and DRTGG domains of the regulatory region ofClostridium perfringens pyrophosphatase complexed with the inhibitor, AMP, and activator, diadenosine tetraphosphate.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 400-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Rates of AMP-induced conformational transitions were much faster in cpPPase (20.Jämsen J. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Fast kinetics of nucleotide binding toClostridium perfringens family II pyrophosphatase containing CBS and DRTGG domains.Biochemistry. 2012; 77: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar) than in mtPPase (21.Jämsen J. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Nucleotide- and substrate-induced conformational transitions in the CBS domain-containing pyrophosphatase ofMoorella thermoacetica.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for the DRTGG domain in regulatory site performance. Here, we show that the regulatory part of the molecule, comprising two CBS domains with or without an intercalating DRTGG domain, binds adenine nucleotides cooperatively and confers catalytic cooperativity to cpPPase and three newly isolated family II PPases of Desulfitobacterium hafniense (dhPPase), Clostridium novyi (cnPPase), and Eggerthella lenta (elPPase). We found that both types of cooperativity depend on Mg2+ concentration and the identity of the bound nucleotide, further expanding our understanding of the mechanisms involved in regulating cellular PPi level. These findings were corroborated by studies of a genetically engineered dhPPase deletion variant corresponding to the isolated catalytic part of the enzyme. CBS domain-containing PPases are thus the first known oligomeric PPases whose subunits exhibit cooperative behavior. Genomic DNA extracted from D. hafniense, C. novyi, and E. lenta (DSM numbers 10664, 14992, and 2243, respectively) was obtained from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Microorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH). The sequences of full-length dhPPase (residues 1–544; YP_002458003), cnPPase (residues 1–548; YP_878001), and elPPase (residues 1–455; YP_003181314) were amplified by PCR and ligated into NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET28bTEV plasmid (Novagen) for dhPPase and pET46 Ek/LIC plasmid (Novagen) for cnPPase and elPPase. A synthetic gene encoding the catalytic part of dhPPase (dhPPaseΔCDC) containing codons for dhPPase fragments 1–63 and 306–544 connected by the linker ESVEAKQK was obtained from GeneArt. The linker sequence was identical to that found in the family II PPase from Desulfosporosinus acidiphilus SJ4 that most closely resembles the catalytic part of dhPPase but has no regulatory element. The gene was subcloned into the pET28bTEV plasmid using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The plasmid constructs thus obtained expressed dhPPase, dhPPaseΔCDC, cnPPase, elPPase, or dhCDC with a cleavable His6 tag at their N termini. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Full-length dhPPase and dhPPaseΔCDC were produced in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) by cultivating at 37 °C in Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml each of kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Gene expression was induced by incubating with 1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Collected cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.8) and disrupted with an MSE 100-watt ultrasonic disintegrator. The cell lysate was applied to a 2-ml TALON Superflow gravity column (GE Healthcare), and dhPPase was eluted using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.2 m imidazole-HCl (pH 7.8). Imidazole was removed from eluate fractions containing dhPPase by passing through a HiPrep 26/10 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 500 mm NaCl. The His6 tag was removed by digesting overnight with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease at 20 °C as described by the manufacturer after which the mixture was passed through a TALON Superflow gravity column to remove His6-containing peptides from the sample. The flow-through was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 26/60 (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2), 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CoCl2, and 20 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetate. cnPPase and elPPase were expressed and purified similarly except that the His6 tag was not removed, and the buffer in size exclusion chromatography was 25 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm CoCl2. cpPPase was expressed and purified as described previously (19.Tuominen H. Salminen A. Oksanen E. Jämsen J. Heikkilä O. Lehtiö L. Magretova N.N. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Crystal structures of the CBS and DRTGG domains of the regulatory region ofClostridium perfringens pyrophosphatase complexed with the inhibitor, AMP, and activator, diadenosine tetraphosphate.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 400-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein solutions were stored at −40 to −80 °C. The purity of the isolated proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE using Phast system 8–25% gradient gels (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) using A2800.1% values of 0.478 for dhPPase, 0.419 for dhPPaseΔCDC, 0.548 for cnPPase, 0.426 for cpPPase, and 0.493 for elPPase calculated from the corresponding amino acid compositions with ProtParam. Molar concentrations were calculated on the basis of the subunit molecular masses of 60.4, 34.5, 63.6, 60.8, and 52.5 kDa, respectively. The activity assay medium contained 140 μm PPi (yielding 50 μm MgPPi complex), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 m Tes-KOH (pH 7.2) except where specified otherwise. In measurements done at higher Mg2+ concentrations, buffer concentration was decreased appropriately to maintain constant ionic strength. The reaction was initiated by adding enzyme, and Pi accumulation due to PPi hydrolysis was continuously recorded for 2–3 min at 25 °C using an automatic Pi analyzer (22.Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. A simple and sensitive apparatus for continuous monitoring of orthophosphate in the presence of acid-labile compounds.Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The analyzer utilizes the principle of color change of methyl green in the presence of phosphomolybdate and consists of a three-channel peristaltic pump and a flow-through photometer. The pump delivers a constant flow of sample, acid molybdate, and methyl green solutions, which are successively combined and directed to the flow photometer. The sensitivity of the analyzer was varied to yield full-scale recorder values of 4 or 20 μm Pi using an appropriate choice of pump tubing diameters; corresponding sample consumption rates were 5 and 1 ml/min. The dead time of the analyzer (i.e. the time from feeding the sample into the analyzer to mixing with the acid molybdate solution, which quenches the enzymatic reaction) was 10–20 s in the standard mode. The precision of initial velocity estimates for reactions yielding nonlinear time courses of Pi production was increased by decreasing the dead time to 1 s using an appropriate modification of the inlet system (23.Baykov A.A. Alexandrov A.P. Smirnova I.N. A two-step mechanism of fluoride inhibition of rat liver inorganic pyrophosphatase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The initial velocity values obtained in replicate measurements agreed within 5–10% and were strictly proportional to enzyme concentration. The values of the apparent dissociation constants for the various metal ion complexes used to calculate the free metal ion concentrations at pH 7.2 were as follows: MgPPi, 112 μm (24.Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Steady-state kinetics of substrate hydrolysis by vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase. A simple three-state model.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); Mg2PPi, 2.84 mm (24.Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Steady-state kinetics of substrate hydrolysis by vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase. A simple three-state model.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); MgAMP, 10.5 mm (25.Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Motekaitis R.J. NIST Critical Stability Constants of Metal Complexes Database. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD1995Google Scholar); MgADP, 0.42 mm (25.Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Motekaitis R.J. NIST Critical Stability Constants of Metal Complexes Database. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD1995Google Scholar); and MgATP, 0.034 mm (25.Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Motekaitis R.J. NIST Critical Stability Constants of Metal Complexes Database. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD1995Google Scholar). The values for adenine nucleotides were derived from published values of the corresponding pH-independent constants. Nonlinear least square fits were performed using the program Scientist (Micromath). Initial velocities of PPi hydrolysis were typically estimated graphically from the slopes of the tangents to the initial portion of hydrolysis time courses recorded with the Pi analyzer. The time courses generated by truncated PPase were markedly nonlinear because of gradual inactivation of the enzyme upon dilution into the reaction medium. In this case, the initial velocities (v) were obtained by fitting the time courses to Equation 1, [Pi]=a+(v/kd)(1−e−kdt)(Eq. 1) where kd is the rate constant for enzyme inactivation, t is time, and a is the background signal of the instrument. The dependence of hydrolysis rate on nucleotide concentration ([N]) at fixed substrate concentration was fit to Equation 2, A=(AN+(A0+AN)KN2/2[N]+A0KN1KN2/[N]2)/(1+KN2/[N]+KN1KN2/[N]2)(Eq. 2) where A0 and AN are activities of free and nucleotide-saturated enzyme, respectively, and KN1 and KN2 are the apparent dissociation constants for the enzyme-nucleotide complexes. Equation 2 was derived for Scheme 1, which describes successive binding of nucleotide to two regulatory sites per enzyme molecule. Here, E2 refers to a mixture of free and substrate-bound dimeric enzyme. The activity of E2N is intermediate between the activities of E2 and E2N2 (i.e. activities of two subunits respond independently to nucleotide binding). Equation 2 is equally valid if N is an inhibitor or activator. For non-cooperative binding, Equation 3 with a single KN value was used. A=A0+(AN−A0)/(1+KN/[N])(Eq. 3) Notably, ifEquation 2 instead ofEquation 3 is applied to a non-cooperative binding reaction, the fitted values ofKN1 andKN2 should differ 4-fold:KN1 =KN/2 andKN2 = 2KN (26.Bisswanger H. Enzyme Kinetics. Principles and Methods. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weinheim, Germany2008Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consequently, the ratio 4KN1/KN2 can be used to recognize cooperativity: it is greater than 1 for positive cooperativity and less than 1 for negative cooperativity. In terms of generally accepted nomenclature,KN is a “microscopic” binding constant, andKN1 andKN2 are “macroscopic” binding constants (26.Bisswanger H. Enzyme Kinetics. Principles and Methods. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weinheim, Germany2008Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The merit of using 4KN1/KN2 instead ofh to characterize cooperativity is that the former parameter is directly related to the free energy change associated with cooperativity, that is the effect of a ligand binding at one site on the binding affinity of the other site (27.Forsén S. Linse S. Cooperativity: over the Hill.TIBS. 1995; 20: 495-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Alternatively, nucleotide binding data were fit to the Hill equation (Equation 4) to determine the Hill coefficienth. A=A0+(AN+A0)/{1+b/[N]h}(Eq. 4) Cooperative kinetics of substrate hydrolysis was analyzed in terms ofScheme 2, which assumes different Michaelis constants (Km1 andKm2) and equalkcat values for two active sites in the dimer (E2); [E]0 is total enzyme concentration. The values ofKm1,Km2, andkcat were obtained by fittingEquation 5 to the dependence of hydrolysis rate (v) on substrate (MgPPi) concentration at fixed Mg2+ concentrations. v=kcat[E]0(1+0.5Km2/[S]+Km1Km2/[S]2)(Eq. 5) As was the case forEquation 2, the ratio 4Km1/Km2 can be used to recognize catalytic cooperativity: its value is greater than 1 for positive cooperativity and less than 1 for negative cooperativity (26.Bisswanger H. Enzyme Kinetics. Principles and Methods. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weinheim, Germany2008Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The applicability of the microscopic/macroscopic constant concept to Michaelis constants results from the formal similarity of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the equilibrium binding equation (28.Ricard J. Hervé G. Allosteric Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 1-25Google Scholar) despite the fact that they are not equilibrium substrate binding constants in a general case. The dependence ofKN on Mg2+ (M) concentration was fit toEquation 6 derived forScheme 3 where (KN)0 and (KN)M are the limiting values ofKN at zero and infinite Mg2+ concentrations, andKM is the metal binding constant. Equations analogous toEquation 6 were used to analyze the Mg2+ concentration dependence ofKm. KN=(KN)0(1+[M]/KM)/{1+(KN)0[M]/(KN)MKM}(Eq. 6) The genes for CBS-PPases and the deletion variant ofdhPPase (dhPPaseΔCDC;Fig. 1A) were expressed inE. coli, and the proteins were purified with a yield of ∼10 mg of pure protein/liter of medium. Constructs were designed to encode an additional N-terminal MGSSHHHHHHENLYFQGH sequence containing a His6 tag to facilitate isolation by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. TEV protease cleaves this sequence between the Gln and Gly residues, leaving only a dipeptide extension on the protein. His6 tag removal did not affect PPase activity but diminished the aggregation of full-sizedhPPase during purification and concentration procedures. Tag removal was not performed withdhPPaseΔCDC and other PPases as it did not improve their solubility. Inactive aggregates were separated from soluble active proteins during size exclusion chromatography. The final products were at least 95% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE. The final purification step (Superdex 200 chromatography) was conducted in the presence of 0.1 mm Co2+ to stabilize the enzymes; Co2+ was also routinely added to enzyme stock solutions. The stabilizing effect of Co2+ is consistent with data showing that “canonical” family II PPases contain one site that tightly binds transition metal ions (Co2+ or Mn2+) in addition to several more loosely binding sites with broader specificity that are apparently filled with Mg2+in vivo (5.Parfenyev A.N.

The inflammatory response to this bacterium involves a large influx of neutrophils to the lamina propria of the gastric mucosa. However, little is known about the receptors and molecular mechanisms involved in activation of these neutrophils. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in the response of human neutrophils to H. pylori and purified H. pylori DNA (Hp-DNA). Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of adult volunteers and challenged with either H. pylori or Hp-DNA. We found that both, H. pylori and Hp-DNA induced increased expression and release of IL-8. Furthermore, we showed that TLR9 is involved in the induction of IL-8 production by H. pylori and Hp-DNA. IL-8 production induced by H. pylori but not by Hp-DNA was partially mediated by NF-κB. In conclusion, this study showed for first time that both, H. pylori and Hp-DNA activate TLR9 and induce a different inflammatory response that leads to activation of neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2031813104,"Prolonged viewing of dichoptically presented images with different content results in perceptual alternations known as binocular rivalry. This phenomenon is thought to be the result of competition at a local level, where local rivalry zones interact to give rise to a single, global dominant percept. Certain perceived combinations that result from this local competition are known to last longer than others, which is referred to as grouping during binocular rivalry. In recent years, the phenomenon has been suggested to be the result of competition at both eye- and image-based processing levels, although the exact contribution from each level remains elusive. Here we use a paradigm designed specifically to quantify the contribution of eye- and image-based processing to grouping during rivalry. In this paradigm we used sine-wave gratings as well as upright and inverted faces, with and without binocular disparity-based occlusion. These stimuli and conditions were used because they are known to result in processing at different stages throughout the visual processing hierarchy. Specifically, more complex images were included in order to maximize the potential contribution of image-based grouping. In spite of this, our results show that increasing image complexity did not lead to an increase in the contribution of image-based processing to grouping during rivalry. In fact, the results show that grouping was primarily affected by the eye-of-origin of the image parts, irrespective of stimulus type. We suggest that image content affects grouping during binocular rivalry at low-level processing stages, where it is intertwined with eye-of-origin information."

We determined several characteristics in the modified DSW. We explored duodenal pressure, oxygenation, microvascular blood flow, and changes in pH and oxidative redox potential (ORP) values within the stomach and duodenum in response to tap water (TW, hardness: 2.48 ppm), DSW600 (hardness: 600 ppm), and DSW1200 (hardness: 1200 ppm) in Wistar rats and analyzed oxidative stress and apoptosis gene expressions by cDNA and RNA microarrays in the duodenal epithelium. We compared the effects of drinking DSW, MgCl2, and selenium water on duodenal ulcers using pathologic scoring, immunohistochemical analysis, and Western blotting. Our results showed DSW has a higher pH value, lower ORP value, higher scavenging H2O2 and HOCl activity, higher Mg2+ concentrations, and micronutrients selenium compared with TW samples. Water infusion significantly increased intestinal pressure, O2 levels, and microvascular blood flow in DSW and TW groups. Microarray showed DSW600, DSW1200, selenium water upregulated antioxidant and anti-apoptotic genes and downregulated pro-apoptotic gene expression compared with the TW group. Drinking DSW600, DSW1200, and selenium water but not Mg2+ water significantly enhanced Bcl-2 and thioredoxin reductase 1 expression. Bax/Bcl-2/caspase 3/poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase signaling was activated during the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration. DSW drinking reduced ulcer area as well as apoptotic signaling in acetic acid-induced duodenal ulcers.

In this study, 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped among 330 HBV-related HCC patients using the MassARRAY system from Sequenom. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the effects of genotype on survival time under an additive model with age, sex, smoking status and clinical stage as covariates. We identified four SNPs on 6p21 (rs1419881 T>C, rs7453920 G>A,rs3997872 G>A and rs7768538 T>C), and two SNPs on 8p12 (rs2275959 C>T and rs7821974 C>T) significantly associated with survival time of HBV-related HCC patients.

https://openalex.org/W2028587574,"Plasmodium falciparum invasion of host erythrocytes is essential for the propagation of the blood stage of malaria infection. Additionally, the brief extracellular merozoite stage of P. falciparum represents one of the rare windows during which the parasite is directly exposed to the host immune response. Therefore, efficient invasion of the host erythrocyte is necessary not only for productive host erythrocyte infection, but also for evasion of the immune response. Host traits, such as hemoglobinopathies and differential expression of erythrocyte invasion ligands, can protect individuals from malaria by impeding parasite erythrocyte invasion. Here we combine RBC barcoding with flow cytometry to study P. falciparum invasion. This novel high-throughput method allows for the (i) direct comparison of P. falciparum invasion into different erythrocyte populations and (ii) assessment of the impact of changing erythrocyte population dynamics on P. falciparum invasion."

We hypothesized variations in the pathway between tumors contribute to poor response. We clustered GBM based on AKT pathway genes and discovered new subtypes then characterized their clinical and molecular features. There are at least 5 GBM AKT subtypes having distinct DNA copy number alterations, enrichment in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and patterns of expression for PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling components. Gene Ontology terms indicate a different cell of origin or dominant phenotype for each subgroup. Evidence suggests one subtype is very sensitive to BCNU or CCNU (median survival 5.8 vs. 1.5 years; BCNU/CCNU vs other treatments; respectively). AKT subtyping advances previous approaches by revealing additional subgroups with unique clinical and molecular features. Evidence indicates it is a predictive marker for response to BCNU or CCNU and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors. We anticipate Akt subtyping may help stratify patients for clinical trials and augment discovery of class-specific therapeutic targets."

The prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection among these patients was assessed using two different OneStep reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The epidemiological profiles of the patients with HCoV-OC43 infection were described. Partial S and N genes of HCoV-OC43 circulating strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analysis and amino acid alignment. Our results showed that the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection was 12.52% (95% CI: 9.78-15.26%), and the epidemic peak occurred in autumn. Fifty partial S and 40 partial N fragments were obtained from these patients. Phylogenetic analysis based on neighbour-joining method showed that at least three distinct clusters (A, B, C/D) of HCoV-OC43 strains were circulating among adult patients with ARI in Beijing. In addition, some novel unique clusters (UNT) of HCoV-OC43 were found in the S- and N-based phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, consensus amino acids substitutes for each cluster were also found after alignment of partial S or N sequence coding region in this study. In conclusion, we herein describe the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 among adult patients and provide substantial evidence for the genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 circulating in Beijing."
https://openalex.org/W2018907895,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been revealed to be a signal molecule with second messenger action in the somatic cells of many tissues, including the reproductive tract. The aim of this study was to address how exogenous H2S acts on the meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes, including key maturation factors such as MPF and MAPK, and cumulus expansion intensity of cumulus-oocyte complexes. We observed that the H2S donor, Na2S, accelerated oocyte in vitro maturation in a dose-dependent manner, following an increase of MPF activity around germinal vesicle breakdown. Concurrently, the H2S donor affected cumulus expansion, monitored by hyaluronic acid production. Our results suggest that the H2S donor influences oocyte maturation and thus also participates in the regulation of cumulus expansion. The exogenous H2S donor apparently affects key signal pathways of oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion, resulting in faster oocyte maturation with little need of cumulus expansion."

For this purpose, clones of the leukemic T-cell line SKW-3 were used, which had been engineered to constantly express differently low Rb levels. The alkylphosphocholine induced apoptosis, stimulated the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 and inhibited the synthesis of cyclin D3, thereby causing a G2 phase cell cycle arrest and death of cells with wild type Rb expression. In contrast, Rb-deficiency impeded the changes induced by eru-fosine in the expression of these proteins and abrogated the induction of G2 arrest, which was correlated with reduced antiproliferative and anticlonogenic activities of the compound. In conclusion, analysis of our results showed for the first time that the Rb signaling pathway is essential for mediating the antineoplastic activity of erufosine and its efficacy in patients with malignant diseases may be predicted by determining the Rb status."
https://openalex.org/W2167221026,"Introduction Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a treatable cause of blindness in neonates. In Pakistan, ROP is often not recognized early because screening and treatment programs are not yet in place in most neonatal units, even in tertiary care hospitals. It is hoped that this report will help inform medical professionals of the magnitude of the problem and help to design appropriate management strategies. Objectives The aim was to determine the frequency of ROP in premature and very low birth weight (BW) neonates (BW<1500 g and gestational age (GA) <32 weeks). Study Design Cross-sectional study. Study Setting Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Study Duration From June 2009 to May 2010. Subjects and Methods Neonates with a Birth weight (BW) <1500 g and Gestational Age (GA) <32 weeks who were admitted to the NICU and received an eye examination, or were referred for a ROP eye examination as an outpatient, were included in the study. GA was estimated from intrauterine ultrasound findings. Neonates with major congenital malformations, syndromes or congenital cataracts or tumors of the eyes, and those that died before the eye examination or did not attend the out patients department for an eye examination, were excluded. The neonatal eye examination was performed by a trained ophthalmologist at 4 or 6 weeks of age. Results Out of 86 neonates, ROP was identified in nine neonates (10.5%) at the first eye examination. ROP was significantly associated with BW (P = 0.037), GA (P = 0.033), and chronological age (P<0.001). Conclusions we identified ROP in 10.5% of neonates at first eye examination. Significant associations between ROP and a GA<32 weeks and a BW<1500 g were also observed.we also stress that serial follow-up of neonates at risk for ROP is important when making a final diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W1972769486,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), eukaryotic transposable elements, exist as proviruses in vertebrates including primates and contribute to genomic changes during the evolution of their host genomes. Many studies about ERVs have focused on the elements residing in the human genome but only a few studies have focused on the elements which exist in non-human primate genomes. In this study, we identified 256 chimpanzee-specific endogenous retrovirus copies (PtERVs: Pan troglodyte endogenous retroviruses) from the chimpanzee reference genome sequence through comparative genomics. Among the chimpanzee-specific ERV copies, 121 were full-length chimpanzee-specific ERV elements while 110 were chimpanzee-specific solitary LTR copies. In addition, we found eight potential retrotransposition-competent full-length chimpanzee-specific ERV copies containing an intact env gene, and two of them were polymorphic in chimpanzee individuals. Through computational analysis and manual inspection, we found that some of the chimpanzee-specific ERVs have propagated via non-classical PtERV insertion (NCPI), and at least one of the PtERVs may have played a role in creating an alternative transcript of a chimpanzee gene. Based on our findings in this study, we state that the chimpanzee-specific ERV element is one of the sources of chimpanzee genomic variations, some of which might be related to the alternative transcripts in the chimpanzee population."
https://openalex.org/W1977308374,"There is an acceptance that plasmid-based delivery of interfering RNA always generates the intended targeting sequences in cells, making it as specific as its synthetic counterpart. However, recent studies have reported on cellular inefficiencies of the former, especially in light of emerging gene discordance at inter-screen level and across formats. Focusing primarily on the TRC plasmid-based shRNA hairpins, we reasoned that alleged specificities were perhaps compromised due to altered processing; resulting in a multitude of random interfering sequences. For this purpose, we opted to study the processing of hairpin TRCN#40273 targeting CTTN; which showed activity in a miRNA-21 gain-of-function shRNA screen, but inactive when used as an siRNA duplex. Using a previously described walk-through method, we identified 36 theoretical cleavage variants resulting in 78 potential siRNA duplexes targeting 53 genes. We synthesized and tested all of them. Surprisingly, six duplexes targeting ASH1L, DROSHA, GNG7, PRKCH, THEM4, and WDR92 scored as active. QRT-PCR analysis on hairpin transduced reporter cells confirmed knockdown of all six genes, besides CTTN; revealing a surprising 7 gene-signature perturbation by this one single hairpin. We expanded our qRT-PCR studies to 26 additional cell lines and observed unique knockdown profiles associated with each cell line tested; even for those lacking functional DICER1 gene suggesting no obvious dependence on dicer for shRNA hairpin processing; contrary to published models. Taken together, we report on a novel dicer independent, cell-type dependent mechanism for non-specific RNAi gene silencing we coin Alternate Targeting Sequence Generator (ATSG). In summary, ATSG adds another dimension to the already complex interpretation of RNAi screening data, and provides for the first time strong evidence in support of arrayed screening, and questions the scientific merits of performing pooled RNAi screens, where deconvolution of up to genome-scale pools is indispensable for target identification."
https://openalex.org/W2118524417,"Background Although the effect of water level on germination in soil seed banks has been documented in many ecosystems, the mechanism is not fully understood, and to date no empirical studies on this subject exist. Further, no work has been done on the effect of water level on seed banks of drying and saline-alkaline wetlands in alpine areas on the Tibetan Plateau. Methodology We examined the effects of water level (0 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm) on seed germination and seedling establishment from soil seed banks at 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths in typical, drying, and saline-alkaline wetlands. We also explore the potential role of soil seed bank in restoration of drying and saline-alkaline wetlands. Principal Findings Species richness decreased with increase in water level, but there almost no change in seed density. A huge difference exists in species composition of the seed bank among different water levels in all three wetlands, especially between 0 cm and 5 cm and 0 cm and 10 cm. Similarity of species composition between seed bank and plant community was higher in 0 cm water level in drying wetland than in the other two wetlands. The similarity was much higher in 0 cm water level than in 5 cm and 10 cm water levels in all three wetlands. Species composition of the alpine wetland plant community changed significantly after drying and salinization, however, species composition of the seed bank was unchanged regardless of the environment change. Conclusions/Significance Water level greatly affects seed bank recruitment and plant community establishment. Further, different water levels in restored habitats are likely to determine its species composition of the plant community. The seed bank is important in restoration of degraded wetlands. Successful restoration of drying and salinization wetlands could depend on the seed bank."

DNA sequences are conserved in virtually all the cells of a multicellular organism. To analyze the sequences of various individuals with distinct pathological disorders, DNA is routinely isolated from blood, independently of the tissue that is the target of the disease. This approach has proven useful for the identification of familial diseases where mutations are present in parental germinal cells. With the capacity to compare DNA sequences from distinct tissues or cells, present technology can be used to study whether DNA sequences in tissues are invariant. Here we explored the presence of specific SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variations) in various tissues of the same individual. We tested for the presence of tissue-specific exonic SNVs, taking blood exome as a control. We analyzed the chromosomal location of these SNVs. The number of SNVs per chromosome was found not to depend on chromosome length, but mainly on the number of protein-coding genes per chromosome. Although similar but not identical patterns of chromosomal distribution of tissue-specific SNVs were found, clear differences were detected. This observation supports the notion that each tissue has a specific SNV exome signature."
