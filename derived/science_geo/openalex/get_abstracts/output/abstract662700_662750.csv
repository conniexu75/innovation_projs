https://openalex.org/W3095294932,"Introduction Older people have been reported to be at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality. This study explored the factors mediating this association and whether older age was associated with increased mortality risk in the absence of other risk factors. Methods In UK Biobank, a population cohort study, baseline data were linked to COVID-19 deaths. Poisson regression was used to study the association between current age and COVID-19 mortality. Results Among eligible participants, 438 (0.09%) died of COVID-19. Current age was associated exponentially with COVID-19 mortality. Overall, participants aged ≥75 years were at 13-fold (95% CI 9.13–17.85) mortality risk compared with those &lt;65 years. Low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, high systolic blood pressure, low handgrip strength, and multiple long-term conditions were significant mediators, and collectively explained 39.3% of their excess risk. The associations between these risk factors and COVID-19 mortality were stronger among older participants. Participants aged ≥75 without additional risk factors were at 4-fold risk (95% CI 1.57–9.96, P = 0.004) compared with all participants aged &lt;65 years. Conclusions Higher COVID-19 mortality among older adults was partially explained by other risk factors. ‘Healthy’ older adults were at much lower risk. Nonetheless, older age was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 mortality."

The aim of the present study was to verify the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and to ascertain FCV-19S effects on assessment of Japanese people's coping behavior. After back-translation of the scale, 450 Japanese participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing platform. These participants responded to the Japanese FCV-19S, the Japanese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and the Japanese versions of the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD), which assesses coping behaviors such as stockpiling and health monitoring, reasons for coping behaviors, and socio-demographic variables. Results indicated the factor structure of the Japanese FCV-19S as including seven items and one factor that were equivalent to those of the original FCV-19S. The scale showed adequate internal reliability (α = .87; ω = .92) and concurrent validity, as indicated by significantly positive correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; anxiety, r = .56; depression, r = .29) and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD; perceived infectability, r = .32; germ aversion, r = .29). Additionally, the FCV-19S not only directly increased all coping behaviors (β = .21 - .36); it also indirectly increased stockpiling through conformity reason (indirect effect, β = .04; total effect, β = .31). These results suggest that the Japanese FCV-19S psychometric scale has equal reliability and validity to those of the original FCV-19S. These findings will contribute further to the investigation of various difficulties arising from fear about COVID-19 in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W3096280259,"Background To provide an interpretable summary of the impact on mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic we estimate weekly and annual life expectancies at birth in Spain and its regions. Methods We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), and death counts from 2018, and population on July 1st, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to 5 July 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences with respect to 2019. Results Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11–20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23 rd to April 5 th ), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020 also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.9 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.8 years among men in Madrid. Conclusions Life expectancy is an easy to interpret measure for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly and annual life expectancy are sensitive and useful indicators for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units."
https://openalex.org/W3094776494,"Deletions in Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2( pfhrp 2) gene threaten the usefulness of the most widely used HRP2-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) that cross react with its structural homologue, Pf HRP3. Parasites with deleted pfhrp 2/3 genes remain undetected and untreated due to ‘false-negative’ RDT results. As Ethiopia recently launched malaria elimination by 2030 in certain selected areas, the availability of RDTs and the scale of their use have rapidly increased in recent years. Thus, it is important to explore the presence and prevalence of deletion in the target genes, pfhrp 2 and pfhrp 3. From a total of 189 febrile patients visited Adama Malaria Diagnostic centre, sixty-four microscopically-and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed P . falciparum clinical isolates were used to determine the frequency of pfhrp 2/3 gene deletions. Established PCR assays were applied to DNA extracted from blood spotted onto filter papers to amplify across pfhrp 2/3 exons and flanking regions. However, analysis of deletions in pfhrp 2, pfhrp 3 and flanking genomic regions was successful for 50 of the samples. The pfhrp2 gene deletion was fixed in the population with all 50(100%) isolates presenting a deletion variant. This deletion extended downstream towards the Pf3D7 0831900 (MAL7PI.230) gene in 11/50 (22%) cases. In contrast, only 2/50 (4%) of samples had deletions for the Pf3D7 0831700 (MALPI.228) gene, upstream of pfhrp 2. Similarly, the pfhrp 3 gene was deleted in all isolates (100%), while 40% of the isolates had an extension of the deletion to the downstream flanking region that codes for Pf3D7 13272400 (MAL13PI.485).The pfhrp 3 deletion also extended upstream to Pf3D7 081372100 (MAL13PI.475) region in 49/50 (95%) of the isolates, exhibiting complete absence of the locus. Although all samples showed deletions of pfhrp 2 exon regions, amplification of an intron region was successful in five cases. Two different repeat motifs in the intron regions were observed in the samples tested. Pfhrp 2/3 gene deletions are fixed in Ethiopia and this will likely reduce the effectiveness of Pf HRP2-based mRDTs. It will be important to determine the sensitivity Pf HRP 2/3-based RDTs in these populations and conduct a countrywide survey to determine the extent of these deletions and its effect on routine RDT-based malaria diagnosis."

As part of testing efforts, whole genome sequencing of human isolates has resulted in over 1,600 complete genomes publicly available from GenBank. We have performed a comparative analysis of the sequences, in order to detect common mutations within the population. Analysis of variants occurring within the assembled genomes yields 417 variants occurring in at least 1% of the completed genomes, including 229 within the 5’ untranslated region (UTR), 152 within the 3’UTR, 2 within intergenic regions and 34 within coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3097805496,"Purpose Disparities persist in HIV infection among Black and Latino men who have sex with men (BLMSM) and Black and Latina transgender women (BLTW). Increasing uptake and subsequent consistent use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), an effective biomedical strategy for preventing HIV acquisition, can dramatically reduce HIV incidence in these populations. The purpose of this study was to explore reasons for PrEP discontinuation among BLMSM and BLTW living in Los Angeles County to inform the development of support services for these populations to remain persistent with their PrEP regimen. Methods In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 BLMSM and 7 BLTW who reported either temporary or indefinite PrEP discontinuation. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyze qualitative data. Results Four themes emerged related to reasons for PrEP discontinuation, including: (1) lower perceived HIV risk related to changes in sexual behavior; (2) structural or logistical barriers (e.g., lapse or loss of health insurance, cost, difficulty navigating complex medical systems); (3) anticipated and experienced medication side effects, with a sub-theme of interactions between PrEP and feminizing hormone medications; and (4) challenges with medication adherence. Conclusions PrEP is an important prevention tool for BLMSM and BLTW, particularly during periods of heightened HIV risk. However, both individual (e.g., inability to adhere to medication, changes in HIV sexual risk behaviors) and structural/logistical (e.g., loss of insurance, navigating complex medical systems) factors can cause temporary or indefinite PrEP discontinuation. Additional support services, beyond those offered by medical providers, are needed to help BLMSM and BLTW PrEP users overcome barriers to discontinuation and assist them to remain persistent with their PrEP regimen. We describe potential options for support services such as PrEP case management, expanded PrEP navigation services, or text messaging services."
https://openalex.org/W3095958872,"The quality attributes of jujube fruit can be directly and indirectly affected by abiotic stresses associated with climate change. Increased temperature and drought are among the most important factors challenging sustainable jujube production in the temperate semi-arid region in northwest China. The main objective of the present study was to understand the effects of elevated air temperature and drought stress on sugar and acid accumulation and coloration of jujube fruits. The content of soluble sugar, organic acid and pigments of traditional jujube ""Linwuchangzao"" under different atmospheric temperatures and drought stresses were analyzed during three different fruit ripening stages. The elevated temperature (1.5–2.5° C than normal temperature) significantly increased the fruit sugar content, sugar-acid ratio, anthocyanins, flavonoids and carotenoids content. Under the drought stress where the soil moisture was 30% -50% of the field capacity, sugar content, anthocyanin, flavonoid and carotenoid content of the fruit were significantly reduced at the same temperature, but the chlorophyll and organic acid content increased. No significant interaction of Temperature x Drought was observed for all the analyzed quality parameters. The current results showed that the fruit quality of jujube variety ""Lingwuchangzao"" could be improved when the atmospheric temperature increases by 2° C in this region. However, drought stress had a negative impact on the fruit's sugar-acid ratio and pigment content. The present results also showed that the synthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins in jujube fruit were positively correlated with sugar content and related enzyme activities, especially Phenylalanine Ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity. This study, therefore, provides novel information for understanding the influence of growth environment on the quality properties of jujube fruits. This knowledge will help develop appropriate crop management practices for jujube production in arid and semi-arid areas in northwest China."
https://openalex.org/W3095291394,"Oocyte maturation is a coordinated process that is tightly linked to reproductive potential. A better understanding of gene regulation during human oocyte maturation will not only answer an important question in biology, but also facilitate the development of in vitro maturation technology as a fertility treatment. We generated single-cell transcriptome and used our previously published single-cell methylome data from human oocytes at different maturation stages to investigate how genes are regulated during oocyte maturation, focusing on the potential regulatory role of non-CpG methylation. DNMT3B , a gene encoding a key non-CpG methylation enzyme, is one of the 1,077 genes upregulated in mature oocytes, which may be at least partially responsible for the increased non-CpG methylation as oocytes mature. Non-CpG differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between mature and immature oocytes have multiple binding motifs for transcription factors, some of which bind with DNMT3B and may be important regulators of oocyte maturation through non-CpG methylation. Over 98% of non-CpG DMRs locate in transposable elements, and these DMRs are correlated with expression changes of the nearby genes. Taken together, this data indicates that global non-CpG hypermethylation during oocyte maturation may play an active role in gene expression regulation, potentially through the interaction with transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W3097763558,"In recent years, the development of diagnostics using artificial intelligence (AI) has been remarkable. AI algorithms can go beyond human reasoning and build diagnostic models from a number of complex combinations. Using next-generation sequencing technology, we identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants resistant to directing-acting antivirals (DAA) by whole genome sequencing of full-length HCV genomes, and applied these variants to various machine-learning algorithms to evaluate a preliminary predictive model. HCV genomic RNA was extracted from serum from 173 patients (109 with subsequent sustained virological response [SVR] and 64 without) before DAA treatment. HCV genomes from the 109 SVR and 64 non-SVR patients were randomly divided into a training data set (57 SVR and 29 non-SVR) and a validation-data set (52 SVR and 35 non-SVR). The training data set was subject to nine machine-learning algorithms selected to identify the optimized combination of functional variants in relation to SVR status following DAA therapy. Subsequently, the prediction model was tested by the validation-data set. The most accurate learning method was the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm (validation accuracy, 0.95; kappa statistic, 0.90; F-value, 0.94). The second-most accurate learning algorithm was Multi-layer perceptron. Unfortunately, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms could not be fitted with our data set due to low accuracy (&lt; 0.8). Conclusively, with an accuracy rate of 95.4% in the generalization performance evaluation, SVM was identified as the best algorithm. Analytical methods based on genomic analysis and the construction of a predictive model by machine-learning may be applicable to the selection of the optimal treatment for other viral infections and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3097247397,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to the world. Whether there is an association between lifestyle behaviors and the acquisition of COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods In this case-control study, we recruited 105 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as a case group from the Wuhan Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). For each case two control subjects were recruited. Participants were randomly selected from communities in Wuhan and matched for sex, age (± 2yrs), and pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes). Results A total of 105 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 210 controls were included. Compared with control group, the case group had higher proportions of lack of sleep (30.5% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.001) and increased physical activities (56.2% vs. 32.9%, P &lt; 0.001). And patients in the case group were more likely to have alopecia (28.6% vs. 10.0%, P &lt; 0.001) than people from the control group. Overall, we found that lack of sleep [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–2.39)], physical activities (≥ 5 times a week) (adjusted OR 2.05, 95%CI 1.39–3.02) and alopecia (adjusted OR 1.73, 95%CI 1.13–2.66) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 infection. Conversely, low-dose alcohol intake (&lt;100g alcohol per week), hand hygiene, and fruits intake (daily) were significantly associated with a decrease in morbidity. Conclusions Individual lifestyle behaviors and health status can affect the occurrence of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3094804169,"An explicit understanding of false belief develops around the age of four years. However, tasks based on spontaneous responses have revealed an implicit understanding of belief and other theory of mind constructs in infants in their second year of life. The few longitudinal studies that have examined conceptual continuity of theory of mind from infancy to early childhood have reported mixed findings. Here we report two longitudinal experiments to investigate the developmental relation between implicit and explicit theory of mind. No link was observed in the first experiment between false belief and intention understanding measured at 14 and 18 months with the violation of expectation paradigm and tasks measuring explicit and implicit false belief at four or five years of age. In the second experiment, infants aged 18 months were tested with a battery of tasks that measured knowledge inference and false belief. They were then tested with the theory of mind scale at five years of age. The parents completed the Children’s Social Understanding Scale (CSUS) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). As in the first experiment, there were no associations between early and later forms of theory of mind. We suggest that these findings do not support the view that there is conceptual continuity in theory of mind development."
https://openalex.org/W3096365100,"Even though there is a clear link between Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) related neuropathology and cognitive decline, numerous studies have observed that healthy cognition can exist in the presence of extensive AD pathology, a phenomenon sometimes called Cognitive Resilience (CR). To better understand and study CR, we develop the Alzheimer’s Disease Cognitive Resilience Score (AD-CR Score), which we define as the difference between the observed and expected cognition given the observed level of AD pathology. Unlike other definitions of CR, our AD-CR Score is a fully non-parametric, stand-alone, individual-level quantification of CR that is derived independently of other factors or proxy variables. Using data from two ongoing, longitudinal cohort studies of aging, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), we validate our AD-CR Score by showing strong associations with known factors related to CR such as baseline and longitudinal cognition, non AD-related pathology, education, personality, APOE, parkinsonism, depression, and life activities. Even though the proposed AD-CR Score cannot be directly calculated during an individual’s lifetime because it uses postmortem pathology, we also develop a machine learning framework that achieves promising results in terms of predicting whether an individual will have an extremely high or low AD-CR Score using only measures available during the lifetime. Given this, our AD-CR Score can be used for further investigations into mechanisms of CR, and potentially for subject stratification prior to clinical trials of personalized therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3096719898,"Objectives To explore patient perceptions and experiences of mild-to-moderate emotional distress and the support offered by kidney units to patients with end-stage kidney disease. Methods In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients (n = 46) being treated for end-stage kidney disease in four hospital Trusts, with data analysed thematically. Results Patients described multiple sources of distress and talked about the substantial burden that emotional challenges raised for their ability to manage their condition and develop coping strategies. Many patients did not feel it appropriate to disclose their emotional issues to staff on the kidney unit, due to a perceived lack of time for staff to deal with such issues, or a perception that staff lacked the necessary skills to provide resolution. Five themes were identified from the patient interviews, broadly related to patients’ experience of distress, and the support offered by the kidney unit: i) the emotional burden that distress placed on patients; ii) patients’ relationship with the treatment for their condition; iii) strategies for coping and adjustment; iv) patient-staff interactions and the support offered by the kidney unit, and v) the mediating impact of the treatment environment on patient experience of distress and their ability to raise emotional issues with staff. Conclusions Many patients felt unprepared for the likelihood of experiencing emotional issues as part of their condition, for which pre-dialysis education could help in managing expectations, along with support to help patients to develop appropriate coping strategies and adjustments. These findings demonstrate the importance of recognising patient distress and ensuring that talking about distress becomes normalised for patients with end-stage kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W3097764828,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Phosphorus is usually applied as fertilizer obtained from rock phosphate which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, developing rice varieties that can use P more efficiently is crucial. Here, we investigated genotypic differences in traits related to internal Phosphorus Utilization Efficiency (PUE) in five rice genotypes grown under P-deficient conditions. P-efficient rice genotypes showed higher total biomass. This was partly due to higher root biomass, which in turn relied on preferential allocation of P to roots in these genotypes. Changes in P content and tissue P concentrations were analyzed in individual leaves at different time points. Genotypes belonging to the high-PUE group responded more quickly to P starvation in terms of reducing leaf P concentrations and they were able to reduce these concentrations to a lower level compared to the low-PUE group. Changes in P concentrations were reflected in gene expression levels for genes involved in lipid remodeling. Sulfolipid ( OsSQD2 ) and galactolipid ( OsMGD and OsDGD ) synthesis-related genes were generally induced due to P starvation with most pronounced up-regulation in OsDGD1 and OsMGD3 , but patterns differed between genotypes. A significantly higher expression of OsDGD5 and OsMGD1 &amp; 2 was detected in the youngest fully expanded leaf of the high-PUE genotype group, whereas expression levels were reversed in older leaves. This pattern would confirm that P efficient genotypes react faster to P starvation in terms of freeing P for redistribution to growing tissues and replacing phospholipids with galactolipids in younger leaves may contribute to this aspect."
https://openalex.org/W3097920854,"Hypocalcaemia in pregnancy remains a major health issue, particularly in the developing world where daily calcium intakes are suboptimal. This electrolyte imbalance can lead to severe maternofoetal and childhood consequences. Calcium supplementation, amongst others, contributes significantly to meeting calcium demands in pregnancy. With ionised calcaemia as the gold standard for diagnosis, total calcaemia and albumin-corrected calcaemia in other pathological states have been found to overestimate the burden of hypocalcaemia. The main objectives of this study are to describe the blood calcium level (total, albumin corrected, and ionised calcaemia) and associated maternofoetal outcomes while identifying determinants of calcium supplementation and ionised hypocalcaemia. This study will also evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of albumin corrected calcaemia as a diagnostic tool for hypocalcaemia (ionised calcaemia as the gold standard) among pregnant women in the Nkongsamba Regional Hospital, Cameroon.Our study will target a total of 1067 term pregnant women who shall be included consecutively into the study as they arrive the maternity of the Nkongsamba Regional Hospital for their last antenatal care visit. Data shall be collected using a semi-structured interview-administered questionnaire and blood samples collected for total plasma calcium, albumin and serum ionized calcium assays. Additional data will be collected at birth (maternal and foetal variables; foetal outcomes evaluated as secondary outcomes). Total calcaemia and albuminemia shall be measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, while ionised calcaemia will be measured by ion-selective electrode potentiometry(using MSLEA15-H electrolyte analyzer) per standard BIOLABO and MSLEA15 protocols, respectively. Data will be analysed using the statistical softwares epi-Info version 7.2.2.16 and STATA version 16.This study will present a more precise estimate of the burden of hypocalcaemia in late pregnancy as well as identify and analyse the different factors associated with calcium supplementation and ionised hypocalcaemia among term pregnant women in a developing world setting. Maternofoetal outcomes associated with hypocalcaemia will be determined as well as the sensitivity and specificity of total and albumin-corrected calcaemia in diagnosing hypocalcaemia. Our findings will contribute significantly to designing or strengthening interventions to control this electrolyte imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W3096831892,"Introduction Indigo naturalis (IN) is a blue pigment extracted from Assam indigo and other plants and has been confirmed to be highly effective for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment in several clinical studies. Objective We conducted a multicenter double-blind study to confirm the efficacy and safety of short-term IN administration. Methods A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted between December 2015 and October 2018 in our facilities. Forty-six patients with mild to moderate active UC (Lichtiger index: 5–10) were randomly assigned to the IN group or the placebo group and received 5 capsules (500 mg) twice a day for 2 weeks. We investigated the efficacy according to blood tests and the Lichtiger index before and after administration, and we also examined adverse events. Results The analysis included 42 patients (20 males, 22 females) with an average age of 45 years. Nineteen patients were assigned to the placebo group, and 23 were assigned to the IN group. After treatment administration, in the placebo group, no change in the Lichtiger index was observed (7.47 to 6.95, p = 0.359), and hemoglobin was significantly reduced (12.7 to 12.4, p = 0.031), while in the IN group, the Lichtiger index (9.04 to 4.48, p = 0.001) and albumin (4.0 to 4.12, p = 0.022) improved significantly. Mild headaches were observed in 5 patients and 1 patient in the IN and placebo groups, respectively. Conclusions Short-term administration of IN is highly effective without serious adverse events such as pulmonary hypertension or intussusception and may prevent the occurrence of serious adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W3096136371,"The new concept of relational values (RVs) is gaining more and more attention in environmental research, but empirical analyses are still rare. However, this type of research is necessary because the RVs have an influence on environmental behavior. To evaluate the impact of biological education on attributing higher importance to RVs and connectedness to nature, we compared the connection to nature scores (using the inclusion of nature scale (INS) and connectedness to nature scale (CNS)) and RV scores of biologically interested high school students (n = 417) with first year (n = 593) and advanced biology (n = 223) students. While high school students showed significant lower connection to nature scores than university students, there was no significant difference in RVs between the test groups. These results suggest that there is a lack of factors in the university study of biology that can change RVs. The gender comparison of RVs and connection to nature showed a significant higher RV score for females while INS and CNS did not show a gender difference. Thus, the study makes an important contribution to the research, as it was able to prove that gender has an influence on a person's RVs but not on their connection to nature."
https://openalex.org/W3097555788,"Objective Full endoscopic lumbar discectomy (FELD) for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) has become popular in recent years. Previous studies have proven the efficacy, but few have discussed the possible risk factors of poor outcome. In this study, we reviewed patients who underwent FELD at Changhua Christian Hospital in the past 10 years and sought to identify factors associated with poor surgical outcomes and re-operations. Methods We retrospectively reviewed records from mid-2009 to mid-2018. Patients had undergone FELD and follow-up for ≥1 year were included. Factors included in the outcome evaluations were age, sex, surgical time, body mass index, surgical methods, disc herniation type, extension of herniation, degree of canal compromised, disc degenerative grade, smoking and alcohol use, surgical lumbar level, symptom duration, Oswestry low back disability index, and visual analog scale score. We had evolved from inside-out methods to outside-in methods after 2016, thus, we included this factor in the analysis. The primary outcomes of interest were poor/fair MacNab score and re-operation. Results From mid-2009 to mid-2018, 521 patients met our criteria and were analyzed. The median follow-up was 1685 days (range, 523–3923 days). Thirty-one (6.0%) patients had poor surgical outcomes (fair/poor MacNab score) and 45 (8.6%) patients required re-operation. Prolapsed herniated disc ( P &lt; 0.001), higher disc degenerative grade ( P = 0.047), higher lumbar level ( P = 0.026), longer preoperative symptoms ( P &lt; 0.001), and surgery before 2017 (outside-in technique, P = 0.020) were significant factors associated with poor outcomes in univariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, prolapsed herniated disc ( P &lt; 0.001), higher disc degenerative grade ( P = 0.030), and higher lumbar level ( P = 0.046) were statistically significant. The most common adverse symptom was numbness. Factors possibly associated with higher re-operation rate were older age ( P = 0.045), alcohol use ( P = 0.073) and higher lumbar level ( P = 0.069). Only alcohol use showed statistically significant re-operation rates in multivariate analyses ( P = 0.035). Conclusions For treating LDH by FELD, we concluded that prolapsed disc, higher disc degenerative grade, higher lumbar level, and longer preoperative symptom duration were possibly associated with unsatisfactory surgical outcomes (poor/fair MacNab score). The outside-in technique might be superior to the inside-out technique. Older age and alcohol use might be associated with a higher re-operation rate."
https://openalex.org/W3097902881,"The Hawkesbury Bioregion located off southeastern Australia (31.5–34.5 o S) is a region of highly variable circulation. The region spans the typical separation point of the East Australian Current (EAC), the western boundary current that dominates the flow along the coast of SE Australia. It lies adjacent to a known ocean warming hotspot in the Tasman Sea, and is a region of high productivity. However, we have limited understanding of the circulation, temperature regimes and shelf transport in this region, and the drivers of variability. We configure a high resolution (750m) numerical model for the Hawkesbury Shelf region nested inside 2 data assimilating models of decreasing resolution, to obtain the best estimate of the shelf circulation and transport over a 2-yr period (2012–2013). Here we show that the transport is driven by the mesoscale EAC circulation that strengthens in summer and is related to the separation of the EAC jet from the coast. Transport estimates show strong offshore export is a maximum between 32-33 o S. Median offshore transports range 2.5–8.4Sv seasonally and are a maximum during in summer driven by the separation of the EAC jet from the coast. The transport is more variable downstream of the EAC separation, driven by the EAC eddy field. Onshore transport occurs more frequently off Sydney 33.5–34.5 o S; seasonal medians range -1.7 to 2.3Sv, with an onshore maximum in winter. The region is biologically productive, and it is a known white shark nursery area despite the dominance of the oligotrophic western boundary current. Hence an understanding of the drivers of circulation and cross-shelf exchange is important."
https://openalex.org/W3094725212,"Existing research shows that high achievement boredom is correlated with a range of undesirable behavioral and personality variables and that the main antecedents of boredom are being over- or under-challenged. However, merely knowing that students are highly bored, without taking their achievement level into account, might be insufficient for drawing conclusions about students’ behavior and personality. We, therefore, investigated if low- vs. high-achieving students who experience strong mathematics boredom show different behaviors and personality traits. The sample consisted of 1,404 German secondary school students (fifth to 10th grade, mean age 12.83 years, 52% female). We used self-report instruments to assess boredom in mathematics, behavioral (social and emotional problems, positive/negative affect, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression), and personality variables (neuroticism and conscientiousness). In comparing highly bored students (more than one SD above M , n = 258) who were low vs. high achievers (as indicated by the math grade, n = 125 / n = 119), results showed that there were no mean level differences across those groups for all variables. In conclusion, our results suggest that high boredom can occur in both low- and high-achieving students and that bored low- and high-achievers show similar behaviors and personality profiles."

Samples were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with 2D-immunoblot and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS analysis, two ELISA procedures and a confirmatory 1D-immunoblot test. Sera were obtained from nine patients with a history of ingestion of raw or undercooked meat who presented typical clinical manifestations of trichinellosis and from eleven healthy people. Specific anti- Trichinella IgG antibodies were detected in all samples tested with the Home-ELISA kits, but in only four samples for the commercially-available kit. The 1D-immunoblot results indicated that all nine serum samples were positive for T . spiralis ML E-S antigens, expressed as the presence of specific bands. In contrast, eight of the serum samples with T . britovi E-S ML antigens were positive, with one serum sample taken from a patient at 33dpi (days post infection) being negative. To identify immunoreactive proteins that are specifically recognized by host antibodies, both species of ML E-S proteins were subjected to 2D-immunoblotting with human serum taken at 49 dpi. The sera recognized 22 protein spots for T . spiralis and 18 for T . britovi in 2D-immunoblot analysis. Their molecular weights (MW) ranged from 50 to 60 kDa. LC-MS/MS analysis identified both common and specifically-recognized immunoreactive proteins: transmembrane serine protease 9, serine protease, antigen targeted by protective antibodies and Actin-1 partial were shared for both Trichinella species; hypothetical protein T01_7775 and P49 antigen, partial those specific to T . spiralis ; deoxyribonuclease-2-alpha and hypothetical protein T03_17187/T12_7360 were specific to T . britovi . Our results demonstrate the value of 2-DE and 2D-immunblot as versatile tools for pinpointing factors contributing to the parasite-host relationship by comparing the secretomes of different Trichinella species."
https://openalex.org/W3097397491,"Currently no drugs are employed clinically to reverse the unconsciousness induced by general anesthetics. Our previous studies showed that caffeine, when given near the end of an anesthesia session, accelerated emergence from isoflurane anesthesia, likely caused by caffeine's ability to elevate intracellular cAMP levels and to block adenosine receptors. These earlier studies showed that caffeine did not rouse either rats or humans from deep anesthesia (≥ 1 minimum alveolar concentration, MAC). In this current crossover study, we examined whether caffeine reversed the unconsciousness produced by light anesthesia (< 1 MAC) in the continued presence of isoflurane. The primary endpoint of this study was to measure isoflurane levels at the time of recovery of righting reflex, which was a proxy for consciousness. Rats were deeply anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (~1.5 MAC) for 20 minutes. Subsequently, isoflurane was reduced to 1.2% for 10 minutes, then by 0.2% every 10 min; animals were monitored until the recovery of righting reflex occurred, in the continued presence of isoflurane. Respiration rate, heart rate and electroencephalogram (EEG) were monitored. Our results show that caffeine-treated rats recovered their righting reflex at a significantly higher inspired isoflurane concentration, corresponding to light anesthesia, than the same rats treated with saline (control). Respiration rate and heart rate increased initially after caffeine injection but were then unchanged for the rest of the anesthesia session. Deep anesthesia is correlated with burst suppression in EEG recordings. Our data showed that caffeine transiently reduced the burst suppression time produced by deep anesthesia, suggesting that caffeine altered neuronal circuit function but not to a point where it caused arousal. In contrast, under light anesthesia, caffeine shifted the EEG power to high frequency beta and gamma bands. These data suggest that caffeine may represent a clinically viable drug to reverse the unconsciousness produced by light anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W3095784561,"Research ethics has traditionally been guided by well-established documents such as the Belmont Report and the Declaration of Helsinki. At the same time, the introduction of Big Data methods, that is having a great impact in behavioral research, is raising complex ethical issues that make protection of research participants an increasingly difficult challenge. By conducting 39 semi-structured interviews with academic scholars in both Switzerland and United States, our research aims at exploring the code of ethics and research practices of academic scholars involved in Big Data studies in the fields of psychology and sociology to understand if the principles set by the Belmont Report are still considered relevant in Big Data research. Our study shows how scholars generally find traditional principles to be a suitable guide to perform ethical data research but, at the same time, they recognized and elaborated on the challenges embedded in their practical application. In addition, due to the growing introduction of new actors in scholarly research, such as data holders and owners, it was also questioned whether responsibility to protect research participants should fall solely on investigators. In order to appropriately address ethics issues in Big Data research projects, education in ethics, exchange and dialogue between research teams and scholars from different disciplines should be enhanced. In addition, models of consultancy and shared responsibility between investigators, data owners and review boards should be implemented in order to ensure better protection of research participants."
https://openalex.org/W3095957156,"Although the motor–executive function (EF) link is actively being investigated, there remain open questions surrounding why some studies found associations between specific motor and specific EF tasks, while others did not. Furthermore, it is also yet unknown which factors impact the magnitude of the motor–EF link. Findings from neuroimaging studies have proposed that neural activity in networks that are important for motor and cognitive tasks is especially strong when a task is new. In the present behavioral study, we systematically investigated the impact that task novelty had on the motor–EF link. In our study, n = 124 kindergarten children aged five to six administered in a within-subject design three fine motor tasks of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (Posting Coins, Threading Beads, and Drawing Trail) twice in succession (new vs. repeated), and three EF tasks (adapted versions of a Flanker, a N-back, and the Advanced Dimensional Chance Card Sort task). Results not only replicated the fine motor–EF link, but also showed a significantly stronger association between EF and the new task compared to the repeated Drawing Trail task. However, for the time-based task of Posting Coins and Threading Beads, motor–EF associations did not differ between the new task and the repeated task. Future investigations of more than two repetitions will provide further insights into the assumption that the motor–EF link is mainly driven by the EF processes triggered when a task is new, demands attention, and requires fast and flexible adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3095987567,"Here we present and analyze the complete genome of Alcaligenes faecalis strain Mc250 (Mc250), a bacterium isolated from the roots of Mimosa calodendron , an endemic plant growing in ferruginous rupestrian grasslands in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The genome has 4,159,911 bp and 3,719 predicted protein-coding genes, in a single chromosome. Comparison of the Mc250 genome with 36 other Alcaligenes faecalis genomes revealed that there is considerable gene content variation among these strains, with the core genome representing only 39% of the protein-coding gene repertoire of Mc250. Mc250 encodes a complete denitrification pathway, a network of pathways associated with phenolic compounds degradation, and genes associated with HCN and siderophores synthesis; we also found a repertoire of genes associated with metal internalization and metabolism, sulfate/sulfonate and cysteine metabolism, oxidative stress and DNA repair. These findings reveal the genomic basis for the adaptation of this bacterium to the harsh environmental conditions from where it was isolated. Gene clusters associated with ectoine, terpene, resorcinol, and emulsan biosynthesis that can confer some competitive advantage were also found. Experimental results showed that Mc250 was able to reduce (~60%) the virulence phenotype of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri when co-inoculated in Citrus sinensis , and was able to eradicate 98% of juveniles and stabilize the hatching rate of eggs to 4% in two species of agricultural nematodes. These results reveal biotechnological potential for the Mc250 strain and warrant its further investigation as a biocontrol and plant growth-promoting bacterium."

Nine blocks of ACP resin-based sealant were prepared and immersed in three solutions at different pH (4.0, 5.5, 7.0), and calcium and phosphate ion release was measured with ion chromatography at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after immersion. Sixty days after immersion, each block was charged with CPP-ACP solution in three 7-day cycles to investigate the re-release of these ions, which was measured on days 1, 3, and 7. No difference was observed in initial calcium ion release at pH 4.0 and pH 5.5. At both values, ion release was significantly higher than at pH 7.0 ( p &lt;0.001). Initial phosphate release was significantly different among the three pH values ( p &lt;0.001). After re-charging the specimens, calcium ion re-release was greater than phosphate ion release. Initial ion release from ACP resin-based sealant was greatest at the lowest pH. Ion release decreased with time. As the number of recharge cycles increased, ion re-release also improved. Phosphate ion re-release required more recharge cycles than calcium ion re-release."
https://openalex.org/W3096949782,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in biomedical research promises to unlock new information from the vast amounts of data being generated through the delivery of healthcare and the expanding high-throughput research applications. Such information can aid medical diagnoses and reveal various unique patterns of biochemical and immune features that can serve as early disease biomarkers. In this report, we demonstrate the feasibility of using an AI/ML approach in a relatively small dataset to discriminate among three categories of samples obtained from mice that either rejected or tolerated their pancreatic islet allografts following transplant in the anterior chamber of the eye, and from naïve controls. We created a locked software based on a support vector machine (SVM) technique for pattern recognition in electropherograms (EPGs) generated by micellar electrokinetic chromatography and laser induced fluorescence detection (MEKC-LIFD). Predictions were made based only on the aligned EPGs obtained in microliter-size aqueous humor samples representative of the immediate local microenvironment of the islet allografts. The analysis identified discriminative peaks in the EPGs of the three sample categories. Our classifier software was tested with targeted and untargeted peaks. Working with the patterns of untargeted peaks (i.e., based on the whole pattern of EPGs), it was able to achieve a 21 out of 22 positive classification score with a corresponding 95.45% prediction accuracy among the three sample categories, and 100% accuracy between the rejecting and tolerant recipients. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of AI/ML approaches to classify small numbers of samples and they warrant further studies to identify the analytes/biochemicals corresponding to discriminative features as potential biomarkers of islet allograft immune rejection and tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3097909518,"Whereas the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in plant growth improvement has been well described in agroecosystems, little is known about the effect of environmental factors on AMF root colonization status of barley, the fourth most important cereal crop all over the world. In order to understand the influence of environmental factors, such as climatic and soil physico-chemical properties, on the spontaneous mycorrhizal ability of barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), a field investigation was conducted in 31 different sites in sub-humid, upper and middle semi-arid areas of Northern Tunisia. Mycorrhizal root colonization of H . vulgare varied considerably among sites. Principal component analysis showed that barley mycorrhization is influenced by both climatic and edaphic factors. A partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that 39% (R²) of the total variation in AMF mycorrhizal rate of barley roots was mainly explained by chemical soil properties and climatic characteristics. Whereas barley root mycorrhizal rates were inversely correlated with soil organic nitrogen (ON), available phosphorus amounts (P), altitude (Z), average annual rainfall (AAR), they were directly correlated with soil pH and temperature. Our results indicated that AMF root colonization of barley was strongly related to climatic characteristics than chemical soil properties. The current study highlights the importance of the PLS-SEM to understand the interactions between climate, soil properties and AMF symbiosis of barley in field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3097536072,"Background Electrolytes play an important role in controlling acid base balance, blood clotting, and body fluid and muscle contractions. Serum electrolytes concentrations are most commonly used tests for assessment of a patient’s clinical conditions, and are associated with morbidity and mortality. Any derangements from the normal range of electrolyte levels in the body is described as electrolyte disorders. The Current study was aimed to determine serum electrolytes disorder and its associated factors among adults admitted with metabolic syndrome at Jimma medical center, South West Ethiopia. Methods A Facility based cross sectional study was conducted on 256 patients admitted medical center with metabolic syndrome during the study period. The World Health Organization stepwise assessment tools and patients’ medical records were used to collect information on factors associated with electrolyte disorders. Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with electrolyte disorder at the level of significance of p value &lt;0.25 with 95% confidence interval of crude odds ratio and &lt;0.05 with 95% confidence interval of adjusted odds ratio respectively. Results The overall prevalence of electrolyte disorders was 44.1% (95%CI:40.99–47.20) with hyponatremia 42.9% (95%CI:39.81–45.99) as the leading electrolyte disorder followed by hypokalemia 20.7% (95%CI:18.17–23.23), hypochloremia 17.6% (95%CI:15.22–19.98) and hypocalcemia 9.4% (95%CI:7.57–11.22). Non-formal education [AOR: 6.81; 95%CI:(3.48,17.01)] alcohol consumption [AOR: 4.28; 95%CI:(1.71,10.70)], diuretics, diuretics [AOR: 4.39; 95%CI:(2.10,9.15)], antidiabetics [AOR: 5.18; 95%CI:(2.44,11.00)], and body mass index [AOR: 11.51; 95%CI:(3.50,18.81)] were identified as independent factors for electrolyte disturbance in multivariable logistic regression. Conclusion The finding of the study revealed that nearly half the study participants with metabolic syndromes had electrolyte disorder. Educational status, habit of alcohol consumption, diuretics, antidiabetics, and having higher body mass index were the independent factors associated with electrolyte disorders. Determination of Serum electrolytes, proper administration of diuretic and health education on behavioral factors were the necessary measures that should be done by concerned bodies to reduce electrolytes disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3095045404,"To elucidate how variants in genetic risk loci previously implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) contribute to expression of disease phenotypes, a phenome-wide association study was performed in two waves. In the first wave, we explored clinical traits associated with thirteen genetic variants previously reported to be linked to disease risk using both the 23andMe and UKB cohorts. We tested 30 additional AD variants in UKB cohort only in the second wave. APOE variants defining ε 2/ ε 3/ ε 4 alleles and rs646776 were identified to be significantly associated with metabolic/cardiovascular and longevity traits. APOE variants were also significantly associated with neurological traits. ABI3 variant rs28394864 was significantly associated with cardiovascular (e.g. (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis, angina) and immune-related trait asthma. Both APOE variants and CLU variant were significantly associated with nearsightedness. HLA- DRB1 variant was associated with diseases with immune-related traits. Additionally, variants from 10+ AD genes ( BZRAP1-AS1 , ADAMTS4 , ADAM10 , APH1B , SCIMP , ABI3 , SPPL2A , ZNF232 , GRN , CD2AP , and CD33 ) were associated with hematological measurements such as white blood cell (leukocyte) count, monocyte count, neutrophill count, platelet count, and/or mean platelet (thrombocyte) volume (an autoimmune disease biomarker). Many of these genes are expressed specifically in microglia. The associations of ABI3 variant with cardiovascular and immune-related traits are one of the novel findings from this study. Taken together, it is evidenced that at least some AD and FTD variants are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes and not just dementia. These findings were discussed in the context of causal relationship versus pleiotropy via Mendelian randomization analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3095402959,"Chicken egg products increased by 60% worldwide resulting in the farmers or traders egg industry. The double yolk (DY) eggs are priced higher than single yolk (SY) eggs around 35% at the same size. Although, separating DY from SY will increase more revenue but it has to be replaced at the higher cost from skilled labor for sorting. Normally, the separation of double yolk eggs required the expertise person by weigh and shape of egg but it is still high error. The purpose of this research is to detect double-yolked (DY) chicken eggs with weight and ratio of the egg’s size using fuzzy logic and developing a low cost prototype to reduce the cost of separation. The K-means clustering is used for separating DY and SY, firstly. However, the error from this technique is still high as 15.05% because of its hard clustering. Therefore, the intersection zone scattering from using the weight and ratio of the egg’s size to input of DY and SY is taken into consider with fuzzy logic algorithm, to improve the error. The results of errors from fuzzy logic are depended with input membership functions (MF). This research selects triangular MF of weight as low = 65 g, medium = 75 g and high = 85 g, while ratio of the egg is triangular MF as low = 1.30, medium = 1.40 and high = 1.50. This algorithm is not provide the minimum total error but it gives the low error to detect a double yolk while the real egg is SY as 1.43% of total eggs. This algorithm is applied to develop a double yolk egg detection prototype with Mbed platform by a load cell and OpenMV CAM, to measure the weight and ratio of the egg respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3095740737,"Background Team care improves processes and outcomes of care, especially for patients with complex medical conditions that require coordination of care. This study aimed to compare the processes and outcomes of care provided to older patients with diabetes by primary care teams comprised of only primary care physicians (PCPs) versus team care that included nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants (PAs). Methods We studied 3,524 primary care practices identified via social network analysis and 306,741 patients ≥66 years old diagnosed with diabetes in or before 2015 in Medicare data. Guideline-recommended diabetes care included eye examination, hemoglobin A1c test, and nephropathy monitoring. High-risk medications were based on recommendations from the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults. Preventable hospitalizations were defined as hospitalizations for a potentially preventable condition. Results Compared with patients in the PCP only teams, patients in the team care practices with NPs or PAs received more guideline-recommended diabetes care (annual eye exam: adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00–1.08), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03–1.13), and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.05–1.15), and HbA1C test: aOR: 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04–1.18), 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02–1.20), and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.06–1.25) for PCP/NP, PCP/NP/PA, and PCP/PA teams). Patients in the PCP/NP and the PCP/PA teams had a slightly higher likelihood of being prescribed high-risk medications (aOR: 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00–1.07), and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02–1.11), respectively). The likelihood of preventable hospitalizations was similar among patients cared for by various types of practices. Conclusion The team care practices with NPs or PAs were associated with better adherence to clinical practice guideline recommendations for diabetes compared to PCP only practices. Both practices had similar outcomes. Further efforts are needed to explore new and cost-effective team-based care delivery models that improve process, outcomes, and continuity of care, as well as patient care experiences."
https://openalex.org/W3096347997,"Background An accurate prediction of tissue outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients is of high interest for treatment decision making. To date, various machine learning models have been proposed that combine multi-parametric imaging data for this purpose. However, most of these machine learning models were trained using voxel information extracted from the whole brain, without taking differences in susceptibility to ischemia into account that exist between brain regions. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a local tissue outcome prediction approach, which makes predictions using locally trained machine learning models and thus accounts for regional differences. Material and methods Multi-parametric MRI data from 99 acute ischemic stroke patients were used for the development and evaluation of the local tissue outcome prediction approach. Diffusion (ADC) and perfusion parameter maps (CBF, CBV, MTT, Tmax) and corresponding follow-up lesion masks for each patient were registered to the MNI brain atlas. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were trained employing a local approach, which makes predictions using models individually trained for each specific voxel position using the corresponding local data. A global approach, which uses a single model trained using all voxels of the brain, was used for comparison. Tissue outcome predictions resulting from the global and local RF and LR models, as well as a combined (hybrid) approach were quantitatively evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), the Dice coefficient, and the sensitivity and specificity metrics. Results Statistical analysis revealed the highest ROC AUC and Dice values for the hybrid approach. With 0.872 (ROC AUC; LR) and 0.353 (Dice; RF), these values were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) than the values of the two other approaches. In addition, the local approach achieved the highest sensitivity of 0.448 (LR). Overall, the hybrid approach was only outperformed in sensitivity (LR) by the local approach and in specificity by both other approaches. However, in these cases the effect sizes were comparatively small. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that using locally trained machine learning models can lead to better lesion outcome prediction results compared to a single global machine learning model trained using all voxel information independent of the location in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3096389529,"The monoclonal anti-CD20 IgG1 antibody rituximab is used as a first-line treatment for B cell lymphoma. Like all therapeutic antibodies, it is a complex protein for which both safety and efficacy heavily depend on the integrity of its three-dimensional structure. Aptamers, short oligonucleotides with a distinct fold, can be used to detect minor modifications or structural variations of a molecule or protein. To detect antibody molecules in a fold state occurring prior to protein precipitation, we generated DNA aptamers that were selected for extensively heat-treated rituximab. Using the magnetic bead-based systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), we obtained six DNA aptamer sequences (40-mers) specific for 80°C heat-treated rituximab. In silico fold prediction and circular dichroism analysis revealed a G-quadruplex structure for one aptamer, while all others exhibited a B-DNA helix. Binding affinities ranging from 8.8–86.7 nM were determined by an enzyme-linked apta-sorbent assay (ELASA). Aptamers additionally detected structural changes in rituximab treated for 5 min at 70°C, although with lower binding activity. Notably, none of the aptamers recognized rituximab in its native state nor did they detect the antibody after it was exposed to lower temperatures or different physical stressors. Aptamers also reacted with the therapeutic antibody adalimumab incubated at 80°C suggesting similar aptamer binding motifs located on extensively heat-treated IgG1 antibodies. Within this work, we obtained the first aptamer panel, which is specific for an antibody fold state specifically present prior to protein aggregation. This study demonstrates the potential of aptamer selection for specific stress-based protein variants, which has potential impact for quality control of biopharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W3096891085,"Background The normal ranges for clinical chemistry tests are usually defined by cut-offs given by the distribution in healthy individuals. This approach does however not indicate if individuals outside the normal range are more prone to disease. Methods We studied the associations and risk prediction of 11 plasma and serum biomarkers with all-cause mortality in two population-based cohorts: a Swedish cohort (X69) initiated in 1969, and the UK Biobank (UKB) initiated in 2006–2010, with up to 48- and 9-years follow-up, respectively. Results In X69 and in UKB, 18,529 and 425,264 individuals were investigated, respectively. During the follow-up time, 14,475 deaths occurred in X69 and 17,116 in UKB. All evaluated tests were associated with mortality in X69 ( P &lt;0.0001, except bilirubin P&lt;0.005). For calcium, blood urea nitrogen, bilirubin, hematocrit, uric acid, and iron, U-shaped associations were seen ( P &lt;0.0001). For leukocyte count, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatases and lactate dehydrogenase, linear positive associations were seen, while for albumin the association was negative. Similar associations were seen in UKB. Addition of all biomarkers to a model with classical risk factors improved mortality prediction (delta C-statistics: +0.009 in X69 and +0.023 in UKB, P &lt;0.00001 in both cohorts). Conclusions Commonly used clinical chemistry tests were associated with all-cause mortality both in the medium- and long-term perspective, and improved mortality prediction beyond classical risk factors. Since both linear and U-shaped relationships were found, we propose to define the normal range of a clinical chemistry test based on its association with mortality, rather than from the distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3095447185,"The implementation and monitoring of management strategies is integral to protect coastal marshes from increased inundation and submergence under sea-level rise. Sediment addition is one such strategy in which sediment is added to marshes to raise relative elevations, decrease tidal inundation, and enhance ecosystem processes. This study looked at the plant and invertebrate community responses over 12 months following a sediment addition project on a salt marsh located in an urbanized estuary in southern California, USA. This salt marsh is experiencing local subsidence, is sediment-limited from landscape modifications, has resident protected species, and is at-risk of submergence from sea-level rise. Abiotic measurements, invertebrate cores, and plant parameters were analyzed before and after sediment application in a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. Immediately following the sediment application, plant cover and invertebrate abundance decreased significantly, with smothering of existing vegetation communities without regrowth, presumably creating resulting harsh abiotic conditions. At six months after the sediment application treatment, Salicornia bigelovii minimally colonized the sediment application area, and Spartina foliosa spread vegetatively from the edges of the marsh; however, at 12 months following sediment application overall plant recovery was still minimal. Community composition of infaunal invertebrates shifted from a dominance of marsh-associated groups like oligochaetes and polychaetes to more terrestrial and more mobile dispersers like insect larvae. In contrast to other studies, such as those with high organic deposition, that showed vegetation and invertebrate community recovery within one year of sediment application, our results indicated a much slower recovery following a sediment addition of 32 cm which resulted in a supratidal elevation with an average of 1.62 m (NAVD88) at our sampling locations. Our results indicate that the site did not recover after one year and that recovery may take longer which illustrates the importance of long-term monitoring to fully understand restoration trajectories and inform adaptive management. Testing and monitoring sea-level rise adaptation strategies like sediment addition for salt marshes is important to prevent the loss of important coastal ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3096315871,"The Grain-for-Green project is an important ecological restoration measure to address the degradation of alpine ecosystems in China, which has an important impact on the ecological stoichiometry of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). However, soil stoichiometry changes under different vegetation restoration patterns and at different soil depths remain poorly understood in the alpine region of the Loess Plateau. To clarify these soil stoichiometry changes, a 0–60 cm soil profile was sampled from two typical vegetation restoration patterns: grassland (GL) and forestland (FL), including Picea crassifolia (PC), Larix principis-rupprechtii (LR), Populus cathayana (PR) and Betula platyphylla (BP). The control was a wheat field (WF). In all soil layers, the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil available nitrogen and potassium (AN and AK, respectively) and C:P, C:K, N:P and N:K ratios of FL were higher than those of GL and WF. The TN content and N:P and N:K ratios of GL were higher than those of WF in each soil layer. Additionally, the soil nutrients (except TK) of all vegetation types and stoichiometry of PR and GL (except the N:P ratio of GL) were greater at 0–20 cm than at 20–60 cm. Moreover, the SOC and TN showed the strongest correlation with the soil stoichiometry (except P:K ratio); thus, C and N had the greatest effect on the soil stoichiometry. Furthermore, soil fertility was limited by N. Our results indicated that different vegetation restoration patterns and soil depths had significant effects on the soil nutrients and stoichiometry in the alpine region of the Loess Plateau. The recovery of farmland to forestland promoted better improvements of soil nutrients, and PR had the most significant positive effect on soil surface nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W3096712951,"Immunization-based antibody discovery platforms require robust and effective protocols for the amplification, cloning, expression, and screening of antibodies from large numbers of B-cells in order to effectively capture the diversity of an experienced Ig-repertoire. Multiplex PCR using a series of forward and reverse primers designed to recover antibodies from a range of different germline sequences is challenging because primer design requires the recovery of full length antibody sequences, low starting template concentrations, and the need for all the primers to function under the same PCR conditions. Here we demonstrate several advantages to incorporating RNase H2-dependent PCR (rh-PCR) into a high-throughput, antibody-discovery platform. Firstly, rh-PCR eliminated primer dimer synthesis to below detectable levels, thereby eliminating clones with a false positive antibody titer. Secondly, by increasing the specificity of PCR, the rh-PCR primers increased the recovery of cognate antibody variable regions from single B-cells, as well as downstream recombinant antibody titers. Finally, we demonstrate that rh-PCR primers provide a more homogeneous sample pool and greater sequence quality in a Next Generation Sequencing-based approach to obtaining DNA sequence information from large numbers of cloned antibody cognate pairs. Furthermore, the higher specificity of the rh-PCR primers allowed for a better match between native antibody germline sequences and the VL/VH fragments amplified from single B-cells."

There is great inequity in healthcare allocation, as two parallel healthcare systems exist, potentially modifying PAI patients’ clinical profiles, private being better resourced than public healthcare. Methods An online survey of physicians’ experience relating to PAI. Results The physicians were managing 811 patients, equal to a prevalence of 14.2 per million. Likely causes of PAI in public/ academic vs private settings included: AIDS-related [304 (44.8%) vs 5 (3.8%); p &lt;0.001], tuberculosis [288 (42.5%) vs 8 (6.0%); p &lt;0.001], autoimmune disease [50 (7.4%) vs 88 (66.2%); p &lt;0.001], malignancy [27 (4.0%) vs 7 (5.3%); p = 0.500], genetic including adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) [5 (0.7%) vs 16 (12.0%); p &lt;0.001], respectively. Overall, more patients presented with nausea [101 (74.3%) and vomiting 89 (65.9%), than diarrhoea 76 (58.9%); p = 0.008 and 126 (15.5%) in adrenal crisis.

Greater unavailability of antibody testing in the public vs. the private sector [32 (66.7%) vs 30 (32.1%); p = 0.001], [serum-ACTH 25 (52.1%) vs 16 (19.5%); p &lt;0.001] and glucocorticoids were [26 (54.2%) vs 33 (40.2%); p = 0.015]. Many patients, 389(66.7%) were not using identification, indicating that they need steroids in an emergency. Conclusion A survey of South African physicians suggests a higher prevalence than previously reported. Patients presented with typical symptoms, and 15.5% presented in adrenal crisis. Significant disparities in the availability of physicians’ expertise, diagnostic resources, and management options were noted in the public versus private settings. Greater awareness among health practitioners to timeously diagnose PAI is required to prevent a life-threatening outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3096804512,"Anesthesia with desflurane and remifentanil can be maintained with either fixed or titrated desflurane concentration. We hypothesized that the fixed-gas concentration (FG) method would reduce the number of anesthetic titrations without hypnotic and hemodynamic instability compared to the bispectral index (BIS)-guided (BG) method. Forty-eight patients were randomly allocated to the FG or BG groups. In the FG group, desflurane vaporizer setting was fixed at 1 age-corrected minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). In the BG group, desflurane was titrated to target a BIS level at 50. Remifentanil was titrated to maintain a systolic arterial pressure (SAP) of 120 mmHg in both groups. Our primary endpoint was the hypnotic stability measured by the wobble of BIS in performance analysis, and the secondary endpoints included the wobble of SAP, mean BIS value during surgery, and the number of anesthetic titrations. The BIS in the FG group showed significantly less wobble (3.9 ± 1.1% vs 5.5 ± 1.5%, P &lt;0.001) but lower value (33 ± 6 vs 46 ± 7, P &lt;0.001) than BG group. The wobble of SAP showed no difference between groups [median (inter-quartile range), 5.0 (4.1–7.5)% vs 5.2 (4.2–8.3)%, P = 0.557]. The numbers of anesthetic titrations in the FG group were significantly lower than the BG group (0 ± 0 vs 8 ± 5, P &lt;0.001 for desflurane, 13 ± 13 vs 22 ± 17, P = 0.047 for remifentanil). Less wobble in BIS and reduced anesthetic titration without hemodynamic instability during the FG technique may be practical in balanced anesthesia using desflurane and remifentanil anesthesia. Clinical trial: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02283866 )."
https://openalex.org/W3094724013,"Background &amp; aim Hepatic resection is a treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, factors associated with candidacy for resection and predictive of liver-related morbidity after resection for HCC remain unclear. This study aimed to assess candidacy for liver resection in patients with HCC and to design a model predictive of liver-related morbidity after resection. Methods A retrospective analysis of 1,565 patients who underwent liver resection for HCC between January 2016 and December 2017 was performed. The primary outcome was liver-related morbidity, including post-hepatectomy biochemical dysfunction (PHBD), ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, rescue liver transplantation, and death from any cause within 90 days. PHBD was defined as international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 or hyperbilirubinemia (&gt; 2.9 mg/dL) on postoperative day ≥ 5. Results The 1,565 patients included 1,258 (80.4%) males and 307 (19.6%) females with a mean age of 58.3 years. Of these patients, 646 (41.3%) and 919 (58.7%) patients underwent major and minor liver resection, respectively. Liver-related morbidity was observed in 133 (8.5%) patients, including 77 and 56 patients who underwent major and minor resection, respectively. A total of 83 (5.3%) patients developed PHBD. Multivariate analysis identified cut-off values of the platelet count, serum albumin concentration, and ICG R15 value for predicting liver-related morbidity after resection. A model predicting postoperative liver-related morbidity was developed, which included seven factors: male sex, age ≥ 55 years, ICG R15 value ≥ 15%, major resection, platelet count &lt; 150,000/mm 3 , serum albumin concentration &lt; 3.5 g/dL, and INR &gt; 1.1. Conclusion Hepatic resection for HCC was safe with 90-day liver-related morbidity and mortality rates of 8.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The developed point-based scoring system with seven factors could allow the prediction of the risk of liver-related morbidity after resection for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3095089491,"The aim of the present study was to determine and compare the degree and duration of corneal anesthesia following topical application of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution and 1% ropivacaine hydrochloride treatment in healthy rats. A randomized, blinded, crossover study was conducted on 20 healthy adult Wistar rats, following complete physical and ophthalmological examination. Baseline corneal touch threshold (CTT) was determined in the central corneal area of both eyes with a Cochet–Bonnet aesthesiometer, in mm filament length. Oxybuprocaine was randomly applied to one eye and 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution was instilled into the contralateral eye. Subsequent CTT measurements were performed in both eyes 5 minutes after topical application and at 5-minute intervals thereafter for 75-minutes in the anesthetized eye. Following a 2-week washout period, this protocol was repeated with ropivacaine. Quantitative data were summarized as mean ± standard deviation, median and inter-quartile range (Q1–Q3). Repeated measures data were analyzed over time and between treatments using Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment ( p &lt; 0.05). Baseline CTT values were 60 mm in all eyes. With oxybuprocaine, CTT values decreased significantly for 65 minutes (0–55 mm; p = 0.002) when compared with baseline; the maximal anesthetic effect (no blink response at 5 mm filament length) was maintained for up to 15 minutes ( p &lt; 0.0001). With ropivacaine, CTT values were significantly lower than baseline for 30 minutes (0–55 mm; p = 0.002), with a maximal anesthetic effect recorded at 5 minutes in 18 eyes ( p &lt; 0.0001). Oxybuprocaine induced a significantly lower CTT than ropivacaine ( p = 0.002) from 10 to 65 minutes following topical application. Both anesthetic agents induced significant corneal anesthesia; however, oxybuprocaine provided a greater and longer anesthetic effect, making it more suitable for potentially painful ophthalmologic procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3095505102,"Quantification of skeletal muscle contraction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method for studying muscle motion and deformation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the repeatability of quantitative measures such as strain, based on single slice dynamic MRI synchronized with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and standardized to a similar relative force level across various individuals. Unilateral electrical stimulation of the triceps surae muscles was applied in eight volunteers during single-slice, three-directional phase contrast MRI acquisition at a 3T MRI scanner. To assess repeatability, the same process was executed on two different days by standardizing the stimulation aiming at evoking a fixed percentage of their maximal voluntary force in the same position. Except from the force, the effect of using the current as reference was evaluated on day two as a secondary acquisition. Finally, the presence of fatigue induced by NMES was assessed (on day one) by examining the difference between consecutive measurements. Strain maps were derived from the acquired slice at every time point; distribution of strain in the muscle and peak strain over the muscle of interest were evaluated for repeatability. It was found that fatigue did not have an appreciable effect on the results. The stimulation settings based on evoked force produced more repeatable results with respect to using the current as the only reference, with an intraclass correlation coefficient between different days of 0.95 for the former versus 0.88 for the latter. In conclusion, for repeatable strain imaging it is advisable to record the force output of the evoked contraction and use that for the standardization of the NMES setup rather than the current."
https://openalex.org/W3095764058,"Household food insecurity remains a major policy challenge in low-income countries. Identifying accurate measures that are relatively easy to collect has long been an important priority for governments seeking to better understand and fund solutions for communities in remote settings. Conventional approaches based on surveys can be time-consuming and costly, while data derived from satellite imagery represent proxies focused on biological processes (such as rainfall and crop growth) lack granularity in terms of human behaviors. As a result, there has recently been interest in tapping into the large digital footprint offered by mobile phone usage. This paper explores empirical relationships between data relating to mobile phones (ownership and spending on service use), and food insecurity in rural Nepal. The work explores models for estimating community-level food insecurity through aggregated mobile phone variables in a proof-of-concept approach. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed by considering the performance of the models under different settings. The results suggest that mobile phone variables on ownership and expenditure can be used to estimate food insecurity with reasonable accuracy. This suggests that such an approach can be used in and beyond Nepal as an option for collecting timely food insecurity information, either alone or in combination with conventional approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3096268063,"Background Due to an aging population and the increasing proportion of patients with various comorbidities, the number of patients with acute ischemic heart disease (AIHD) who present to the emergency department (ED) with atypical chest pain is increasing. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prediction model for AIHD in patients with atypical chest pain. Methods and results A chest pain workup registry, ED administrative database, and clinical data warehouse database were analyzed and integrated by using nonidentifiable key factors to create a comprehensive clinical dataset in a single academic ED from 2014 to 2018. Demographic findings, vital signs, and routine laboratory test results were assessed for their ability to predict AIHD. An extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model was developed and evaluated, and its performance was compared to that of a single-variable model and logistic regression model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated to assess discrimination. A calibration plot and partial dependence plots were also used in the analyses. Overall, 4,978 patients were analyzed. Of the 3,833 patients in the training cohort, 453 (11.8%) had AIHD; of the 1,145 patients in the validation cohort, 166 (14.5%) had AIHD. XGB, troponin (single-variable), and logistic regression models showed similar discrimination power (AUROC [95% confidence interval]: XGB model, 0.75 [0.71–0.79]; troponin model, 0.73 [0.69–0.77]; logistic regression model, 0.73 [0.70–0.79]). Most patients were classified as non-AIHD; calibration was good in patients with a low predicted probability of AIHD in all prediction models. Unlike in the logistic regression model, a nonlinear relationship-like threshold and U-shaped relationship between variables and the probability of AIHD were revealed in the XGB model. Conclusion We developed and validated an AIHD prediction model for patients with atypical chest pain by using an XGB model."
https://openalex.org/W3094965742,"This study described the epidemiology of 487 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Sichuan province of China, and aimed to provide epidemiological evidence to support public health decision making. Epidemiological information of 487 COVID-19 cases were collected from the official websites of 21 districts (including 18 cities, 3 autonomous prefecture) health commissions within Sichuan between 21st of January 2020 to 17th of April 2020. We focus on the single-day diagnosis, demographics (gender and age), regional distribution, incubation period and symptoms. The number of single-day confirmed COVID-19 cases reach a peak on January 29 (33 cases), and then decreased. Chengdu (121 cases), Dazhou (39 cases) Nanchong (37 cases) and Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (78 cases) contributed 275 cases (56.5% of the total cases) of Sichuan province. The median age of patients was 44.0 years old and 52.6% were male. The history of living in or visiting Hubei, close contact, imported and unknown were 170 cases (34.9%), 136 cases (27.9%), 21 cases (4.3%) and 160 cases (32.9%) respectively. The interval from the onset of initial symptoms to laboratory diagnosis was 4.0 days in local cases, while that of imported cases was 4.5 days. The most common symptoms of illness onset were fever (71.9%) and cough (35.9%). The growth rate of COVID-19 in Sichuan has significantly decreased. New infected cases have shifted from the living in or visiting Wuhan and close contact to imported. It is necessary to closely monitor the physical condition of imported cases."
https://openalex.org/W3095550006,"We present evidence of pupil response modification, as well as differential theoretical melatonin suppression through selective and dynamic electrochromic filtering of visible light in the 400–500 nm range to minimize chronodisruptive nocturnal blue light exposure. A lower activation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), the first step for light to reach a human’s internal clock, is related to melatonin secretion therefore avoiding detrimental effects of excessive blue light exposure. Pupillary Light Reflex and Color Naming were experimentally assessed under light filtered by two different coloration states (transmissive and absorptive) of these novel dynamic filters, plus an uncoated test device, in 16 volunteers. Also, different commercial light sources at illuminances ranging from 1 to 1000 lux were differentially filtered and compared in terms of theoretical melatonin suppression. Representative parameters of the pupil responses reflected lower pupil constriction when the electrochromic filters (ECFs) were switched on (absorptive state, blue light is absorbed by the filter) compared to uncoated filters (control sample), but failed to do so under transmissive state (blue light passes through the filter) indicating less activation of ipRGCs under absorptive state (although no significant differences between states was found). Out of eight colors tested, just one showed significant differences in naming between both filter states. Thus, the ECF would have some protecting effect on ipRGC activation with very limited changes in color perception. While there are some limitations of the theoretical model used, the absorptive state yielded significantly lower theoretical melatonin suppression in all those light sources containing blue wavelengths across the illuminance range tested. This would open the way for further research on biological applications of electrochromic devices."
https://openalex.org/W3095854870,"Background Fecundity is a physiological ability to have children. The inability to get the desired child which was commonly caused by the prolonged time to conceive due to unwanted non-conception period increased from time to time. As a result, many couples are developing psychological, social, and economic problems and unstable life. However, information on fecundity status is limited in Ethiopia context. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the proportion of sub-fecundity and associated factors in Ethiopia context. Methods A health institution based cross-sectional study was conducted in Arba Minch health facilities from March 25 to April 25, 2020. By using a systematic sampling method, 539 mothers were selected for the study. Structured questionnaire was used for data collection. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the sub-fecundity. Variables with p-value &lt;0.25 in the bi-variable logistic regression analysis were interred and checked for association in a multivariable logistic regression model. The level of statistical significance was declared at p-value &lt;0.05. Result The proportion of sub-fecundity was 17.8% with 95%CI (14.8%-21.3%). Mothers’ age ≥ 30 (AOR = 2.54, 95%CI; 1.18–5.48), partners’ age ≥ 35 (AOR = 2.20, 95%CI; 1.01–4.75), coffee consumption of ≥ 4 cups/day (AOR = 2.93, 95%CI; 1.14–7.53), menses irregularity (AOR = 3.79 95%CI; 2.01–7.14) and coital frequency of 1day/week (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI; 1.47–9.05) were significantly associated with the sub-fecundity. Conclusion This study found that a substantial proportion of mothers were sub-fecund. Factors that contributed to the sub-fecundity were pre-pregnancy; mothers’ age, partners’ age, coffee drinking of ≥ 4 cups/day, coital frequency of 1day/week, and menses irregularity. Thus, efforts to prevent sub-fecundity should focus on awareness creation as to plan to conceive at early age, reducing coffee consumption, increasing days of coital frequency per week, and investigating and treating mothers with irregular menses."
https://openalex.org/W3097451645,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate a novel kit of resorbable calcium sulfate beads marketed specifically for use in veterinary medicine and generally used for local delivery of antimicrobials as carboplatin-delivery system. The study characterized the elution of carboplatin in vitro , and investigated whether the initial dose and formulation of carboplatin, or the bead size significantly influences carboplatin elution in vitro . Calcium sulfate hemihydrate beads of 3- and 5-mm diameter were prepared. Five doses and two formulations of carboplatin (20, 50, 100, and 500 mg carboplatin per kit in powder formulation; 20 mg in liquid formulation) were tested in triplicates for each diameter beads. Beads were placed in 37°C phosphate buffered saline for 72 hours. Carboplatin concentrations in the eluent were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography at 11 time points with a modified United States Pharmacopeia assay. Concentrations of carboplatin in the eluent proportionally increased with the initial dose and peaked between 13 and 52 hours, ranging from 42.1% to 79.3% of the incorporated load. Higher peak concentrations, percentages released, and elution rates were observed with the liquid formulation and with higher carboplatin doses. There was no significant difference in maximum carboplatin concentrations between 3- and 5-mm diameter beads, but 5-mm diameter beads had slower elution rates. The novel kit can be used for preparation of carboplatin-impregnated resorbable calcium sulfate beads at variable doses, sizes and formulations. Further study is warranted to define the in vivo requirements and effective carboplatin dose, spatial diffusion and desired duration of elution."
