https://openalex.org/W2022465033,"Four chinchillas were trained to respond differently to /t/ and /d/ consonant-vowel syllables produced by four talkers in three vowel contexts. This training generalized to novel instances, including synthetically produced /da/ and /ta/ (voice-on-set times of 0 and +80 milliseconds, respectively). In a second experiment, synthetic stimuli with voice-onset times between 0 and +80 milliseconds were presented for identification. The form of the labeling functions and the ""phonetic boundaries"" for chinchillas and English-speaking adults were similar."

It also reduces nonstimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion but does not affect basal secretin concentrations. Suppression of HCl-stimulated secretin release is complete, whereas pancreatic flow rate and bicarbonate and protein secretions are only partially inhibited. The action of somatostatin is rapid in onset and quickly reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1914441096,"In earlier studies, the nucleolar levels of protein A24 were found to be markedly decreased in the nucleolar hypertrophy induced by thioacetamide or during liver regeneration (Ballal, N.R., Goldknopf, I.L., Goldberg, D.A., and Busch, H. (1974) Life Sci. 14, 1835-1845; Ballal, N.R., Kang, Y.-J., Olson, M.O.-J., and Busch, H.J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5921-5925). To determine the role of protein A24, methods were developed for its isolation in highly purified form. Milligram quantities of highly purified protein A24 were isolated from the 0.4 N H2SO4-soluble proteins of calf thymus chromatin by exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-100, followed by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein A24 was highly purified as shown by its migration as a single spot on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, its single NH2-terminal amino acid, methionine, and the production of approximately 50 peptides by tryptic digestion. Like histones 2A, 2B, 3, and 4. A24 was extractable from chromatin with 0.4 N H2SO4 or 3 M NaCl/7 M urea, but unlike most non-histone proteins or histone 1, protein A24 was not extracted with 0.35 M NaCl, 0.5 M HClO4, or 0.6 M NaCl. Protein A24 was present in only 1.9% of the total amount of histones 2A, 2B, 3 and 4; its molecular weight is 27,000."
https://openalex.org/W2077113765,"Hairless albino mice with squamous cell carcinoma were exposed to a mixture of 2.5 percent oxygen and 97.5 percent hydrogen at a total pressure of 8 atmospheres for periods up to 2 weeks in order to see if a free radical decay catalyzer, such as hydrogen, would cause a regression of the skin tumors. Marked aggression of the tumors was found, leading to the possibility that hyperbaric hydrogen therapy might also prove to be of significance in the treatment of other types of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1554616255,"We have studied the structures of adducts formed between subtilisin BPN' and both benzeneboronic acid and 2-phenylethaneboronic acid by x-ray diffraction techniques. Electron density and difference maps at 2.5 A resolution were computed with phases calculated from a partially refined structure of the native enzyme (R = 0.23 at 2.0 A). Both adducts contain a covalent bond between Ogamma of the catalytic Ser-221 and the inhibitor boron atom. The boron atom is coordinated tetrahedrally, with one of the two additional boronic acid oxygen atoms lying in the oxyanion hole and the other at the leaving group site identified in previous studies (ROBERTUS, J.D., Kraut, J. ALDEN, R.A., and BIRKTOFT, J.J. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 4293-4303). Moreover, the previously postulated structure of the tetrahedral intermediate for substrate hydrolysis is isosteric with these boronic acid adducts, which can therefore be considered good models for the transition state complex (KOEHLER, K.K., and LIENHARD, G.E. (1972) Biochemistry 10, 2477-2483). These observations further support the suggestion that an important contribution to stabilization of this transition state complex, relative to both the Michaelis complex and the acyl intermediate, occurs as a consequence of hydrogen bond donation to the substrate carbonyl oxygen atom from the side chain amido group of Asn-155 and from the backbone amido group of Ser-221."
https://openalex.org/W2040667254,"ABOUT 99% of all carbon is the 12C isotope while 1% is 13C. The precise ratio of the isotopes will vary depending on the material analysed. In plants, fractionation of carbon is brought about primarily by carbon dioxide assimilation in photosynthesis and is due to preferential utilisation of 12C and exclusion of 13C. Curiously enough, it has been found recently1,2 that higher plants which fix carbon dioxide by way of the Calvin C3 cycle pathway differ in 13C/12C ratios from plants which fix carbon dioxide through the C4-dicarboxylic acid pathway. Temperate pasture species fix carbon by way of the Calvin pathway and have 13C/12C ratios of approximately −28‰ (ref. 3 and M.M.L., J.H.T., and R. J. Jones, unpublished), whereas tropical pasture grasses fix carbon through the C4-dicarboxylic acid pathway4 and have 13C/12C ratios of approximately −12‰ (ref. 2 and M.M.L., J.H.T., and R.J.J., unpublished). 13C/12C ratios are expressed relative to a carbonate standard5."
https://openalex.org/W1966648082,"Lesions of the subfornical organ (SFO) severely attenuated drinking induced by injections of angiotensin II into the lateral ventricles, but a few days (4 to 14) later a recovery of the drinking response is observed. A possible explanation for this is that other dipsogenic sites are involved which are beyond the interventricular foramen and that SFO lesions produce an obstruction by edema or debris at the foramen which blocks access of cerebrospinal fluid-borne angiotensin to those sites. This hypothesis is supported by tracer studies and by direct injection into the third ventricle of SFO-lesioned animals. Other studies reported implicate the anteroventral third ventricle as a likely site for angiotensin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1503960664,"The reduction of highly purified cytochrome P-450 from rabbit liver microsomes under anaerobic conditions requires 2 electrons per molecule. Similar results were obtained with dithionite, NADPH in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, or a photochemical system as the electron donor, with CO or other ligands, with substrate or phosphatidylcholine present, after denaturation to form cytochrome P-420, or with cytochrome P-450 partially purified from rat or mouse liver microsomes. The reduced cytochrome P-450 donates 2 electrons to dichlorophenolindophenol or to cytochrome c. Reoxidation of reduced cytochrome P-450 by molecular oxygen restores a state where 2 electrons from dithionite are required for re-reduction. Although these unexpected findings indicate the presence of an electron acceptor in addition to the heme iron atom, significant amounts of non-heme iron, other metals or cofactors, or disulfide bonds were not found, and free radicals were not detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. Resolution of the cytochrome with acetone and acid yielded the apoenzyme, which did not accept electrons, and ferriprotoporphyrin IX, which accepted a single electron. A reconstituted hemoprotein preparation with the spectral characteristics of cytochrome P-420 accepted as much as 0.7 extra electron equivalent per heme. The midpoint oxidation-reduction potential of purified cytochrome P-450 from rabbit liver microsomes at pH 7.0 is -330 mv, and with CO present this value is changed to about -150 mv. The oxidation-reduction potential is unaffected by the presence of phosphatidylcholine or benzphetamine, a typical substrate. Laurate, aminopyrine, and benzphetamine undergo hydroxylation in the presence of chemically reduced cytochrome P-450 and molecular oxygen. Neither NADPH nor the reductase is required for substrate hydroxylation under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2082513053,Extracts of human carcinomas from lung and breast contain a protein which binds retinoic acid (vitamin A acid) with high specificity. The binding protein was not detected in normal lung or breast tissue from the same patients.

https://openalex.org/W2024277745,"Rhesus monkeys inhibited their feeding in response to intragastric nutrient preloads, so as to maintain a constant caloric intake. There is a definite dose- response relationship to calories which does not depend on the volume, caloric concentration, or nature of the nutrient. This accurate control is accomplished even though some of the preload remains in the stomach throughout the feeding period."

https://openalex.org/W1487847619,"Binding and degradation of GTP and guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p by plasma membranes from rat liver and fat cells were investigated. Gpp(NH)p is hydrolyzed predominantly by nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolases in the membranes, whereas GTP is hydrolyzed primarily by nucleotide phosphohydrolases. These enzymes are not specific for the guanine nucleotides since co-addition of the analogous adenine nucleotides spares their hydrolysis. Both Gpp(NH)p and GTP are taken up by the membranes at sites which, to the extent that high concentrations of the corresponding adenine nucleotides fail to inhibit uptake, appear to be specific for guanine nucleotides. Gpp(NH)p taken up at these sites remains essentially intact irrespective of the degree of hydrolysis of unbound Gpp(NH)p by nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolases, indicating that the binding siteis incapable of degrading Gpp(NH)p. GTP and GDP inhibit competitively the binding of Gpp(NH)p; the binding constants for the three nucleotides are similar (0.1 to 0.4 muM) and are in the same range required for their effects on adenylate cyclase activity. Binding of the nucleotides is inhibited by sulfhydryl agents, suggesting that a sulfhydryl group is involved in the binding process. In contrast to binding of Gpp(NH)p, uptake of GTP is accompanied by substantial hydrolysis, primarily to GDP, under incubation conditions (high [ATP] plus ATP regenerating system) in which [GTP] in the medium remains essentially constant. GDP bound to the membranes is progressively hydrolyzed to 5'-GMP. Thus, GTP and Gpp(NH)p, although binding to the same specific sites, are differentially susceptible to hydrolysis at their terminal phosphates when bound to these sites. These findings are discussed in terms of the markedly different potencies of GTP and Gpp(NH)p as activators of adenylate cyclase systems."

https://openalex.org/W2137762997,"Electrolytic lesions in a circumscribed area of the rostral midbrain of rats shortened the inhibitory period following ejaculation, thereby increasing the number of ejaculations achieved in 1-hour tests. These lesions also interrupted the dorsal norepinephrine bundle as reflected in a 63 percent reduction in telencephalic or cortical norepinephrine."
https://openalex.org/W1993138129,"A dihydropyridine-pyridine type redox system was successfully applied for delivering a quaternary pyridinium salt, N-methylpyridinium-2-aldoxime chloride (2-PAM), through the blood-brain barrier. The dihydropyridine derivative of 2-PAM was quickly oxidized to 2-PAM after crossing the blood-brain barrier. As a result of this approach, the brain cholinesterase blocked by organophosphates could be reactivated. The new method should be useful in delivering numerous drugs which are otherwise inaccessible to the brain because of their polar ionic character."
https://openalex.org/W1549429781,"During the excitation of muscle the estimated rate of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum may increase 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold compared with relaxed muscle or isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum in vitro, implying a major change in the calcium permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. As a first step in the assessment of the role of various membrane constituents in the regulation of calcium fluxes, the contribution of phospholipids to the definition of calcium permeability was studied in model systems. The rate of calcium release from vesicles prepared from pure phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositides, cardiolipin, and extracted microsomal lipids is in the range of 10(-15) to 10(18) mol of calcium/cm2/s. This rate is several orders of magnitude lower than the passive calcium outflux from isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The permeability to Ca2+ is influenced by fatty acid composition and net charge and it is markedly increased with increasing temperature or after the addition of local anesthetics."

https://openalex.org/W2042829976,Mouse strain differences suggest intermediate or multifactorial gentic control of chloroform-induced renal toxicity and death. The chloroform dose lethal to 50 percent of animals was four times higher in C57BL/6J males than in DBA/2J males. Twice as much chloroform accumulated in the kidneys of the sensitive as the resistant strain. First generation offspring were midway between parental strains for both parameters.

https://openalex.org/W2037375997,The number of mite species using cricetid rodents in North America is related to the host distributional areas. The age and latitude of the distributional areas have unimportant effects on the number of mite species using a rodent species. The relation between species and areas is analogous to species equilibrium numbers of island faunas.
https://openalex.org/W1494211741,"Affinity chromatography on Sepharose-fetuin columns was used in a single step procedure to isolate the lectins concanavalin A, Favin, phytohemagglutinin, wheat germ agglutinin, and Limulus hemagglutinin. New lectins with unknown binding specificities were also purified by the same procedure from extracts of small California white beans, Idaho red beans, and white pea beans. The purified lectins exhibited different cell surface mapping properties on erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and sperm cells. It was particularly striking that neither 131I-labeled concanavalin nor 125I-labeled wheat germ agglutinin had any effect on the binding of the other to mouse spleen cells. In accord with this observation, gel electrophoretic analysis of radiolabeled lymphocyte receptors for these two lecithins yielded different patterns. These results indicate that highly purified lectins prepared by affinity chromatography on the same adsorbent can possess strikingly different binding specificities for cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1555013217,"Microsomes from rat liver were extracted by low ionic strength solutions. Extracted microsomes lost most of the linoleic acid desaturation activity. The addition of the extract back into the extracted microsomes was necessary to restore full desaturation activity. The soluble fraction had no desaturation activity. The existence of a soluble factor loosely bound to the microsomes, stable to sonication, and unstable to heat and trypsin digestion was recognized. This protein could not be replaced by albumin. The factor was also essential for the oxidative desaturation of palmitic, stearic, linoleic, and gamma-linolenic acid. The present experiment suggests that the protein factor is not NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, or the cyanide-sensitive factor."
https://openalex.org/W1967033506,"We have succeeded in growing a Tetrahymena mutant without food vacuoles in growth media supplemented with vitamins and heavy-metal salts. This finding implies the existence of adequate alternative routes of entry for every required nutrient, and clearly indicates that the food vacuole in Tetrahymena is a dispensable cellular organelle. The growth of the mutant without food vacuoles makes available a valuable experimental tool."

https://openalex.org/W1496333107,"Orotidylate decarboxylase has been purified approximately 300-fold from human erythrocytes. It was shown to exist in three molecular weight forms, a probable monomer of molecular weight 62,000, a dimer, and a tetramer. Conversion of the monomer to higher molecular weight forms was associated with increased stability to thermal inactivation and was promoted by a number of low molecular weight compounds, including orotic acid and competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Orotic acid phosphoribosyltransferase co-purified with the decarboxylase but was much more susceptible to inactivation. The partially purified orotidylate decarboxylase showed a triphasic Lineweaver-Burk plot when examined over a wide range of substrate concentrations. The separated molecular weight forms gave linear double reciprocal plots with Km values corresponding to the three values obtained with the erythrocyte enzyme preparation. The values obtained were 25, 3, and 0.6 muM for the monomer, dimer, and tetramer forms, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1525206651,"Thyroglobulin obtained from guinea pigs was examined by Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after reduction and alkylation. In contrast to thyroglobulin from other mammalian sources, only three groups of polypeptide chains accounted for 95% or more of the protein. Determinations of the molecular weights of these purified proteins by equilibrium centrifugation in 6 M guanidine HCl gave values of 295,000 (species A), 210,000 (species B), and 110,000 (species C). Molecular weights determined by gel filtration in 6 M guanidine HCl gave similar results. Due to the large size of the polypeptides, satisfactory molecular weights could not be obtained from Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid analysis of the three species was similar to that of whole thyroglobulin. Only slightly higher level of lysine and histidine and a lower level of glutamic acid were seen in species C. The iodine contents were found to range from 0.07 to 0.12 to 0.20% for species A, B, and C, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2051101485,"Patterns of nocturnal excretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were investigated in 11 girls. Autoregressive digital filtering of low- and high-frequency variations was used to make patterns more apparent. Coincident FSH and LH surges, separated by an interval of 20 to 40 days, were seen in specimens from three of six postmenarcheal girls and three to five premenarcheal girls. This suggests that cyclic hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian interactions occur before menarche."

The agreement with experimental results in the temperature range from 1 to 20 K, including an anomaly near 8 K, is the best obtained thus far for homopolypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1607177380,"A number of cytokinin analogs containing modifications in the heterocyclic moiety were prepared. These compounds were tested for activity as cytokinins and anticytokinins in the tabacco bioassay and the results were used to determine whether any position(s) of the heterocyclic nucleus of cytokinins may require derivatization as part of an over-all activation process. 3-substituted 4-alkylaminopyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidines and 4-alkylaminopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines, for example, have (substituted) carbon rather than nitrogen atoms at positions 3 and 5, respectively (analogous to position 7 in purines) and would be predicted to be metabolically stable at these positions. The finding that these compounds had cytokinin activity suggested that modification at the metabolically stable positions. The finding that these compounds had cytokinin activity suggested that modification at the metabolically stable position, and by extension at position 7 in cytokinin analogues which are purines, is not a prerequisite for the expression of cytokinin activity. Similar consideration of other heterocyclic analogs which have cytokinin activity suggests that the active form of a cytokinin can be the exogenous compound itself. Certain structural analogs of cytokinins were found to inhibit the growth of tobacco callus promoted by 6-(3-methyl-2-butenylamino)purine. These compounds were studied as potential cytokinin antagonists, i.e. having activity analogous to the 7-alkylamino-3-methylpyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidines (Hecht, S. M., 2068-2610; Skoog, F., Schmitz, R.Y., Hecht, S.M., and Bock, R. M. (1973) Phytochemistry 12, 25-37). The activity of these compounds is discussed and criteria are proposed to distinguish between those species which are specific anticytokinins and those which otherwise inhibit growth."
https://openalex.org/W1568047910,"In normal lung growth, post-pneumonectomy lung growth, and in possibly several lung disorders, there are marked alterations in the density of collagen and changes in the rate of synthesis of collagen relative to the synthesis of other lung proteins. To provide a technology to begin to understand these changes at the molecular level, polysomes were prepared from rabbit lung and translated in a heterologous cell-free system including rabbit reticulocyte 0.5 M KCl ribosomal wash fraction and liver tRNA. Collagen was shown in the cell-free product by collagenase sensitivity, hydroxylation of incorporated proline by peptidyl prolyl hydroxylase, agarose gel chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cell-free system was optimized with respect to K+, Mg2+, amino acids, and ribosomal wash fraction and used under conditions where total protein synthesis and collagen synthesis are linear with respect to time and amount of polysomes. Under these conditions, collagen synthesis was directed almost entirely by polysomes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. Polysomes isolated from late fetal lung directed collagen synthesis at twice the rate (per polysome) as those polysomes isolated from adult lung. Similar changes were seen if lung tRNA replaced liver tRNA and if lung ribosomal wash fraction replaced reticulocyte wash fraction. Although these changes in cell-free lung collagen synthesis with tissue explants, further studies will have to be carried out to determine whether, in fact, age-related alterations in control of lung collagen synthesis are truly explained by these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1997445800,"IN spite of growing interest in the function of skin glands in mammalian chemical communication1,2, little is known of either the chemical nature or the behavioural significance of the secretion of the supracaudal (tail) scent gland of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). A recent paper3 reports observations concerning the histology and histochemistry of this gland, including findings of unusual fluorescent sebum constituents. In this paper, preliminary gas chromatographic–mass spectrometric data are presented indicating the presence of dihydroactinidiolide (I) and related compounds in this secretion and the significance of this finding is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1496845128,"The results of a double isotope experiment using 3H- and 14C-labeled leucine as precursors of protein synthesis demonstrated that the aldolase C to A subunit transition which is associated with chick skeletal muscle development involves the preferential synthesis of different aldolase isoenzymes. This developmental system was used to test for subunit exchange between aldolase tetramers in vivo. In a second double isotope experiment, it was found that the 14C:3H ratios of A and C subunits derived from the same heterotetramer were essentially identical, while the isotope ratios of the same subunit type derived from different isoenzymes were considerably different. Had subunit exchange between the isoenzymes occurred, A subunits of a given heterotetramer would have been expected to have higher isotope ratios than the corresponding C subunits. Therefore, these data suggest that subunit exchange between aldolase tetramers does not occur in vivo, at least not in skeletal muscle to an appreciable extent. The results of the present study suggest that all aldolase tetramers are constructed at the time of the initial assembly of newly synthesized subunits, that is, new tetramers would not be generated by subunit exchange between already constructed tetramers. In addition, the present work suggests that the degradation of all four subunits of an aldolase tetramer are coupled inasmuch as the subunits would not be reincorporated into other tetramers. Thus, in contrast to some other proteins, it appears that the subunits of the aldolase tetramer turn over coordinately."

https://openalex.org/W1542899092,"The amino acid sequences of chick skin alpha1-CB4 and alpha1-CB5 have been determined by automated Edman degradation of the intact peptides and of their tryptic and chymotryptic peptides. The two peptides contain 47 and 37 residues and comprise residues 56 to 102 and 103 to 139, respectively, of the alpha1(I) chain. In addition, alpha1-CB5 is the major hexose-containing peptide, previously reported to be active in mediating platelet aggregation. A comparison of the sequence with previously reported data on the homologous region of the rat skin alpha1(I) chain indicates that there are only three interspecies differences, or a sequence identity of 96%."
https://openalex.org/W1609959265,"As determined by equilibrium dialysis, bovine liver argininosuccinase of molecular weight 202,000 binds 4 mol of argininosuccinate or arginine/mol of enzyme. Negative homotropic interactions occur in the binding of both ligands at 0.15 ionic strength in the presence of phosphate. Argininosuccinate binds to two sites (Kdiss 1.6 times 10(-5) M) and four sites (Kdiss 2.9 times 10(-4) M) at low and high substrate concentration. Similarly, arginine binds to two sites (Kdiss 4.9 times 10(-4) M), and four sites (Kdiss 1.6 times 10(-3) M). At 0.05 ionic strength in Tris-HCl buffer, the four enzyme sites bind argininosuccinate independently and arginine binding remains negatively cooperative. Kinetic analysis gave double reciprocal plots that showed negative cooperatively also. The changes in Km were analogous to changes in Kdiss, thus indicating that the substrate binding sites correspond to catalytic sites. Since the catalytically active enzyme is a tetramer composed of four identical or closely similar subunits (Lusty, C.J., and Ratner, S. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7010-7022), the present results show that each subunit contains one catalytic site. Ionic strength, phosphate ions, and GTP have each been found to influence negative cooperatively through a change in the affinity for argininosuccinate. The significance of the negative homotropic interactions and of the specific stimulation of activity by GTP is discussed with respect to different conformational forms of the enzyme and the in vivo regulation of argininosuccinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1525813213,"Lysine monooxygenase catalyzes the oxygenation of lysine and arginine, and produces delta-amino-n-valeramide and gamma-guanidinobutyramide, respectively, concomitant with decarboxylation. In a preliminary communication, treatment of the native enzyme with p-chloromercuribenzoate was shown to inactivate the oxygenase and to induce an oxidase activity. The modified enzyme catalyzed predominantly the oxidative deamination of lysine and arginine resulting in the formation of the corresponding alpha-keto acid, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide (YAMAUCHI, T., YAMAMOTO, S., and HAYAISHI, O.(1973) J. Biol. Chem. 2j8, 3750-3752). Paper electrophoresis, cellulose thin layer chromatography, and chemical degradation of the reaction products from lysine and arginine, provided further evidence for their identity with alpha-keto-epsilon-aminocaproate and alpha-keto-delta-guanidinovalerate, respectively. Further studies were carried out to establish the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in this conversion of the enzyme activities. Various sulfhydryl reagents including certain mercurials, alkylating, and oxidizing reagents, showed essentially identical effects on the enzyme. Dithiothreitol treatment reversed the conversion produced by various mercurials; the oxidase activity disappeared and the oxygenase activity was recovered. When p-chloromercuribenzoate was added to the enzyme and the increase in the absorbance at 250 nm was followed, 3.6 of the 6.5 half-cystine residues present per enzyme-bound FAD were readily titrated within 3 to 4 min. The inactivation of the oxygenase and the induction of the oxidase activity were almost maximal with 4 to 5 mol of p-chloromercuribenzoate/mol of enzyme, and these effects occurred within 3 to 4 min. These results together with other properties of the modified enzyme provided evidence for a possible involvement of these reactive sulfhydryl groups during the conversion of the oxygenase to an oxidase."
