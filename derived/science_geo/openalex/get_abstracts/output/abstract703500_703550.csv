https://openalex.org/W4307905659,"When challenged by hypertonicity, dehydrated cells must recover their volume to survive. This process requires the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SLC12 cation chloride transporters by WNK kinases, but how these kinases are activated by cell shrinkage remains unknown. Within seconds of cell exposure to hypertonicity, WNK1 concentrates into membraneless condensates, initiating a phosphorylation-dependent signal that drives net ion influx via the SLC12 cotransporters to restore cell volume. WNK1 condensate formation is driven by its intrinsically disordered C terminus, whose evolutionarily conserved signatures are necessary for efficient phase separation and volume recovery. This disorder-encoded phase behavior occurs within physiological constraints and is activated in vivo by molecular crowding rather than changes in cell size. This allows kinase activity despite an inhibitory ionic milieu and permits cell volume recovery through condensate-mediated signal amplification. Thus, WNK kinases are physiological crowding sensors that phase separate to coordinate a cell volume rescue response."
https://openalex.org/W4307905272,"Human brain development is underpinned by cellular and molecular reconfigurations continuing into the third decade of life. To reveal cell dynamics orchestrating neural maturation, we profiled human prefrontal cortex gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution from gestation to adulthood. Integrative analyses define the dynamic trajectories of each cell type, revealing major gene expression reconfiguration at the prenatal-to-postnatal transition in all cell types followed by continuous reconfiguration into adulthood and identifying regulatory networks guiding cellular developmental programs, states, and functions. We uncover links between expression dynamics and developmental milestones, characterize the diverse timing of when cells acquire adult-like states, and identify molecular convergence from distinct developmental origins. We further reveal cellular dynamics and their regulators implicated in neurological disorders. Finally, using this reference, we benchmark cell identities and maturation states in organoid models. Together, this captures the dynamic regulatory landscape of human cortical development."

https://openalex.org/W4307935333,"Many humans live in large, complex political centers, composed of multi-scalar communities including neighborhoods and districts. Both today and in the past, neighborhoods form a fundamental part of cities and are defined by their spatial, architectural, and material elements. Neighborhoods existed in ancient centers of various scales, and multiple methods have been employed to identify ancient neighborhoods in archaeological contexts. However, the use of different methods for neighborhood identification within the same spatiotemporal setting results in challenges for comparisons within and between ancient societies. Here, we focus on using a single method-combining Average Nearest Neighbor (ANN) and Kernel Density (KD) analyses of household groups-to identify potential neighborhoods based on clusters of households at 23 ancient centers across the Maya Lowlands. While a one-size-fits all model does not work for neighborhood identification everywhere, the ANN/KD method provides quantifiable data on the clustering of ancient households, which can be linked to environmental zones and urban scale. We found that centers in river valleys exhibited greater household clustering compared to centers in upland and escarpment environments. Settlement patterns on flat plains were more dispersed, with little discrete spatial clustering of households. Furthermore, we categorized the ancient Maya centers into discrete urban scales, finding that larger centers had greater variation in household spacing compared to medium-sized and smaller centers. Many larger political centers possess heterogeneity in household clustering between their civic-ceremonial cores, immediate hinterlands, and far peripheries. Smaller centers exhibit greater household clustering compared to larger ones. This paper quantitatively assesses household clustering among nearly two dozen centers across the Maya Lowlands, linking environment and urban scale to settlement patterns. The findings are applicable to ancient societies and modern cities alike; understanding how humans form multi-scalar social groupings, such as neighborhoods, is fundamental to human experience and social organization."

https://openalex.org/W4307934592,"This paper proposes an improvement to the dwarf mongoose optimization (DMO) algorithm called the advanced dwarf mongoose optimization (ADMO) algorithm. The improvement goal is to solve the low convergence rate limitation of the DMO. This situation arises when the initial solutions are close to the optimal global solution; the subsequent value of the alpha must be small for the DMO to converge towards a better solution. The proposed improvement incorporates other social behavior of the dwarf mongoose, namely, the predation and mound protection and the reproductive and group splitting behavior to enhance the exploration and exploitation ability of the DMO. The ADMO also modifies the lifestyle of the alpha and subordinate group and the foraging and seminomadic behavior of the DMO. The proposed ADMO was used to solve the congress on evolutionary computation (CEC) 2011 and 2017 benchmark functions, consisting of 30 classical and hybrid composite problems and 22 real-world optimization problems. The performance of the ADMO, using different performance metrics and statistical analysis, is compared with the DMO and seven other existing algorithms. In most cases, the results show that solutions achieved by the ADMO are better than the solution obtained by the existing algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4307935088,"Standardized cross-cultural databases of the arts are critical to a balanced scientific understanding of the performing arts, and their role in other domains of human society. This paper introduces the Global Jukebox as a resource for comparative and cross-cultural study of the performing arts and culture. The Global Jukebox adds an extensive and detailed global database of the performing arts that enlarges our understanding of human cultural diversity. Initially prototyped by Alan Lomax in the 1980s, its core is the Cantometrics dataset, encompassing standardized codings on 37 aspects of musical style for 5,776 traditional songs from 1,026 societies. The Cantometrics dataset has been cleaned and checked for reliability and accuracy, and includes a full coding guide with audio training examples ( https://theglobaljukebox.org/?songsofearth ). Also being released are seven additional datasets coding and describing instrumentation, conversation, popular music, vowel and consonant placement, breath management, social factors, and societies. For the first time, all digitized Global Jukebox data are being made available in open-access, downloadable format ( https://github.com/theglobaljukebox ), linked with streaming audio recordings (theglobaljukebox.org) to the maximum extent allowed while respecting copyright and the wishes of culture-bearers. The data are cross-indexed with the Database of Peoples, Languages, and Cultures (D-PLACE) to allow researchers to test hypotheses about worldwide coevolution of aesthetic patterns and traditions. As an example, we analyze the global relationship between song style and societal complexity, showing that they are robustly related, in contrast to previous critiques claiming that these proposed relationships were an artifact of autocorrelation (though causal mechanisms remain unresolved)."
https://openalex.org/W4307930389,"Accurately counting the human cost of the COVID-19 at both the national and regional level is a policy priority. The Russian Federation currently reports one of the higher COVID-19 mortality rates in the world; but estimates of mortality differ significantly. Using a statistical method accounting for changes in the population age structure, we present the first national and regional estimates of excess mortality for 2021; calculations of excess mortality by age, gender, and urban/rural status for 2020; and mean remaining years of life expectancy lost at the regional level. We estimate that there were 351,158 excess deaths in 2020 and 678,022 in 2021 in the Russian Federation; and, in 2020, around 2.0 years of life expectancy lost. While the Russian Federation exhibits very high levels of excess mortality compared to other countries, there is a wide degree of regional variation: in 2021, excess deaths expressed as a percentage of expected deaths at the regional level range from 27% to 52%. Life expectancy loss is generally greater for males; while excess mortality is greater in urban areas. For Russia as whole, an average person who died due to the pandemic in 2020 would have otherwise lived for a further 14 more years (and as high as 18 years in some regions), disproving the widely held view that excess mortality during the pandemic period was concentrated among those with few years of life remaining–especially for females. At a regional level, less densely populated, more remote regions, rural regions appear to have fared better regarding excess mortality and life expectancy loss–however, a part of this differential could be owing to measurement issues. The calculations demonstrate more clearly the true degree of the human cost of the pandemic in the Russian Federation."
https://openalex.org/W4307931836,"Using data from all those born in a single week in 1958 in Britain we track associations between short pain and chronic pain in mid-life (age 44) and subsequent health, wellbeing and labor market outcomes in later life. We focus on data taken at age 50 in 2008, when the Great Recession hit and then five years later at age 55 in 2013 and again at age 62 in 2021 during the Covid pandemic. We find those suffering both short-term and chronic pain at age 44 continue to report pain and poor general health in their 50s and 60s. However, the associations are much stronger for those with chronic pain. Furthermore, chronic pain at age 44 is associated with a range of poor mental health outcomes, pessimism about the future and joblessness at age 55 whereas short-duration pain at age 44 is not. Pain has strong predictive power for pain later in life: pain in childhood predicts pain in mid-life, even when one controls for pain in early adulthood. Pain appears to reflect other vulnerabilities as we find that chronic pain at age 44 predicts whether or not a respondent has Covid nearly twenty years later."
https://openalex.org/W4307931510,"Objectives To quantify the burnout and spiritual health of general practitioners (GPs) in the United Kingdom (UK) who worked during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Design Online survey, April/May 2021, distributed via emails to general practices, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), Health boards, Clinical Research Networks, professional groups, social media GP groups and networks. Setting United Kingdom. Participants 1318 GPs who had worked in the National Health Service (NHS) during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 –May 2021). Main outcome measures Burnout scores, measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) for Medical Personnel; spiritual health, measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Spiritual Well-Being, Non-Illness (FACIT-SP-NI). Results 19% of surveyed GPs were at the highest risk for burnout, using accepted MBI ‘cut off’ levels. There was no evidence of a difference in burnout by gender, ethnicity, or length of service. GP burnout was associated with GP spiritual health, regardless of identification with a religion. GPs with low spiritual health were five times more likely to be in the highest risk group for burnout. Conclusions Burnout is at crisis levels amongst GPs in the UK NHS. A comprehensive response is required, identifying protective and precipitating factors for burnout. The potentially protective impact of spiritual health merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4307935388,"Electron Impact Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (EI-GC-MS) and High Resolution Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HR-LC-MS) have been used in the analysis of products arising from the trichloroethoxycarbonylation of fentanyl and acetylfentanyl in urine and plasma matrices. The method involves the initial extraction of both synthetic opioids separately from the matrices followed by detection of the unique products that arise from their reaction with 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl chloride (Troc-Cl), namely Troc-norfentanyl and Troc-noracetylfentanyl. The optimized protocol was successfully evaluated for its efficacy at detecting these species formed from fentanyl and acetylfentanyl when present at low and high levels in urine (fentanyl: 5 and 10 ng/mL and acetylfentanyl: 20 and 100 ng/mL) and plasma (fentanyl: 10 and 20 ng/mL and acetylfentanyl: 50 and 200 ng/mL), values that reflect levels reported in overdose victims. The HR-LC-MS method's LOQ (limit of quantitation) for the Troc-norfentanyl and Troc-noracetylfentanyl products was determined to be ~10 ng/mL for both species. Even though the superiority in the detection of these species by HR-LC-MS over EI-GC-MS, the latter method proved to be important in the detection of the second product from the reaction, namely 2-phenylethyl chloride that is crucial in the determination of the original opioid. This observation highlights the importance of using complimentary analytical techniques in the analysis of a sample, whether biological or environmental in nature. The method herein serves as a complementary, qualitative confirmation for the presence of a fentanyl in collected urine, plasma and by extension other biological samples amenable to the common extraction procedures described for opioid analysis. More importantly, the method's main strength comes from its ability to react with unknown fentanyls to yield products that can be not only detected by EI-GC-MS and HR-LC-MS but can then be used to retrospectively identify an unknown fentanyl."

https://openalex.org/W4307930306,"An important step to achieve greater financial inclusion is to increase the acceptance and usage of digital payments. Although consumer adoption of digital payments has improved dramatically globally, the acceptance and usage of digital payments for micro, small, and medium-sized retailers (MSMRs) remain challenging. Using random forest estimation, we identify 14 key predictors out of 190 variables with the largest predictive power for MSMR adoption and usage of digital payments. Using conditional inference trees, we study the importance of sequencing and interactions of various factors such as public policy initiatives, technological advancements, and private sector incentives. We find that in countries with low POS terminal adoption, killer applications such as mobile phone payment apps increase the likelihood of P2B digital transactions. We also find the likelihood of digital P2B payments at MSMRs increases when MSMRs pay their employees and suppliers digitally. The level of ownership of basic financial accounts by consumers and the size of the shadow economy are also important predictors of greater adoption and usage of digital payments. Using causal forest estimation, we find a positive and economically significant marginal effect for merchant and consumer fiscal incentives on POS terminal adoption on average. When countries implement financial inclusion initiatives, POS terminal adoption increases significantly and MSMRs' share of P2B digital payments also increases. Merchant and consumer fiscal incentives also increase MSMRs' share of P2B electronic payments."
https://openalex.org/W4307930388,"Approximately 80% of the population residing in sub-Saharan Africa relies on Traditional Medicine (TM). However, literature on factors motivating the use of TM for children under the age of five in these settings is limited. Such information can guide policy formulation for integration of TM into mainstream health care services. This study aimed to describe the motivation on use of TM among caregivers of children residing in rural and urban communities in western Kenya.The socio-behavioral sciences (SBS) arm of the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) program in western Kenya, conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study in Manyatta-an urban informal settlement located in Kisumu town and Karemo-a rural setting in Siaya County. We performed 29 in-depth interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 11 semi-structured interviews with community representatives (n = 53), health workers (n = 17), and community leaders (n = 18). All the participants were purposively sampled. We performed thematic analysis using both inductive and deductive approaches. Data management was completed on Nvivo 11.0 software (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia).Our findings reveal that some caregivers prefer TM to treat some childhood diseases. Use of TM was informed by illness beliefs about etiology of disease. We observed an appreciation from the study participants that malaria can effectively be treated by Conventional Medicine (CM) while TM was preferred to treat measles and diseases believed to be associated with supernatural etiology such as witchcraft, evil spirit or breaching cultural taboos. TM was also used in instances where CM failed to provide a diagnosis or when CM was 'slow'. TM in such cases was used as a last resort.We observed varied beliefs that motivate caregivers' choice of TM use among children in western Kenya. It is therefore crucial to consider perceptions and socio-cultural beliefs about illnesses when formulating interventions that are geared towards child health."

Forty human mandibular first premolars were selected. After smear layer removal, the samples were divided into 4 groups and irrigated with experimental solutions for 1 min and later with distilled water. G1: Cinnamomum zeylanicum (CZ) in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); G2: Sodium hypochlorite 2.5%; G3: Sodium hypochlorite in MIC; G4: Cuminum cyminum (CC) in MIC. After obturation, the roots were sectioned in order to obtain 1-mm discs for push-out assessment. The push-out test was performed using a universal testing machine. The slices were examined using a stereomicroscope at 30× to determine the mode of failure. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s post-hoc test. The teeth irrigated with CZ showed significantly lower push-out resistance than those irrigated with NaOCl 2.5% and NaOCl at MIC. The other groups had no significant difference. The modes of failure were predominantly mixed. Under the limitations of the present study, CC does not have adverse effects on the bond strength of AH Plus and can be used as a good alternative for currently used final irrigants."
https://openalex.org/W4307935320,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the physical and mental health of the public. Nevertheless, the presence of green and blue spaces has been shown to be able to encourage physical activities and alleviate the mental distress caused by COVID-19. However, just as the impact of COVID-19 varies by geographical region and area, the distribution of green and blue spaces is also different across different neighborhoods and areas. By using Hong Kong as the study area, we determine the local neighborhoods that suffer from both high COVID-19 infection risk as well as low green and blue space accessibility. The results show that some of the poorest neighborhoods in the territory such as Sham Shui Po, Kwun Tong and Wong Tai Sin are also among the most doubly disadvantaged in terms of COVID-19 infection risk as well as green and blue space accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W4307935397,"Based on an exhaustive database of gastropod genera and subgenera during the Triassic–Jurassic transition, origination and extinction percentages and resulting diversity changes are calculated, with a particular focus on the end-Triassic mass extinction event. We show that gastropods suffered a loss of 56% of genera and subgenera during this event, which was higher than the average of marine life (46.8%). Among molluscs, gastropods were more strongly affected than bivalves (43.4%) but less than ammonoids, which were nearly annihilated. However, there were also pronounced differences among gastropod subclasses. The most strongly affected subclass was the Neritimorphia, which lost 72.7% of their Rhaetian genera; on the other extreme, the Heterobranchia remained nearly unaffected (11% loss). We analysed this extinction pattern with respect to larval development, palaeobiogeography, shell size, and anatomy and found that putative feeding of the pelagic larval stage, adaptation to tropical-temperate water temperatures, and flexibility of the mantle attachment were among the factors that might explain extinction resilience of heterobranchs during the end-Triassic crisis. Among molluscs, extinction magnitude roughly correlates with locomotion activity and thus metabolic rates. We suggest three potential kill mechanisms that could account for these observations: global warming, ocean acidification, and extinction of marine plankton. The end-Triassic extinction of gastropods therefore fits to proposed extinction scenarios for this event, which invoke the magmatic activity of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province as the ultimate cause of death. With respect to gastropods, the effect of the end-Triassic mass extinction was comparable to that of the end-Permian mass extinction. Notably, Heterobranchia was relatively little affected by both events; the extinction resilience of this subclass during times of global environmental changes was therefore possibly a key aspect of their subsequent evolutionary success."
https://openalex.org/W4307834136,"Abstract Neuroblastomas require novel therapies that are based on the exploitation of their biological mechanism. To address this need, we analyzed the DNA methylation and expression datasets of neuroblastomas, extracted a candidate gene characterizing the aggressive features, and conducted functional studies. Based on the DNA methylation data, we identified a subgroup of neuroblastoma cases with 11q loss of heterozygosity with extremely poor prognosis. PHGDH , a serine metabolism-related gene, was extracted as a candidate with strong expression and characteristic methylation in this subgroup as well as in cases with MYCN amplification. PHGDH inhibition suppressed neuroblastoma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the inhibition of serine metabolism by PHGDH inhibitors is a therapeutic alternative for neuroblastoma. Inhibiting the arginine metabolism, which is closely related to serine metabolism using arginine deiminase, had a combination effect both in vitro and in vivo, especially on extracellular arginine-dependent neuroblastoma cells with ASS1 deficiency. Expression and metabolome analyses of post-dose cells confirmed the synergistic effects of treatments targeting serine and arginine indicated that xCT inhibitors that inhibit cystine uptake could be candidates for further combinatorial treatment. Our results highlight the rational therapeutic strategy of targeting serine/arginine metabolism for intractable neuroblastoma."

This study aims to show the associations between frailty and frailty symptoms.The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is an ongoing longitudinal biannual survey in the United States. Three of the most used frailty diagnoses, defined by the Functional Domains Model, the Burden Model, and the Biologic Syndrome Model, were reproduced according to previous studies. The associations between frailty statuses and input symptoms were assessed using odds ratios and correlation coefficients.The sample sizes, mean ages, and frailty prevalence matched those reported in previous studies. Frailty statuses were weakly correlated with each other (coefficients = 0.19 to 0.38, p < 0.001 for all). There were 49 input symptoms identified by these three models. Frailty statuses defined by the three models were not significantly correlated with one or two symptoms defined by the same models (p > 0.05 for all). One to six symptoms defined by the other two models were not significantly correlated with each of the three frailty statuses (p > 0.05 for all). Frailty statuses were significantly correlated with their own bias variables (p < 0.05 for all).Frailty diagnoses lack significant correlations with some of their own frailty symptoms and some of the frailty symptoms defined by the other two models. This finding raises questions like whether the frailty symptoms lacking significant correlations with frailty statuses could be included to diagnose frailty and whether frailty exists and causes frailty symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4307930378,"This paper aimed to investigate the temperature effect on photovoltaic (PV) cell parameters. The PV cell parameters such as series and parallel resistances, diode ideality factor, and diode saturation current, are not considered in the reported stepwise modeling. The present work aims to improve available models used in the modeling and simulation of PV modules to support the researcher and power project developer. All the required temperature-dependent parameters are determined to model the simulated PV module with high accuracy using Simulink/MATLAB software. To validate the method, a 36-cell-50W solar panel with different radii of curvature is set up to assess solar power outputs under varying irradiance and temperature conditions. For the present application, the Tabuk region (Saudi Arabia) is chosen based on its location and climatic conditions. The method provided conformity to the measured power outputs for varying Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and temperature conditions. The maximum power output of the PV module increases from 14.4 W to 25.8 W when the received solar power density varies from 307 W/m 2 to 526 W/m 2 depending on the level of curvature starting from a semi-cylindrical shape to a vaulted shape to a flat shape. The curved PV module shows slightly higher power variation with temperature as compared to the flat one. Above 25°C, the power output is about 20% less at a maximum temperature of 65°C. When the temperature drops below 25°C, the power outputs increase about 6% and 11.5% for corresponding temperatures of 15°C and 5°C, respectively."

A key contributory factor for a traumatic childbirth experience is women's relationships with maternity care providers.To develop, design and evaluate an immersive educational programme for maternity care providers to raise awareness of traumatic childbirth experiences amongst vulnerable groups, and ultimately to improve women's experiences of childbirth.A critical pedagogical approach that utilised virtual reality (VR) underpinned the design and development of the educational programme. This involved: a) collecting vulnerable/disadvantaged women's experiences of birth via interviews; b) analysing data collected to identify key hotspots for traumatic experiences within interpersonal patient-provider relationships to develop a script; c) filming the script with professional actors creating a first person perspective via VR technology; d) using existing literature to inform the theoretical and reflective aspects of the programme; e) conducting an evaluation of the education programme using pre-and post-evaluation questionnaires and a follow-up focus group.Human Perspective VR was very well received. Participants considered the content to have enhanced their reflective practice and increased their knowledge base regarding contributory factors associated with a traumatic childbirth experience. A need for further work to implement learning into practice was highlighted.While further research is needed to evaluate the impact of the programme, Human Perspective VR programme offers an innovative approach to reflective education and to enhance participants' care practices."

In this study, we built and evaluated the performance of a deep neural network in differentiating between the presence and absence of a lateral spread response, which provides critical information during microvascular decompression surgery for the treatment of hemifacial spasm using intraoperatively acquired electromyography images.A total of 3,674 image screenshots of monitoring devices from 50 patients were prepared, preprocessed, and then adopted into training and validation sets. A deep neural network was constructed using current-standard, off-the-shelf tools. The neural network correctly differentiated 50 test images (accuracy, 100%; area under the curve, 0.96) collected from 25 patients whose data were never exposed to the neural network during training or validation. The accuracy of the network was equivalent to that of the neuromonitoring technologists (p = 0.3013) and higher than that of neurosurgeons experienced in hemifacial spasm (p < 0.0001). Heatmaps obtained to highlight the key region of interest achieved a level similar to that of trained human professionals. Provisional clinical application showed that the neural network was preferable as an auxiliary tool.A deep neural network trained on a dataset of intraoperatively collected electromyography data could classify the presence and absence of the lateral spread response with equivalent performance to human professionals. Well-designated applications based upon the neural network may provide useful auxiliary tools for surgical teams during operations."
https://openalex.org/W4307930856,"An important unmet need revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic is the near-real-time identification of potentially fitness-altering mutations within rapidly growing SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Although powerful molecular sequence analysis methods are available to detect and characterize patterns of natural selection within modestly sized gene-sequence datasets, the computational complexity of these methods and their sensitivity to sequencing errors render them effectively inapplicable in large-scale genomic surveillance contexts. Motivated by the need to analyze new lineage evolution in near-real time using large numbers of genomes, we developed the Rapid Assessment of Selection within CLades (RASCL) pipeline. RASCL applies state of the art phylogenetic comparative methods to evaluate selective processes acting at individual codon sites and across whole genes. RASCL is scalable and produces automatically updated regular lineage-specific selection analysis reports: even for lineages that include tens or hundreds of thousands of sampled genome sequences. Key to this performance is (i) generation of automatically subsampled high quality datasets of gene/ORF sequences drawn from a selected “query” viral lineage; (ii) contextualization of these query sequences in codon alignments that include high-quality “background” sequences representative of global SARS-CoV-2 diversity; and (iii) the extensive parallelization of a suite of computationally intensive selection analysis tests. Within hours of being deployed to analyze a novel rapidly growing lineage of interest, RASCL will begin yielding JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-formatted reports that can be either imported into third-party analysis software or explored in standard web-browsers using the premade RASCL interactive data visualization dashboard. By enabling the rapid detection of genome sites evolving under different selective regimes, RASCL is well-suited for near-real-time monitoring of the population-level selective processes that will likely underlie the emergence of future variants of concern in measurably evolving pathogens with extensive genomic surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W4307931053,"The 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic resulted in more infections and deaths than all prior outbreaks in the 40-year history of this virus combined. This study examines how experiences of EVD infection, and preventive measures such as social distancing, were linked to experiences of stigma and social exclusion among those reintegrating into their communities.Key informant interviews (n = 42) and focus group discussions (n = 27) were conducted in districts with a high prevalence of EVD and representing geographical and ethnic diversity (n = 228 participants). The final sample was composed of adults (52%) and children (48%) who were EVD-infected (46%) and -affected (42%) individuals, and community leaders (12%). Data were coded using a Grounded Theory approach informed by Thematic Content Analysis, and analyzed using NVivo. Interrater reliability was high, with Cohen's κ = 0.80 or higher.Participants described two main sources of EVD-related stress: isolation from the community because of social distancing and other prevention measures such as quarantine, and stigma related to infected or affected status. Participants linked experiences of social isolation and stigma to significant distress and feelings of ostracization. These experiences were particularly pronounced among children. Sources of support included community reintegration over time, and formal community efforts to provide education and establish protection bylaws.This study found that social distancing and EVD-related stigma were each prominent sources of distress among participants. These results suggest that isolation because of infection, and the enduring stigmatization of infected individuals and their families, demand coordinated responses to prevent and mitigate additional psychosocial harm. Such responses should include close engagement with community leaders to combat misinformation and promote community reintegration."

Our critical aim was to investigate whether categorization based on language occurs even when the languages coexist within the same sociolinguistic context, as is the case in bilingual communities. Bilingual individuals of two bilingual communities, the Basque Country (Spain) and Veneto (Italy), were tested using the memory confusion paradigm in a ‘ Who said what ? ’ task. In the encoding part of the task, participants were presented with different faces together with auditory sentences. Two different languages of the sentences were presented in each study, with half of the faces always associated with one language and the other half with the other language. Spanish and Basque languages were used in Study 1, and Italian and Venetian dialect in Study 2. In the test phase, the auditory sentences were presented again and participants were required to decide which face uttered each sentence. As expected, participants error rates were high. Critically, participants were more likely to confuse faces from the same language category than from the other (different) language category. The results indicate that bilinguals categorize individuals belonging to the same sociolinguistic community based on the language these individuals speak, suggesting that social categorization based on language is an automatic process."

HIV stigma in healthcare setting may also discourage people living with HIV (PLHIV) from getting the care needed. Therefore, studying the attitudes of healthcare workers towards PLHIV is important and requires well-constructed measurement tools adapted to the specific cultural context. In our study, we aimed to adapt and re-validate a brief questionnaire on HIV stigma among healthcare workers in Almaty, Kazakhstan. We held focus group discussions to obtain input on an existing questionnaire and surveyed 448 primary healthcare providers to psychometrically evaluate the scale. The final HIV-stigma scale consisted of 15 items, 6 of them measuring negative opinions about PLHIV and the rest assessing stigmatizing health facility policies towards PLHIV. Both HIV-stigma subscales demons6trated adequate psychometric properties (with Cronbach’s alpha α = 0.57 for the first and α = 0.86 for the second subscale, and with factor loadings &gt;0.35 within each subscale). High numbers of respondents holding negative attitudes towards PLHIV, detected in this sample (87%; n = 380), may suggest the need for immediate actions addressing HIV stigma in healthcare in Kazakhstan."

There were 101 surveys returned from the 143 member associations across the world. Many countries reported being caught unaware of the severity of the infection and in some places, midwives were forced to make their own PPE, or reuse single use PPE. Disruption to maternity services meant women had to change their plans for place of birth; and in many countries maternity facilities were closed to become COVID-19 centres. Half of all respondents stated that women were afraid to give birth in hospitals during the pandemic resulting in increased demand for home birth and community midwifery. Midwifery students were denied access to practical or clinical placements and their registration as midwives has been delayed in many countries. More than 50% of the associations reported that governments did not consult them, and they have little or no say in policy at government levels. These poor outcomes were not exclusive to high-, middle- or low-income countries. Conclusions Strong recommendations that stem from this research include the need to include midwifery representation on key government committees and a need to increase the support for planned out of hospital birth. Both these recommendations stand to enhance the effectiveness of midwives in a world that continues to face and may face future catastrophic pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4307934677,"Background The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the government of New Zealand have proposed a reduction of the nicotine content in cigarettes to very low levels. This study examined the potential effects of this regulation in smokers with affective disorders. Methods In a randomized controlled parallel group trial conducted at two sites in the USA (Penn State University, Hershey, PA and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) 188 adult smokers with a current (n = 118) or lifetime (n = 70) anxiety or unipolar mood disorder, not planning to quit in the next 6 months, were randomly assigned (1:1) to smoke either Usual Nicotine Content (UNC) (11.6 mg nicotine/cigarette) research cigarettes, or Reduced Nicotine Content (RNC) research cigarettes where the nicotine content per cigarette was progressively reduced to 0.2 mg in five steps over 18 weeks. Participants were then offered the choice to either receive assistance to quit smoking, receive free research cigarettes, or resume using their own cigarette brand during a 12-week follow-up period. Main outcomes were biomarkers of nicotine and toxicant exposure, smoking behavior and dependence and severity of psychiatric symptoms. The pre-registered primary outcome was plasma cotinine. Results A total of 143 (76.1%) randomized participants completed the randomized phase of the trial, 69 (73.4%) in the RNC group and 74 (78.8%) in the UNC group. After switching to the lowest nicotine content cigarettes, compared to smokers in the UNC group, at the last randomized visit the RNC group had significantly lower plasma cotinine (metabolite of nicotine): difference between groups, -175.7, 95% CI [-218.3, -133.1] ng/ml. Urine NNAL (metabolite of NNK, a lung carcinogen), exhaled carbon-monoxide, cigarette consumption, and cigarette dependence were also significantly lower in the RNC group than the UNC group. No between-group differences were found on a range of other biomarkers (e.g. 8-isoprostanes) or health indicators (e.g. blood pressure), or on 5 different psychiatric questionnaires, including the Kessler K6 measure of psychological distress. At the end of the subsequent 12-week treatment choice phase, those randomized to the RNC group were more likely to have quit smoking, based on initial intent-to-treat sample, n = 188 (18.1% RNC v 4.3% UNC, p = 0.004). Conclusion Reducing nicotine content in cigarettes to very low levels reduces some toxicant exposures and cigarette addiction and increases smoking cessation in smokers with mood and/or anxiety disorders, without worsening mental health.

https://openalex.org/W4307935512,"In human challenge trials (HCTs), volunteers are deliberately infected with an infectious agent. Such trials can be used to accelerate vaccine development and answer important scientific questions. Starting early in the COVID-19 pandemic, ethical concerns were raised about using HCTs to accelerate development and approval of a vaccine. Some of those concerns pertained to potential exploitation of and/or lack of truly informed consent from volunteers. Specific areas of concern arose around individuals who may be unusually risk-seeking or too economically vulnerable to refuse the payments these trials provide, as opposed to being motivated primarily by altruistic goals. This pre-registered study is the first large-scale survey to characterize people who, early in the pandemic, expressed interest and intention to volunteer to participate in COVID-19 HCTs. We found that individuals expressing interest in SARS-CoV-2 HCTs exhibit consistently altruistic motivations without any special indication of poor risk perception or economic vulnerability. In finding that, early in the pandemic, COVID-19 HCTs were able to attract volunteers whose values align with the nature of these trials, and who are not unusually vulnerable to exploitation, this study may allay some ethical concerns about the volunteers interested in participating in such trials."
https://openalex.org/W4307988540,"Exposure of biological systems to acute or chronic insults triggers a host of molecular and physiological responses to either tolerate, adapt, or fully restore homeostasis; these responses constitute the hallmarks of resilience. Given the many facets, dimensions, and discipline-specific focus, gaining a shared understanding of “resilience” has been identified as a priority for supporting advances in cardiovascular health. This report is based on the working definition: “Resilience is the ability of living systems to successfully maintain or return to homeostasis in response to physical, molecular, individual, social, societal, or environmental stressors or challenges,” developed after considering many factors contributing to cardiovascular resilience through deliberations of multidisciplinary experts convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute during a workshop entitled: “Enhancing Resilience for Cardiovascular Health and Wellness.” Some of the main emerging themes that support the possibility of enhancing resilience for cardiovascular health include optimal energy management and substrate diversity, a robust immune system that safeguards tissue homeostasis, and social and community support. The report also highlights existing research challenges, along with immediate and long-term opportunities for resilience research. Certain immediate opportunities identified are based on leveraging existing high-dimensional data from longitudinal clinical studies to identify vascular resilience measures, create a ‘resilience index,’ and adopt a life-course approach. Long-term opportunities include developing quantitative cell/organ/system/community models to identify resilience factors and mechanisms at these various levels, designing experimental and clinical interventions that specifically assess resilience, adopting global sharing of resilience-related data, and cross-domain training of next-generation researchers in this field."
https://openalex.org/W4308142447,"Exercise training enhances oxidative capacity whereas detraining reduces mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle. The strategy to suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content has not been fully elucidated. As previous studies reported that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) ingestion increased mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, we evaluated whether BCAA supplementation could suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content. Six-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into four groups as follows: control (Con), endurance training (Tr), detraining (DeTr), and detraining with BCAA supplementation (DeTr + BCAA). Mice in Tr, DeTr, and DeTr + BCAA performed treadmill running exercises [20–30 m/min, 60 min, 5 times/week, 4 weeks]. Then, mice in DeTr and DeTr + BCAA were administered with water or BCAA [0.6 mg/g of body weight, twice daily] for 2 weeks of detraining. In whole skeletal muscle, mitochondrial enzyme activities and protein content were decreased after 2 weeks of detraining, but the reduction was suppressed by BCAA supplementation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) protein content, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was decreased by detraining irrespective of BCAA ingestion. Regarding mitochondrial degradation, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a mitophagy-related protein, was significantly higher in the Tr group than in the DeTr + BCAA group, but not different from in the DeTr group. With respect to mitochondrial quality, BCAA ingestion did not affect oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in isolated mitochondria. Our findings suggest that BCAA ingestion suppresses the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content partly through inhibiting mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W4307930309,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the motion features of surgical devices associated with laparoscopic surgical competency and build an automatic skill-credential system in porcine cadaver organ simulation training. Participants performed tissue dissection around the aorta, dividing vascular pedicles after applying Hem-o-lok (tissue dissection task) and parenchymal closure of the kidney (suturing task). Movements of surgical devices were tracked by a motion capture (Mocap) system, and Mocap-metrics were compared according to the level of surgical experience (experts: ≥50 laparoscopic surgeries, intermediates: 10-49, novices: 0-9), using the Kruskal-Wallis test and principal component analysis (PCA). Three machine-learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), PCA-SVM, and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), were utilized for discrimination of the surgical experience level. The accuracy of each model was evaluated by nested and repeated k-fold cross-validation. A total of 32 experts, 18 intermediates, and 20 novices participated in the present study. PCA revealed that efficiency-related metrics (e.g., path length) significantly contributed to PC 1 in both tasks. Regarding PC 2, speed-related metrics (e.g., velocity, acceleration, jerk) of right-hand devices largely contributed to the tissue dissection task, while those of left-hand devices did in the suturing task. Regarding the three-group discrimination, in the tissue dissection task, the GBDT method was superior to the other methods (median accuracy: 68.6%). In the suturing task, SVM and PCA-SVM methods were superior to the GBDT method (57.4 and 58.4%, respectively). Regarding the two-group discrimination (experts vs. intermediates/novices), the GBDT method resulted in a median accuracy of 72.9% in the tissue dissection task, and, in the suturing task, the PCA-SVM method resulted in a median accuracy of 69.2%. Overall, the mocap-based credential system using machine-learning classifiers provides a correct judgment rate of around 70% (two-group discrimination). Together with motion analysis and wet-lab training, simulation training could be a practical method for objectively assessing the surgical competence of trainees."
https://openalex.org/W4307930371,"This study quantifies the association between patient reported measures (PRMs) and readmission to inform efforts to improve hospital care. A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted with adults who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF) and were admitted for acute care in a public hospital in New South Wales, Australia for any reason (n = 2394 COPD and 2476 CHF patients in 2018-2020). Patient- level survey data were linked with inpatient data for one year prior to risk-adjust outcomes and after discharge to detect all cause unplanned readmission to a public or private hospital. Ninety-day readmission rates for respondents with COPD or CHF were 17% and 19%. Crude rates for adults with COPD were highest among those who reported that hospital care and treatment helped ""not at all"" (28%), compared to those who responded, ""to some extent"" (20%) or ""definitely"" (15%). After accounting for patient characteristics, adults with COPD or CHF who said care and treatment didn't help at all were at twice the risk of readmission compared to those who responded that care and treatment helped ""definitely"" (Hazard ratio for COPD 1.97, CI: 1.17-3.32; CHF 2.07, CI 1.25-3.42). Patients who offered the most unfavourable ratings of overall care, understandable explanations, organised care, or preparedness for discharge were at a 1.5 to more than two times higher risk of readmission. Respect and dignity, effective and clear communications, and timely and coordinated care also matter. PRMs are strong predictors of readmission even after accounting for risk related to age and co-morbidities. More moderate ratings were associated with attenuation of risk, and the most positive ratings were associated with the lowest readmission rate. These results suggest that increasing each patient's positive experiences progressively reduces the risk of adults with chronic conditions returning to acute care."
https://openalex.org/W4307930401,"Address based sampling (ABS) has become current state-of-the-art methodology for conducting household surveys by mail, telephone or web in the United States. One potential advantage of ABS frames is that additional information about the sampled households can be appended and leveraged for data collection and analytic purposes. The appended data come from many sources and are of variable quality and completeness. The goals of this research were to evaluate data quality of demographic and socioeconomic variables provided for recent ABS samples from one vendor, and to examine their potential usefulness for sample design, including oversampling. We report on the completeness of the appended data as well as their concordance with data reported by respondents to two recent large ABS household surveys, one that invited households to complete the survey online and another that was mail only. Based on the quality assessment, we also examine the utility of the appended variables for oversampling. Our general conclusions are that the quality of select appended variables has improved such that the Hispanic origin, Hispanic surname, and presence of age group 65+ variables may be used to efficiently oversample these subgroups. However, this is not the case for oversampling other subgroups through appended variables for home tenure; those with head of household whose educational attainment is high school or less; low income households; households with children; presence of age groups 18–24, 25–34, and 35–64; or households based on the number of adults in the household."
https://openalex.org/W4307930452,"Objectives Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are common gastrointestinal problems in children, and the pathophysiology is thought to be multifactorial. Adverse early life events (ELE) induce alterations in the central nervous system, perhaps predisposing individuals to develop FAPDs. We aimed to study the potential adverse ELE that are associated with FAPDs. Methods We steered a school-based survey involving 1000 children from 4 randomly selected schools. FAPDs were assessed using the translated Rome III questionnaire, and ELE were identified using a pre-tested, parental questionnaire. FAPDs were diagnosed using the Rome III criteria. Results Hundred and eighty-two (182) children had FAPDs (62.1% girls, mean age 8.5, SD 2.1). ELE of them were compared with 571 children without FAPDs (51.1% girls, mean age 8.8, SD 1.9). According to the binary logistic regression analysis, family members with abdominal pain, family member with chronic pain other than abdominal pain, prenatal maternal complications and interventional deliveries, were recognized as potential risk factors for the development of FAPDs. Breast feeding over two years has shown to reduce the prevalence of FAPDs.a. Conclusions Prenatal maternal medical problems are associated a with higher prevalence of FAPDs later in life. Prolonged breastfeeding and normal vaginal delivery could be considered as factors that reduce the vulnerability of developing FAPDs in children. Therefore, minimizing pregnancy-related complications, encouraging vaginal deliveries, and encouraging breastfeeding are potentially valuable measures to prevent FAPDs during childhood."

Thus, this survey was performed to evaluate the satisfaction of both school students and their parents with the VLE in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was distributed online for VLE evaluation. The questionnaire was based on previous studies and expert opinions from validated instruments for assessing distance education, integrative and literature reviews of VLE environment. A median value >3 indicated participant satisfaction in each of the 5 domains of the questionnaire as well as overall VLE satisfaction. The used questionnaire was checked after its implementation by all possible statistical means and it was found to be of acceptable validity and reliability.Six hundred and ninety-three participants including 571 Saudi citizens and 122 non-Saudi residents participated in this survey. The number of school students who agreed or strongly agreed were significantly lower than the number of students who disagreed or strongly disagreed with preferring the VLE over traditional education (p<0.001). The participants evaluated the VLE experience as unsatisfactory with a median value ≤3 for 4 out of 5 questionnaire domains with an overall satisfaction value of 2.8. Among the 117 participants who gave further written opinions/comments, 42(35.9%) participants supported the VLE as an alternative to traditional classrooms, if equipment and internet are made available and for the safety of their children.This is one of few available adequate population-based studies for exploring the VLE satisfaction of both Saudi citizens and non-Saudi residents school students and their parents. This study showed the participants' unsatisfactory VLE experience. The VLE is accepted as an alternative to traditional classrooms to keep up with learning and to maintain the safety of children and it can be a supplementary learning method but many measures are still needed to develop the VLE."

We generated a de novo genome assembly of the Psidium guajava, the super fruit ""apple of the tropics"", and successfully transferred 14,268 SNP probesets from Eucalyptus to Psidium at the nucleotide level, to detect genomic loci linked to resistance to the root knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne enterolobii derived from the wild relative P. guineense. Significantly associated loci with resistance across alternative analytical frameworks, were detected at two SNPs on chromosome 3 in a pseudo-assembly of Psidium guajava genome built using a syntenic path approach with the Eucalyptus grandis genome to determine the order and orientation of the contigs. The P. guineense-derived resistance response to RKN and disease onset is conceivably triggered by mineral nutrients and phytohormone homeostasis or signaling with the involvement of the miRNA pathway. Hotspots of mapped resistance quantitative trait loci and functional annotation in the same genomic region of Eucalyptus provide further indirect support to our results, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of genomes across genera of Myrtaceae in the adaptation to pathogens. Marker assisted introgression of the resistance loci mapped should accelerate the development of improved guava cultivars and hybrid rootstocks."
https://openalex.org/W4307931046,"Precision cut liver slices represent an encouraging ex vivo method to understand the pathogenesis of liver disease alongside drug induced liver injury. Despite being more physiologically relevant compared to in vitro models, precision cut liver slices are limited by the availability of healthy human tissue and experimental variability. Internal oxygen concentration and media composition govern the longevity and viability of the slices during the culture period and as such, a variety of approaches have been taken to maximise the appropriateness of the internal oxygen concentrations across the slice. The aim of this study was to predict whether it is possible to generate a physiologically relevant oxygen gradient of 35-65mmHg across a precision cut liver slice using mathematical modelling. Simulations explore how the internal oxygen concentration changes as a function of the diameter of the slice, the position inside the well and the external incubator oxygen concentration. The model predicts that the desired oxygen gradient may be achieved using a 5mm diameter slice at atmospheric oxygen concentrations, provided that the slice is positioned at a certain height within the well of a 12-well plate."
https://openalex.org/W4307931503,"The use of by-products of salted jellyfish for gelatin production offers valuable gelatin products rather than animal feed. Several washes or washing machines have reported removing salt in salted jellyfish. However, the green ultrasound technique has never been reported for the desalination of salted jellyfish. The objectives were to determine how effectively the raw material’s salt removal was done by combining the traditional wash and then subjected to the ultrasonic waves in a sonication bath for 20–100 min. For gelatin production, the ultrasonicated jellyfish by-products were pretreated with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, washed, and extracted with hot water for 4, 6, and 8 h. Results showed that the increased duration of ultrasound time increased the desalination rate. The highest desalination rate of 100% was achieved using 100 min ultrasonic time operated at a fixed frequency (40 kHz) and power (220 W). The jellyfish gelatin extracted for 4, 6, and 8 h showed gel strengths in 121–447, 120–278, and 91–248 g. The 80 min ultrasonicated sample and hot water extraction for 8 h (JFG80-8) showed the highest gel yield of 32.69%, with a gel strength of 114.92 g. Still, the 40 min ultrasonicated sample with 4 h of extraction delivered the highest gel strength of 447.01 g (JFG40-4) and the lower yield of 10.60%. The melting and gelling temperatures of jellyfish gelatin from ultrasonicated samples ranged from 15–25°C and 5–12°C, which are lower than bovine gelatin (BG) and fish gelatin (FG). Monitored by FITR, the synergistic effect of extended sonication time (from 20–100 min) with 4 h extraction time at 80 °C caused amide I, II, and III changes. Based on the proteomic results, the peptide similarity of JFG40-4, having the highest gel strength, was 17, 23, or 20 peptides compared to either BG, FG, or JFG100-8 having the lowest gel strength. The 14 peptides were similarly found in all JFG40-4, BG, and FG samples. In conclusion, for the first time in this report, the improved jellyfish gel can be achieved when combined with traditional wash and 40 min ultrasonication of desalted jellyfish and extraction time of 4 h at 80 °C."

However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between serum bilirubin levels and skeletal muscle mass in older patients with type2 diabetes. Methods A total of 272 older patients with type2 diabetes (152 male and 120 female) aged 60 years and over were continuously recruited from April 2020 to July 2020. Body composition was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis. The skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was calculated as appendicular muscle mass divided by height squared (m 2 ). Results The SMI was markedly lower in old-old patients (aged 75 years and over) than in young-old patients (aged 60–74 years) in both male and female (7.1 ± 0.8 kg/m 2 vs 7.6 ± 0.9 kg/m 2 , P&lt;0.001; 5.5 ± 0.9 kg/m 2 vs 6.3 ± 0.8 kg/m 2 , P&lt;0.001, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the SMI was associated with body mass index (BMI) (p&lt;0.001) and age (p = 0.048) in male young-old patients, while it was associated with BMI (p&lt;0.001), age (p = 0.008), and serum indirect bilirubin levels (p = 0.038) in male old-old patients. In female, the SMI was associated with BMI (p&lt;0.001) and age (p = 0.042) in young-old patients and associated with BMI alone (p&lt;0.001) in old-old patients. Conclusion Serum indirect bilirubin levels may be associated with the decreased skeletal muscle mass in male older patients (aged 75 years and over) with type 2 diabetes."

Currently used reference intervals in most African countries including Ethiopia are mainly derived from Western populations, despite studies reporting differences that could lead to incorrect clinical decisions. The aim of this study was to establish reference intervals for commonly used clinical chemistry parameters for healthy adults in Northeast Ethiopia.A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 328 apparently healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 57 years. Blood samples were collected for clinical chemistry analysis using Dirui CS-T240 auto-analyzer and serological testing to screen the population. Medians and 95% reference intervals were computed using non-parametric method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare reference values between males and females.Reference intervals established were: ALT 11.2-48.0 U/L, AST 16-60 U/L, ALP 53-342.3 U/L, total protein 5.4-8.9 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.1-1.23 mg/dL, glucose 65-125 mg/dL, total cholesterol 69-213 mg/dL, triglycerides 46-207 mg/dL, creatinine 0.3-1.2 mg/dL and urea 9.5-46.3 mg/dL. Significant sex-differences were observed for ALT, AST, ALP, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine and urea. We found that the established reference intervals substantially differ from the reference ranges currently in use. Up to 43.1% of apparently healthy adults are considered as having abnormal test values on the bases of the currently in use reference ranges. If the reference values from the United States based intervals were applied to the study population, 81.8% would have been classified as having abnormal laboratory test results.Local population-specific reference intervals were established for commonly used clinical chemistry parameters in adult population of Northeast Ethiopia. Although further study is needed, these reference intervals may have the potential to facility the decision-making process based on laboratory test results in this population."

While these vaccines are highly efficacious against COVID-19 disease, their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection of upper respiratory tract and transmission is at best temporary. Development of safe and efficacious vaccines that are able to induce robust mucosal and systemic immune responses are needed to control new variants. In this study, we have used our nanoemulsion adjuvant (NE01) to intranasally (IN) deliver stabilized spike protein (S-2P) to induce immunogenicity in mouse and hamster models. Data presented demonstrate the induction of robust immunity in mice resulting in 100% seroconversion and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in a hamster challenge model. There was a significant induction of mucosal immune responses as demonstrated by IgA- and IgG-producing memory B cells in the lungs of animals that received intranasal immunizations compared to an alum adjuvanted intramuscular vaccine. The efficacy of the S-2P/NE01 vaccine was also demonstrated in an intranasal hamster challenge model with SARS-CoV-2 and conferred significant protection against weight loss, lung pathology, and viral clearance from both upper and lower respiratory tract. Our findings demonstrate that intranasal NE01-adjuvanted vaccine promotes protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease through activation of three arms of immune system: humoral, cellular, and mucosal, suggesting that an intranasal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may play a role in addressing a unique public health problem and unmet medical need."

https://openalex.org/W4307934715,"Background Patients have difficult unmet needs when standard chemotherapy produces a median survival of less than 1 year or many patients will experience severe toxicities. Blood tests can predict their survival. Methods Analyses evaluate predictive blood tests to identify patients who often survive 1 and 2 years. A four-test model includes: albumin, absolute neutrophil count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio. Individual tests include: alkaline phosphatase, lymphocytes, white blood count, platelet count, and hemoglobin. Eligible patients have advanced: resistant 3 rd line colorectal, and both resistant and new pancreatic and intrahepatic bile duct cancers. Eligibility characteristics include: biopsy-proven, measurable metastatic disease, NCI grade 0–2 blood tests, Karnofsky Score 100–50, and any adult age. Drugs are given at 1/4–1/3 of their standard dosages biweekly: gemcitabine, irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and day 2 oxaliplatin every 2 weeks. In case of progression, Docetaxel is added (except colon cancer), with or without Mitomycin C, and next cetuximab (except pancreatic and KRAS BRAF mutation cancers). Bevacizumab is substituted for cetuximab in case of another progression or ineligibility. Consent was written and conforms with Helsinki, IRB, and FDA criteria (FDA #119005). Results Median survival is 14.5 months. Of 205 patients, 60% survive 12, and 37% survive 24 months (95% CI ± 8%). Survival is &gt; 24, 13, and 3.8 months for patients with 0, 1–2, and 3–4 unfavorable tests, respectively. Individual “favorable and unfavorable” tests predict long and short survival. Neither age nor prior therapy discernibly affects survival. Net rates of clinically significant toxicities are less than 5%. Conclusion Treatments reproduce predictable, greater than 12 and 24-month chances of survival for the aged and for patients with drug-resistant tumors. Evaluation of blood tests may change practice, expand eligibility, and personalize treatments. Findings support investigation of drug combinations and novel dosages to reverse resistance and improve safety."
https://openalex.org/W4307935083,"Background A growing body of evidence suggests that exposure to nature is beneficial for human health. However, the observed health effect of nature may be mediated by physical activity and that humans are physically active at a higher intensity outdoors compared to when they are physical active indoors. Objective This study examines the variation of heart rate and power output for a fixed rating of perceived exertion in a group of healthy older adults in three different environments representing three levels of exposure to nature. Methods To this randomized, 3-by-3 crossover design study, healthy older adults (≥65 years) were recruited from local gyms. All participants participated in three experimental conditions; indoors, simulated outdoors and outdoor environments, in a randomized order. The participants exercised for 20 minutes at an intensity equivalent to a rating of 11–13 on the Borg scale for perceived exertion (RPE). Measurements of heart rate, power output (Watt) and ratings of perceived exertion were taken at minutes 1 to 6 and at minute 20. To examine the effect of the environment on heart rate and power, linear mixed models were used. Results In all, 48 participants (56% females) were included in the analysis. No significant main effects on the outcomes were observed for power output (p = 0.073, η 2 = 0.04) or heart rate (p = 0.067, η 2 = 0.04) Conclusion No significant effect on the outcomes was observed. However, borderline significant outcomes for power output or heart rate outdoors in nature, along with previous studies in the field, indicates that such an effect cannot be completely ruled out, but any effect is likely to be small.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of age, sex, education, nationality, competitive background and training amount with sport motives of masters track and field athletes. Methods 811 (254 women) athletes aged 35–89 years participated in European Veterans Athletics Championships in the year of 2000. Sport motives were assessed with a questionnaire and categorized into1) well-being, 2) competitive and performance 3) health and fitness motives. Results Men considered health and fitness motives more important than women (p = 0.022). Over 65-year-old athletes considered health and fitness motives more important than the youngest, 35-49-year age group (p&lt;0.001). Education was not associated with sport motives, while motives varied significantly among different nationalities. Athletes from Nordic Countries considered well-being motives more important than Southern Europeans (p&lt;0.001) or Western Europeans (p&lt;0.05). Athletes from Nordic Countries (p = 0.003), Eastern Europe (p&lt;0.001) and Central Europe (p&lt;0.001) found health and fitness motives more meaningful than athletes from the British Isles. Furthermore, athletes with competitive background before the age of 35 and training amount more than 7.5 h a week found competitive and performance motives more important than athletes without a competitive history (p = 0.002). Conclusions These results suggest that age, sex, nationality and former athleticism are associated with sports motives among international level masters track and field athletes. It seems that while for masters athletes with competitive background performance motives dominate, for older adults, particularly for males, health and fitness motives are more important. In addition, when designing the exercise interventions for older adults, different sport motives across countries should be considered."

The effect of neuroscientific testimony on legal decisions remains uncertain, with some studies finding no effect, others reporting that neuroscience has a mitigating impact, and some indicating neuroscience evidence has an aggravating effect. The present study attempts to explain these divergent findings by showing that the effect of neuroscience evidence on sentencing interacts with beliefs about the goals of the criminal legal system. Using a between-subjects design, participants ( N = 784) were asked to assume different rationales for imprisonment, before receiving neuroscientific evidence about antisocial behavior and its potential relation to the defendant. Participants recommended a sentence for the defendant prior to and after reading the neuroscientific evidence. Participants who were given the rationale of retribution as the primary goal of imprisonment significantly decreased their sentencing recommendations. When the goal of imprisonment was to protect the public from dangerous people, participants provided longer post-testimony sentences. Lastly, when the goal was to rehabilitate wrongdoers, participants also increased sentences from pre to post. Thus, the impact of neuroscientific evidence is not monolithic, but can lead to either mitigated or aggravated sentences by interacting with penal philosophy."

This study evaluated mental and physical fatigue secondary to IF (daily 18-hour fast, 7-days-a-week) in the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced male obese Sprague Dawley rats. Fifty-four rats were randomly assigned to a HFD (n = 28) or a standard diet (SD; n = 26). After six weeks, the HFD rats were divided into one of four groups: obese HFD ad libitum (OB-HFD-AL), obese HFD-IF (OB-HFD-IF), obese SD-AL (OB-SD-AL), and obese SD-IF (OB-SD-IF). Similarly, non-obese controls were grouped into HFD-AL (C-HFD-AL), non-obese HFD-IF (C-HFD-IF), non-obese SD-AL (C-SD-AL), and non-obese SD-IF (C-SD-IF). After 2 weeks of IF, mental and physical fatigue were measured using open field (OF) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Rats on IF gained weight at a slower pace ( p&lt; 0.05) and had lower glucose levels ( p &lt;0.01) compared to the AL group. In non-obese rats, ketone levels were higher in the IF-HFD group than IF-SD (p&lt;0.05) and AL-SD ( p &lt;0.01) animals. Obese rats exhibited elevated blood ketone levels in IF-SD conditions versus AL-SD rats ( p &lt;0.01). AL-HFD rats had higher ketone levels than AL-SD animals in both obese and non-obese groups ( p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, rats with higher blood ketone levels, whether they were on IF or AL, traveled a greater distance during OF suggesting a lack of physical fatigue. There was no significant difference between IF and AL during NOR indicating a lack of mental fatigue. Thus, IF results in reduced body weight and blood glucose levels but does not induce physical or mental fatigue."
