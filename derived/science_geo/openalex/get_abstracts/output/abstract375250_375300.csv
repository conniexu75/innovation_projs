https://openalex.org/W2136541538,"Cellular differentiation and lineage commitment are considered to be robust and irreversible processes during development. Recent work has shown that mouse and human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state with a combination of four transcription factors. This raised the question of whether transcription factors could directly induce other defined somatic cell fates, and not only an undifferentiated state. We hypothesized that combinatorial expression of neural-lineage-specific transcription factors could directly convert fibroblasts into neurons. Starting from a pool of nineteen candidate genes, we identified a combination of only three factors, Ascl1, Brn2 (also called Pou3f2) and Myt1l, that suffice to rapidly and efficiently convert mouse embryonic and postnatal fibroblasts into functional neurons in vitro. These induced neuronal (iN) cells express multiple neuron-specific proteins, generate action potentials and form functional synapses. Generation of iN cells from non-neural lineages could have important implications for studies of neural development, neurological disease modelling and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1971207325,"Mammals are repelled by large concentrations of salts but attracted to low concentrations of sodium. In mice, the latter behaviour can be blocked by the ion-channel inhibitor amiloride. Now mice genetically engineered to lack the drug's target sodium channel, ENaC, in taste receptor neurons have been found to lack both salt sensing and sodium taste responses. Thus sodium sensing, like the four other taste modalities (sweet, sour, bitter and umami), is mediated by dedicated taste-receptor cells. Though because sodium sensing is amiloride-insensitive in primates, how this relates to our ability to taste salt remains unclear. Mammals are repelled by large concentrations of salts but attracted to low concentrations of sodium. In mice, the latter behaviour can be blocked by the ion channel inhibitor amiloride. Here, mice have been produced lacking the drug's target sodium channel, ENaC, specifically in taste receptor neurons. It is confirmed that sodium sensing, like the four other taste modalities (sweet, sour, bitter and umami), is mediated by a dedicated 'labelled line'. Salt taste in mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion1,2,3,4,5. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts1,2,3,6,7,8,9. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system1,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses5,15,16,17,18. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC19,20, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1986820918,"Genetic and biochemical studies have established a central role for alpha-synuclein accumulation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Here, two microRNAs, namely mir-7 and mir-153, have been identified to regulate alpha-synuclein levels post-transcriptionally. These microRNAs bind specifically to the 3'-untranslated region of alpha-synuclein and down-regulate its mRNA and protein levels, with their effect being additive. They are expressed predominantly in the brain with a pattern that mirrors synuclein expression in different tissues as well as during neuronal development, indicating that they play a tuning role in the amount of alpha-synuclein produced. Overexpression of mir-7 and mir-153 significantly reduces endogenous alpha-synuclein levels, whereas inhibition of mir-7 and mir-153 enhances translation of a luciferase construct bearing the alpha-synuclein 3'-untranslated region in primary neurons. These findings reveal a significant additional mechanism by which alpha-synuclein is regulated and point toward new therapeutic regimes for lowering endogenous alpha-synuclein levels in patients with familial or sporadic Parkinson disease."
https://openalex.org/W1966587486,"A series of striking 'feathered dinosaur' fossil discoveries from the Cretaceous Jehol Group sediments of China has revolutionized thinking about the evolution and diversity of dinosaurs and early birds. But it has been suggested that some of the structures that are not obviously feathers might actually be strands of collagen from under the skin. Zhang et al. refute this notion by demonstrating the presence in these structures of melanosomes — the characteristic bodies that give feathers their colours. Not only do they show that the feather-like structures of dinosaurs such as Sinosauropteryx really are akin to feathers, but also they can speculate in an informed way about their colour — which it seems was reddish brown or ginger. Here the presence of melanosomes — characteristic bodies that give feathers their colour — is demonstrated in feathers and feather-like structures of fossil early birds and dinosaurs from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Group of China. Not only is it shown that the feather–like structures of dinosaurs such as Sinosauropteryx really are akin to feathers, it is also possible to speculate in an informed way about their colour. Spectacular fossils from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Group1,2 of northeastern China have greatly expanded our knowledge of the diversity and palaeobiology of dinosaurs and early birds, and contributed to our understanding of the origin of birds, of flight, and of feathers. Pennaceous (vaned) feathers and integumentary filaments are preserved in birds3,4,5 and non-avian theropod dinosaurs6,7,8,9,10,11,12, but little is known of their microstructure. Here we report that melanosomes (colour-bearing organelles) are not only preserved in the pennaceous feathers of early birds, but also in an identical manner in integumentary filaments of non-avian dinosaurs, thus refuting recent claims13,14,15,16 that the filaments are partially decayed dermal collagen fibres. Examples of both eumelanosomes and phaeomelanosomes have been identified, and they are often preserved in life position within the structure of partially degraded feathers and filaments. Furthermore, the data here provide empirical evidence for reconstructing the colours and colour patterning of these extinct birds and theropod dinosaurs: for example, the dark-coloured stripes on the tail of the theropod dinosaur Sinosauropteryx can reasonably be inferred to have exhibited chestnut to reddish-brown tones."
https://openalex.org/W2088248538,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a potent sphingolipid mediator produced by sphingosine kinase isoenzymes (SphK1 and SphK2), regulates diverse cellular processes important for breast cancer progression acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. Here we show that SphK1, but not SphK2, increased S1P export from MCF-7 cells. Whereas for both estradiol (E(2)) and epidermal growth factor-activated SphK1 and production of S1P, only E(2) stimulated rapid release of S1P and dihydro-S1P from MCF-7 cells. E(2)-induced S1P and dihydro-S1P export required estrogen receptor-alpha, not GPR30, and was suppressed either by pharmacological inhibitors or gene silencing of ABCC1 (multidrug resistant protein 1) or ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein). Inhibiting these transporters also blocked E(2)-induced activation of ERK1/2, indicating that E(2) activates ERK via downstream signaling of S1P. Taken together, our findings suggest that E(2)-induced export of S1P mediated by ABCC1 and ABCG2 transporters and consequent activation of S1P receptors may contribute to nongenomic signaling of E(2) important for breast cancer pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W1970517964,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA7 is a non-respiratory human isolate from Argentina that is multiresistant to antibiotics. We first sequenced gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE, ampC, ampR, and several housekeeping genes and found that PA7 is a taxonomic outlier. We report here the complete sequence of the 6,588,339 bp genome, which has only about 95% overall identity to other strains. PA7 has multiple novel genomic islands and a total of 51 occupied regions of genomic plasticity. These islands include antibiotic resistance genes, parts of transposons, prophages, and a pKLC102-related island. Several PA7 genes not present in PAO1 or PA14 are putative orthologues of other Pseudomonas spp. and Ralstonia spp. genes. PA7 appears to be closely related to the known taxonomic outlier DSM1128 (ATCC9027). PA7 lacks several virulence factors, notably the entire TTSS region corresponding to PA1690-PA1725 of PAO1. It has neither exoS nor exoU and lacks toxA, exoT, and exoY. PA7 is serotype O12 and pyoverdin type II. Preliminary proteomic studies indicate numerous differences with PAO1, some of which are probably a consequence of a frameshift mutation in the mvfR quorum sensing regulatory gene."
https://openalex.org/W2017859854,"Ceramide is an important lipid signaling molecule that plays critical roles in regulating cell behavior. Ceramide synthesis is surprisingly complex and is orchestrated by six mammalian ceramide synthases, each of which produces ceramides with restricted acyl chain lengths. We have generated a CerS2 null mouse and characterized the changes in the long chain base and sphingolipid composition of livers from these mice. Ceramide and downstream sphingolipids were devoid of very long (C22-C24) acyl chains, consistent with the substrate specificity of CerS2 toward acyl-CoAs. Unexpectedly, C16-ceramide levels were elevated, and as a result, total ceramide levels were unaltered; however, C16-ceramide synthesis in vitro was not increased. Levels of sphinganine were also significantly elevated, by up to 50-fold, reminiscent of the effect of the ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1. With the exceptions of glucosylceramide synthase and neutral sphingomyelinase 2, none of the other enzymes tested in either the sphingolipid biosynthetic or degradative pathways were significantly changed. Total glycerophospholipid and cholesterol levels were unaltered, although there was a marked elevation in C18:1 and C18:2 fatty acids in phosphatidylethanolamine, concomitant with a reduction in C18:0 and C20:4 fatty acids. Finally, differences were observed in the biophysical properties of lipid extracts isolated from liver microsomes, with membranes from CerS2 null mice displaying higher membrane fluidity and showing morphological changes. Together, these results demonstrate novel modes of cross-talk and regulation between the various branches of lipid metabolic pathways upon inhibition of very long acyl chain ceramide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982703175,"We have generated a mouse that cannot synthesize very long acyl chain (C22–C24) ceramides (Pewzner-Jung, Y., Park, H., Laviad, E. L., Silva, L.

As a result, significant changes were observed in the sphingolipid profile of livers from these mice, including elevated C16-ceramide and sphinganine levels. We now examine the functional consequences of these changes. CerS2 null mice develop severe nonzonal hepatopathy from about 30 days of age, the age at which CerS2 expression peaks in wild type mice, and display increased rates of hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation. In older mice there is extensive and pronounced hepatocellular anisocytosis with widespread formation of nodules of regenerative hepatocellular hyperplasia. Progressive hepatomegaly and noninvasive hepatocellular carcinoma are also seen from ∼10 months of age. Even though CerS2 is found at equally high mRNA levels in kidney and liver, there are no changes in renal function and no pathological changes in the kidney. High throughput analysis of RNA expression in liver revealed up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle regulation, protein transport, cell-cell interactions and apoptosis, and down-regulation of genes associated with intermediary metabolism, such as lipid and steroid metabolism, adipocyte signaling, and amino acid metabolism. In addition, levels of the cell cycle regulator, the cyclin dependent-kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, were highly elevated, which occurs by at least two mechanisms, one of which may involve p53. We propose a functional rationale for the synthesis of sphingolipids with very long acyl chains in liver homeostasis and in cell physiology.

Six mammalian ceramide synthase (CerS) genes have recently been described, with each using a relatively defined subset of fatty acyl-CoAs for N-acylation of the sphingoid base (1.Pewzner-Jung Y.

Briefly, ceramide and downstream SLs containing very long (C22–C24) acyl chains were barely detectable, whereas C16-ceramide and sphinganine levels were significantly elevated. Prior studies have shown that interfering with ceramide metabolism by genetic manipulation has profound effects on cell physiology. For instance, targeted disruption of the gene encoding glucosylceramide synthase led to an embryonic lethal phenotype, with differentiation into primitive germ layers and patterning of the embryo abruptly halted by a major apoptotic process, possibly because of ceramide accumulation (3.Yamashita T. Wada R. Sasaki T. Deng C. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9142-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Likewise, knock-out of both isoforms of serine palmitoyltransferase caused embryonic lethality (4.Hojjati M.R. Li Z. Jiang X.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1737: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). More recently, the ceramide transfer protein, CERT, has been shown to be essential for mouse development and embryonic survival (5.Wang X. Rao R.P. Kosakowska-Cholody T. Masood M.A. Southon E.

Thus, ablation of the activity of three proteins critically involved in ceramide metabolism results in embryonic lethality. We now report that CerS2 null mice can survive for at least 20 months, but they display a remarkable phenotype in the liver, consistent with an ongoing metabolic dysfunction manifested as shortened hepatocellular life span, apoptosis, and hepatocellular regeneration, leading to pronounced hepatomegaly and hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings considerably expand the work of Imgrund et al. (6.Imgrund S. Hartmann D. Farwanah H. Eckhardt M. Sandhoff R. Degen J. Gieselmann V. Sandhoff K. Willecke K. J. Biol.

The ApopTag Red in situ apoptosis detection kit was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and handled according to protocols approved by the Weizmann Institute Animal Care Committee as per international guidelines. CerS2 was assayed as in the accompanying study (2.Pewzner-Jung Y. Park H. Laviad E.L. Silva L.C. Lahiri S. Stiban J. Erez-Roman R. Brugger B. Sachsenheimer T. Wieland F.T. Prieto M. Merrill A.H.

Measurements were performed by the Pathovet Veterinary Diagnostic Services (Kfar Bilu, Israel) using a Roche Applied Science/Hitachi 917 system. Electrolytes were determined with an ion selective unit integrated in the analyzer. For paraffin sections, tissues were collected at necropsy and fixed by immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin. They were processed routinely, embedded in paraffin, trimmed at 4–5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Selected samples were stained with periodic acid-Schiff and Mason's trichrome. Immunohistochemistry was performed on deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissues using an immunoperoxidase procedure with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. For identification of apoptotic and proliferating cells, anti-caspase 3 (1:50 dilution) and anti-BrdUrd antibodies (1:100 dilution) were used, respectively. Tissues were stained for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) using the ApopTag Red in situ apoptosis detection kit, and nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Before staining, slides were microwave-treated. BrdUrd (100 mg/kg) was applied intraperitoneally to mice 1 h prior to sacrifice. For Oil-Red-O and X-gal staining, tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, (Tissue-Tek) and frozen on dry ice for cryosectioning. Slides were stained for Oil-Red-O according to the supersaturated isopropyl alcohol method. For whole mount X-gal staining, livers were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min, washed (2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline) three times at room temperature, and stained in the dark using 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm C6FeK4N6 (37 °C, overnight). Stained livers were dehydrated in graded ethanol and cleared in benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate (1:2, v/v) for several hours. For X-gal staining on cryosections, slides were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min and then washed and stained overnight as above. Slides were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with hematoxylin. SL analyses by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry were conducted using a PE-Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and an ABI 4000 quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (7.Sullards M.C.

Briefly, mice were perfused through the inferior vena cava using liver perfusion media (Invitrogen) preheated to 42 °C. Perfusion was performed using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 4 ml/min for 4 min. The buffer was immediately replaced with liver digest media (Invitrogen) preheated to 42 °C for 12 min. The liver was collected in 10 ml of plating media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% lipid-reduced fetal bovine serum, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.1 μm insulin). The liver was dissected using tweezers and passed through a cell strainer (70 μm nylon). Cells were centrifuged at 50 × gav (5 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in Percoll. After centrifugation, dead cells were removed, and the pellet was washed twice using plating medium. Cells were resuspended in plating medium and counted using a hemocytometer and trypan blue to exclude dead cells. For digital gene expression (DGE), total RNA was prepared from whole liver and extracted on Maxi RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); RNA was pooled from five 30-day-old CerS2 null and wild type (WT) female mice, and 2 μg was used for construction of the library. Tags were sequenced using an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (San Diego) and analyzed using the Illumina Pipeline software. Sequence tags for digital gene expression profiling were prepared according to the Illumina NlaIII protocol and using DGE tag profiling sample prep kit (FC-1002-1005, Illumina). Using the standard cluster generation kit, version 2, cluster generation was performed. Primer hybridization and cycles of base incorporation were performed on the GAII according to the manufacturer's instructions. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the Illumina Pipeline, where sequence tags were obtained after purity filtering (6.65 × 106 for CerS2 null and 5.81 × 106 for WT mice) and aligned to the canonical transcriptome tag library obtained from Illumina. This was followed by sorting and counting the unique tags using Eland tag. The raw data have been submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive under the accession number SRA008869 and is listed in supplemental Table 1. The read count per tag was normalized to the number of total reads uniquely aligned for each lane. 4.3 and 5 × 106 sequence reads were obtained for the WT and CerS2 null mouse livers, respectively. Tags with less than 10 reads in the two samples were filtered out. Differential expression was assessed as in Ref. 13.Audic S. Claverie J.M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar. The cutoff on the false discovery rate was fixed at 5% (13,000 genes) (14.Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Fold-changes were calculated on the normalized tag counts, and tags with a minimum fold-change of 1.5 were chosen for functional analysis. After the previous filtrations, 6,247 up-regulated tags remained, of which 6,120 had gene symbols for a total of 5,075 nonredundant gene symbols. There were 1,189 down-regulated tags, 1,126 of them with gene symbols and a total of 970 nonredundant gene symbols. Differentially expressed genes were categorized based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways (15.Kanehisa M. Araki M. Goto S. Hattori M. Hirakawa M. Itoh M.

Note that the various mouse models are from different strains (supplemental Table 2). The following primers were used: p21WAF1/CIP1 sense, 5′-TCAGAGCCACAGGCACCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGAACAGGTCGGACATCACCA-3′; p53 sense, 5′-GCTTCTCCGAAGACTGGATGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGATATCCGACTGTGACTCCTCC-3′. Conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min (95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 1 min) for 40 cycles; 95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 1 min; 95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 15 s. The following antibodies were used: anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 (1:200 dilution), anti-actin (1:5,000 dilution), anti-α-tubulin (1:10,000 dilution), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:5,000 dilution). Antibodies were diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. All data are shown as means ± S.E. (unless indicated). p values were calculated using a one-tailed two-independent samples Student's t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine the developmental profile of CerS2, mRNA expression was examined by quantitative PCR in WT mouse liver during the first 10 months of life. CerS2 mRNA expression was relatively low in fetal tissue (embryonic day 17) and at birth, and it increased until it peaked at ∼1–3 month of age. By 6 months of age, expression was reduced, reaching levels similar to those at birth, but increased again to the highest levels of expression at 10 months (Fig. 1A). CerS2 activity followed a similar general pattern to that of CerS2 mRNA expression, although activity was higher in fetal tissue than at birth (Fig. 1B, inset). After birth, CerS2 activity increased and peaked, along with mRNA levels, at ∼1–2 months of age (Fig. 1B). Again, similar to mRNA levels, CerS2 activity decreased at 6 months, but did not reach levels as low as those found at birth, and increased at 10 months. Together, these findings suggest that CerS2 expression is tightly regulated during development and imply that CerS2 may play a vital role in postnatal liver development and physiology. Because CerS2 activity increases significantly during post-natal development until ∼1–2 months of age in WT mice (Fig. 1B), we reasoned that pathological changes might occur at around this time in CerS2 null mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2), and cholesterol (Fig. 3) were elevated at 1 month of age and further elevated at 11 months (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), indicative of liver damage (26.Tennant B. Loeb W.F. The Clinical Chemistry of Laboratory Animals. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia1999Google Scholar). Hypoglycemia was also observed, albeit to a limited extent at 1 month, which became statistically significant at 11 months (Fig. 3). Hints that pathology is tissue-specific were obtained by the lack of change of enzymes and metabolites used to diagnose dysfunction of other organs, including kidney (creatinine, urea, and phosphate) (Fig. 3). Interestingly, kidney shows similarly high levels of CerS2 mRNA expression as liver (9.Laviad E.L. Albee L. Pankova-Kholmyansky I. Epstein S. Park H. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5677-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and similar changes in the SL profile in the CerS2 null mouse (see Fig. 8B). However, renal dysfunction was not observed in CerS2 null mice of up to 11 months of age.FIGURE 3Enzyme and metabolite levels in serum from CerS2 null mice.

Many mice survived longer, with some surviving up to 20 months (see for instance, Fig. 4B). Based on the survival rates, and on the pathological findings in the liver, the CerS2 null mice were divided into three groups for further analysis, P0 (i.e. day of birth) to 4 months of age, 4–7 months, and 8–20 months. Although there was a good correlation between the age of the mice and the lesion severity, exceptions occurred that can probably be ascribed to the mixed genetic background of the mice. In CerS2 null mice up to 4 months of age, the only gross abnormalities were reduced body size and fat deposits. Beyond 4 months of age, the liver was grossly abnormal. Its capsular surface was irregular due to the presence of randomly scattered nodules of variable size and color (Fig. 4B). The color of many nodules was similar to that of the surrounding parenchyma, but some were pale, suggestive of focal fatty accumulation, and others were orange-tinged, consistent with localized bile retention (Fig. 4B). The color of the intervening parenchyma was normal, and the liver edges were usually sharp. Some (3 out of 20) CerS2 null mice >8 months of age showed pathology similar to that in the 4–7 month group. However, in the majority of older mice, the liver was characterized by marked distortion of the lobar architecture as a result of widespread nodular proliferation and coalescence. Most nodules were solid, although a few were cystic (Fig. 4B). A pronounced increase in the size and weight of the liver (i.e. hepatomegaly) was also observed (Fig. 4C). In half of the CerS2 null mice, the liver showed an ∼300% increase in liver/body weight ratio. Liver weight reached 15.8–21.4% of body weight in cases without hepatocellular carcinoma and 18.5–32.7% in cases with hepatocellular carcinoma (see below). CerS2 is expressed in a zonal pattern in heterozygous mice (CerS2GT/+), found at high levels in periportal hepatocytes but at lower levels in centrilobular hepatocytes (Fig. 5A). In CerS2 null mice up to ∼4 months of age, histological abnormalities included increased apoptosis at 21 days of age and increased mitosis by 30 days of age (Fig. 5, B and C), heterogeneity in hepatocellular size (anisocytosis and anisokaryosis), and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of Kupffer cells. Moreover, live hepatocytes could not be isolated from 30-day-old CerS2 null mice (Fig. 5D). Hepatocellular anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were prominent from ∼4 months of age and affected the entire parenchyma, concurrent with abnormally elevated levels of apoptosis and mitosis. Randomly scattered within the altered parenchyma were 2–4 mm diameter hepatocellular nodules with round to irregular and variably distinct outlines (Fig. 6, A and B). In most cases, hepatocytes within the nodules were 5–10-fold larger than those in the surrounding parenchyma, where hepatocytes were often smaller than normal and crowded (Fig. 6, A–E). The nodules often included portal triads (Fig. 6G) and were morphologically most compatible with nodules of regenerative hepatocellular hyperplasia (27.Deschl U. Cattley R.C. Harada T. Kuettler K. Hailey J.R. Hartig F. Leblanc B. Marsman D.S. Shirai T. Mohr U. International Classification of Rodent Tumors: The Mouse. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001Google Scholar). The lobular architecture of the parenchyma was preserved but multifocally compressed and distorted (Fig. 6, B, D, and G). In the pre-existing parenchyma, portal triads were often crowded, and there was multifocal moderate to marked bile duct and oval cell hyperplasia, accompanied by very mild collagen deposition (Fig. 6, C–E). Small clusters of lipofuscin-laden macrophages were observed predominantly in the portal triads with minimal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration (Fig. 6, F and G). Kupffer cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia were present in the parenchyma and within the nodules. An overall reduction in cytoplasmic glycogen within hepatocytes was observed and was especially pronounced in hepatocytes within nodules (Fig. 6L). The CerS2 promoter was active in the pre-existing parenchyma but not in hepatocytes within nodules (Fig. 6, M and N). Interestingly, in the CerS2 null mouse, there was no zonal expression of the CerS2 promoter in the parenchyma (Fig. 6, M and N). The histological picture in CerS2 null mice ∼1 year of age and older was more complex due to the relentless progression of the hepatopathy. Individual nodules were larger and frequently coalesced (Fig. 7A). In some cases, the pre-existing parenchyma was virtually obliterated or reduced to scant tissue entrapped among the nodules or at the edges (Fig. 6, F and G). Hepatocytes within nodules commonly showed degenerative changes such as pronounced megalocytosis, irregular shapes, microvesicular or macrovesicular vacuolation (Fig. 6, B and G), alteration in cytoplasmic tinctorial properties, cytoplasmic granularity, and intracytoplasmic globular hypereosinophilic material (Mallory bodies) (Fig. 7, B and C). Interestingly, a specific type of degenerative change usually characterized an individual nodule and was different from the one affecting an adjacent nodule, suggesting clonal expansion. This feature assisted in the demarcation of the nodules and highlighted the irregular outlines of some of the nodules (Fig. 6, D, F, and G). Most of the nodules were nodules of regenerative hepatocellular hyperplasia (Fig. 6, A, D, F, and G, and Fig. 7A). Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed in some (6 out of 20) CerS2 null mice older than 8 months of age (three males and three females), with four of them only diagnosed at 14 months and older. The carcinomas were mostly well differentiated and consisted of a moderately pleomorphic population of hepatocytes arranged in solid, trabecular, or adenoid patterns (Fig. 7, E and F). Remarkably, the degree of hepatocellular pleomorphism was often more striking in the nodules of regenerative hepatocellular hyperplasia than in the carcinomas (compare Fig. 7, B and C with Fig. 7, E and F). Cystic degeneration/spongiosis hepatitis was observed in 5 out of 20 CerS2 null mice >8 months of age, with the earliest case at 10.5 months. The lesion was characterized by formation of cavities filled with eosinophili"
https://openalex.org/W2028141043,"Background RNA activation (RNAa) is a newly discovered mechanism of gene activation triggered by small double-stranded RNAs termed ‘small activating RNAs’ (saRNAs). Thus far, RNAa has only been demonstrated in human cells and is unclear whether it is conserved in other mammals. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we evaluated RNAa in cells derived from four mammalian species including nonhuman primates (African green monkey and chimpanzee), mouse, and rat. Previously, we identified saRNAs leading to the activation of E-cadherin, p21, and VEGF in human cells. As the targeted sequences are highly conserved in primates, transfection of each human saRNA into African green monkey (COS1) and chimpanzee (WES) cells also resulted in induction of the intended gene. Additional saRNAs targeting clinically relevant genes including p53, PAR4, WT1, RB1, p27, NKX3-1, VDR, IL2, and pS2 were also designed and transfected into COS1 and WES cells. Of the nine genes, p53, PAR4, WT1, and NKX3-1 were induced by their corresponding saRNAs. We further extended our analysis of RNAa into rodent cell types. We identified two saRNAs that induced the expression of mouse Cyclin B1 in NIH/3T3 and TRAMP C1 cells, which led to increased phosphorylation of histone H3, a downstream marker for chromosome condensation and entry into mitosis. We also identified two saRNAs that activated the expression of CXCR4 in primary rat adipose–derived stem cells. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that RNAa exists in mammalian species other than human. Our findings also suggest that nonhuman primate disease models may have clinical applicability for validating RNAa-based drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1973368497,"Background Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D elicits both transcriptional events and rapid non genomic effects. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) localization and mechanisms of VDR-triggered non genomic responses are still controversial. Although anticoagulant effects of vitamin D have been reported and VDR signalling has been characterized in monocytes and vascular cells, nothing is known about VDR expression and functions in human platelets, anucleated fragments of megakaryocytes which are known targets of other steroids. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we characterized the expression and cellular localization of VDR in human platelets and in a megakaryocyte lineage. Human platelets and their TPA-differentiated precursors expressed a classical 50 kDa VDR protein, which increased with megakaryocytes maturation. By biochemical fractionation studies we demonstrated the presence of the receptor in the soluble and mitochondrial compartment of human platelets, and the observation was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy analysis. Similar localization was found in mature megakaryocytes, where besides its classical nuclear localization the receptor was evident as soluble and mitochondria resident protein. Conclusions The results reported here suggest that megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet activation, which are calcium-dependent events, might be modulated by a mitochondrial non genomic activity of VDR. These data open challenging future studies on VDR physiological role in platelets and more generally in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2009114717,"Cancer cells constantly adapt to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) suppression resulting from hypoxia or mitochondria defects. Under the OXPHOS suppression, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates global metabolism adjustments, but its activation has been found to be transient. Whether cells can maintain cellular ATP homeostasis and survive beyond the transient AMPK activation is not known. Here, we study the bioenergetic adaptation to the OXPHOS inhibitor oligomycin in a group of cancer cells. We found that oligomycin at 100 ng/ml completely inhibits OXPHOS activity in 1 h and induces various levels of glycolysis gains by 6 h, from which we calculate the bioenergetic organizations of cancer cells. In glycolysis-dominant cells, oligomycin does not induce much energy stress as measured by glycolysis acceleration, ATP imbalance, AMPK activation, AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79), and cell growth inhibition. In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1 wild type cells, oligomycin induces 5-8% ATP drops and transient AMPK activation during the initial 1-2 h. After AMPK activation is completed, oligomycin-induced increase of acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79) is still detected, and cellular ATP is back at preoligomycin treatment levels by sustained elevation of glycolysis. Cell growth, however, is inhibited without an increase in cell death and alteration in cell cycle distribution. In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1-null cells, no AMPK activation by oligomycin is detected, yet cells still show a similar adaptation. We also demonstrate that the adaptation to oligomycin does not invoke activation of hypoxia-induced factor. Our data suggest that cancer cells may grow and survive persistent OXPHOS suppression through an as yet unidentified regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2010560182,"Background Metastatic bone disease is a frequent cause of morbidity in patients with advanced breast cancer, but the role of the bone mineral hydroxyapatite (HA) in this process remains unclear. We have developed a novel mineralized 3-D tumor model and have employed this culture system to systematically investigate the pro-metastatic role of HA under physiologically relevant conditions in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells were cultured within non-mineralized or mineralized polymeric scaffolds fabricated by a gas foaming-particulate leaching technique. Tumor cell adhesion, proliferation, and secretion of pro-osteoclastic interleukin-8 (IL-8) was increased in mineralized tumor models as compared to non-mineralized tumor models, and IL-8 secretion was more pronounced for bone-specific MDA-MB231 subpopulations relative to lung-specific breast cancer cells. These differences were pathologically significant as conditioned media collected from mineralized tumor models promoted osteoclastogenesis in an IL-8 dependent manner. Finally, drug testing and signaling studies with transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) confirmed the clinical relevance of our culture system and revealed that breast cancer cell behavior is broadly affected by HA. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that HA promotes features associated with the neoplastic and metastatic growth of breast carcinoma cells in bone and that IL-8 may play an important role in this process. The developed mineralized tumor models may help to reveal the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that may ultimately enable more efficacious therapy of patients with advanced breast cancer."

Here, we used a well-established sheep model to investigate the effects of maternal obesity on cardiac functions. Multiparous ewes were assigned to a control (CON) diet [100% of National Research Council (NRC) recommendations] or an obesogenic (OB) diet (150% of NRC recommendations) from 60 d before conception to necropsy on d 135 of pregnancy. Fetal blood glucose and insulin were increased (P<0.01, n=8) in OB (35.09+/-2.03 mg/dl and 3.40+/-1.43 microU/ml, respectively) vs. CON ewes (23.80+/-1.38 mg/dl and 0.769+/-0.256 microU/ml). Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cardioprotective signaling pathway, was reduced (P<0.05), while the stress signaling pathway, p38 MAPK, was up-regulated (P<0.05) in OB maternal and fetal hearts. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser-307 were increased (P<0.05) in OB fetal heart associated with lower downstream PI3K-Akt activity (P<0.05), indicating impaired cardiac insulin signaling. Although OB fetal hearts exhibited a normal contractile function vs. CON fetal hearts during basal perfusion, they developed an impaired heart-rate-left-ventricular-developed pressure product in response to high workload stress. Taken together, fetuses of OB mothers demonstrate alterations in cardiac PI3K-Akt, AMPK, and JNK-IRS-1 signaling pathways that would predispose them to insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2105990535,"The accumulation of the intermediate filament protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in astrocytes of Alexander disease (AxD) impairs proteasome function in astrocytes. We have explored the molecular mechanism that underlies the proteasome inhibition. We find that both assembled and unassembled wild type (wt) and R239C mutant GFAP protein interacts with the 20 S proteasome complex and that the R239C AxD mutation does not interfere with this interaction. However, the R239C GFAP accumulates to higher levels and forms more protein aggregates than wt protein. These aggregates bind components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and, thus, may deplete the cytosolic stores of these proteins. We also find that the R239C GFAP has a greater inhibitory effect on proteasome system than wt GFAP. Using a ubiquitin-independent degradation assay in vitro, we observed that the proteasome cannot efficiently degrade unassembled R239C GFAP, and the interaction of R239C GFAP with proteasomes actually inhibits proteasomal protease activity. The small heat shock protein, αB-crystallin, which accumulates massively in AxD astrocytes, reverses the inhibitory effects of R239C GFAP on proteasome activity and promotes degradation of the mutant GFAP, apparently by shifting the size of the mutant protein from larger oligomers to smaller oligomers and monomers.

Because of the loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes and a variable loss of neurons, AxD has been historically thought of as a leukodystrophy or neurodegenerative disorder. AxD is, however, a disease of astrocyte dysfunction, as mutations in GFAP are found in the large majority of AxD patients (2.Li R. Johnson A.B. Salomons G. Goldman J.E. Naidu S. Quinlan R. Cree B. Ruyle S.Z. Banwell B. D'Hooghe M. Siebert J.R. Rolf C.M. Cox H. Reddy A. Gutiérrez-Solana L.G. Collins A. Weller R.O. Messing A. van der Knaap M.S. Brenner M. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 310-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). All mutations detected so far are heterozygous coding mutations, and most cases of AxD disease arise through de novo, dominant, GFAP mutations (2.Li R. Johnson A.B. Salomons G. Goldman J.E. Naidu S. Quinlan R. Cree B. Ruyle S.Z. Banwell B. D'Hooghe M. Siebert J.R. Rolf C.M. Cox H. Reddy A. Gutiérrez-Solana L.G. Collins A. Weller R.O. Messing A. van der Knaap M.S. Brenner M. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 310-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Most of the AxD mutations reside in the 1A, 2A, and 2B segments of the conserved central rod domain of GFAP, but several are located in the tail region (2.Li R. Johnson A.B. Salomons G. Goldman J.E. Naidu S. Quinlan R. Cree B. Ruyle S.Z. Banwell B. D'Hooghe M. Siebert J.R. Rolf C.M. Cox H. Reddy A. Gutiérrez-Solana L.G. Collins A. Weller R.O. Messing A. van der Knaap M.S. Brenner M. Ann.

The Arg-239 residue is a “hot spot” for GFAP mutagenesis, as substitutions at this arginine are the most frequent mutations found in AxD and appear among different ethnic groups (2.Li R. Johnson A.B.

Messing A. van der Knaap M.S. Brenner M. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 310-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our previous work has concentrated on the most common substitution, R239C, and has demonstrated that overexpressing GFAP, either wild type (wt) or the R239C mutant, leads to the formation of intracellular protein aggregates (3.Koyama Y. Goldman J.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1563-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4.Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Der Perng M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J.

GFAP accumulation also inhibited proteasome protease activity and increased levels of ubiquitinated GFAP species (5.Tang G. Xu Z. Goldman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38634-38643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although overexpressing wt GFAP can lead to intracellular protein aggregates, the R239C mutation exacerbates GFAP accumulation and aggregation and aggravates the effects of GFAP accumulation in inducing intracellular stress responses and in inhibiting proteasome activities (5.Tang G. Xu Z. Goldman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38634-38643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present study we have explored the mechanisms that underlie the impaired proteasome function by GFAP accumulation. We asked if GFAP interacted with proteasomes in cells and in vitro and further asked if this interaction resulted in proteasome inhibition. Finally, we examined if αB-crystallin, a shsp and molecular chaperone, could reverse the GFAP-mediated proteasome inhibition. Both assembled (10-nm wide polymers) and unassembled (soluble at 80,000 × g) GFAP protein, both wild type and mutant, interact with the 20 S proteasome complex. The unassembled GFAP includes a mix of monomeric and oligomeric forms. Compared with the wt GFAP, the unassembled R239C GFAP showed a marked shift toward larger oligomers. In addition, the unassembled R239C had a far greater inhibitory effect on proteasome proteolytic activity in vitro than did the wt GFAP. The addition of αB-crystallin, which accumulates massively in AxD astrocytes, reversed the inhibitory effects of the R239C GFAP on proteasome activity. αB-Crystallin also changed the oligomer-monomer distribution of the R239C GFAP to a point at which it appeared identical to that of the wt GFAP. Our observations direct a focus on oligomeric forms of GFAP as effective proteasome inhibitors and suggest mechanisms that underlie the proteasome inhibition in astrocytes of the AxD brain. In addition, because the R239C GFAP aggregates could bind components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, they may deplete the cytosolic stores of these proteins. Cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and molecular biological reagents were obtained from Invitrogen and Qiagen. Primary antibodies included anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody (pAb, DAKO), anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-αB-crystallin pAb, anti-ubiquitin mAb (Chemicon), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mAb (Encor), and anti-20 S pAb (Biomol). The fluorescence-conjugated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Chemicon and Amersham Biosciences. Imidazole-HCl, EDTA, MG132, lactacystin, camptothecin, anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel and protein G-Sepharose were from Sigma. Tissues stored at −80 °C from cerebral hemispheric white matter of control subjects or AxD cases with different mutations were obtained postmortem. For immunohistochemistry, the tissue was fixed in formalin and then embedded in paraffin. All AxD cases were diagnosed based on histopathological examination and confirmed by the molecular genetic analysis for GFAP mutation. Controls included frozen central nervous system tissue from two children, one with no neurological disease (Control I) and one with Werdnig-Hoffman disease (non-AxD, non-leukodystrophy neurological disease without Rosenthal fibers) (Control II). cDNA clones encoding wt GFAP or R239C mt GFAP were inserted into EGFP-C1 expression vector for expressing a GFP-GFAP fusion protein. To generate permanent cell lines, U251 astrocytoma cells were transfected with the GFAP-GFP plasmid using calcium phosphate. The transfected cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplement with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and 500 μg/ml G418. Clonal lines of stably transfected cells were isolated and confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting or Western blot analysis. MG132 (10 μm) and lactacystin (10 μm) were added to cultures at 24 h post-transfection and incubated for a further 24 h, with DMSO as the vehicle control. For protein extraction and fractionation, brain tissue or cells were lysed in total cell lysis buffer (2% w/v SDS, 6.25% mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA supplemented with a Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture tablet) for total protein or in fractional lysis buffer to separate soluble and insoluble fraction. Briefly, cells or brain tissues were recovered in S1 buffer (0.5% v/v Triton X, 2 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, and sucrose implemented with Complete Mini Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected as the “soluble” fraction, and the pellet (“insoluble” fraction) was recovered in S2 buffer (2% w/v SDS, 2 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation, Cos7 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged wt and R239C GFAP or vector only. Immunoprecipitations were performed 48 h post-transfection. Equal amounts of protein from whole cell extract soluble fractions were diluted in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (6.Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and were incubated with anti-FLAGM2-agarose gel or anti-20 S antibody and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. Brain tissues and cells were homogenized in ice-cold proteolysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.035% SDS, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with proteasome substrate II (S-II: benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-amidomethylcoumarin) or III (S-III: Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin) to detect the peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolase (PGPH) and chymotrypsin-like peptidase activities, respectively. Fluorescence was monitored at 360-nm excitation and 450-nm emission in a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek FL600). Immunostaining of cultured cells was performed at 48 h after transfection as described before (4.Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Der Perng M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A cytoskeleton buffer (PHEM buffer: 100 mm Pipes, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.8) was utilized to characterize the cytoskeleton. Cells were visualized by a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Immunohistochemistry was performed according to general protocols. 10-μm-thick consecutive sections were prepared. Sections were blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween, 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and subsequently incubated with antibodies against the 20 S proteasome complex (1:100), αB-crystallin (1:100) ubiquitin (1:100), and GFAP (1:200) overnight at 4 °C. Negative control sections were held in phosphate-buffered saline during the primary incubation. Sections were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody 1 h at room temperature and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Recombinant human wt and R239C GFAP were purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and assembled in vitro as before (7.Perng M.D. Muchowski P.J. van Den IJssel P. Wu G.J. Hutcheson A.M. Clark J.I. Quinlan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33235-33243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The assembled wt or R239C GFAP filaments were incubated with purified 20 S proteasomes (8.Wilk, S., Chen, W. E. (2001) Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. Chapter 21, Unit 21.6Google Scholar) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Samples were then separated into pellet and supernatant fractions by ultracentrifugation at 80,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and assayed by Western blotting. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We first assessed the proteasome protease activities in the U251 astrocytoma cell line stably transfected with control, wt GFAP, and R239C GFAP expression vectors. In comparing cells transfected with vector only (used as control and set to 100% activity), the PGPH activity was reduced in cells expressing wt GFAP (p < 0.05) and further in those expressing R239C GFAP (p < 0.01), whereas the chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity showed a non-significant reduction in wt and a modest reduction in R239C cells (p < 0.01, Fig. 1A). The decreased proteasome activity due to GFAP accumulation was not caused by the loss or reduction of proteasome complexes as the total amount of the 20 S complex remained the same in the vector-transfected cells and the GFAP-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). However, we observed a shift of 20 S complex from a Triton X-100-soluble fraction to the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1C). We detected significantly decreased PGPH and chymotrypsin-like protease activities in white matter from AxD patients with the R239C, R416W, and R239H mutations (Fig. 1D), although 20 S complex protein levels were at the same levels or increased compared with that in white matter without Rosenthal fibers from a non-AxD subject (Fig. 1E). The 20 S proteasome complex has been reported to be associated with aggresomes, intracellular protein aggregates formed by misfolded proteins (9.Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). In the U251 cells, the GFAP inclusions were labeled with antibodies to the proteasomal 20 S complex and to ubiquitin (Fig. 2A). Many more of the cells expressing the R239C GFAP showed inclusions compared with cells expressing wt GFAP (Fig. 2D). Treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors increased GFAP levels and increased the proportion of cells that contained inclusions (Fig. 2, C and D). When we examined sections from the brains of AxD patients, we found a similar distribution of GFAP, the 20 S proteasome and Rosenthal fibers (Fig. 2B). Because this similar distribution can only suggest, but cannot prove physical interactions among these components, we looked at cell and in vitro systems (see below). Based on the fact that proteasomes associate with different types of intermediate filaments, including keratin, desmin, and vimentin (10.Grossi de Sa M.F. Martins de Sa C. Harper F. Olink-Coux M. Huesca M. Scherrer K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1517-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11.Olink-Coux M. Arcangeletti C. Pinardi F. Minisini R. Huesca M. Chezzi C. Scherrer K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 353-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we inferred that, as a type III intermediate filament, GFAPs may interact with 20 S proteasome complexes, and the interaction of proteasome complexes with the accumulated GFAP might interrupt the normal proteasome function. To address this possibility, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitations in Cos7 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged wt or R239C GFAP. Because it has been reported that some proteasomes are present in the Triton X-100-soluble membrane and cytosolic fractions (12.Arcangeletti C. Sütterlin R. Aebi U. De Conto F. Missorini S. Chezzi C. Scherrer K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 35-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we looked for GFAP-20 S complexes in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions of Cos7 cells (Fig. 3A). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations using anti-20 S antibodies and anti-FLAG antibodies revealed that both wt and R239C GFAPs were present in complexes with 20 S proteasomes. Protein A-Sepharose beads without anti-20 S antibodies were used as a background control, as were non-transfected Cos7 cells and Cos7 cells transfected with the empty vector. Note that the polymerized GFAP intermediate filaments were excluded from this assay, as they are part of the Triton X-100-insoluble, cytoskeletal network, which is also insoluble in immunoprecipitation buffer. However, when we treated the cells first with a cytoskeleton buffer (PHEM, containing 0.5% Triton X), which extracts soluble proteins, double immunofluorescence examination showed that proteasomes continued to associate with GFAP inclusions even when soluble, cytoplasmic proteins were removed (Fig. 3B), suggesting that some of the 20 S subunits associated with cytoskeletal GFAP. To determine whether GFAP intermediate filaments will associate directly with proteasomes, we turned to in vitro analyses, first using a co-sedimentation assay (7.Perng M.D. Muchowski P.J. van Den IJssel P. Wu G.J. Hutcheson A.M. Clark J.I. Quinlan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33235-33243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Purified 20 S proteasome complexes were incubated with in vitro assembled wt or R239C GFAP filaments at a weight ratio of 1:1 or without GFAP (as a control) for 1.5 h. The samples were centrifuged at 80,000 × g in 40% sucrose, washed with assembly buffer and the PHEM buffer, and finally resolved by SDS-PAGE. Nitrocellulose blots were probed with an anti-20 S antibody and then re-probed with an anti-GFAP antibody. The 20 S proteasomes incubated without GFAP could not be recovered in the pellet fraction (Fig. 3C). In contrast, when incubated with assembled wt or R239C GFAP filaments, a fraction of the 20 S proteasomes co-sedimented with the GFAP (Fig. 3C). This result revealed a direct association between proteasomes and GFAP filaments. Note that the R239C mutation apparently does not interfere with this binding. Our data above indicated a direct interaction between GFAP and proteasome complexes, but we could not discern if the interaction interrupts proteasome function. To address this possibility, we performed an in vitro ubiquitin-independent proteasome degradation assay by examining the activity of purified 20 S proteasomes in the presence of recombinant wt GFAP, R239C GFAP, or MG132, again using fluorescent substrates to monitor proteasomal protease activity. We first examined how soluble wt and R239C GFAPs (separated from pelleted, assembled wt and R239C GFAPs by centrifugation in 40% sucrose at 80,000 × g as described above) affected proteasome function. wt and R239C GFAPs were isolated from the top layers and were incubated at identical concentrations with purified 20 S proteasome for 30 min. We then added fluorescent substrates and 30 min later analyzed the samples. Compared with those incubated with substrates only, 20 S proteasome complexes exposed to R239C GFAP showed a significantly decreased activity. In contrast, wt GFAP showed less inhibitory effects on 20 S proteasome activity (Fig. 3D). In the positive control, MG132-treated proteasomes were almost completely inhibited. We also assessed the effect of assembled wt and R239C GFAPs on 20 S proteasome activity. In vitro assembled wt or R239C GFAP filaments were separated from soluble GFAP by centrifugation and preincubated with purified 20 S proteasome complexes. The fluorescent substrates were added to examine proteasomal proteolytic activity. Compared with MG132-treated samples and the negative control, the R239C GFAP filaments exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on proteasomes, whereas the wt GFAP filaments only slightly inhibited PGPH protease activity (Fig. 3D). However, these inhibitory effects were far less than those produced by non-assembled GFAP on a weight/weight basis. This result suggested that the inhibition of proteasomes by R239C GFAP might be predominantly attributed to soluble GFAPs. In all of the proteasome inhibition experiments we kept the GFAP concentration between 0.25 mg/ml (50 μg/200 μl) and 1 mg/ml (200 μg/200 μl), which we believe is within the physiological range given the following estimates. GFAP represents about 1.0% of total brain protein in the adult rat (13.Malloch G.D. Clark J.B. Burnet F.R. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If brain is ∼11% protein and 9% protein by wet weight in adult rat and human, respectively (14.Banay-Schwartz M. Kenessey A. DeGuzman T. Lajtha A. Palkovits M. Age. 1992; 15: 51-54Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or about 90 mg/ml, the GFAP concentration would be 0.90 mg/ml. If astrocytes take up about 10% of brain volume (15.Reichenbach A. Wolburg H. Kettenmann H. Ransom B. Neuroglia. Oxford University Press, Oxford2005: 19-35Google Scholar) and as GFAP is only found in astrocytes, the GFAP concentration in astrocytes is in the order of 9.0 mg/ml (may be higher in white matter astrocytes, as their GFAP content is greater than that of gray matter astrocytes). The central nervous system in patients with AxD contains markedly increased amounts of GFAP, up by at least 10-fold, thus, giving a GFAP concentration of 90 mg/ml. The soluble GFAP is operationally defined as material that does not pellet at a specified g force and in a normal brain represents a small fraction of the total GFAP. Thus, in the adult rat brain after Triton X-100 solubilization and centrifugation at 180,000 × g, about 0.8% of the total GFAP appears in the soluble fraction (13.Malloch G.D. Clark J.B. Burnet F.R. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the soluble GFAP concentration in astrocytes would be around 0.72 mg/ml. To understand how non-assembled GFAPs inhibit 20 S proteasome activity, we varied the concentration of fluorogenic substrates at a constant concentration of wt or R239C GFAP and measured proteolytic activities. Purified proteasomes were incubated with soluble or polymerized wt and R239C GFAPs, and 20 min later, proteasome substrates II or III were added. For proteasomes unexposed to GFAPs, as a control, the degradation of proteasome substrates increased with increasing substrate concentration and reached a maximum activity at a concentration of 100 μm. With a further increase in substrate concentration, the proteasome activity decreased slightly (Fig. 4A), suggesting that increasing substrate concentration beyond a threshold may inhibit proteasome proteolytic activities. In the range of 100 μm substrate concentration, the activity of 20 S proteasome exposed to filamentous or unassembled wt GFAP increased with increasing substrate concentrations (Fig. 4A), similarly to the activity without GFAP, although there appeared to be some small inhibition at higher SII substrate levels. These data indicate that the proteasomal inhibition that we observed before was not a false positive result from substrate binding and substrate sequestration. Thus, GFAP seems to inhibit the proteasome activity via an interaction with the proteasome rather than by binding substrate peptide. The R239C GFAP produced a significant inhibition of proteasome activity, with the unassembled (soluble) GFAP exhibiting the greatest effect (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, proteasome activity did not continue to increase with increasing concentrations of substrate, suggesting that the interaction between soluble R239C GFAP and proteasomes produced a non-competitive inhibition of proteasome activity. Next, we assayed the PGPH and chymotrypsin-like protease activities at different GFAP concentrations (50, 100,150, 200 μg/200-μl total reaction volume), with the fluorescent peptide substrate concentration fixed at 100 μm. The R239C GFAP inhibited PGPH and chymotrypsin-like activity more than the wt GFAP at all GFAP concentrations (Fig. 4B). For example, at the 100 μg/200 μl, the R239C GFAP inhibited almost 50% of proteasome activity, whereas the wt inhibited only 10% of total activity; at 200 μg/200 μl, the R239C GFAP produced a 90% percent inhibition, whereas the wt GFAP was far less inhibitory. MG132, as a positive control, blocked the protease activity markedly (Fig. 4B). We then asked whether the wt and the R239C GFAPs could be efficiently degraded by 20 S proteasomes via a ubiquitin-independent manner in vitro. Soluble wt and R239C GFAPs were incubated with 20 S proteasomes, and products were analyzed by Western blotting. After exposure to 20 S proteasomes, a fraction of the wt GFAP was broken down into smaller fragments (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the R239C GFAP was degraded only minimally (Fig. 4C). In the presence of MG132, as a positive control, neither wt nor R239C GFAP was degraded. Thus, although both wt and R239C GFAP can interact with proteasome 20 S complexes, the R239C GFAP cannot be efficiently degraded. We then asked if αB-crystallin could rescue proteasome function from the R239C GFAP toxicity. We incubated purified 20 S proteasomes with soluble or aggregated wt or R239C mt GFAPs in the presence or absence of αB-crystallin (at a weight/weight ratio of GFAP to αB-crystallin of 1:2) and then analyzed the PGPH and chymotrypsin-like proteasome proteolytic activities. At the GFAP concentration used here (100 μg/200 μl), the soluble R239C GFAP inhibited both PGPH and chymotrypsin activities, and the pelleted R239C GFAP produced a milder inhibition (Fig. 5A). The introduction of recombinant αB-crystallin attenuated the toxicity of R239C GFAP on proteasome activities (Fig. 5A). To validate the protective effects of αB-crystallin on proteasome function in vivo, we increased intracellular αB-crystallin levels using a recombinant adenovirus in U251 cells stably expressing R239C GFAP. By determining the proteasome activity using fluorescent substrates, we found that the overexpression of exogenous αB-crystallin attenuated the proteasome toxicity induced by R239C GFAP (Fig. 5B). As visualized by immunofluorescence, the overexpressed αB-crystallin dispersed the GFAP aggregates and shifted them into filamentous structures (Fig. 5C). The R239C mutant GFAP can assemble into 10-nm filaments, like the wt GFAP (4.Hsiao V.C. Tian R. Long H. Der Perng M. Brenner M. Quinlan R.A. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, a fraction of the GFAP remains in suspension after centrifuging the reassembled GFAP at 80,000 × g, as noted above. This soluble GFAP fraction was electrophoresed through a non-SDS, non-reducing 8% PAGE gel and then immunoblotted to reveal the different GFAP species. The soluble wt GFAP resolved as a mix of monomers (50 kDa) and higher molecular mass bands, the two main ones representing dimers and tetramers (Fig. 5D, left panel). In contrast, the R239C GFAP showed a pronounced shift to higher molecular mass forms (∼200–300 kDa, perhaps reflecting 4–6 GFAP molecules). When we added αB-crystallin to the soluble R239C GFAP and then electrophoresed the protein, we found a pattern of GFAP monomers and oligomers much more similar to that of the wt GFAP (Fig. 5D, right panel). We then asked if αB-crystallin would promote more proteolytic degradation of the R239C GFAP by the 20 S proteasome. When the soluble R239C GFAP was preincubated with αB-crystallin, we found that the degree of proteolytic breakdown of the GFAP was now similar to that of the wt GFAP (Fig. 5, E and F). Thus, α"

In order to induce immune responses that cover the major antigenic polymorphisms, FVO and 3D7 recombinant proteins of MSP142 were mixed (MSP142-C1). To improve the level of antibody response, MSP142-C1 was formulated with Alhydrogel plus the novel adjuvant CPG 7909. Methods A Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted in healthy malaria-naïve adults at the Center for Immunization Research in Washington, D.C., to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MSP142-C1/Alhydrogel +/− CPG 7909. Sixty volunteers were enrolled in dose escalating cohorts and randomized to receive three vaccinations of either 40 or 160 µg protein adsorbed to Alhydrogel +/− 560 µg CPG 7909 at 0, 1 and 2 months. Results Vaccinations were well tolerated, with only one related adverse event graded as severe (Grade 3 injection site erythema) and all other vaccine related adverse events graded as either mild or moderate. Local adverse events were more frequent and severe in the groups receiving CPG. The addition of CPG enhanced anti-MSP142 antibody responses following vaccination by up to 49-fold two weeks after second immunization and 8-fold two weeks after the third immunization when compared to MSP142-C1/Alhydrogel alone (p<0.0001). After the third immunization, functionality of the antibody was tested by an in vitro growth inhibition assay. Inhibition was a function of antibody titer, with an average of 3% (range −2 to 10%) in the non CPG groups versus 14% (3 to 32%) in the CPG groups. Conclusion/Significance The favorable safety profile and high antibody responses induced with MSP142-C1/Alhydrogel + CPG 7909 are encouraging. MSP142-C1/Alhydrogel is being combined with other blood stage antigens and will be taken forward in a formulation adjuvanted with CPG 7909.

https://openalex.org/W2048144306,"Actin-binding proteins filamin A (FLNA) and B (FLNB) are expressed in endothelial cells and play an essential role during vascular development. In order to investigate their role in adult endothelial cell function, we initially confirmed their expression pattern in different adult mouse tissues and cultured cell lines and found that FLNB expression is concentrated mainly in endothelial cells, whereas FLNA is more ubiquitously expressed. Functionally, small interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous FLNB in human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced in vitro angiogenesis by decreasing endothelial cell migration capacity, whereas FLNA ablation did not alter these parameters. Moreover, FLNB-depleted cells increased their substrate adhesion with more focal adhesions. The molecular mechanism underlying this effect implicates modulation of small GTP-binding protein Rac-1 localization and activity, with altered activation of its downstream effectors p21 protein Cdc42/Rac-activated kinase (PAK)-4/5/6 and its activating guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav-2. Moreover, our results suggest the existence of a signaling complex, including FLNB, Rac-1, and Vav-2, under basal conditions that would further interact with VEGFR2 and integrin alphavbeta5 after VEGF stimulation. In conclusion, our results reveal a crucial role for FLNB in endothelial cell migration and in the angiogenic process in adult endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2160331473,"Targeting of genes in mice, a key approach to study development and disease, often leaves a neo cassette, loxP, or FRT sites inserted in the mouse genome. Insertion of neo can influence the expression of neighboring genes, but similar effects have not been reported for loxP sites. We therefore performed microarray analyses of mice in which the Ncam or the Tnr gene were targeted either by insertion of neo or loxP/FRT sites. In the case of Ncam, neo, but not loxP/FRT insertion, led to a 2-fold reduction in mRNA levels of 3 genes located at distances between 0.2 and 3.1 Mb from the target. In contrast, after introduction of loxP/FRT sites into introns of Tnr, we observed a 2.5- to 4-fold reduction in the transcript level of the Gas5 gene, 1.1 Mb away from Tnr, most probably due to disruption of a conserved regulatory element in Tnr. Insertion of short DNA sequences such as loxP/FRT can thus influence off-target mRNA levels if these sites are accidentally placed into regulatory elements. Our results imply that conditional knockout mice should be analyzed for genomic positional side effects that may influence the animals’ phenotypes.—Meier, I.

However, the physical act of sex may modulate gel distribution, and preclinical studies demonstrate seminal plasma interferes with the antiviral activity of several microbicides. This study compared the biological activity and concentration of PRO 2000 in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) collected in the absence or following coitus.CVL samples were collected from ten heterosexual couples at baseline, after sex, after a single dose of 0.5% PRO 2000 gel and sex, and after gel application without sex. The impact of CVL on HIV-1 infection of TZM-bl cells and HSV-2 infection of CaSki cells was monitored by luciferase and plaque assay, respectively. PRO 2000 concentrations were measured by fluorescence.CVL collected after PRO 2000 application significantly inhibited HIV-1 and HSV-2 (p = 0.01). However, the antiviral activity was reduced following sex and no significant protective effect was observed in postcoital CVL obtained in the presence compared to the absence of PRO 2000 for HIV (p = 0.45) or HSV-2 (p = 0.56). Less PRO 2000 was recovered in postcoital CVL, which, in conjunction with interference by seminal plasma, may have contributed to lower antiviral activity.Postcoital responses to PRO 2000 differ from precoital measures and the results obtained may provide insights into the clinical trial findings in which there was no significant protection against HIV-1 or HSV-2. Postcoital studies should be incorporated into clinical studies before embarking on large-scale efficacy trials."
https://openalex.org/W2130331607,"Background: Many different simulation frameworks, in different topics, need to treat realistic datasets to initialize and calibrate the system. A precise reproduction of initial states is extremely important to obtain reliable forecast from the model. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper proposes an algorithm to create an artificial population where individuals are described by their age, and are gathered in households respecting a variety of statistical constraints (distribution of household types, sizes, age of household head, difference of age between partners and among parents and children). Such a population is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent) individual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often very important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic evolution. Usual techniques from microsimulation approach cross different sources of aggregated data for generating individuals. In our case the number of combinations of different households (types, sizes, age of participants) makes it computationally difficult to use directly such methods. Hence we developed a specific algorithm to make the problem more easily tractable. Conclusions/Significance: We generate the populations of two pilot municipalities in Auvergne region (France), to illustrate the approach. The generated populations show a good agreement with the available statistical datasets (not used for the generation) and are obtained in a reasonable computational time."
https://openalex.org/W2158429932,"NADPH oxidase activator 1 (NOXA1) together with NADPH oxidase organizer 1 (NOXO1) are key regulatory subunits of the NADPH oxidase NOX1. NOX1 is expressed mainly in colon epithelial cells and could be involved in mucosal innate immunity by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Contrary to its phagocyte counterpart NOX2, the mechanisms involved in NOX1 activation and regulation remain unclear. Here we report that NOX1 activity is regulated through MAP kinase (MAPK), protein kinase C (PKC), and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of NOXA1. We identified Ser-282 as target of MAPK and Ser-172 as target of PKC and PKA in vitro and in a transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell model using site directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping analysis. In HEK293 cells, phosphorylation of these sites occurred at a basal level and down-regulated constitutive NOX1 activity. Indeed, S172A and S282A single mutants of NOXA1 significantly up-regulated constitutive NOX1-derived ROS production, and S172A/S282A double mutant further increased it, as compared to wild-type NOXA1. Furthermore, phosphorylation of NOXA1 on Ser-282 and Ser-172 decreased its binding to NOX1 and Rac1. These results demonstrated a critical role of NOXA1 phosphorylation on Ser-282 and Ser-172 in preventing NOX1 hyperactivation through the decrease of NOXA1 interaction to NOX1 and Rac1.— Kroviarski, Y., Debbabi, M., Bachoual, R., Pe´rianin, A, Gougerot-Pocidalo, M.-A, El-Benna, J., Dang, P.

https://openalex.org/W2005790733,"Hsp90 and tubulin are among the most abundant proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. Although Hsp90 plays key roles in maintaining its client proteins in their active state, tubulin is essential for fundamental processes such as cell morphogenesis and division. Several studies have suggested a possible connection between Hsp90 and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Because tubulin is a labile protein in its soluble form, we investigated whether Hsp90 protects it against thermal denaturation. Both proteins were purified from porcine brain, and their interaction was characterized in vitro by using spectrophotometry, sedimentation assays, video-enhanced differential interference contrast light microscopy, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Our results show that Hsp90 protects tubulin against thermal denaturation and keeps it in a state compatible with microtubule polymerization. We demonstrate that Hsp90 cannot resolve tubulin aggregates but that it likely binds early unfolding intermediates, preventing their aggregation. Protection was maximal at a stoichiometry of two molecules of Hsp90 for one of tubulin. This protection does not require ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsp90, but it is counteracted by geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W2106299608,"d-Ornithine 4,5-aminomutase (OAM) from Clostridium sticklandii converts d-ornithine to 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid by way of radical propagation from an adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) to a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. We have solved OAM crystal structures in different catalytic states that together demonstrate unusual stability of the AdoCbl Co-C bond and that radical catalysis is coupled to large-scale domain motion. The 2.0-Å substrate-free enzyme crystal structure reveals the Rossmann domain, harboring the intact AdoCbl cofactor, is tilted toward the edge of the PLP binding triose-phosphate isomerase barrel domain. The PLP forms an internal aldimine link to the Rossmann domain through Lys629, effectively locking the enzyme in this “open” pre-catalytic conformation. The distance between PLP and 5′-deoxyadenosyl group is 23 Å, and large-scale domain movement is thus required prior to radical catalysis. The OAM crystals contain two Rossmann domains within the asymmetric unit that are unconstrained by the crystal lattice. Surprisingly, the binding of various ligands to OAM crystals (in an oxygen-free environment) leads to transimination in the absence of significant reorientation of the Rossmann domains. In contrast, when performed under aerobic conditions, this leads to extreme disorder in the latter domains correlated with the loss of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl group. Our data indicate turnover and hence formation of the “closed” conformation is occurring within OAM crystals, but that the equilibrium is poised toward the open conformation. We propose that substrate binding induces large-scale domain motion concomitant with a reconfiguration of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl group, triggering radical catalysis in OAM. d-Ornithine 4,5-aminomutase (OAM) from Clostridium sticklandii converts d-ornithine to 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid by way of radical propagation from an adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) to a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. We have solved OAM crystal structures in different catalytic states that together demonstrate unusual stability of the AdoCbl Co-C bond and that radical catalysis is coupled to large-scale domain motion.

Among several types of G protein-coupled receptors expressed in sensory neurons, Gi-coupled α2A-adrenoreceptor (α2A-AR), is known to be involved in thermoregulation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrated that stimulation of α2A-AR inhibited TRPM8 in sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In addition, using specific pharmacological and molecular tools combined with patch-clamp current recordings, we found that in heterologously expressed HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells, TRPM8 channel is inhibited by the Gi protein/adenylate cyclase (AC)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling cascade. We further identified the TRPM8 S9 and T17 as two key PKA phosphorylation sites regulating TRPM8 channel activity. We therefore propose that inhibition of TRPM8 through the α2A-AR signaling cascade could constitute a new mechanism of modulation of thermosensation in both physiological and pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1967780464,"We investigated the mechanisms by which chlorine (Cl(2)) and its reactive byproducts inhibit Na(+)-dependent alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) in vivo and the activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na(+) channels (ENaC) by measuring AFC in mice exposed to Cl(2) (0-500 ppm for 30 min) and Na(+) and amiloride-sensitive currents (I(Na) and I(amil), respectively) across Xenopus oocytes expressing human alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC incubated with HOCl (1-2000 microm). Both Cl(2) and HOCl-derived products decreased AFC in mice and whole cell and single channel I(Na) in a dose-dependent manner; these effects were counteracted by serine proteases. Mass spectrometry analysis of the oocyte recording medium identified organic chloramines formed by the interaction of HOCl with HEPES (used as an extracellular buffer). In addition, chloramines formed by the interaction of HOCl with taurine or glycine decreased I(Na) in a similar fashion. Preincubation of oocytes with serine proteases prevented the decrease of I(Na) by HOCl, whereas perfusion of oocytes with a synthetic 51-mer peptide corresponding to the putative furin and plasmin cleaving segment in the gamma-ENaC subunit restored the ability of HOCl to inhibit I(Na). Finally, I(Na) of oocytes expressing wild type alpha- and gamma-ENaC and a mutant form of beta ENaC (S520K), known to result in ENaC channels locked in the open position, were not altered by HOCl. We concluded that HOCl and its reactive intermediates (such as organic chloramines) inhibit ENaC by affecting channel gating, which could be relieved by proteases cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2047425894,"Ack1 is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that participates in tumorigenesis, cell survival, and migration. Relatively little is known about the mechanisms that regulate Ack1 activity. Recently, four somatic missense mutations of Ack1 were identified in cancer tissue samples, but the effects on Ack1 activity, and function have not been described. These mutations occur in the N-terminal region, the C-lobe of the kinase domain, and the SH3 domain. Here, we show that the cancer-associated mutations increase Ack1 autophosphorylation in mammalian cells without affecting localization and increase Ack1 activity in immune complex kinase assays. The cancer-associated mutations potentiate the ability of Ack1 to promote proliferation and migration, suggesting that point mutation is a mechanism for Ack1 deregulation. We propose that the C-terminal Mig6 homology region (MHR) (residues 802–990) participates in inhibitory intramolecular interactions. The isolated kinase domain of Ack1 interacts directly with the MHR, and the cancer-associated E346K mutation prevents binding. Likewise, mutation of a key hydrophobic residue in the MHR (Phe820) prevents the MHR-kinase interaction, activates Ack1, and increases cell migration. Thus, the cancer-associated mutation E346K appears to destabilize an autoinhibited conformation of Ack1, leading to constitutively high Ack1 activity.

Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Ack1 belongs to a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that includes Ack1, Tnk, and homologous proteins in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (2.Hoehn G.T. Stokland T. Amin S. Ramírez M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9796-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a kinase domain, an SH3 domain, and a Cdc42-binding domain (CRIB) (see Fig. 1A). The large C-terminal portion of Ack1 contains several proline-rich sequences as well as a clathrin-binding motif (6.Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin-binding domain (7.Shen F. Lin Q. Gu Y. Childress C. Yang W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and a region homologous to Mig6 (8.Zhang X. Pickin K.A. Bose R. Jura N. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2007; 450: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The domain architecture of Ack1 is unique among NRTKs; it is the only NRTK with a CRIB domain, and the position of the SH3 domain (C-terminal to the kinase domain) differs from all other families of NRTKs.Recent data implicate Ack1 in different stages of cancer. Amplification of the Ack1 gene correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis in lung and prostate cancer, and overexpression increases invasiveness (9.van der Horst E.H. Degenhardt Y.Y. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf J. Rong M. Li S. See L.H. Nguyen K.Q. Hoey T. Wesche H. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15901-15906Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In v-Ras-transformed mammalian cells, Ack1 is required for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype (10.Nur-E-Kamal A. Zhang A. Keenan S.M. Wang X.I. Seraj J. Satoh T. Meiners S. Welsh W.J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ack1 contributes to prostate tumorigenesis by phosphorylating the tumor suppressor protein Wwox, leading to its degradation (11.Mahajan N.P. Whang Y.E. Mohler J.L. Earp H.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10514-10523Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and by phosphorylating androgen receptor (12.Mahajan N.P. Liu Y. Majumder S. Warren M.R. Parker C.E. Mohler J.L.

Upon EGF stimulation, Ack1 phosphorylates and activates the guanine exchange factor Dbl (16.Kato-Stankiewicz J. Ueda S. Kataoka T. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In response to Cdc42 activation, Ack1 mediates phosphorylation of p130Cas to promote cell migration (17.Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Simpson M.A. Keely P.J. Guan J.L. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E. Furcht L.T. Iida J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18.Modzelewska K.

A number of SH3-containing proteins have been identified as ligands for the proline-rich region of Ack1, including the SH3 domains of Hck (21.Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 8185-8194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the physiological functions of Ack1 are not completely understood, several studies have focused on the role of Ack1 in EGF receptor trafficking and dynamics. Ack1 is recruited to EGFR following EGF stimulation, and overexpression of Ack1 interferes with the proper trafficking of EGFR (24.Gr⊘vdal L.M. Johannessen L.E. R⊘dland M.S. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). EGFR stability is regulated by interactions between Ack1 and multiple partner proteins including ubiquitin (7.Shen F. Lin Q. Gu Y. Childress C. Yang W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), clathrin heavy chain (6.Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol.

J. 2006; 394: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The activities of other NRTKs are controlled through intramolecular interactions and by conformational changes in the kinase activation loops (27.Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). In Src family kinases, the inactive conformation is stabilized by an interaction between the SH3 domain and a polyproline type II helix and an interaction between the SH2 domain and the C-terminal phosphotyrosine (28.Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 29.Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Activating signals (such as SH3 or SH2 ligands) disrupt these interactions and promote the phosphorylation of Tyr416 in the activation loop of Src (30.Liu X. Brodeur S.R. Gish G. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Laudano A.P. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1119-1126PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In c-Abl, the SH2 and SH3 domains also participate in autoinhibitory interactions. These interactions are stabilized by an N-terminal cap region and by an interaction between the N-terminal myristoyl group and the base of the kinase catalytic domain (34.Pluk H. Dorey K. Superti-Furga G. Cell. 2002; 108: 247-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Based on the distinctive domain organization of Ack1, the regulatory mechanisms are likely to be divergent from the Src and Abl family paradigm.Using purified Ack1, we previously showed that the major autophosphorylation site is Tyr284 in the activation loop (21.Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the isolated kinase domain of Ack1 has been solved in both the phosphorylated (Tyr(P)284) and unphosphorylated forms (35.Lougheed J.C. Chen R.H. Mak P. Stout T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44039-44045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In both of these structures, the conformation of the activation loop resembles the conformation seen in other active kinases. Phosphorylation of Tyr284 in Ack1 stimulates kinase activity (21.Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but not as strongly as in Src or Abl NRTKs. Thus, the regulatory importance of Ack1 autophosphorylation appears to be intermediate between Src/Abl (strongly phosphorylation-dependent) (35.Lougheed J.C. Chen R.H. Mak P. Stout T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44039-44045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and kinases such as EGFR or Cdks (in which formation of the activated state is phosphorylation-independent) (36.Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar, 37.Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev.

Ligands for the SH3 or the CRIB domains of Ack1 do not activate the purified enzyme (21.Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); thus, the regulatory mechanism for Ack1 is poorly understood at present.Recently, the genes encoding 518 protein kinases were sequenced in a large collection of human cancers to identify somatic mutations (39.Greenman C. Stephens P. Smith R. Dalgliesh G.L. Hunter C. Bignell G. Davies H. Teague J. Butler A. Stevens C. Edkins S. O'Meara S. Vastrik I. Schmidt E.E. Avis T. Barthorpe S. Bhamra G. Buck G. Choudhury B.

Four missense mutations were identified in Ack1: two mutations in the N terminus (R34L and R99Q) were identified in lung adenocarcinoma and ovarian carcinoma, respectively; a mutation in the kinase catalytic domain (E346K) was identified in ovarian endometroid carcinoma; and a mutation in the SH3 domain (M409I) was found in gastric adenocarcinoma. The probability of each mutation being a driver (i.e. a mutation that confers an advantage to the cancer cell and that is therefore subject to positive selection pressure) was estimated by comparing the rate of nonsynonymous and synonymous somatic mutations in each gene. The genes were ranked according to their probability of carrying at least one driver mutation, and Ack1 ranked in the top 5%. The effect of these mutations on Ack1 activity and downstream signaling is unknown.The aims of this study were: 1) to test the effects of the cancer-associated mutations on Ack1 function and activity and 2) to use the mutations to gain insight into the regulation of Ack1. We report that cancer-associated mutations stimulate Ack1 activity without affecting its subcellular localization, suggesting that point mutations represent a new mechanism for the oncogenic activation of Ack1. Moreover, we propose that an autoinhibitory interaction exists between the kinase domain and the C-terminal Mig6 homology region and that mutations that disrupt this interaction (such as the cancer-associated mutation E346K) activate Ack1.DISCUSSIONAck1 has previously been implicated in tumorigenesis (11.Mahajan N.P.

Welsh W.J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and metastasis (9.van der Horst E.H. Degenhardt Y.Y. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf J. Rong M. Li S.

The Ack1 gene is amplified and overexpressed in a number of tumors, and the copy number change correlates with later stage, more aggressive tumors (9.van der Horst E.H. Degenhardt Y.Y. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf J. Rong M. Li S. See L.H. Nguyen K.Q. Hoey T. Wesche H. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15901-15906Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Prior to this study, it was not clear whether mutations represent an additional mechanism for the oncogenic activation of Ack1. The four nonsynonymous mutations in Ack1 studied in this paper were identified in a study in which 210 cancer tissue samples were screened for somatic mutations in protein kinase genes (39.Greenman C. Stephens P. Smith R. Dalgliesh G.L. Hunter C. Bignell G. Davies H. Teague J. Butler A. Stevens C. Edkins S. O'Meara S. Vastrik I. Schmidt E.E. Avis T. Barthorpe S. Bhamra G. Buck G. Choudhury B.

Using this approach, Ack1 emerged as a likely candidate to carry driver mutations. We show here that point mutations activate Ack1 and that cells expressing the cancer-associated mutants exhibit aspects of the transformed phenotype. Mutations located in the N terminus (R34L and R99Q), in the C-lobe of the kinase domain (E346K), and in the SH3 domain (M409I) activated Ack1 in functional and biochemical assays. Our data reinforce the previous characterization of Ack1 as an oncogene and suggest that the somatic mutations may contribute to cancer development.Consistent with published data (9.van der Horst E.H. Degenhardt Y.Y. Strelow A. Slavin A. Chinn L. Orf J. Rong M. Li S. See L.H. Nguyen K.Q. Hoey T. Wesche H. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15901-15906Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we found that the overexpression of wild type Ack1 promotes the transformed phenotype. Cells overexpressing WT Ack1 showed higher levels of migration than control cells (Fig. 5). The expression of WT Ack1 also caused a loss of contact inhibition in cells growing attached to a surface and allowed the cells to survive in nonanchored conditions (Fig. 4). Our studies were carried out in NIH3T3 cells, and they are similar to the results obtained in human mammary epithelial cells and in 4T1 mouse mammary tumor cells, suggesting that Ack1 promotes cell growth and migration independently of cell context.The two cancer-associated mutations located in the N terminus of Ack1 increased the level of Ack1 autophosphorylation in cells (Fig. 1B). This was due to enhanced Ack1 kinase activity, because the mutants also phosphorylated a synthetic peptide at a higher rate (Fig. 1C). Neither of the N-terminal mutations displayed any significant enhancement of anchored or nonanchored growth over the level observed with WT Ack1. On the other hand, the R34L mutation did increase the effect of Ack1 on cell migration. The N terminus of Ack1 contains a region that was identified as a SAM domain and as a membrane localization motif (5.Galisteo M.L. Yang Y. Ureña J. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9796-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The observed activation of Ack1 by these mutations could potentially have been explained by the mislocalization of Ack1 caused by the disruption of the membrane localization domain. However, the intracellular localization of Ack1 was not affected by the cancer-associated mutations located in the N terminus (Fig. 2). Thus, our data indicate that the R34L and R99Q mutations increase Ack1 autophosphorylation and activity. Although the mechanism is not clear, one possibility is that the N-terminal mutations disrupt an inhibitory interaction. This putative interaction could be either intramolecular or intermolecular (in the latter case, involving other molecules or the formation of an Ack1 homodimer). SAM domains share an overall secondary structure rich in α-helices and have been found in more than 1000 proteins, including the Eph family of tyrosine kinase receptors (46.Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 47.Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U.

Biol. 2002; 9: 453-457PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of several SAM domains have been solved, and they form dimeric and polymeric associations. Although the biological roles of these interactions are not yet clear for all of the SAM-containing proteins, diacylglycerol kinase δ was reported to be regulated by SAM-mediated polymerization (48.Harada B.T.

The deletion of the N-terminal portion of Ack1 reduces the ability of full-length Ack1 to undergo autophosphorylation (5.Galisteo M.L. Yang Y. Ureña J. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9796-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We speculate that the N-terminal SAM domain may be involved in protein-protein interactions that play a role in Ack1 regulation and that cancer-associated mutations in this region disrupt the normal regulation mechanism, rendering the enzyme more active. Future studies will be focused on the role of the N-terminal region in Ack1 regulation.The cancer-associated mutation M409I, located in the SH3 domain of Ack1, activated cellular autophosphorylation of Ack1 and promoted increased cell migration as compared with WT Ack1. On the other hand, the effect of this mutation on cell proliferation did not significantly differ from the effect of WT Ack1. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear; however, the functional assays that we used measure different biological processes. Ack1 may activate several downstream effectors and pathways through its different domains. Therefore, it is possible that the SH3 domain is involved in the regulation of motility-related rather than cell proliferation pathways. The methionine residue mutated in Ack1 is not conserved in other closely related SH3 domains, and it is not predicted to lie in the binding site for polyproline-containing ligands. Thus, the molecular basis for Ack1 activation by M409I is not understood presently.The cancer-associated mutation E346K is located in the C-lobe of the kinase domain. We found that the expression of E346K Ack1 potentiated the effects of the expression of WT Ack1 on migration and nonanchored growth. Thus, our functional data suggested that the C-terminal portion of Ack1 plays a role in its regulation. Next, we focused on the study of this region to gain insight into a regulatory mechanism that involves the kinase domain and the C-terminal Mig6 homology region.Relatively little information was previously available concerning Ack1 regulation. Ack1 autophosphorylation produced modest activation in a construct containing the N terminus, the catalytic domain, the SH3 domain, and the CRIB domain of Ack1 (21.Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, the addition of Cdc42 (ligand for CRIB domain) or poly-proline peptides (ligands for SH3 domain) did not activate this purified construct in vitro. However, in cells expressing full-length Ack1, the co-expression of Cdc42 did activate Ack1 (21.Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The introduction of point mutations into the CRIB and SH3 domains in full-length Ack1 expressed in cells also produced increased autophosphorylation, suggesting that the different domains of Ack1 participate in regulatory interactions (5.Galisteo M.L. Yang Y. Ureña J. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9796-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The structure of the kinase domain of EGFR in a complex with the inhibitor protein Mig6 (8.Zhang X. Pickin K.A. Bose R. Jura N. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2007; 450: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) suggested that the C-lobe of the kinase domain could be important for an intramolecular interaction with the Mig6 homology region located in the C terminus of Ack1 (Fig. 7B). Based on previous studies on EGFR, we introduced point mutations designed to disrupt this putative interaction. We found that point mutations located either in the C-lobe of the kinase domain (V365R) or in the Mig6 homology region (F820A) resulted in the activation of full-length Ack1 (Fig. 8, B and C). Although F820A is not a naturally occurring mutation, it was able to recapitulate the functional effects that we observed for the cancer-associated mutations. Likewise, it produced a 50% increase in cell migration and nonanchored growth (Fig. 9). The ability of the F820A mutation to produce a large (∼80-fold) increase in kinase activity suggests that previous work on Ack1, which was carried out with a construct lacking the Mig6 homology region (MHR), underestimated the dynamic range of kinase activation.To further test the interaction predicted by the model and suggested by the cell transfection experiments, we conducted binding experiments using purified GST-tagged MHR and purified His6-tagged Ack1 kinase domain. The purified kinase domain binds to the purified WT MHR (Fig. 10, A and B). This interaction is prevented by the F820A mutation in the MHR (Fig. 10A) and by the E346K mutation in the kinase domain (Fig. 10B). The interaction between these two minimal segments provides additional evidence for a direct interaction between the kinase domain and the MHR in the context of full-length Ack1. Based on the data presented in this paper, we propose a model for Ack1 regulation in which the MHR interacts with C-lobe of the kinase domain to stabilize a down-regulated structure (Fig. 10C). The Mig6 region might interact directly with the Ack1 active site as pictured in Fig. 10C or alternatively act indirectly to position an inhibitory segment in the active site. In preliminary in vitro experiments, the GST-MHR did not inhibit the purified Ack1 kinase domain, 3V. Prieto-Echagüe and W. T. Miller, unpublished observations. suggesting that additional regions of Ack1 are needed for direct or indirect autoinhibition.The C-terminal region of Ack1 is also involved in interactions with EGFR and other upstream and downstream signaling molecules. Thus, as observed for other NRTKs such as Src (51.Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol.

Conformational distortion of the native monomer leads to aggregation-coupled misfolding. Whereas β-cells are protected from proteotoxicity by hexamer assembly, fibrillation limits the storage and use of insulin at elevated temperatures. Here, we have investigated conformational distortions of an engineered insulin monomer in relation to the structure of an insulin fibril. Anomalous 13C NMR chemical shifts and rapid 15N-detected 1H-2H amide-proton exchange were observed in one of the three classical α-helices (residues A1–A8) of the hormone, suggesting a conformational equilibrium between locally folded and unfolded A-chain segments. Whereas hexamer assembly resolves these anomalies in accordance with its protective role, solid-state 13C NMR studies suggest that the A-chain segment participates in a fibril-specific β-sheet. Accordingly, we investigated whether helicogenic substitutions in the A1–A8 segment might delay fibrillation. Simultaneous substitution of three β-branched residues (IleA2 → Leu, ValA3 → Leu, and ThrA8 → His) yielded an analog with reduced thermodynamic stability but marked resistance to fibrillation. Whereas amide-proton exchange in the A1–A8 segment remained rapid, 13Cα chemical shifts exhibited a more helical pattern. This analog is essentially without activity, however, as IleA2 and ValA3 define conserved receptor contacts. To obtain active analogs, substitutions were restricted to A8. These analogs exhibit high receptor-binding affinity; representative potency in a rodent model of diabetes mellitus was similar to wild-type insulin. Although 13Cα chemical shifts remain anomalous, significant protection from fibrillation is retained.

IntroductionInsulin, a hormone central to the regulation of metabolism (Fig. 1), is a prototypical amyloidogenic protein. In pathological amyloid deposits, such proteins undergo non-native cross-β-assembly to form linear polymers (fibrils) (1.Brange J. Andersen L. Laursen E.D. Meyn G. Rasmussen E. J. Pharm. Sci. 1997; 86: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), a hallmark of diseases of toxic misfolding (2.Dobson C.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fibrillation of insulin when stored above room temperature has long complicated its use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) 4The abbreviations used are: DMdiabetes mellitusCSIchemical shift indexDKP-insulininsulin analog containing three substitutions in B-chain (AspB10, LysB28, and ProB29)KP-insulinKP-insulin contains the substitutions ProB28 to Lys and LysB29 to ProHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum coherenceIGFRinsulin-like growth factor receptorIRinsulin receptorMASmagic-angle spinningNOEnuclear Overhauser enhancementsNOESYNOE spectroscopyr.m.s.d.root-mean-square deviationrp-HPLCreverse-phase HPLCThTthioflavin TTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopySSPsecondary structural propensities.

Why is insulin susceptible to fibrillation, and how may such degradation be prevented? These questions are of both basic and applied interest. In this study, we employ 13C and 15N NMR spectroscopy to identify a dynamic anomaly in an engineered insulin monomer (4.Weiss M.A. Hua Q.X. Lynch C.S. Frank B.H. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7373-7389Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Molecular repair of an unstable polypeptide segment (its “Achilles' heel”) provides evidence of a link to the mechanism of fibrillation and yields novel analogs that may enhance the stability, efficacy, and safety of insulin replacement therapy in the treatment of DM in the developed and developing world.The mechanism of insulin fibrillation is outlined in Fig. 2. Of signal importance is conformational distortion of the monomer (Fig. 2, purple rhombus). Whereas native insulin (Fig. 2, triangle) may be sequestered within storage hexamers (left), non-native aggregation of distorted monomers leads to successive formation of amyloidogenic nuclei, protofilaments, and fibrils (right). The fact that susceptibility to fibrillation is conserved among vertebrate insulins 5A striking exception to the general susceptibility of vertebrate insulins to fibrillation is provided by synthetic single-chain insulin analogs (“mini-proinsulins”), in which the C terminus of the B-chain is connected to the N terminus of the A-chain (1.Brange J.

Disassembly leads to equilibrium between native and partially folded monomers (open triangle and purple rhombus, respectively). This partial fold may unfold completely as an off-pathway event (open circle) or aggregate to form a nucleus en route to a protofilament (far right).

First, to map sites of conformational distortability in an insulin monomer, we sought to exploit the 13C NMR chemical shift index (CSI) (10.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 11.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) as a probe of ensemble-averaged protein dynamics. Based on associations between secondary structure and trends among 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO chemical shifts, the CSI provides a rapid and sensitive method to identify α-helices, β-strands, and disordered segments in a protein without analysis of nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) (10.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 11.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Application to an insulin monomer (12.Hua Q.X. Shoelson S.E. Kochoyan M. Weiss M.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) uncovered a discrepancy between CSI- and NOE-based models. These results suggested that, despite maintenance of helix-related NOEs, the N-terminal segment of the A-chain (red in Fig. 1) undergoes conformational fluctuations between helical and nonhelical conformations in accordance with its rapid 1H-2H amide proton exchange in D2O (13.Krishna M.M. Hoang L. Lin Y. Englander S.W. Methods. 2004; 34: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Second, to test whether this or other segments of insulin participate in a fibril-specific β-sheet, we employed 13C-based solid-state NMR to measure 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO chemical shifts at selected sites in a powder sample (14.Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). The probes suggested that on fibrillation the fluctuating A1–A8 α-helix undergoes an α → β transition as part of a global change in protein conformation. The solid-state NMR results are in accordance with prior evidence of an overall α → β transition obtained by infra-red and Raman spectroscopy (7.Huang K. Dong J. Phillips N.B. Carey P.R. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42345-42355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15.Yu N.T. Jo B.H. Chang R.C. Huber J.D. Arch. Biochem.

Biol. 2003; 330: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In the third and final part of this study, we sought to repair the A1–A8 segment as a test of its relationship to fibrillation and as a potential route to novel insulin analogs of clinical interest. Because this segment contains unfavorable β-branched residues at three positions (IleA2, ValA3, and ThrA8), an analog was prepared containing only non-β-branched residues at these sites to augment α-helical propensity (18.O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 19.Chakrabartty A. Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Together, the substitutions (IleA2 → Leu, ValA3 → Leu, and ThrA8 → His) impair thermodynamic stability (presumably due to perturbed tertiary packing by LeuA2 and LeuA3) and yet extend the lag time prior to fibrillation by 5-fold. Such extension is associated with a more helical pattern of 13Cα chemical shifts in the A1–A8 segment. Although these findings suggest that the intrinsic helical propensity of fluctuating α-helix can indeed modulate amyloidogenicity, the affinity of the analog for the insulin receptor (IR) is reduced by 100-fold, precluding its clinical utility. To obtain potential therapeutic analogs, substitutions were therefore restricted to the solvent-exposed position A8 at which site a variety of non-β-branched substitutions are well tolerated (21.Weiss M.A. Wan Z.

Models were provided by rapid-acting insulin analogs in current clinical use (22.Demirdjian S. Bardin C. Savin S. Zirinis P. Chast F. Slama G. Sélam J.L.

Insulin aspart and insulin lispro are formulated as zinc insulin hexamers whose dimer interface is destabilized by mutations (78.Brange J. Ribel U. Hansen J.F. Dodson G. Hansen M.T. Havelund S.

In zinc-free monomers, the mutations are also destabilizing in terms of free energy of unfolding (see Table 1). We have found that the A8 substitutions extend the lag time by between 2- and 3-fold. Although such protection is less marked than that of the above analog, the A8-modified insulin analogs exhibit high receptor-binding affinities. Such an analog exhibits native hypoglycemic potency in a rodent model of type 1 DM.Our study is of dual basic and translational significance. From a biophysical perspective, it is remarkable that the anomalous 13C-based CSI signature of a globular protein correlates with both classical patterns of structural variability among crystal forms (26.Chothia C.

Furthermore, application of 13C NMR methods combined with protein engineering implies that a relationship exists between the intrinsic α-helical propensity of a peptide segment and fibrillation lag time. From a therapeutic perspective, mutagenesis of a fluctuating α-helix may augment the stability of rapid-acting insulin formulations, a potential benefit of particular relevance to continuous pump infusion (28.Bode B.W. Sabbah H.T. Gross T.M. Fredrickson L.P. Davidson P.C. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: S14-S20Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because fibrillation-associated occlusion of the delivery system can cause metabolic decompensation leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (25.Wolpert H.A. Faradji R.N. Bonner-Weir S. Lipes M.A. British Medical Journal. 2002; 324: 1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), A8-modified rapid-acting insulin analogs may enhance the efficacy and safety of such devices. Whereas pump-based therapy is a technology of affluent societies, in the developing world, thermal fibrillation poses a barrier to the storage and use of insulin for treatment of DM. Together, these results suggest that joint 13C chemical shift mapping by solution- and solid-state 13C NMR may provide a general approach to detect sites of conformational distortability in amyloidogenic proteins as a foundation for their rational repair and therapeutic application.RESULTSOur results are presented in three parts. We first describe heteronuclear NMR studies to identify an anomaly in the 13C chemical shifts of an engineered insulin monomer. We next extend these findings by solid-state NMR to insoluble insulin fibrils containing selective isotopic labels in the A- or B-chains. Finally, based on these results, we describe the design of fibrillation-resistant insulin analogs. Together, these findings provide evidence for a relationship between the intrinsic α-helical propensity of a peptide segment and the amyloidogenicity of the intact protein.Solution NMR Chemical Shift MappingChemical Shift Index and Core-related NOEsSecondary chemical shifts of Cα- and Cβ-carbons (the differences between observed and random-coil values) are sensitive to secondary structure (10.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 11.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). CSI values are summarized by the histogram in Fig. 3 in relation to canonical elements of secondary structure (bottom). Positive (or negative) values correspond to resonances that are downfield (or upfield) of expected random-coil values. Whereas CSI values are in accordance with maintenance of α-helices 1 and 3 (residues B9–B19 and A13–A19, respectively) and the C-terminal B-chain β-strand (B24–B28), the A1–A8 segment exhibits marked attenuation of CSI values (Fig. 3, arrow and asterisks).FIGURE 3Chemical shift index of DKP-insulin. Histograms show 13C NMR secondary shifts by residue in B-chain (left) and A-chain (right); sequences are provided at top. Upper histogram refers to Cα shifts, and lower histogram refers to Cβ shifts. Positive (negative) values indicate that the observed chemical shift is downfield (upfield) of expected random-coil frequency (10.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 11.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Canonical secondary structure of insulin is indicated at bottom: helix (spiral) or β-strand (arrow). CSI values in the A1–A8 segment (asterisk) are attenuated relative to α-helices 1 and 3. The sequence of insulin is shown with B-chain at left and A-chain at right to correspond to the N- to C-terminal order of B and A domains in proinsulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Heteronuclear resonance assignment also enabled application of an algorithm to convert chemical shift data to a single residue-specific SSP score (32.Marsh J.A. Singh V.K. Jia Z. Forman-Kay J.D. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2795-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This score predicts at each residue the percentage of stably folded conformers with canonical secondary structure (α-helical or β-strand) in an ensemble. Limiting SSP scores of 1 or −1 imply formation of a fully formed α-helix or β-strand, respectively; intermediate scores (±0.5) imply 50% local occupancy; no information is provided regarding the nature of alternative noncanonical conformations. The SSP score of each residue in DKP-insulin (supplemental Table S2) is mapped onto the structure of an insulin monomer in Fig. 4A. Ribbon color in Fig. 4A ranges from violet (highest β-strand character) to white (no predominant secondary structure) to blue (highest α-helical character). Mean segment-specific SSP scores are ∼20% (N-terminal A-chain segment), 75% (C-terminal A-chain α-helix), and 100% (central B-chain α-helix). Strikingly, these segmental scores correlate with structural variability among crystallographic protomers as probed by main-chain atomic r.m.s.d. (mapped onto the structure in Fig. 4B; see “Discussion”). An alignment of crystallographic protomers is shown in Fig. 4C. With respect to strands, the N-terminal segment of the B-chain (residues B1–B6; light violet in Fig. 4A) exhibits attenuated β-character relative to its C-terminal segment (residues B24–B28; violet). The latter is thus pre-organized to engage its 2-fold-related partner to form a dimer-specific β-sheet, whereas the flexibility of the N-terminal segment foreshadows its conformational transition to α-helix in the TR transition (Fig. 4D). 8The crystallographic T → R transition, an allosteric reorganization of insulin hexamers (64.Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Reynolds C.D. Smith G.D. Sparks C. Swenson D. Nature. 1989; 338: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 80.Bentley G. Dodson E. Dodson G. Hodgkin D. Mercola D. Nature. 1976; 261: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), is remarkable for a change in the secondary structure of the B1–B8 segment from extended (T state) to α-helix (R state). Segmental reorganization is coupled to changes in the conformation of GlyB8, core packing, and handedness of cystine A7–B7. The latter sulfur atoms are exposed in the T state but buried in a nonpolar crevice in the R state. The superscript Rf refers to N-terminal fraying of the B1–B19 α-helix. The T → R transition has been analyzed as a model for the long range transmission of conformational change (26.Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Dodson G.G. Hodgkin D.C. Nature. 1983; 302: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). FIGURE 4Structure of insulin and relationship between conformational variability and chemical shift mapping.

Native-like contacts are likewise maintained between the side chains of ValA3 and TyrB26 within an inter-chain crevice. The N-terminal A1–A8 segment also retains a subset of canonical α-helical NOEs. Such NOEs, exemplified by an (i, i + 3) contact between A2-Hα and A5-Hβ, are weaker than corresponding NOEs in other helices (31.Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Such attenuation presumably reflects nonhelical local conformations; the signal-to-noise ratio is further reduced by line broadening in this segment, itself a consequence of conformational exchange (45.Hua Q.X. Ladbury J.E. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We imagine that core side chains in the B-chain and C-terminal A-chain α-helix provide a nonpolar template for folding of the molten N-terminal A-chain segment as an amphipathic helix (see “Discussion”).Amide Proton ExchangeBase-catalyzed amide exchange in DKP-insulin is too rapid to investigate by the standard D2O exchange method. We therefore employed the heteronuclear solvent presaturation 1H-15N HSQC method at 25 °C in H2O. Base-line HSQC spectra of DKP-insulin at pH 7.1 or 7.8 (Fig. 5A) exhibit favorable chemical shift dispersion in both 1H- and 15N dimensions; the inset shows the weak cross-peak of CysA11 (green dashed circle), observable only at the lower pH following prolonged acquisition (14 h). Although spectra acquired at pH 7.8 (Fig. 5A, red) or pH 7.1 (black) exhibit only slight changes in cross-peak positions, six additional cross-peaks (residues A11, B8, B21, B26, B27, and B28) are observed at the lower pH. Although for residues B26–B28 (lying at the edge of a β-strand), this pH effect is presumably due to less efficient base-catalyzed exchange, and for residues A11 and B8 (participating in chain reversals) the change in pH may also be affecting the extent of conformational broadening as these amide resonances exhibit unusually large 1H line widths. 9Raising the temperature from 25 to 40 °C, which would be expected to accelerate amide proton exchange, leads to partial narrowing of A11 and B8 1HN resonances and their detectability in 1H-15N HSQC spectra.

https://openalex.org/W1993712066,"The flotillin proteins are localized in lipid domains at the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular compartments. In the present study, we examined the importance of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 for the uptake and transport of the bacterial Shiga toxin (Stx) and the plant toxin ricin and we investigated whether toxin binding and uptake were associated with flotillin relocalization. We observed a toxin-induced redistribution of the flotillins, which seemed to be regulated in a p38-dependent manner. Our experiments provide no evidence for a changed endocytic uptake of Stx or ricin in cells silenced for flotillin-1 or -2. However, the Golgi-dependent sulfation of both toxins was significantly reduced in flotillin knockdown cells. Interestingly, when the transport of ricin to the ER was investigated, we obtained an increased mannosylation of ricin in flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 knockdown cells. The toxicity of both toxins was twofold increased in flotillin-depleted cells. Since BFA (Brefeldin A) inhibits the toxicity even in flotillin knockdown cells, the retrograde toxin transport is apparently still Golgi-dependent. Thus, flotillin proteins regulate and facilitate the retrograde transport of Stx and ricin."

Despite these studies implicating VDAC in neuromuscular function and spermatogenesis, the specific cellular and developmental roles of the various VDAC isoforms, as well as the proteins or pathways with which VDACs interact, are not yet well understood. The use of genetic model systems such as Drosophila melanogaster offers the possibility of gaining additional in vivo insights into VDAC functions, its intracellular interactions, and its potential as a therapeutic target. D. melanogaster contains a cluster of four genes (porin, CG17137 (Porin2), CG17139, and CG17140) that encode proteins that are homologous to known VDACs (14Messina A. Neri M. Perosa F. Caggese C.

Craigen W.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 85: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When expressed in VDAC-deficient yeast, porin and CG17137 can rescue a conditional lethal phenotype, whereas the other two cannot, demonstrating functional complementation for a subset of these genes (7Komarov A.G. Graham B.H. Craigen W.J. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given its homology to mammalian VDACs and its ubiquitous expression pattern, it was hypothesized that porin represents the predominant functional ortholog of VDAC in Drosophila. This hypothesis predicts that mutant porin phenotypes should exhibit significant similarities to mammalian mutant VDAC phenotypes. In this study, analysis of mutant porin phenotypes reveals a striking concordance with mammalian mutant VDAC phenotypes. In addition, the demonstration of a secondary respiratory chain deficiency and abnormal distribution of mitochondria within motor neurons of porin mutants provides new insights into the phenotypic consequences of VDAC deficiency, illustrating the potential of Drosophila as a useful model system to study mitochondrial function and disease.

For measuring lifespan, flies of indicated genotypes were isolated on the day of eclosion and placed into same-sex cohorts of five flies per vial. Each day the number of surviving flies was recorded until all flies had died. The flies were placed in fresh vials three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) during the entire test. Polarographic experiments were performed as described previously (24Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C.

Intact mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from fresh homogenates of three-day-old adult flies, with the homogenates first filtered through cheesecloth to remove residual particulate remains of the exoskeleton. Oxygen consumption of mitochondria was measured in a 650-μl chamber fitted with a Clark microelectrode (YSI Life Sciences), recorded using a PowerLab electronic data recorder, and analyzed using LabChart (AD Instruments). For enzymologic assays of respiratory chain complexes I–IV, sufficient third instar larval stage larvae were collected to fill a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube to 50 μl. Potassium phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.5) was added to a final volume of 300 μl, and the larvae were sonicated (5-s pulse ×4, 60% power) using a Microson XL2000 Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor (Misonix). The spectrophotometric kinetic assays were performed at 30 °C in a volume of 100 μl using a monochromator microplate reader (Tecan M200). Complex I activity (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) was determined by measuring oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (using ferricyanide as the electron acceptor) in a reaction mixture of 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm NADH, and 1.7 mm potassium ferricyanide. Complex II activity (succinate dehydrogenase) was determined by measuring the reduction of the artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol at 600 nm in a reaction mixture of 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 20 mm succinate, 0.5 mm 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol, 10 μm rotenone, 2 μg/ml antimycin A, and 2 mm potassium cyanide. Complex III activity (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) was determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm in a reaction mixture of 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 35 μm reduced decylubiquinone, 15 μm cytochrome c, 10 μm rotenone, and 2 mm potassium cyanide. Complex IV activity (cytochrome c oxidase) was determined by measuring the oxidation of cytochrome c at 550 nm in a reaction mixture of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mm reduced cytochrome c. Citrate synthase activity was determined by measuring the reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm, which is coupled to the reduction of acetyl-CoA by citrate synthase in the presence of oxaloacetate. The reaction mixture consists of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 50 μm acetyl-CoA, and 250 μm oxaloacetate. All activities were calculated as nmol/min/mg protein, normalized to citrate synthase activity and expressed as a percentage of wild type activity. For transmission electron microscopy of indirect flight muscle, the indirect flight muscle of 7-day-old flies was dissected in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/1% glutaraldehyde/0.1 m cacodylic acid (pH 7.2). Fixation, post-fixation, staining, embedding, sectioning, and transmission electron microscopy were performed as described previously (25Verstreken P. Koh T.W. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Hiesinger P.R. Zhou Y. Mehta S.Q. Cao Y. Roos J. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 2003; 40: 733-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For male fertility tests, individual 3-day-old males of the indicated genotypes were mated with two virgin yw females. After 3 days, each vial was visually examined to ensure eggs had been laid and the parents were discarded. After 17 days (from the initial mating), the total number of adult progeny was recorded. A minimum of 20 males for each genotype was used for testing. For female fecundity and fertility tests, individual virgin females of the indicated genotypes were paired with single virgin yw males. For 21 consecutive days, each mating pair was transferred to a fresh vial. The vial from the previous 24-h period was visually inspected and the total number of eggs laid was recorded and summed over the 21-day period. Each vial was also saved for 17 days, and then the total number of adult progeny was recorded and summed over the 21-day period. From these data, the total number of eggs laid, the total number of adult progeny, and the ratio of total progeny to total number of eggs laid were determined. Ten females of each genotype were tested to obtain mean values for the above parameters. Testes from 3-day-old males of each indicated genotype were dissected in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and photographed using a Leica S8 stereomicroscope fitted with a Leica DC300 digital camera (Meyer Instruments). Images were captured using Leica IM50 image management software. An image of a ruler (1-mm units) at the same magnification as the testes (80×) was photographed to provide reference for measuring the absolute length. The images were analyzed using ImageTool for Windows (version 3.00) (University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio), and the maximal width for each testis was determined. A minimum of 14 testes of each genotype was measured. For the bang sensitivity assay, flies were anesthetized with CO2 and individually placed into 7-ml borosilicate glass scintillation vials (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Flies were allowed to recover from CO2 for 2–3 h, and then each vial was vortexed (maximal setting) for 10 s, and the time for the fly to right itself and resume normal behavior was recorded. Any trial in which the fly remained stunned for >30 s was terminated and recorded as 30 s. A minimum of 20 flies was tested for any particular genotype. For each genotype, 20 5-day-old male flies were placed into an empty 10-cm plastic vial. With the top of the vial plugged, the vertical distance from the bottom of the vial to the top was 7 cm. After a 2-h period of recovery from CO2 anesthesia, the vial was gently tapped once on the bench top to displace the flies to the bottom of the vial, and a digital camera recorded the movements of the flies for 6 s. Individual frames at 1-s intervals from 0 to 5 s were digitally captured and analyzed using ImageTool for Windows (version 3.00). The relative distance from the bottom of the vial for each fly at each time point was determined and used to obtain a mean distance for each group of flies at each time point. The assay was repeated for each genotype with a new cohort of male flies at least three times. ERGs from flies immobilized with nail polish (Top Speed, Revlon) were recorded with a fine glass pipette filled with 3 m NaCl placed on the corneal surface of the fly's eye. The reference electrode was inserted into the thorax. Light flashes of 1 s were delivered from a 150-watt halogen lamp (Volpi), and field potential recordings were digitized and stored on a personal computer using Clampex software. At least two flies for each genotype were used to generate the ERG traces, and the amplitudes of the “on” and “off” transients as well as the sustained negative component were analyzed using Clampfit. Larval electrophysiological recordings and temperature control were performed as described (26Koh T.W. Verstreken P. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 2004; 43: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Modified HL3 contained 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm HEPES, 30 mm sucrose, 5 mm trehalose, and 20 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2), and CaCl2 (concentrations indicated in Fig. 6). Excitatory junctional potential (EJP) recordings were made from muscles 6 or 7 using 90–110-megohm electrodes, and motor neurons were stimulated several times above threshold to ensure action potential initiation. For each animal, 60 EJPs were recorded, and the amplitudes were averaged to determine the individual EJP amplitude (observed failures at 0.25 mm Ca2+ were excluded). The mean EJP amplitude was determined from several animals (sample sizes indicated in bar graphs of Fig. 6). Staining protocols were performed as described (27Bellen H.J. Budnik V. Sullivan M. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols. CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000: 175-199Google Scholar): anti-DLG (mouse; 4F3) was used at a dilution of 1:50. Anti-GluRIII/IIC was a gift from A. Di Antonio (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Secondary antibodies tagged with Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) were used at 1:250. All fluorescent images were captured using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope and processed using Amira 2.2 and ImageJ. Z stacks of synapses were acquired as delimited by DLG fluorescence. Using ImageJ, all three fluorescent channels of each Z stack were analyzed as two-dimensional projections of maximal fluorescence and quantitated as percentage of voxels in each Z stack that had a detectable signal above background. GluRIII/IIC and mitoGFP fluorescence were normalized to DLG fluorescence. Two Z stacks each from three individual animals (i.e. six total) for both wild type and porinRev8 were used for the analysis. A P element insertion allele of porin (Fig. 1A), porinEY2333, was obtained from the Drosophila Gene Disruption Project (18Bellen H.J. Levis R.W. Liao G. He Y. Carlson J.W. Tsang G. Evans-Holm M. Hiesinger P.R. Schulze K.L. Rubin G.M. Hoskins R.A. Spradling A.C. Genetics. 2004; 167: 761-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). A series of hypomorphic alleles were derived from porinEY2333 by imprecise P element excision (28Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Phillis R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1988; 118: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Long range PCR analysis of one of these excision alleles, porinRev8, revealed an insertion of ∼7 kb in the porin locus (supplemental Fig. S1C), whereas PCR analysis of three other alleles demonstrate deletions involving the alternatively spliced 5′-untranslated exons and the first intron (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Sequence analysis of all alleles demonstrated intact coding exons. Western blot analysis of these alleles demonstrated severe reduction in Porin expression levels (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). Based on the low residual amount of porin protein in porinRev8 mutants, this allele was chosen for further study. porinRev8 homozygous mutants are semilethal because significantly fewer than expected adult homozygotes were observed (Fig. 1C). Homozygotes progress through embryogenesis and early larvogenesis, but ∼75% fail to successfully transition from late larvogenesis to pupation and eclosion (data not shown). This partial lethality is specific to porin deficiency because homozygotes that ectopically express wild type porin are rescued into adulthood (Fig. 1, D and E). Adult porinRev8 homozygotes also exhibit reduced lifespans, and this phenotype is similarly rescued by ectopic porin expression (Fig. 1, E and F). To examine the consequences of Porin deficiency on mitochondrial respiration, oxygen consumption in the presence of oxidizable substrates and ADP was measured from fresh mitochondria isolated from wild type and porinRev8 flies (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). Mitochondria from porinRev8 mutants demonstrated a global respiratory defect, with significantly decreased ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption (“state III” respiration) in the presence of either complex I or II-dependent substrates. When activities of individual respiratory chain complexes were measured, porin mutants exhibited a significant partial deficiency of complex I activity (∼30% of wild type activity) as well as an increase of complex III activity (∼140% of wild type activity) (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S2). These results demonstrate that in addition to decreased mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, Porin deficiency leads to perturbations in respiratory chain function and thus is valid a model for secondary respiratory chain deficiency. Mutant porin flies have reduced fertility. porinEY2333 male homozygotes are subfertile, whereas porinRev8 male homozygotes are absolutely infertile (no fertile cross has been observed after testing more than 1,000 individual porinRev8 males). This infertility is rescued by ectopic expression of porin cDNA in the testes using the c135-GAL4 driver, which is expressed both in somatic cyst cells and spermatocytes (Fig. 3A) (23Hrdlicka L. Gibson M. Kiger A. Micchelli C. Schober M. Schöck F. Perrimon N. Genesis. 2002; 34: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Importantly, expression of other Drosophila VDAC isoforms present in the testis (CG17137 (Porin2) and CG17140) is not significantly altered in porinRev8 mutants (Fig. 3A). The other hypomorphic mutant porin alleles also demonstrate decreased fertility (supplemental Fig. S3B). Similar to the infertile mutant described by Oliva et al. (16Oliva M. De Pinto V. Barsanti P. Caggese C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), these mutants exhibit normal testes morphology, with normal appearing Nebenkern bodies by differential interference microscopy, yet they produce immotile sperm (data not shown). Further examination of dissected male reproductive tracts revealed that in porinRev8 male homozygotes the seminal vesicles are small and devoid of sperm, whereas the testes themselves are enlarged ∼25% compared with wild type controls (Fig. 3B). In addition, although female porinEY2333 homozygotes have normal fecundity and fertility, female porinRev8 homozygotes have severely reduced fecundity and fertility (Fig. 3C). “Bang-sensitive” or stress-sensitive mutants are a phenotypic class of mutants that exhibit temporary paralysis when exposed to mechanical stress (29Benzer S. Jama. 1971; 218: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 30Homyk Jr., T. Genetics. 1977; 87: 105-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Homyk Jr., T. Szidonya J. Suzuki D.T. Mol. Gen.

Two stress-sensitive mutants have been identified as nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes: stress sensitive B (sesB), encoding the fly ortholog of the adenine nucleotide translocase (39Zhang Y.Q. Roote J. Brogna S. Davis A.W. Barbash D.A. Nash D. Ashburner M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 891-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and technical knock-out (tko), encoding a subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (40Royden C.S. Pirrotta V. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1987; 51: 165-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the gene encoding Drp1, a protein involved in mitochondrial fission, also cause bang sensitivity (41Verstreken P. Ly C.V. Venken K.J. Koh T.W. Zhou Y. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 2005; 47: 365-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Analysis of mutant porin homozygotes revealed that these mutants also exhibit enhanced bang sensitivity, with hypomorphic porinEY2333 homozygotes demonstrating a 2–3-fold increase in recovery time and imprecise excision mutant porin homozygotes showing at least a 6–7-fold increase in recovery time compared with wild type. Ectopic expression of wild type porin in the central nervous system (CNS) of mutant homozygotes rescues this abnormal phenotype (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3A). This defect is consistent with a defect in mitochondrial function. In light of the pathological changes in muscle structure and function observed in Vdac1−/− mice (12Anflous K. Armstrong D.D.

We previously revealed that SmcR, a LuxR homologue of Vibrio vulnificus, activates promoter S, an RpoS-dependent promoter of vvpE encoding a potential virulence factor elastase and binds in vitro to a binding site centered at −196.5. In this study, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and promoter deletion analyses demonstrated that SmcR binds to the vvpE regulatory region in vivo and directly interacts with RNAP for activation of the vvpE expression. A search for regulatory genes involved in the regulation of elastase production singled out ihfA, which encodes for a subunit of integration host factor (IHF). Levels of both elastase activity and vvpE transcript decreased significantly as a result of inactivation of ihfA, and primer extension analyses demonstrated that IHF regulates the vvpE transcription by activating PS. Direct binding of IHF to the two distinct binding sites centered at −174 and −131, respectively, was determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a DNase I protection assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the interaction of SmcR with RNAP in vivo was mediated by IHF.

https://openalex.org/W2084659150,"Gamma-glutamylamine cyclotransferase (GGACT) is an enzyme that converts gamma-glutamylamines to free amines and 5-oxoproline. GGACT shows high activity toward gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine, derived from the breakdown of fibrin and other proteins cross-linked by transglutaminases. The enzyme adopts the newly identified cyclotransferase fold, observed in gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT), an enzyme with activity toward gamma-glutamyl-alpha-amino acids (Oakley, A. J., Yamada, T., Liu, D., Coggan, M., Clark, A. G., and Board, P. G. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 22031-22042). Despite the absence of significant sequence identity, several residues are conserved in the active sites of GGCT and GGACT, including a putative catalytic acid/base residue (GGACT Glu(82)). The structure of GGACT in complex with the reaction product 5-oxoproline provides evidence for a common catalytic mechanism in both enzymes. The proposed mechanism, combined with the three-dimensional structures, also explains the different substrate specificities of these enzymes. Despite significant sequence divergence, there are at least three subfamilies in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that have conserved the GGCT fold and GGCT enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2040563918,"Brown adipocytes are specialised in dissipating energy through adaptive thermogenesis, whereas white adipocytes are specialised in energy storage. These essentially opposite functions are possible for two reasons relating to mitochondria, namely expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and a remarkably higher mitochondrial abundance in brown adipocytes.Here we report a comprehensive characterisation of gene expression linked to mitochondrial DNA replication, transcription and function during white and brown fat cell differentiation in vitro as well as in white and brown fat, brown adipose tissue fractions and in selected adipose tissues during cold exposure. We find a massive induction of the majority of such genes during brown adipocyte differentiation and recruitment, e.g. of the mitochondrial transcription factors A (Tfam) and B2 (Tfb2m), whereas only a subset of the same genes were induced during white adipose conversion. In addition, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) was found to be expressed at substantially higher levels in brown compared to white pre-adipocytes and adipocytes. We demonstrate that forced expression of Tfam but not Tfb2m in brown adipocyte precursor cells promotes mitochondrial DNA replication, and that silencing of PRDM16 expression during brown fat cell differentiation blunts mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of brown fat cell markers.Using both in vitro and in vivo model systems of white and brown fat cell differentiation, we report a detailed characterisation of gene expression linked to mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We find significant differences in differentiating white and brown adipocytes, which might explain the notable increase in mitochondrial content observed during brown adipose conversion. In addition, our data support a key role of PRDM16 in triggering brown adipocyte differentiation, including mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of UCP1."
https://openalex.org/W2012875980,"Based on measuring responses to rat whiskers as they are mechanically stimulated, one recent study suggests that barrel-related areas in layer 2/3 rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contain a pinwheel map of whisker motion directions. Because this map is reminiscent of topographic organization for visual direction in primary visual cortex (V1) of higher mammals, we asked whether the S1 pinwheels could be explained by an input-driven developmental process as is often suggested for V1. We developed a computational model to capture how whisker stimuli are conveyed to supragranular S1, and simulate lateral cortical interactions using an established self-organizing algorithm. Inputs to the model each represent the deflection of a subset of 25 whiskers as they are contacted by a moving stimulus object. The subset of deflected whiskers corresponds with the shape of the stimulus, and the deflection direction corresponds with the movement direction of the stimulus. If these two features of the inputs are correlated during the training of the model, a somatotopically aligned map of direction emerges for each whisker in S1. Predictions of the model that are immediately testable include (1) that somatotopic pinwheel maps of whisker direction exist in adult layer 2/3 barrel cortex for every large whisker on the rat's face, even peripheral whiskers; and (2) in the adult, neurons with similar directional tuning are interconnected by a network of horizontal connections, spanning distances of many whisker representations. We also propose specific experiments for testing the predictions of the model by manipulating patterns of whisker inputs experienced during early development. The results suggest that similar intracortical mechanisms guide the development of primate V1 and rat S1."
https://openalex.org/W2023218469,"In mammals, calories ingested in excess of those used are stored primarily as fat in adipose tissue; consistent ingestion of excess calories requires an enlargement of the adipose tissue mass. Thus, a dysfunction in adipose tissue growth may be a key factor in insulin resistance due to imbalanced fat storage and disrupted insulin action. Adipose tissue growth requires the recruitment and then the development of adipose precursor cells, but little is known about these processes in vivo.In this study, adipose cell-size probability distributions were measured in two Zucker fa/fa rats over a period of 151 and 163 days, from four weeks of age, using micro-biopsies to obtain subcutaneous (inguinal) fat tissue from the animals. These longitudinal probability distributions were analyzed to assess the probability of periodic phenomena.Adipose tissue growth in this strain of rat exhibits a striking temporal periodicity of approximately days. A simple model is proposed for the periodicity, with PPAR signaling driven by a deficit in lipid uptake capacity leading to the periodic recruitment of new adipocytes. This model predicts that the observed period will be diet-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2062584615,"Stathmin is an important microtubule (MT)-destabilizing protein, and its activity is differently attenuated by phosphorylation at one or more of its four phosphorylatable serine residues (Ser-16, Ser-25, Ser-38, and Ser-63). This phosphorylation of stathmin plays important roles in mitotic spindle formation. We observed increasing levels of phosphorylated stathmin in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-harboring lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines during the EBV lytic cycle. These suggest that EBV lytic products may be involved in the regulation of stathmin phosphorylation. BGLF4 is an EBV-encoded kinase and has similar kinase activity to cdc2, an important kinase that phosphorylates serine residues 25 and 38 of stathmin during mitosis. Using an siRNA approach, we demonstrated that BGLF4 contributes to the phosphorylation of stathmin in EBV-harboring NPC. Moreover, we confirmed that BGLF4 interacts with and phosphorylates stathmin using an in vitro kinase assay and an in vivo two-dimensional electrophoresis assay. Interestingly, unlike cdc2, BGLF4 was shown to phosphorylate non-proline directed serine residues of stathmin (Ser-16) and it mediated phosphorylation of stathmin predominantly at serines 16, 25, and 38, indicating that BGLF4 can down-regulate the activity of stathmin. Finally, we demonstrated that the pattern of MT organization was changed in BGLF4-expressing cells, possibly through phosphorylation of stathmin. In conclusion, we have shown that a viral Ser/Thr kinase can directly modulate the activity of stathmin and this contributes to alteration of cellular MT dynamics and then may modulate the associated cellular processes.

It is known that some viruses rely on the host cell cytoskeleton for transportation to the site of replication or to the egress progeny virions to the extracellular environment, indicating that this trafficking is essential for their infection (20.Sodeik B. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 465-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 21.Ploubidou A. Way M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a variety of viruses have been found to use diverse approaches to regulate cellular MTs or actin cytoskeletons (21.Ploubidou A. Way M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22.Cudmore S. Reckmann I. Way M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 142-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For example, adenovirus has been found to activate PKA and P38/MAPK pathways to boost MT-mediated targeting of the virus to the nucleus, and this can enhance virus infection (23.Suomalainen M. Nakano M.Y. Boucke K. Keller S. Greber U.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Additionally, vaccinia virus has been shown to induce the formation of actin tails and viral particles are propelled on the tips of the actin tails (24.Cudmore S. Cossart P. Griffiths G. Way M. Nature. 1995; 378: 636-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Moreover, several viruses encode MAP-like proteins which possess MT-stabilizing activity (25.Ploubidou A. Moreau V. Ashman K. Reckmann I. González C. Way M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3932-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26.Elliott G. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6448-6455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, various viruses exploit different strategies to target and modulate the cellular MT network during infection. However, the approaches used by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to regulate the MT dynamics are obscure. EBV, a human gammaherpesvirus, infects over 95% of the human population (27.Cohen J.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 28.Young L.S. Rickinson A.B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The infection is associated with many types of malignances (27.Cohen J.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 28.Young L.S. Rickinson A.B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Recently, increased levels of stathmin expression have been reported in EBV-infected primary B cells and in EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (29.Baik S.Y. Yun H.S. Lee H.J. Lee M.H. Jung S.E. Kim J.W. Jeon J.P. Shin Y.K. Rhee H.S. Kimm K.C. Han B.G. Cell Prolif. 2007; 40: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, an EBV-encoded latent protein, LMP1, was shown to increase phosphorylation of stathmin in EBV-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (30.Lin X. Liu S. Luo X. Ma X. Guo L. Li L. Li Z. Tao Y.

Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of stathmin in EBV infection remains unclear. BGLF4 is the only kinase expressed by EBV during the lytic stage and it can phosphorylate a spectrum of viral and cellular factors (32.Zhu J. Liao G. Shan L. Zhang J. Chen M.R. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. Desai P. Zhu H. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 5219-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33.Gershburg E. Pagano J.S. Biochim. Biophys.

In this study, we investigated the expression and roles of stathmin in EBV-positive cell lines. We demonstrate that BGLF4, an EBV-encoded Ser/Thr kinase, can phosphorylate and then attenuate the activity of stathmin to alter MT dynamics. EBV-positive B95.8 cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium and treated with 40 ng/ml tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate and 3 mm sodium butyrate for 72 h. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the cell debris. The cell-free supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in a volume of 1 ml of complete medium per 100 ml starting culture supernatant. The resuspended virus was then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and stored at −80 °C until use. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences). PBMC were then cultured at 2 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and infected with EBV B95.8 virus. P1, P7, P9, P13, P14, and P15 cell lines were LCLs established by EBV infection of PBMCs. The immortalized T lymphocyte cell line Jurkat was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum. The HeLa cell line is derived from human cervical carcinoma, and cells are grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Inducible human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) T-REx cells for BGLF4, BGLF4-KD, and vector expression were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% tetracycline-free serum. These cells were derived by cloning the BGLF4 and BGLF4-KD open reading frames in pLenti4-CPO/V5/His (Invitrogen). The expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293 T-REx cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected in growth medium with 400 μg/ml zeocin and 5 μg/ml blasticidin, as reported previously (35.Sankar S. Chan H. Romanow W.J. Li J. Bates R.J. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 982-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To induce protein expression, these cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline (Invitrogen) for the times indicated in the figures. Expression lysates were collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then subjected to immunoblotting. NA cells are an EBV harboring NPC cell line infected with a recombinant Akata-EBV strain carrying a neomycin-resistance gene (36.Chang Y. Tung C.H. Huang Y.T. Lu J. Chen J.Y. Tsai C.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8857-8866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NA cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in 12-well plates and then co-transfected with pSG5-Rta (37.Chua H.H. Lee H.H. Chang S.S.

Cell lysates were harvested 36 h post-transfection. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.1, 0.3, 1, or 2.5 μg of pSG5-BGLF4 or PSG5-BGLF4-KD individually using Lipofectamine 2000. All cell lysates were harvested in RIPA buffer 24 h post-transfection. Flag-tagged expression plasmids of different UL13 homologues, such as pTAG-UL13 of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), pTAG-UL97 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and pTAG-36 of murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) were generated independently by cloning BamHI-KpnI viral kinase gene fragments into pTAG-attR-C1 (Invitrogen) and were kindly provided by Ren Sun (UCLA) (38.Lee C.P. Chen J.Y. Wang J.T. Kimura K. Takemoto A. Lu C.C. Chen M.R. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5166-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Flag-tagged ORF36 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) was generated by cloning the Flag-KSHV ORF36 gene fragment into the RsrII site of pLenti4-V5 (Invitrogen) (39.Lee C.P. Huang Y.H. Lin S.F. Chang Y. Chang Y.H. Takada K. Chen M.R. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 11913-11926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates and transfected with 4 μg of either Flag-tagged plasmids of different UL13 homologues using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cell lysates were harvested in RIPA buffer 24 h post-transfection. pSG5-BGLF4 and pSG5-BGLF4-KD (K102I) are plasmids expressing wild-type BGLF4 and a BGLF4 kinase dead mutant, respectively (40.Wang J.T. Yang P.W. Lee C.P. Han C.H. Tsai C.H. Chen M.R. J. Virol. 2005; 86: 3215-3225Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The full-length stathmin cDNA, stathmin-4A, and stathmin-4E mutants, which were kindly provided by Dr. Martin Gullberg (19.Holmfeldt P. Brännström K. Stenmark S. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2921-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were cloned in the pSG5 vector, generating pSG5-stathmin-Flag, pSG5-stathmin-4E-Flag, and pSG5-stathmin-4A-Flag. The plasmids expressing pSG5-stathmin-SAAA-Flag, pSG5-stathmin-ASAA-Flag, pSG5-stathmin-AASA-Flag, and pSG5-stathmin-AAAS-Flag were generated using a single primer-based in vitro mutagenesis strategy (41.Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with primers primer-SASS gcttttgagctgattctcgcccctcggtcaaaagaa, primer-SSAS tccagaattcccccttgcccctccaaa gaagaa, primer-SAAA ctggagaagcgtgcctcaggccaggcttttg and primer AAAS gaagaaagacgcaagtcccatgaagctgagg. The plasmids generated are pSG5-stathmin-SAAA-Flag (Ser-25, -38, and -63 were replaced by alanine), pSG5-stathmin-ASAA-Flag (Ser-16, -38, and -63 were replaced by alanine), pSG5-stathmin-AASA-Flag (Ser-16, -25, and -63 were replaced by alanine) and pSG5-stathmin-AAAS-Flag (Ser-16, -25, and -38 were replaced by alanine). To purify GST-tagged stathmin and its mutants, the cDNAs from pSG5-stathmin-Flag and pSG5-stathmin mutants were further subcloned to the Escherichia coli expression plasmid, pGEX-4T-1, with an N-terminal GST tag. The plasmids generated are pGEX-4T1-stathmin-Flag, pGEX-4T1-stathmin-SAAA-Flag, pGEX-4T1-stathmin-ASAA-Flag, pGEX-4T1-stathmin-AASA-Flag, and pGEX-4T1-stathmin-AAAS-Flag. The RNA fragments targeting the expression of BGLF4 were purchased from Invitrogen, including si-BGLF4-1 (5′-CCCUCUAUGUAAAGCUGCCGGAGAA), si-BGLF4-2 (5′-UGGGUAGGCUGGUCCUGACUGAUUA) and a control siRNA fragment (5′-CCCGUAUAAAUGUCGGGCCACUGAA) (42.Wang J.T. Doong S.L. Teng S.C. Lee C.P. Tsai C.H. Chen M.R. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 1856-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 90% in 10-cm Petri dishes and co-transfected with 7 μg of pSG5-BGLF4 and 7 μg of pSG5-stathmin-Flag with Lipofectamine 2000. At 18 h post-transfection, cell lysates were collected in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant was precleared with 200 μl of 20% protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the precleared supernatant was incubated with 3 μg of anti-BGLF4 (40.Wang J.T. Yang P.W. Lee C.P. Han C.H. Tsai C.H. Chen M.R. J. Virol. 2005; 86: 3215-3225Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), anti-Flag M2 mAb (Sigma), or irrelevant control antibodies (mIgG) at 4 °C for 1 h and then 250 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added to precipitate the immunocomplexes with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The recovered immunocomplexes were washed extensively in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resolved with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. HeLa cells were also transfected with 10 μg of pSG5-BGLF4, and lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation as described above. The anti-stathmin polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to precipitate the endogenous stathmin. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and further transferred to Hybond-C Extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk and the primary antibodies (Abs) used were anti-BGLF4 (2224 or 2216 clones) mAbs (40.Wang J.T. Yang P.W. Lee C.P. Han C.H. Tsai C.H. Chen M.R. J.

After hybridization with secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). ImageQuant software was used to quantify the expression levels of the proteins detected by immunoblotting. Briefly, the value of the band density was quantified and then normalized to its corresponding internal control. Then, the results were shown relative to vector transfectant or cell line of interest. BGLF4, BGLF4-KD and vector control inducible HEK 293 T-REx cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% tetracycline-free serum and protein expression was induced by incubation with 10 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Total lysates from BGLF4, BGLF4-KD or vector control cells were collected in two-dimensional lysis buffer (40 mm Tris, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAOS, pH 9) and subjected to two-dimensional PAGE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, isoelectric focusing was carried out using pH 3–10 carrier ampholytes and separated in 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and probed with anti-stathmin polyclonal Ab or anti-phosphorylated Ser-16 stathmin polyclonal Ab. After hybridization with secondary antibodies, the membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Wild-type stathmin (pGEX-4T1-stathmin-Flag) and stathmin mutated at specific serine residues (pGEX-4T1-stathmin-SAAA-Flag, pGEX-4T1-stathmin-ASAA-Flag, pGEX-4T1-stathmin-AASA-Flag, and pGEX-4T1-stathmin-AAAS-Flag) were transformed to E. coli and then treated with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) to induce recombinant protein expression. The recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). BGLF4 kinase assay was performed according to a previous report (38.Lee C.P. Chen J.Y. Wang J.T. Kimura K. Takemoto A. Lu C.C. Chen M.R. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5166-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For in vitro kinase assays, immunoprecipitates of BGLF4 or BGLF4-KD were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of GST-stathmin-Flag. All mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then the reactions stopped by adding 10 μl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Thereafter, all samples were subjected to immunoblotting and autoradiography. The other stathmin mutants, as well as the positive control protein, Histone H1, and negative control protein, GST protein, were used as substrates in similar experiments to those described above. Slide-cultured HeLa cells were transfected with 5 μg or 10 μg of pSG5 vector, pSG5-BGLF4, pSG5-BGLF4-KD, pSG5-stathmin-4E-Flag, pSG5-stathmin-4A-Flag, or pSG5-stathmin-Flag using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Fixed slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 1.56 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) and then permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. Fixed cells were then stained with rabbit anti-BGLF4 polyclonal Ab (1:100) (40.Wang J.T. Yang P.W. Lee C.P. Han C.H. Tsai C.H. Chen M.R. J. Virol. 2005; 86: 3215-3225Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), mouse anti-Flag M2 Ab (1:250) or rabbit polyclonal to beta tubulin Ab (1:200) (Abcam) at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline three times, slides were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Cappel) at 37 °C for 1 h. DNA was stained by Hoechst 33258 at room temperature for 90 s, and slides were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). Statistical analyses employed the correlation coefficient, Student's t test, and 2 × 2 Contingency Table of chi-squared test using Microsoft EXCEL. Briefly, the expression levels of BGLF4, phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated stathmin in twenty LCLs were quantified as described above. The correlation coefficients between levels of BGLF4 and stathmin (either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated) were calculated separately. Student's t test was used to compare the treated samples with the corresponding controls. To test whether any EBV products affect the activity of stathmin, we compared the results from LCL cells with and without spontaneous lytic cycle progression. Six representative LCLs are shown in Fig. 1A. All LCL lines expressed the EBV latent protein, EBNA2. In addition, expression of the EBV lytic kinase BGLF4 was observed clearly in Zta-expressing LCLs, including P1, P9, P13, and P14, but not in P15 or P7. Based on the relative density of total phosphorylated stathmin, levels of phosphorylated stathmin were apparently correlated with viral lytic protein expression, compared with lower or non-lytic protein-expressing cell lines (P15 and P7 cells). This suggests that stathmin phosphorylation might be regulated by EBV-lytic products. BGLF4 is the only EBV-encoded serine/threonine kinase and has a similar biological function to the cellular cdc2 kinase (33.Gershburg E. Pagano J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34.Kawaguchi Y. Kato K. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which is a protein kinase for stathmin (46.Luo X.N. Mookerjee B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Marklund U. Osterman O. Melander H. Bergh A. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30626-30635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the correlation coefficient was calculated between levels of BGLF4 and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated stathmin from twenty LCLs in total (data not shown). Levels of BGLF4 and phosphorylated stathmin are positively correlated (the correlation coefficient is 0.59); whereas levels of BGLF4 and nonphosphorylated stathmin are not correlated (the correlation coefficient is 0.12). To determine whether stathmin is hyper-phosphorylated and can act as a substrate of BGLF4, an IFA was performed in P1, P7, and P13 cells. In Fig. 1B, increasing fluorescent intensity of phosphorylated stathmin was observed in BGLF4-positive cells, compared with BGLF4-negative cells. To verify the importance of BGLF4 presence for stathmin phosphorylation, especially in reactivated EBV-positive cells, BGLF4 expression was knocked down in Rta-induced EBV-harboring NA cells. In Fig. 1C, the phosphorylation of stathmin was increased in NA cells with EB viral lytic cycle progression (lanes 1 and 2). However, the phosphorylation was abolished when BGLF4 expression was knocked down by siRNA (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). These data indicate that BGLF4 could be the protein responsible for stathmin phosphorylation during viral lytic cycle. As mentioned above, BGLF4 contributes to stathmin phosphorylation during EBV lytic cycle. Next, we used doxycycline-induced BGLF4-expressing 293 cells to confirm the effects of BGLF4 on phosphorylation of stathmin. In Fig. 2A, increasing phosphorylation of stathmin was clearly observed by following BGLF4 expression at 18, 24, 30, and 48 h, compared with the non-induction controls. In contrast, expression of BGLF4-kinase dead (KD) protein, which has a point mutation in the kinase domain of BGLF4, did not increase the phosphorylation of stathmin (Fig. 2B). Thus, this experiment demonstrated that BGLF4 expression is associated with stathmin phosphorylation. Moreover, comparing non-doxycycline-treated cells across all the time points for the level of phosphorylated stathmin (Fig. 2, A and B), we found a cell-cycle dependent increase in stathmin phosphorylation. This finding is reasonable because stathmin is known to be cell cycle-regulated (16.Larsson N. Melander H. Marklund U. Osterman O. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14175-14183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 46.Luo X.N. Mookerjee B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol.

Biochem./FEBS. 1994; 220: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Further, as shown in Fig. 2C, phosphorylation of stathmin increased with BGLF4 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Again, BGLF4-KD expression did not affect the phosphorylation of stathmin (Fig. 2D). Taken together, the EBV-encoded BGLF4 kinase can mediate stathmin phosphorylation in vivo. Based on the kinase dead data above and the fact that several cellular proteins are the"
https://openalex.org/W1966951195,"The polyisoprenoid diphosphates farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) are intermediates in the synthesis of cholesterol and related sterols by the mevalonate pathway and precursors for the addition of isoprenyl anchors to many membrane proteins. We developed tandem mass spectrometry assays to evaluate polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase activity of an unusual integral membrane lipid enzyme: type 1 polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase encoded by the PPAPDC2 gene (PDP1/PPAPDC2). In vitro, recombinant PDP1/PPAPDC2 preferentially hydrolyzed polyisoprenoid diphosphates, including FPP and GGPP over a variety of glycerol- and sphingo-phospholipid substrates. Overexpression of mammalian PDP1/PPAPDC2 in budding yeast depletes cellular pools of FPP leading to growth defects and sterol auxotrophy.

Studies using synthetic isoprenols with chemical properties that facilitate detection by mass spectrometry identify a pathway for interconversion of isoprenols and isoprenoid diphosphates in intact mammalian cells and demonstrate a role for PDP1/PPAPDC2 in this process. Overexpression of PDP1/PPAPDC2 in mammalian cells substantially decreases protein isoprenylation and results in defects in cell growth and cytoskeletal organization that are associated with dysregulation of Rho family GTPases. Taken together, these results focus attention on integral membrane lipid phosphatases as regulators of isoprenoid phosphate metabolism and suggest that PDP1/PPAPDC2 is a functional isoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase. The polyisoprenoid diphosphates farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) are intermediates in the synthesis of cholesterol and related sterols by the mevalonate pathway and precursors for the addition of isoprenyl anchors to many membrane proteins. We developed tandem mass spectrometry assays to evaluate polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase activity of an unusual integral membrane lipid enzyme: type 1 polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase encoded by the PPAPDC2 gene (PDP1/PPAPDC2).

https://openalex.org/W1975696281,"We propose a new method for mapping neural connectivity optically, by utilizing Cre/Lox system Brainbow to tag synapses of different neurons with random mixtures of different fluorophores, such as GFP, YFP, etc., and then detecting patterns of fluorophores at different synapses using light microscopy (LM). Such patterns will immediately report the pre- and post-synaptic cells at each synaptic connection, without tracing neural projections from individual synapses to corresponding cell bodies. We simulate fluorescence from a population of densely labeled synapses in a block of hippocampal neuropil, completely reconstructed from electron microscopy data, and show that high-end LM is able to detect such patterns with over 95% accuracy. We conclude, therefore, that with the described approach neural connectivity in macroscopically large neural circuits can be mapped with great accuracy, in scalable manner, using fast optical tools, and straightforward image processing. Relying on an electron microscopy dataset, we also derive and explicitly enumerate the conditions that should be met to allow synaptic connectivity studies with high-resolution optical tools."
https://openalex.org/W2013627084,"Microtubule-organizing centers recruit alpha- and beta-tubulin polypeptides for microtubule nucleation. Tubulin synthesis is complex, requiring five specific cofactors, designated tubulin cofactors (TBCs) A-E, which contribute to various aspects of microtubule dynamics in vivo. Here, we show that tubulin cofactor D (TBCD) is concentrated at the centrosome and midbody, where it participates in centriologenesis, spindle organization, and cell abscission. TBCD exhibits a cell-cycle-specific pattern, localizing on the daughter centriole at G1 and on procentrioles by S, and disappearing from older centrioles at telophase as the protein is recruited to the midbody. Our data show that TBCD overexpression results in microtubule release from the centrosome and G1 arrest, whereas its depletion produces mitotic aberrations and incomplete microtubule retraction at the midbody during cytokinesis. TBCD is recruited to the centriole replication site at the onset of the centrosome duplication cycle. A role in centriologenesis is further supported in differentiating ciliated cells, where TBCD is organized into ""centriolar rosettes"". These data suggest that TBCD participates in both canonical and de novo centriolar assembly pathways."

For glutamate, a multi-equilibrium binding reaction was discerned involving distinct ligand docking, domain isomerization, and lobe-locking steps. In contrast, kainate binding involves a simpler dock-isomerization process in which the isomerization equilibrium is shifted dramatically toward open domain conformations. In light of increasing evidence that the stability, in addition to the extent, of domain closure is a critical component of the channel activation mechanism, the differences in domain opening and closing equilibria detected for glutamate and kainate should be useful structural measures for interpreting the markedly different current responses evoked by these agonists.

In addition, these receptors undergo fast deactivation and desensitization along with slower recovery kinetics, which together shape the time course of current decay and restoration (1Trussell L.O.

Structurally, AMPA receptors are tetrameric membrane-bound proteins composed of modular subunits having two large extracellular domains, a membrane-spanning ion channel, and a C-terminal intracellular region (4Hollmann M.

Nature. 2006; 440: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). One of the extracellular domains, S1S2, is a bilobed structure that binds agonists in a cleft between its lobes (13Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Domain closure of S1S2 around the agonist leads to channel opening, and maximum currents have been attributed to complete lobe closure upon complex formation with full agonists (13Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 14Armstrong N. Gouaux E.

Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, among the full agonists examined, those like glutamate, which are less potent and which bind to S1S2 with lower affinity, produce higher rates of channel deactivation and resensitization (18Zhang W. Robert A. Vogensen S.B. Howe J.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), despite inducing the same degree of cleft closure in S1S2. This suggests that AMPA receptor function is dependent not only on the extent of lobe closure caused by the agonist but also on the lobe closing and opening dynamics associated with agonist binding and dissociation (19Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid ionotropic glutamate receptor 2 hydrogen-deuterium hydrogen-hydrogen protein backbone NH proton 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. A prevailing model for the binding reaction is S+G⇀↽k-1k+1SG⇀↽k-2k+2S*G(Eq. 1) where SG represents a state in which glutamate (G) has rapidly docked to sites in lobe 1 of S1S2 (S) (20Abele R. Keinanen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The species S*G establishes key contacts between glutamate and lobe 2, which brings about domain closure and triggers the opening of a gate in the ion channel. This has been referred to as the dock-isomerization model and is consistent with data from stopped flow (20Abele R. Keinanen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments (21Cheng Q. Du M. Ramanoudjame G. Jayaraman V. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the following model, which was recently proposed based on whole cell recordings of GluR2 channels, implies a related but more complicated binding reaction (18Zhang W. Robert A. Vogensen S.B. Howe J.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), O1β⇕α O2β⇕α O3β⇕αS+G⇀↽k-1k+1SG⇀↽COCCS*G1⇀↽CD1CS1S*G2⇀↽CD2CS2S*G3 β⇕αD1 γ⇕δ2D2 γ⇕δ3D3(Eq. 2) where Oi and Di (where i = 1, 2, or 3) denote open and desensitized channel states, respectively. Although this model accounts for structural changes occurring throughout a subunit of the tetrameric receptor, SG, S*G1, S*G2, and S*G3 were suggested to represent unique conformational states in the binding cleft of S1S2, with S*G3 possessing the highest degree of cleft closure stability (18Zhang W. Robert A. Vogensen S.B. Howe J.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The sequential nature of this mechanism was found to be critical to reproduce current responses for full agonists of varying potency and binding affinity for S1S2. For glutamate, receptors primarily occupy S*G1, whereas higher potency full agonists show increased occupation of S*G2 and S*G3. Importantly, though, longer application of glutamate followed by its sudden removal under nondesensitizing conditions leads to slower current decays corresponding to increased sampling of S*G2 and S*G3. According to Equation 2, these deactivation rates are dependent on agonist binding affinity and application time because increases in either of these variables increase the probability that the binding cleft of S1S2 is closed and populating S*G2 or S*G3 (18Zhang W. Robert A. Vogensen S.B. Howe J.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, solution studies of S1S2 have yet to answer the more fundamental question of whether lobe opening and closure occur by way of a single domain isomerization event, according to Equation 1, or whether there are indeed additional conformational equilibria in the binding cleft distinct from lobe isomerization that have measurable free energies, as suggested by Equation 2. In the present study, this question was addressed by performing hydrogen-deuterium (HD) exchange experiments on complexes of glutamate and kainate with S1S2J, a 30-kDa agonist-binding domain excised from a full-length GluR2 subunit (14Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To evaluate binding mechanisms, we determined free energy changes, ΔGE = −RT ln KE, associated with the solvent exposure of backbone NH protons (HNs) in S1S2J that are protected, in most cases by H-bonds, as a consequence of agonist binding and cleft closure. Assuming EX2-type Linderstrøm-Lang kinetics (22Berger A. Linderstrom-Lang K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1957; 69: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), equilibrium constants, KE, were estimated from KE = kHDX/k̃HDX, where kHDX is the measured HD exchange rate, and k̃HDX is the exchange rate in solvent-exposed states (see “Experimental Procedures”). Importantly, KE, in addition to providing a thermodynamic measure of structural stability, supplies mechanistic detail, because the OD−-catalyzed exchange reaction requires complete disruption of pre-existing H-bonds, including ones made to water molecules (24Eigen M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1964; 3: 1-19Crossref Google Scholar, 25Milne J.S. Mayne L. Roder H. Wand A.J. Englander S.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Previous studies have argued that small thermal fluctuations are not expected to lead to successful reactions but rather that separations of at least a few angstroms are required (25Milne J.S. Mayne L. Roder H. Wand A.J. Englander S.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 521-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Based on this view, domain opening and agonist dissociation events were inferred from the detection of hydrogen exchange at key sites protected through ligand binding and lobe closure. The key sites considered were HY450N, HG451N, HT480N, HS654N, and HT655N (Fig. 1B). HT480N in lobe 1 and HS654N and HT655N in lobe 2 are solvent-protected as a result of H-bonding to glutamate. In contrast, HY450N and HG451N are protected via interlobe H-bonds with the backbone COs of Asp651 and Ser652, respectively, where the former interaction is mediated by a water molecule. However, these interlobe H-bonds are not made in all of the glutamate-bound S1S2J crystal structures because of the ability of Asp651–Gly653 to adopt distinct backbone conformations (14Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Notably, for full agonists that have higher binding affinity than glutamate, the Asp651–Gly653 peptide tends to favor more the conformer that enables interlobe H-bond formation (14Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 15Hogner A. Kastrup J.S. Jin R. Liljefors T. Mayer M.L. Egebjerg J. Larsen I.K. Gouaux E. J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15635-15643Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and this apparent shift in equilibrium may be related to the increase in occupation probabilities of S*G2 and S*G3 for such agonists over glutamate (18Zhang W. Robert A. Vogensen S.B. Howe J.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Understanding the relative conformational free energies associated with the interlobe H-bonds and the interactions between glutamate and sites on lobe 2 is central to determining the binding mechanism. Assuming that glutamate docking to lobe 1 is rapid, similar free energy changes for these equilibria would provide strong evidence for a single-step mechanism of domain opening and closure, such as that implied in Equation 1. On the other hand, distinct free energy changes for these equilibria would be more consistent with Equation 2. Below, we provide evidence for the latter view, namely, that the mechanism of cleft closure for glutamate binding comprises multiple equilibria. However, our results for kainate binding, in which the interlobe H-bonds are absent (13Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 14Armstrong N. Gouaux E.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10600-10610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are consistent with Equation 1 and hence with previous results reported for kainate binding to GluR4-S1S2 (20Abele R. Keinanen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on the 263-residue protein S1S2J (14Armstrong N. Gouaux E.

Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). S1S2J was expressed in BL-21(DE3) Escherichia coli grown in fully deuterated minimal medium, and perdeuterated samples of the native protein were prepared via refolding from inclusion bodies and extensive purification (29McFeeters R.L.

NMR spectroscopic measurements were made using a Varian 500 MHz spectrometer fitted with a cryoprobe. The spectra were processed using Lorentzian-to-Gaussian window functions and modeled using Gaussian line shapes for the estimation of peak volumes (V) (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). 1H-15N peaks were identified based on assignments made previously (30Fenwick M.K. Oswald R.E. Biomol.

The measured peak intensity profiles were obtained from series of 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence-transverse relaxation optimized (33Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) spectra acquired after purified samples were transferred into deuterated buffers. Uncertainties in V were estimated based on the spectral noise, and errors in the fitted parameters were calculated from Monte Carlo simulations (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). For each spectrum, 192 × 2048 total (real plus imaginary) points were recorded with 32 scans performed per increment, which corresponded to ∼2 h. HD exchange measurements were carried out with solutions of 0.3 mm S1S2J, 25 mm sodium acetate, 25 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium azide, and either glutamate (0.45, 1, 4, or 10 mm) or kainate (4 or 10 mm). In most experiments, single protein samples were used to collect multiple series of spectra at progressively increasing temperatures (T). This procedure helped identify conditions yielding appreciable intensity decays for accurately computing kHDX. Furthermore, for sites experiencing modest peak intensity loss at lower temperatures, it enabled kHDX determination for additional temperatures. Estimates for higher temperatures benefited from increased line sharpening. Specifically, the data in Figs. 2 (A–C), 2 (D and E), 3 (A–C), 3 (D–F), 3G, 3H, 5 (C and D), and 5E were taken from eight experimental runs carried out at {10, 14, 18, 21, 25 °C}10 mm,5.1,F, {10, 18 °C}1 mm,5.1,S, {14, 20, 25 °C}10 mm,6.65,F, {14, 20, 25 °C}1 mm,6.4,F, {25 °C}4 mm,6.68,S, {25 °C}0.45 mm,6.68,S, {10, 14 °C}10 mm,5.1,F, and {25 °C}4 mm,6.63,S, respectively.

Freeze-dried samples of agonist-bound S1S2J were resuspended in pure D2O buffered by deuterated acetic acid, whereas solution exchanges were carried out to >99% via two or three 15-min dilution-concentration cycles using Millipore Amicon Ultra-4 concentrators at 2 °C.FIGURE 31H-15N peak intensity-time profiles from four HD exchange experiments involving 0. 3 mm GluR2-S1S2J.

Our aim was to formulate a general scheme that reduces to Equations 1 or 2 for two or four agonist-bound states of S1S2J, respectively. However, we note that whereas Equations 1 and 2 describe forward reactions for agonist binding followed by domain closure, we considered the reverse reaction in our HD exchange analysis. This view was taken because it is conventional and convenient to consider transitions from solvent-protected to solvent-exposed states.

M is equal to both the number of transition states and the number of agonist-bound states. The Xi states denote that the HN being monitored has undergone HD exchange, which was assumed to occur irreversibly in solutions containing nearly 100% D2O. Structurally, P0 contains the maximum number of protective H-bonds (or other interactions), and movement in the direction of P0 to PM corresponds to the successive disruption of H-bonds. HD exchange rates are typically used (26Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 521-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 35Dempsey C.E. Prog.

Linderstrom-Lang K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1957; 69: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), P0⇀↽kP1kE1P1⇀k~HDXX1(Eq. 4) whose general solution is as follows. kHDX=kE1k~HDX/(kP1+kE1+k~HDX)(Eq. 5) In this case, K1 = kE1/kP1, where kE1 and kP1 are transition rates into solvent-exposed and protected states, respectively. k̃HDX is the HD exchange rate in the solvent accessible state. In the EX2 limit (kP1 ≫ kE1, k̃HDX) (23Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), Equation 5 reduces to K1 = kHDX/k̃HDX. This ratio of HD exchange rates can be computed directly from experimental data and is defined here as KE = kHDX (T, pD)/k̃HDX (T, pD). KE was calculated for several HNs in S1S2J and related to the conformational equilibrium constants (Ki) of Equation 3. By extension, for any M in Equation 3, KE=K1+K1K2+⋯+∏i=1M-1Ki+∏i=1MKi/[L](Eq. 6) and the overall binding dissociation constant is KD=∏i=1MKi(Eq. 7) where [L] is the free ligand concentration. Equations 6 and 7 assume that k̃HDX ≡ k̃HDX,1 = k̃HDX,2 = … = k̃HDX,M, exchange is slow relative to the conformational transition rates, and ΔGE ≫ RT (or KE ≪ 1), which implies that the HN is well protected from solvent exposure (see supplemental materials). For the determination of KE, k̃HDX was estimated using the random coil approximation, i.e. k̃HDX = k̃D[D+] + k̃OD[OD−] + k̃D2O[D2O], where k̃D, k̃OD, and k̃D2O are tabulated, sequence-specific HD exchange rates for HNs in model peptides (36Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). For particular HNs in S1S2J, this approximation was found to be inaccurate, and corrected values were estimated as described under “Results.” Although this study focused primarily on HD exchange, we also conducted several HH exchange experiments to obtain an independent assessment of H-bond stability. For example, a CLEANEX-PM pulse sequence (37Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) was used to test whether 1H-15N magnetization could be built up over millisecond time scale windows by HH transfer from water (for which coherent 1H magnetization was maintained) to S1S2J HN sites. Such experiments were applied to solutions of 0.3 mm S1S2J, 25 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium azide, 10 mm sodium glutamate, and 25 mm of either sodium acetate (pH 5.1, 6.0, 6.9, 7.5, and 8.7), EPPS (pH 8.0), CHES (pH 9.5), or CAPS (pH 10.3). In general, as the buffer pH is increased typically to above 10, the EX1 limit (k̃HHX ≫ kP1, kE1) (23Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) is approached for protected HNs, and Equation 5 becomes kHHX = kE1. However, at such pHs, S1S2J was observed to be unstable. Thus, kHHX measurements using CLEANEX at pHs nearer to 9 were made to obtain lower bounds for structural opening rates. Although kHHX could be measured for HG451N and HG653N using this approach, these pHs were too low to detect HH transfer for the more stable key binding site HNs. The particular 1H-15N magnetization build-up curves shown in Fig. 2F were acquired from experiments involving 256 × 1024 total points and 64 scans/increment. Peak intensities, V(τm), were obtained for seven mixing times, τm, involving 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, or 150 mixing cycles of ∼350 μs. These V(τm), along with intensities from reference heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra, Vref, were used to estimate kHHX according to established procedures (37Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Uncertainties in V(τm) and Vref were estimated from the spectral noise and were propagated to obtain the uncertainties in V/Vref. HD exchange lifetimes, τHDX = 1/kHDX, for S1S2J backbone HNs were measured over 10–25 °C, pD 5.1–6.68, and several glutamate concentrations. Under these conditions, exchange is base catalyzed (k̃HDX = k̃OD [OD−]), and in the EX2 limit where kHDX is proportional to k̃HDX, kHDX changes by a factor of 10ΔpD for a change ΔpD at a given T. At the slowest exchange conditions considered (pD 5.1, 10 °C), all of the key HNs involved directly in binding and lobe closure were found to be sufficiently protected for HD exchange analysis. FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 demonstrate that these sites exchange over distinct time scales. In particular, HG653N and HG451N undergo rapid exchange with τHDX of 3.4 and 9.3 h, respectively, at pD 5.1 and 10 °C (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2F, exchange at these sites is fast enough to be detected from HH transfer experiments (37Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) performed under alkaline conditions at which 1H-15N magnetization was built up over 50 ms via proton exchange from water. The kHHX reported for pH 9.5 may be considered as lower bounds for the structural transition rates that expose HG653N and HG451N to solvent. In contrast, HY450N and HT480N do not experience significant HD exchange for any T explored at pD 5.1. For these HNs, higher pDs of ∼6.5, where the driving force for exchange is 25 (101.4) times greater, were required to obtain quantifiable τHDX (Fig. 3). Finally, HS654N and HT655N exchange on intermediate time scales with τHDX comparatively long at pD 5.1 (Fig. 2, A–E) and short at pDs near 6.5 (Fig. 3, A, D, and G). When glutamate is bound to both lobes of S1S2J through H-bonding as shown in Fig. 1B, HT480N, HS654N, and HT655N are protected from undergoing HD exchange. Hence, the τHDX of these HNs should decrease significantly for decreasing concentrations of glutamate because, after dissociation, τHDX is determined largely by a competition between ligand rebinding and HD exchange. We tested for su"
https://openalex.org/W2021899462,"One of the earliest events in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development is the accumulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the center of muscle cells. The unplugged/MuSK (muscle specific tyrosine kinase) gene is essential to initiate AChR clustering but also to restrict approaching growth cones to the muscle center, thereby coordinating pre- and postsynaptic development. To determine how unplugged/MuSK signaling coordinates these two processes, we examined the temporal and spatial requirements of unplugged/MuSK in zebrafish embryos using heat-shock inducible transgenes. Here, we show that despite its expression in muscle cells from the time they differentiate, unplugged/MuSK activity is first required just prior to the appearance of AChR clusters to simultaneously induce AChR accumulation and to guide motor axons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of unplugged/MuSK throughout the muscle membrane results in wildtype-like AChR prepattern and neuromuscular synapses in the central region of muscle cells. We propose that AChR prepatterning and axonal guidance are spatio-temporally coordinated through common unplugged/MuSK signals, and that additional factor(s) restrict unplugged/MuSK signaling to a central muscle zone critical for establishing mid-muscle synaptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2059286602,"The telomeric complex, shelterin, plays a critical role in protecting chromosome ends from erosion, and disruption of these complexes can lead to chromosomal instability culminating in cell death or malignant transformation. We reported previously that dominant-negative mutants of one of the telomeric proteins called TIN2 cause death of androgen receptor (AR)-negative but not AR-positive prostate cancer cells, raising the question of a possible role of AR in the structural stability of telomeric complexes. Consistent with this possibility, in the present study, we observed that the AR antagonist Casodex (bicalutamide) disrupted telomeric complexes in AR-positive LNCaP cells but not in AR-negative PC-3 cells. Immunofluorescent studies revealed colocalization of TIN2 and AR. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies showed association of AR with telomeric proteins. Furthermore, telomeric proteins were overexpressed in prostate cancer cells compared with normal prostate epithelial cells, and sucrose density gradient analysis showed co-sedimentation of AR with telomeric proteins in a shelterin-like mega complex. Together, these observations suggest an allosteric role of AR in telomere complex stability in prostate cancer cells and suggest that AR-antagonist Casodex-mediated cell death may be due to telomere complex disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2015285056,"CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) controls DNA imprinting, insulates important gene expression, and mediates growth factor- and stress-induced cell fate. However, regulatory mechanisms involved in intracellular CTCF activity are largely unknown. In this study, we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced increase and UV stress-induced decrease in CTCF activities mediate human corneal epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. CTCF is regulated by activation of different NF-kappaB subtypes via stimulation by EGF and UV stress. EGF-induced formation of a p65/p50 heterodimer activated CTCF transcription to promote cellular proliferation. This was accomplished by the heterodimer binding to a kappaB site in the promoter region of CTCF gene. In contrast, UV stress induced formation of a p50/p50 homodimer, which suppressed CTCF expression leading to apoptosis. Thus, CTCF by itself plays a central role in mediating the dichotomous effects of growth factor- and stress-stimulated NF-kappaB activation on cell survival and death. These results suggest that CTCF is a downstream component of the NF-kappaB pathway involved in the core transcriptional network of cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2067598275,"The role of the PEA3 subfamily of Ets transcription factors in breast neoplasia is controversial. Although overexpression of PEA3 (E1AF/ETV4), and of the related factors ERM (ETV5) and ER81 (ETV1), have been observed in human and mouse breast tumors, PEA3 factors have also been ascribed a tumor suppressor function. Here, we utilized the MMTV/Wnt1 mouse strain to further interrogate the role of PEA3 transcription factors in mammary tumorigenesis based on our previous observation that Pea3 is highly expressed in MMTV/Wnt1 mammary tumors. Pea3 expression in mouse mammary tissues was visualized using a Pea3NLSlacZ reporter strain. In normal mammary glands, Pea3 expression is predominantly confined to myoepithelial cells. Wnt1 transgene expression induced marked amplification of this cell compartment in nontumorous mammary glands, accompanied by an apparent increase in Pea3 expression. The pattern of Pea3 expression in MMTV/Wnt1 mammary glands recapitulated the cellular profile of activated β-catenin/TCF signaling, which was visualized using both β-catenin immunohistochemistry and the β-catenin/TCF-responsive reporter Axin2NLSlacZ. To test the requirement for PEA3 factors in Wnt1-induced tumorigenesis, we employed a mammary-targeted dominant negative PEA3 transgene, ΔNPEA3En. Expression of ΔNPEA3En delayed early-onset tumor formation in MMTV/Wnt1 virgin females (P = 0.03), suggesting a requirement for PEA3 factor function for Wnt1-driven tumor formation. Consistent with this observation, expression of the ΔNPEA3En transgene was profoundly reduced in mammary tumors compared to nontumorous mammary glands from bigenic MMTV/Wnt1, MMTV/ΔNPEA3En mice (P = 0.01). Our data provide the first description of Wnt1-mediated expansion of the Pea3-expressing myoepithelial compartment in nontumorous mammary glands. Consistent with this observation, mammary myoepithelium was selectively responsive to Wnt1. Together these data suggest the MMTV/Wnt1 strain as a potential model of basal breast cancer. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for a protumorigenic role of PEA3 factors in breast neoplasia, and supports targeting the PEA3 transcription factor family in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1965877574,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate much of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The extracellular ligand binding core (S1S2) of the GluR2 subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors can be produced as a soluble protein with properties essentially identical to the corresponding domain in the intact, membrane-bound protein. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, much has been learned about the structure and dynamics of S1S2 and the relationship between its ligand-induced conformational changes and the function of the receptor. It is clear that dynamic processes are essential to the function of ionotropic glutamate receptors. We have isotopically labeled side chain methyls of GluR2 S1S2 and used NMR spectroscopy to study their dynamics on the ps-ns and μs-ms time scales. Increased disorder is seen in regions that are part of the key dimer interface in the intact protein. When glutamate is bound, the degree of ps-ns motion is less than that observed with other ligands, suggesting that the physiological agonist binds to a preformed binding site. At the slower time scales, the degree of S1S2 flexibility induced by ligand binding is greatest for willardiine partial agonists, least for antagonists, and intermediate for full agonists. Notable differences among bound ligands are in the region of the protein that forms a hinge between two lobes that close upon agonist binding, and along the β-sheet in Lobe 2.

These receptors also play important roles in neuronal development and the formation of synaptic plasticity underlying higher order processes such as learning and memory (2.Asztély F. Gustafsson B. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 12: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, iGluRs are associated with neurologic disorders including epilepsy and ischemic brain damage and neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington chorea, Parkinson, and Alzheimer diseases. iGluRs are membrane-bound receptor ion channels composed of four subunits surrounding a central ion channel in which each subunit contributes to pore formation. Subunits are categorized by pharmacological properties, sequence, functionality, and biological role into those that are sensitive: 1) to the synthetic agonist α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA; GluR1–4); 2) to the naturally occurring neurotoxin kainate (GluR5–7, KA1,2); and 3) to the synthetic agonist N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA; NR1, NR2A-D, NR3A-B). ionotropic glutamate receptor α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (S)-5-bromowillardiine (S)-5-chlorowillardiine (S)-5-fluorowillardiine (S)-willardiine ((S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydro-2,4-dioxopyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)propanoic acid) (S)-5-iodowillardiine (S)-5-nitrowillardiine N-methyl-d-aspartic acid extracellular ligand binding domain of GluR2 (S)-3-(4-carboxybenzyl)willardiine.

The agonist binding domain is a bilobed structure that, under some conditions, can form dimers. The agonist binding site is in a crevice between the two lobes, and the closure of the lobes around the agonist is associated with the activation of the ion channel in the full-length, membrane-bound receptor (4.Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The receptor is a tetramer, built as a dimer of dimers (21.Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The dimer interface of the binding domain is intact in the activated form, but the dissociation of the interface is associated with desensitization (22.Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Although the large scale mechanisms (e.g. lobe closure is associated with channel activation) are relatively clear from the crystal structures, the kinetic and thermodynamic details of activation and desensitization require analysis by methods that can accurately detect dynamic processes (NMR, IR, etc.). This has led to additional insights into the function of these important neurotransmitter receptors. For example, studies using NMR spectroscopy suggest that partial agonists show increased dynamics in the μs-ms time scale that is associated not only with specific motions within the agonist binding site but also seems to report on large scale relative motions of the two lobes (11.Fenwick M.K. Oswald R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23.Maltsev A.S. Ahmed A.H. Fenwick M.K. Jane D.E. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10600-10610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that may be related to mechanisms of channel activation. Although backbone motions are of considerable interest, side chain methyl groups have the potential to report on motions not detected by other methods (24.Wand A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), because methyls tend to participate in the packing of the hydrophobic core of the protein. We report here on the motions of isoleucine, valine, and leucine methyl groups on the ps-ns and μs-ms time scales studied using NMR spectroscopy in combination with specific 13C and 1H labeling of the GluR2 S1S2 domain. On the faster time scale, binding of glutamate was found to induce a higher average order parameter of the methyl groups compared with all other ligands, possibly reflecting the fact that it is the natural ligand for this receptor and produces the least perturbation of the hydrophobic packing. On the longer time scale, motions were observed along the β-sheet of Lobe 2 for agonists and most partial agonists, but not antagonists. These motions as well as those near the hinge axis may provide additional details concerning processes associated with channel activation. AMPA, kainate, DNQX, IW, ClW, UBP282, and FW were obtained from Tocris (St. Louis, MO) or Ascent Scientific (Princeton, NJ). The GluR2 S1S2J construct was obtained from Eric Gouaux (Vollum Institute; Ref. 4.Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Isotopically labeled substrates were obtained from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA), except for sodium 2-ketobutyrate-4-13C,4,4-d2 and sodium α-ketoisovalerate-3-(methyl-13C, d2),4-13C,d2 which were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The GluR2 (flop) S1S2 domain consists of residues Asn-392—Lys-506 and Pro-632—Ser-775 of the full-length rat subunit (25.Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev.

The polyhistidine-tagged protein was expressed (37 °C) in inclusion bodies (BL-21(DE3) Escherichia coli), refolded, treated with trypsin for histidine tag removal, and purified (12.McFeeters R.L.

Two different labeling schemes were used for the carbon HSQC peak assignments and for relaxation experiments, although in both cases α-ketoacids were used for ILV labeling as described by Tugarinov and Kay (29.Tugarinov V. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13868-13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For the 1H,13C-HSQC peak assignments, bacteria were grown in fully deuterated M9 medium with 4 g/liter of [13C,2H]glucose, and 1 h prior to induction, 50 mg/liter α-ketobutyrate and 100 mg/liter of α-ketoisovalerate were added. The α-ketobutyrate and α-ketoisovalerate were uniformly 13C-labeled and had protons only in the methyl positions. This was achieved by exchanging deuterons into the β-position of α-ketobutyrate by incubation in D2O at 45 °C, pH 10.5, for 20 h (30.Gardner K.H. Rosen M.K. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1389-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and into the same position of α-ketoisovalerate by incubation in D2O at 45 °C, pH 12.4, for 3 h (31.Goto N.K.

The protein was also uniformly labeled with 15N using [15N]ammonium chloride as the sole source of nitrogen. Upon purification and refolding in H2O-based buffers, protons are exchanged back on the amides, so that the resulting protein is uniformly 15N- and 13C-labeled with protons on amide nitrogens and methyls of isoleucines (δ1 only), leucines, and valines, with deuterons elsewhere. This preparation was used to assign methyl group protons and carbons using the HCC-TOCSY and CCC-TOCSY experiments (32.Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. Series B. 1993; 101: 114-119Crossref Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To perform carbon relaxation experiments, the desired methyl group configuration was 13CHD2. Bacterial culture was initially grown in fully deuterated medium containing [12C,2H]glucose as the sole carbon source and [15N]ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. Approximately 1 h prior to induction, 50 mg/liter of sodium α-ketobutyrate-4-13C,4,4-d2 and 100 mg/liter of sodium α-ketoisovalerate-3-(methyl-13C, d2),4-13C,d2 were added to the growth medium (deuterons were exchanged into the β-positions as described above). Protein production was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.7 mm, and induction was allowed to proceed for ∼16 h. The protein was refolded and purified as described previously (11.Fenwick M.K. Oswald R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using H2O-based buffers. The resulting protein had protons at amide positions, and methyls in isotopomer configuration 13CHD2 in Ile δ1, Leu δ, and Val γ positions, with deuterons and 12C in all other positions. Protein yield was 3–4 samples of 0.25–0.35 mm purified protein per 1.25 liters of the growth medium. The NMR buffer was an aqueous solution of 25 mm sodium acetate, 25 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium azide, 100% D2O, pH 5.0. Final concentrations of kainate, fluorowillardiine (FW), chlorowillardiine (ClW), iodowillardiine (IW), and UBP282 were 3 mm, of AMPA and DNQX were 1 mm, and of glutamate was 10 mm. Ligands were exchanged using successive dilution and concentration using an Amicon Ultra-4 (10K) filter. All measurements were made on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance, z-gradient cryogenic probe at a sample temperature of 14 °C. T1 and T1ρ experiments were performed on 13CHD2 ILV-labeled S1S2 using pulse sequences similar to those described by Ishima et al. (33.Ishima R. Louis J.M. Torchia D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11589-11590Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and written by Tugarinov and Kay (34.Tugarinov V. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15970-15977Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Delays of 3, 15, 30, 50, 70, and 90(2) ms were used in T1ρ experiments and delays of 0.04, 0.2(2), 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 s were used in T1 experiments. Spectra with different delays were acquired in interleaved fashion to avoid the effects of potential loss of protein during the course of the experiment. The resulting data file was separated into the appropriate number of files each containing a single two-dimensional spectrum, which was then processed using NMRPipe (35.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional spectra were analyzed in Sparky (36.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco1995Google Scholar). The internal Sparky function for fitting to exponential decay was used to obtain values of R1 and R1ρ, and their error estimates (500 Monte-Carlo iterations were performed to obtain standard deviations). The transverse relaxation rate was calculated using Equation 1. R2=(R1ρ−R1cos2θ)/sin2θ,(Eq. 1) where θ = arctan(ω1/Δω) (37.Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 911-912Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 38.Davis D.G. Perlman M.E. London R.E. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The values of R1 and R2 were used to extract the order parameter Saxis2 and the methyl internal rotation correlation time τf closely following the procedure described in Tugarinov and Kay (34.Tugarinov V. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15970-15977Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CPMG experiments on 13CHD2 ILV-labeled S1S2 used a pulse sequence modified from the T1ρ spin-lock sequence by substituting a train of 180° carbon pulses, separated by delays of 2τcpmg, in place of the carbon spin-lock period as described by Ishima et al. (33.Ishima R. Louis J.M. Torchia D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11589-11590Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The duration of the relaxation delay was set to 40 ms, and the number of pulses was varied. Spectra were obtained with 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, and 48 CPMG pulses (setting the pulse spacing as τcpmg = 40 ms/2 × (number of pulses)). A reference spectrum completely omitting the relaxation delay was also obtained. Spectra for the same ligand were obtained in interleaved fashion and transformed as described for T1 and T1ρ experiments. Peak heights, measured in Sparky, were used to calculate relaxation dispersion profiles. Relaxation rates as a function of effective CPMG frequency were calculated according to Mulder et al. (39.Mulder F.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) using Equation 2, R2(vcpmg)=−1TInI(vcpmg)I0(Eq. 2) where T is the fixed duration of the relaxation period (40 ms), Io is the peak height measured when omitting the relaxation period, and I(νcpmg) is the peak height measured for a given frequency of CPMG pulses (νcpmg = 1/4τcpmg). The range of CPMG frequencies covered in these experiments was from 100 to 600 Hz. Because relaxation dispersion experiments were performed at only one value of static magnetic field (500 MHz), quantitation of the parameters of motion is limited. The chemical exchange contribution in a two-site exchange model is dependent on three parameters: fractional population of the minor (major) state, chemical shift difference between the two states, and exchange rate (kex). With the data from only one magnetic field, the values of the first two parameters cannot be reliably extracted; however, the value of kex can be determined. To improve quality of fits used to interpret CPMG data, it was supplemented with R2 values measured from spin-lock experiments that correspond to CPMG frequency of ∼2200 Hz. Note that the lowest frequency of CPMG pulses used in the present experiments was 100 Hz. Skrynnikov et al. (40.Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4556-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) found that the presence of the directly bound deuterons in CHD2 isotopomers at low CPMG frequencies interferes with decoupling and leads to a modulation of relaxation profiles not related to exchange. We observed aberrant relaxation rates at 50 Hz, but flat relaxation profiles for methyls not undergoing chemical exchange were observed when using CPMG frequencies of 100 Hz and above. Based on the backbone assignments previously reported (41.McFeeters R.L. Swapna G.V. Montelione G.T. Oswald R.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), CCC-TOCSY and HCC-TOCSY experiments were used to assign peaks in the 1H,13C-HSQC spectrum of the ILV-labeled S1S2 protein (Fig. 1A). Only the δ1 methyl of Ile is protonated, and the resulting Ile peaks occupy an isolated portion of the spectrum. All 16 of the possible resonances were assigned. Val and Leu have two protonated methyl groups, but in some cases, only one was observed either due to peak overlap or fast relaxation. Peaks belonging to 35 of 38 Val and Leu were identified in the 1H,13C-HSQC spectrum. No attempt was made to obtain stereospecific assignments. In all, 88% of the observed peaks (76 of 86) in the 1H,13C-HSQC spectrum were assigned. Fig. 1B shows the distribution of the assigned ILV methyls within the structure of GluR2 S1S2 (glutamate-bound). In Lobe 1, all 36 residues were represented in assignments, and in Lobe 2, 15 of 18 were represented (only Leu-639, Leu-650, and Val-68 had no assignments; colored green in Fig. 1B). Assignments of the 1H,13C-HSQC spectrum for other ligands were obtained by comparison with glutamate assignments. This resulted in little ambiguity. In the few cases in which the assignment could not be made with certainty, the peak was omitted from consideration. The most conspicuous differences in order parameters (Saxis2) are seen at different parts of the protein rather than among the different ligands tested. Clusters of lower order parameters are found in two positions in Lobe 2 (Ile-664/Val-666, Val-723/Leu-727) and in Lobe 1 (Leu-483/Val-484, Leu-401/Leu-442/Ile-444). The most striking cluster, however, is in the last two helices (J and K helices) that are involved in dimerization of the protein (Fig. 2). Although the protein is largely monomeric under these conditions (12.McFeeters R.L. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10472-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is this part of the protein that forms the dimer interface at higher concentrations or in the presence of allosteric modulators. Also, allosteric modulators bind to a complex surface formed by the dimer interface, which includes the K helix. The intact receptor is a tetramer (dimer of dimers) and in two of the four subunits (one from each dimer), the C-terminal end of the K helix forms part of the interface with the other dimer (21.Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). This apparent loose packing of the helices against the remainder of the protein may be reflective of the increased dynamics typically observed in regions of proteins that participate in protein-protein interactions (42.Luque I. Leavitt S.A. Freire E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One unexpected aspect of these measurements is that the order parameters for bound glutamate are consistently somewhat higher than for the other ligands. These relatively small differences become much more significant when conformational entropies of methyls are calculated according to Yang and Kay (Ref. 43.Yang D. Kay L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar and Table 1). This would suggest that the packing of the hydrophobic cores of the protein is relatively unaffected by the bound ligand, with glutamate allowing somewhat tighter packing.TABLE 1Side chain conformational entropiesLigandEntropy S−T·S−T·S relative to glutamatecal/(K·mol)kcal/molGlutamate−23868.20AMPA−18553.0−15.2FW−18252.2−16.0IW−16647.6−20.6Kainate−16848.3−19.9DNQX−17951.3−16.9UBP282−16747.8−20.4 Open table in a new tab The presence or absence of chemical exchange, and the rate of chemical exchange can be inferred from dispersion plots of the type shown in Fig. 3. Methyl groups showing exchange (Rex ≥ 3 s−1; where Rex is defined as R2(100 Hz) − R2(2200 Hz)) are displayed in Fig. 4. Overall, the weaker partial agonists of the substituted willardiine series (IW and ClW) show the greatest number of residues exhibiting chemical exchange and the antagonists (DNQX and UBP282), and the very weak partial agonist kainate, show the least (Fig. 4). This is similar to the trend seen with ITC, in which, relative to glutamate, binding of antagonists is entropically less favored (16.Ahmed A.H. Thompson M.D. Fenwick M.K. Romero B. Loh A.P. Jane D.E.

In particular, a series of three methyl-containing side chains (Ile-481, Leu-498, and Ile-712) along the hinge axis for lobe closure show exchange for the willardiine partial agonists (Fig. 5A). I481 is in Lobe 1 and contacts the interlobe linkers. In this position, exchange is only observed for ClW and IW (Rex of 3.2 and 5.6 Hz, respectively), with different exchange rates (2000 and 1200 s−1, respectively). Leu-498 is part of the interlobe linkers and, with the exception of DNQX, shows some exchange for all bound ligands tested. However, the largest Rex was observed for ClW and IW. The only ligands that induce exchange in Ile-712 are FW, ClW, and IW. Relaxation dispersion data reveal that the exchange contributions are 9.2 Hz, 3.9 Hz, 2.8 Hz, and the values of kex are 2000 s−1, 2900 s−1, and 3400 s−1 for IW, ClW and FW, respectively. The chemical exchange seen in methyl groups along the hinge axis is consistent with previous studies (10.Ahmed A.H. Loh A.P. Jane D.E. Oswald R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12773-12784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11.Fenwick M.K. Oswald R.E. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10600-10610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which suggests that the willardiine partial agonists exhibit large scale lobe motions due at least in part to the steric hindrance from the halogen in the 5-position. This is much more pronounced for IW and ClW than FW, consistent with the more extensive exchange contributions along the hinge axis. A large number of hydrophobic contacts are made between the helices and the β-sheet in Lobe 1, creating what could be effectively considered a single rigid core. Exchange is observed throughout the hydrophobic cores of Lobe 1, particularly in the cases of the partial agonists, IW and ClW. In Lobe 2, the prominent hydrophobic cluster formed almost exclusively by helices F and G (Core A), makes only scarce hydrophobic contacts with the β sheet (Fig. 5C). Depending upon the bound ligand, exchange is seen at the surface of the β-sheet contacting Core A (Ile-500, Ile-502, Ile-504, Ile-633, Leu-727; Fig. 5B). This suggests a possibility of subtle movements of helices F and G as a whole with respect to the rest of Lobe 2. Core A is a critical part of the structure both in the formation of the dimer interface and the interaction between the two dimers (see “Discussion” and Sobolevsky et al. (21.Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar)). For agonists, the methyl groups facing Core A along the two interlobe β-strands show exchange, whereas this is much less apparent for the antagonists and the weak partial agonist kainate, for which most of the exchange is associated with proximity to the artificial linker replacing the ion channel domain. The reason for this may be related to strain in forming the closed lobe conformation. The closure of the two lobes brings the loop containing Asp-651 and Ser-652 (“flip region”) into close contact with Lobe 1 such that the backbone flips and hydrogen bonds can be ma"

Senkevich T.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One feature that appears to distinguish SF2 and SF1 helicases is the mechanism of substrate binding and strand separation. SF1 helicases such as Rep, PcrA, and UvrD make extensive base contacts that have been proposed to aid in single strand translocation (3Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Lee J.Y. Yang W. Cell. 2006; 127: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In contrast, crystal structures of several SF2 helicases (i.e. Hel308, HCV NS3, and RecG) reveal that the core enzyme makes extensive contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone (5Büttner K. Nehring S. Hopfner K.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C.

Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although specific base contacts are evident and appear to have some functional contribution, as in the Hel308 crystal structure, biochemical data suggest that backbone contacts are the dominant functional mode of interaction for SF2 helicases (8Pyle A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 317-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although SF1 helicases appear to interact more closely with substrate bases, neither SF1 nor SF2 helicases display sequence dependence. Indeed, the lack of sequence specificity would appear to be a general feature for most RNA and DNA helicases, because strict sequence specificity might hinder translocation of the enzyme along its substrate (9Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 10Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol.

Target specificity is thus apparently conferred with the aid of accessory proteins, cofactors, or other such means (12Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J. Gene. 2003; 312: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RecBCD is one notable exception, where recognition of a specific sequence element (Chi) causes drastic changes in helicase behavior (13Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Gaudier M. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Biochemical studies on the viral helicase nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase II (NPH-II) have been important for establishing the molecular mechanism and substrate recognition determinants for SF2 helicases. NPH-II is an essential protein from the vaccina pox virus and a prototypical member of the functionally distinct DEAD/DExH helicases (so named for the characteristic ATPase motif) that are involved in many known aspects of RNA metabolism (10Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Although the specific function of NPH-II remains unknown, NPH-II is thought to play an important accessory role in transcriptional termination of early viral genes in vivo, perhaps by preventing the formation of secondary structures that might mask the early termination signal (14Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8549-8557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Moss B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Willkins, New York2001: 2850-2882Google Scholar). In vitro, NPH-II tracks along the backbone of single-stranded RNA in a processive, unidirectional 3′ → 5′ manner with a kinetic step size of six base pairs (16Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Kawaoka J. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It efficiently unwinds RNA and RNA·DNA duplexes, and it can strip proteins from single-stranded RNA molecules (16Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Science. 2001; 291: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although NPH-II can bind DNA and RNA with equal affinity, NPH-II appears to have a clear preference for RNA as an unwinding substrate (19Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11798-11802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NPH-II is tolerant of nicks and polyglycol linkers in the displaced strand but not in the tracking strand. Abasic residues can be traversed on either strand, albeit with greatly reduced efficiency on the tracking strand (17Kawaoka J. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data support the conclusion that NPH-II is an RNA-specific translocase and helicase that primarily engages backbone contacts (such as phosphoryl oxygens and the ribose 2′-hydroxyl) as it moves along its single-stranded RNA track. Here we demonstrate that although RNA is a preferable substrate in many respects, NPH-II can employ a DNA tracking strand when presented with an appropriate substrate. This surprising activity appears to be modulated by a sensitivity of the helicase to the composition of the substrate nucleobases in both RNA and DNA contexts. Specifically, NPH-II strongly prefers substrate tracking strands that are rich in purine nucleotides, whether RNA or DNA. These data suggest that NPH-II engages with the nucleobases in some important manner and that, contrary to an exclusive backbone tracking mechanism, the nucleobase component of recognition may help regulate and/or target helicase activity. These results establish the first known example of a SF2 helicase that is strongly influenced by substrate sequence. We further demonstrate how this sequence bias may be used in vivo to selectively target the activity of this helicase to specific locations within the viral genome. A new protocol was optimized that allowed for adequate expression and purification from bacterial cell culture. Unless otherwise indicated, protein for this study was prepared in the following manner. In brief, His6-tagged protein was expressed in Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) at 16 °C for 12 h. The protein was first purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The protein was then either subjected directly to gel filtration or was passed over a heparin column, followed by gel filtration, concentration, and a second heparin column. The aliquots were stored at −80 °C in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% CHAPS. Protein preps were normalized by measuring the ATPase activity of each prep. 1 unit is defined as the amount of protein in ng to hydrolyze 1 pmol of ATP in 1 min. RNA substrates used in the nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM) experiments were designed to have as little internal secondary structure as possible, as determined by M-Fold. The top strand consisted of sequence 5′-GGA GUG CAU GUC CUA GCG UCG UAU CGA UCU GGU CGU CUC C-3′. The bottom strand consisted of sequence 5′-GGA GAC GAC CAG AUC GAU ACG ACG CUA GGA CAU GCA CUC CAC UGA CUA ACA CGU ACU AAC AGG AUC AAC U-3′. These substrates were synthesized via in vitro transcription from plasmid or DNA oligonucleotide templates using T7 RNA polymerase or Y639F RNA polymerase. To create a pool of modified tracking strands, phosphorothioate ribonucleotides (NαS) or phosphorothioate deoxyribonucleotides (dNαS) (Trilink, San Diego, CA) were statistically incorporated (10%) into a transcription reaction for the loading strand RNA. Each transcription reaction was supplemented with only a single analog (ATPαS, CTPαS, dATPαS, and dCTPαS, etc.) for a total of eight different substrate pools. After gel purification, top strand transcripts were treated with Antarctic Phosphatase (New England Biolabs), 5′ end-labeled, and annealed to the tracking strand. The sequence and incorporation levels were checked by iodine cleavage and sequencing PAGE to ensure equal incorporation rates across all pools. RNA (54 nt and shorter) and chimeric RNA-DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. The substrates were prepared as described previously (16Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The substrate duplexes contained a 5′-32P end label on the top strand. The substrates were stored at −20 °C in a buffer of 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaCl. The sequence for the viral growth factor pseudo R-loop was taken from the C11R gene of the vaccinia virus genome (GenBankTM accession number AY243312, locus tag VACWR009). The pseudo R-loop substrate synthesized as above and purified on a native salt polyacrylamide gel (12% acrylamide, 0.5× TBE, 70 mm NaCl) and stored in a buffer of 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 154 mm NaCl. Trap RNA (24-bp duplex flanked by a 3′ single stranded tail of 18 nucleotides; top strand, 5′-GCC UCG CUG CCG UCG CCA GCA UAU-3′; bottom strand, 5′-AUA UGC UGG CGA CGG CAG CGA GGC AGA GGA GCA GAG GGA GCA-3′) was prepared as described previously(19Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To identify optimal conditions for the NAIM experiment, the extent of unwinding was varied from 5 to 50%, and [NaCl] was varied from 10 to 120 mm. An optimal interference signal was detected with >50 mm NaCl and < 20% unwinding. A salt concentration of 70 mm was therefore chosen because it produced strong interferences but preserved relatively high levels of unwinding activity. The final reaction conditions were 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 4 mm Mg(OAc)2, 70 mm NaCl, 50 units/μl NPH-II at 25 °C, unless otherwise stated. NPH-II protein was preincubated with duplex substrate (0.5–2 nm) for 10 min at 25 °C and initiated by the simultaneous addition of 3.5 mm ATP and 400 nm Trap RNA (19Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reactions were quenched after 1 min, such that unwinding extent reached 15%. The duplex and unwound fractions were separated by native PAGE. Duplex, unwound, and untreated substrates were isolated and diluted to ∼30,000 cpm in 10 μl. The samples were then treated with iodine (final concentration, 1 mm) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The reactions were quenched by adding 30 μl of a 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA solution, 10 μl of 3 m NaOAc, 1 μl of 10 mg/ml glycogen, and 1 pmol of cold top strand; precipitated; and resuspended in 4 μl of the MOPS/EDTA solution and 8 μl of denaturing loading dye (95% formamide, 25 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). Each substrate pool (AαS, CαS, dAαS, dCαS, etc.) was treated and analyzed separately. Samples without iodine were also prepared in parallel. All of the products were loaded onto a 15% denaturing sequencing gel. The experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Sequencing gels of NAIM experiments were visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software. Peak areas for each band were determined using manual peak selection, and the intensity (I) of each band was calculated. Interferences at each position were calculated as described elsewhere (22Fedorova O. Boudvillain M. Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Hartmann R.K. Bindereif A. Schön A. Westhof E. Handbook of RNA Biochemistry. Wiley, Weinheim, Germany2005: 259-293Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In brief, deoxy and sulfur interferences were calculated as: sulfur interference = Idplx(NαS)/Iunw(NαS) and deoxy interference = Idplx(dNαS)/Iunw(dNαS). For NAIM studies of NPH-II, interference values (κ) greater than 1.5 were scored as interferences. Only interferences seen in at least two independent experiments were considered significant. Positions that showed both phosphorothioate and deoxy interferences were scored as sulfur interferences unless the κdeoxy was significantly greater than κPT (>1.5-fold). All of the unwinding time courses were conducted using the same buffer and conditions as the NAIM assay, unless otherwise stated. The reactions were stopped with two volumes of quench buffer (25 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 10% glycerol). Duplex and unwound products were normally resolved by 12% native PAGE. Unwinding of the pseudo R-loop substrate was resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 70 mm NaCl. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C for 2.5 h. The dried gels were visualized on a Storm PhosphorImager, and the reaction products were analyzed using ImageQuant software. All of the time courses were performed in triplicate. NPH-II is unable to unwind substrates that contain long stretches of DNA on the tracking strand except under highly permissive, low salt conditions (19Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Bayliss C.D. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 794-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether NPH-II is only sensitive to 2′-deoxy substitutions at certain positions on the tracking strand, we examined the ability of NPH-II to unwind chimeric substrates that contain short, three nucleotide segments of DNA placed at different intervals on an otherwise all RNA tracking strand. Surprisingly, these results showed that these small patches could be tolerated at certain locations, but not at others (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that NPH-II may be making specific 2′-hydroxyl contacts at discrete loci within the duplex relative to the single strand/double strand (ss/ds) junction, thus explaining the RNA substrate specificity. We also theorized that if such chemical “stepping” behavior exists, it may be related to the six base pair kinetic stepping described by Jankowsky et al. (16Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To more precisely define loci where NPH-II makes functional 2′-hydroxyl contacts, we developed a chemogenetic screen that is based on NAIM. NAIM involves the incorporation of phosphorothioate or deoxyphosphorothioate nucleotide analogs into RNA molecules during transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. When these pools of modified transcripts are subjected to a selection, such as unwinding by a helicase, the relative importance of individual functional groups can be assessed by quantifying how much a specific modification at a given position interferes with the success of the reaction (termed “interference effect” (24Boudvillain M. de Lencastre A. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Ryder S.P. Strobel S.A. Methods. 1999; 18: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Boudvillain M. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we were able to simultaneously probe the 2′-hydroxyl of each RNA residue of the tracking strand and identify those functionally related to unwinding by NPH-II (Fig. 2; see also “Experimental Procedures”). To generate substrates for NAIM analysis of NPH-II unwinding, a 70-nt tracking strand was randomly doped with phosphorothioate (PT) or deoxyphosphorothioate (deoxy PT) NTPs. These PT containing strands were annealed to a 40-nt RNA top strand, thereby creating a 40-bp duplex with a 30-nt 3′ single-strand overhang. The reaction conditions, set at a relatively high salt concentration of 70 mm NaCl, were chosen to challenge the helicase such that slight perturbations in the system would yield quantifiable interference effects (19Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11798-11802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate pool was partially unwound by NPH-II, and a series of interference effects was observed (Fig. 3). Several phosphorothioate (sulfur) interferences were scattered throughout the duplex, indicating positions at which pro-Rp phosphoryl oxygens on the tracking strand make specific contributions to RNA unwinding by NPH-II. Deoxynucleotide interferences were also observed throughout the duplex, including a single interference in the 3′ ss region at position −1 relative to the ss/ds junction (Fig. 3B). Analysis of the interference patterns shows that interferences are generally spaced at various positions along the duplex. Between these regions are small patches of nucleotides that are relatively free of interference signals. Importantly, these noninterfering clusters coincide with the locations of the “permissive” DNA chimeric patches (Fig. 1A). These data confirm that NPH-II does not view each ribose sugar identically in this substrate. However, the interferences do not appear to occur with any specific spacing (e.g. 6 bp, corresponding to the observed kinetic step size) and are generally inconsistent with a pattern of regular, periodic contact with a specific subset of ribose sugars. Closer examination of the interference pattern reveals that with the exception of position −1, all deoxynucleotide interferences arose from pyrimidine nucleotides (Fig. 3C). Even the sequences of our preliminary chimeric substrates showed that the “permissive” DNA patches were purine rich, whereas the “nonpermissive” patches were rich in pyrimidines (Fig. 1A). This result implies that the interference pattern may be more related to the sequence of the substrate than the hypothesized chemical stepping mechanism. To differentiate between these possibilities, we created a truncated version of the NAIM substrate, and we defined three distinct regions that are based on the NAIM interference pattern: region B as a noninterfering region, C as an interfering region, and B/C as a transition region between the two (Fig. 4A). We then constructed a series of chimeric tracking strands based on the parental RNA sequence, each with a 3-nt DNA patch in either region B, B/C, or C. The sequence of the DNA patch was changed to either the purine sequence dG·dA·dG (B-dPu, B/C-dPu, C-dPu) or the pyrimidine complement dC·dT·dC (B-dPy, B/C-dPy, C-dPy), for a total of six chimeric substrates. Each of these substrates was subjected to unwinding by NPH-II under the same stringent conditions, and the resultant unwinding time courses were fit to a single exponential, yielding values for the apparent rate constant (kobs) and unwinding extent (amplitude, A) under single-cycle unwinding conditions (Fig. 4, B–D; see also “Experimental Procedures”). The unwinding parameters obtained for each of the chimeric substrates were then compared with those of the parental all-RNA substrate. Intriguingly, each of the new dPy substrates was unwound with reduced efficiency when compared with the parental RNA (Fig. 4D). For unwinding of substrates B-dPy and C-dPy, a 3-fold reduction in unwinding amplitude and a nearly 4-fold reduction in rate constant were observed. Substrate B/C-dPy showed a 12-fold reduction in unwinding amplitude. In contrast, unwinding of the dPu substrates resulted in rate constants and amplitudes comparable with that of the parental RNA (Fig. 4C). These results are significant in that we were able to convert a permissive region, B, to nonpermissive merely by substituting three dPy in the place of dPu. Similarly, we converted a nonpermissive region, C, to permissive by substituting the dPu in place of the dPy. The pattern also held true for region B/C, which was intermediate between the two. This experiment demonstrates a clear preference for dPu over dPy regardless of position, which suggests that engagement with the bases may be relevant for the unwinding mechanism of NPH-II. The demonstrable preference for dPu raises the question of whether purines and pyrimidines can both contribute to the mechanism of unwinding or whether purine residues play a uniquely important role in the process. To determine whether a dPy base is better than no base at all, we constructed a substrate that contains a patch of deoxyribose abasic (dab) residues in the C region (C-dab) to compare with the unwinding of substrates C-dPu and C-dPy. Unwinding of substrate C-dab resulted in a 10-fold reduction in unwinding amplitude, in contrast to the 3-fold reduction of substrate C-dPy (Fig. 4E). These data indicate that in the DNA context, all nucleobases make important contributions to the unwinding of substrates by NPH-II. They also indicate that although purine residues are preferable, pyrimidines retain some level of functionality. One potential explanation for the observed bias toward purine bases is that NPH-II is not sensitive to the base composition per se but is responding to differences in the thermodynamic stability of the substrates. For example, it has been demonstrated that rPu·dPy hybrid duplexes are more stable than the equivalent rPy·dPu duplexes (27Hung S.H. Yu Q. Gray D.M. Ratliff R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4326-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To address this question, we designed two new substrates, Pu21 and Py21, which contain 21-nt regions consisting entirely of either Pu or Py nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 5A). Based on these parental RNA substrates, we designed two sets of hybrid and chimeric substrates (Fig. 5B). Each set consists of six tracking strands: one all RNA, one all DNA, and four RNA chimeras with 3, 6, 12, or 21 DNA nucleotides within the 21-homonucleotide stretch. When annealed to either RNA or DNA, the thermodynamic stabilities of these substrates can be estimated using published tables (28Freier S.M. Kierzek R. Jaeger J.A. Sugimoto N. Caruthers M.H. Neilson T. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 9373-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 29SantaLucia Jr., J. Hicks D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These values are summarized as a line plot in Fig. 5C. Generally, we observe that as we increase the DNA content of the substrates, the thermodynamic stability of the duplexes decrease. In particular we note a substantial energetic decrease when DNA replaces RNA as the top strand (10–20 kcal mol−1). Importantly, we observe that with an RNA top strand, the Py21 substrates are more stable, whereas the Pu21 substrates are more stable with the DNA top strands. We tested NPH-II unwinding of these substrates using the same unwinding conditions as previously indicated. The extents of unwinding of each substrate are summarized as a bar chart in Fig. 5C. NPH-II unwinding was almost completely inhibited on all of the Py21 substrates paired with an RNA top strand. Intriguingly, this was true even on the RNA track. This result indicates that the Pu/Py bias is not limited to just the DNA context but is applicable for RNA substrates as well. When Py21 was paired with a DNA top strand (creating a weaker duplex), NPH-II performed somewhat better. It efficiently unwound through the RNA and 3-deoxy tracks, but as the DNA patch was extended, NPH-II unwinding was increasingly inhibited. This shows that although NPH-II is somewhat sensitive to the stability of its substrate, the helicase still responds negatively to the presence of dPy nucleotides. In contrast, NPH-II was able to efficiently unwind the Pu21 chimeric substrates in all cases, even when the duplexes were substantially more stable than their Py21 counterparts. It is also important to note that each of these hybrid chimeric substrates adopts a predominantly A-form conformation. These data confirm that the Pu/Py bias cannot be explained by differences in thermodynamic stabilities or helical geometries but arises from the identity of the nucleobases themselves. These data show that, once it is underway, NPH-II can displace a DNA top strand from a DNA track. Given the wealth of data demonstrating a relative lack of NPH-II activity on DNA (19Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the fact that NPH-II readily unwinds a substrate containing a 21-bp DNA duplex is surprising. Whether NPH-II can function completely as a DNA helicase is questionable, however, given that the Pu21 and Py21 substrates were not unwound by NPH-II when the entire tracking strand was composed of DNA (Fig. 5C). There are several possible explanations for the apparent inactivity of NPH-II on substrates that are completely composed of DNA. First, none of the substrates examined thus far contain exclusively purines on the tracking strand. It is possible that, given a homopurine sequence, NPH-II would be able to unwind a full DNA duplex. Second, it was previously shown that NPH-II unwinding can be inhibited by as little as four DNA nucleotides located on the single strand loading region immediately upstream of the single strand/double strand junction (19Kawaoka J. Pyle A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that, although NPH-II may be able to translocate on a dPu tracking strand, it may require an RNA component to productively initiate unwinding. Finally, NPH-II may prefer a certain helical geometry, such as A-form instead of B-form, independent of the backbone chemistry or sequence (21Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address these questions, we designed substrate Pu34 (Fig. 6A). The tracking strand of this substrate contains a 34-nt purine-rich patch that spans the entire duplex region. The single-stranded overhang region was composed of either DNA or RNA, resulting in a chimeric tracking strand. These tracking strands were both annealed to either RNA or DNA top strands (Fig. 6B) and treated with NPH-II as before. NPH-II displayed the highest level of activity when displacing an RNA top strand from the chimeric tracking"
https://openalex.org/W2026207569,"While the molecular mechanisms of DNA-protein specificity at the origin of replication have been determined in many model organisms, these interactions remain unknown in the majority of higher eukaryotes and numerous vertebrate viruses. Similar to many viral origins of replication, adeno-associated virus (AAV) utilizes a cis-acting origin of replication and a virus specific Replication protein (Rep) to faithfully carry out self-priming replication. The mechanisms of AAV DNA replication are generally well understood. However, the molecular basis of specificity between the Rep protein and the viral origin of replication between different AAV serotypes remains uncharacterized.By generating a panel of chimeric and mutant origins between two AAV serotypes, we have mapped two independent DNA-Protein interfaces involved in replicative specificity. In vivo replication assays and structural modeling demonstrated that three residues in the AAV2 Rep active site are necessary to cleave its cognate origin. An analogous origin (AAV5) possesses a unique interaction between an extended Rep binding element and a 49 aa region of Rep containing two DNA binding interfaces.The elucidation of these structure-function relationships at the AAV origin led to the creation of a unique recombinant origin and compatible Rep protein with properties independent of either parent serotype. This novel origin may impact the safety and efficacy of AAV as a gene delivery tool. This work may also explain the unique ability of certain AAV serotypes to achieve site-directed integration into the human chromosome. Finally, this result impacts the study of conserved DNA viruses which employ rolling circle mechanisms of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2131338123,"Background Cardiomyocytes derived from murine embryonic stem (ES) cells possess various membrane currents and signaling cascades link to that of embryonic hearts. The role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in regulation of membrane potentials and Ca2+ currents has not been investigated in developmental cardiomyocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the role of ANP in regulating L-type Ca2+ channel current (ICaL) in different developmental stages of cardiomyocytes derived from ES cells. ANP decreased the frequency of action potentials (APs) in early developmental stage (EDS) cardiomyocytes, embryonic bodies (EB) as well as whole embryo hearts. ANP exerted an inhibitory effect on basal ICaL in about 70% EDS cardiomyocytes tested but only in about 30% late developmental stage (LDS) cells. However, after stimulation of ICaL by isoproterenol (ISO) in LDS cells, ANP inhibited the response in about 70% cells. The depression of ICaL induced by ANP was not affected by either Nω, Nitro-L-Arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) inhibitor, or KT5823, a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) selective inhibitor, in either EDS and LDS cells; whereas depression of ICaL by ANP was entirely abolished by erythro-9-(2-Hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA), a selective inhibitor of type 2 phosphodiesterase(PDE2) in most cells tested. Conclusion/Significances Taken together, these results indicate that ANP induced depression of action potentials and ICaL is due to activation of particulate guanylyl cyclase (GC), cGMP production and cGMP-activation of PDE2 mediated depression of adenosine 3′, 5′–cyclic monophophate (cAMP)–cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in early cardiomyogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2093136700,"The re-emergence of tuberculosis (TB) in the mid-1980s in many parts of the world, including the United States, is often attributed to the emergence and rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although it is well established that TB transmission is particularly amplified in populations with high HIV prevalence, the epidemiology of interaction between TB and HIV is not well understood. This is partly due to the scarcity of HIV-related data, a consequence of the voluntary nature of HIV status reporting and testing, and partly due to current practices of screening high risk populations through separate surveillance programs for HIV and TB. The San Francisco Department of Public Health, TB Control Program, has been conducting active surveillance among the San Francisco high-risk populations since the early 1990s. We present extensive TB surveillance data on HIV and TB infection among the San Francisco homeless to investigate the association between the TB cases and their HIV+ contacts. We applied wavelet coherence and phase analyses to the TB surveillance data from January 1993 through December 2005, to establish and quantify statistical association and synchrony in the highly non-stationary and ostensibly non-periodic waves of TB cases and their HIV+ contacts in San Francisco. When stratified by homelessness, we found that the evolution of TB cases and their HIV+ contacts is highly coherent over time and locked in phase at a specific periodic scale among the San Francisco homeless, but no significant association was observed for the non-homeless. This study confirms the hypothesis that the dynamics of HIV and TB are significantly intertwined and that HIV is likely a key factor in the sustenance of TB transmission among the San Francisco homeless. The findings of this study underscore the importance of contact tracing in detection of HIV+ individuals that may otherwise remain undetected, and thus highlights the ever-increasing need for HIV-related data and an integrative approach to monitoring high-risk populations with respect to HIV and TB transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2018977555,"Depolarization induced charge movement associated currents, analogous to gating currents in channels, were recently demonstrated in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and were found to affect the receptor's Agonist binding Affinity, hence denoted AA-currents. Here we study, employing a combined theoretical-experimental approach, the properties of the AA-currents using the m2-muscarinic receptor (m2R) as a case study. We found that the AA-currents are characterized by a ""bump"", a distinct rise followed by a slow decline, which appears both in the On and the Off responses. The cumulative features implied a directional behavior of the AA-currents. This forced us to abandon the classical chemical reaction type of models and develop instead a model that includes anisotropic processes, thus producing directionality. This model fitted well the experimental data. Our main findings are that the AA-currents include two components. One is extremely fast, approximately 0.2 ms, at all voltages. The other is slow, 2-3 ms at all voltages. Surprisingly, the slow component includes a process which strongly depends on voltage and can be as fast as 0.3 ms at + 40 mV. The reason that it does not affect the overall time constant of the slow component is that it carries very little charge. The two fast processes are suitable candidates to link between charge movement and agonist binding affinity under physiological conditions."

Activation of the proapoptotic DR5 in various cancer cells triggers the extrinsic and/or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. It has been shown that there are several functional domains in the DR5 extracellular domain. The cysteine-rich domains of DR5 have a conservative role in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-DR5-mediated apoptosis, and the pre-ligand assembly domain within the N1-cap contributes to the ligand-independent formation of receptor complexes.

Antibodies against the antigenic determinant showed high affinities for DR5 and triggered caspase activation in a time-dependent manner, suggesting the NTR of DR5 might function as a potential death-inducing region.

Synthetic wild-type epitopes eliminated the cytotoxicity of all three agonistic monoclonal antibodies, AD5-10, Adie-1, and Adie-2.
