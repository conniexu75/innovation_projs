https://openalex.org/W1982036031,"Invasive breast cancer cells have the ability to extend membrane protrusions, invadopodia, into the extracellular matrix (ECM). These structures are associated with sites of active matrix degradation. The amount of matrix degradation associated with the activity of these membrane protrusions has been shown to directly correlate with invasive potential. We demonstrate here that microinjection of polyclonal anti-cortactin antibodies blocks matrix degradation at invadopodia supporting the hypothesis that cortactin has a direct role in invasive behavior. MDA-MB-231, invasive breast cancer cells were sheared from the surface of a gelatin matrix to isolate invadopodia. Cortactin, paxillin and protein kinase C (PKC) mu, a serine kinase, were co-immunoprecipitated as a complex from invadopodia-enriched membranes. We confirmed the subcellular distribution of these proteins by immunolocalization and Western blotting. We also determined that, in contrast to its presence in invasive cells, this complex of proteins was not detected in lysates from non-invasive cells that do not form invadopodia. Taken together, these data suggest that the formation of this cortactin-containing complex correlates with cellular invasiveness. We hypothesize that this complex of molecules has a role in the formation and function of invadopodia during cellular invasion."

Members of the Dbl family have been shown to function as physiological activators (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) of the Rho-like small GTPases. Although the expression of GTPase-defective versions of Rho proteins has been shown to induce a transformed phenotype under different conditions, their transformation capacity has been typically weak and incomplete relative to that exhibited by dbl -like oncogenes. Moreover, in some cases (e.g. NIH3T3 fibroblasts), expression of GTPase-defective Cdc42 results in growth inhibition. Thus, in attempting to reconstitute dbl -induced transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we have generated spontaneously activated (“fast-cycling”) mutants of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA that mimic the functional effects of activation by the Dbl oncoprotein. When stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells, all three mutants caused the loss of serum dependence and showed increased saturation density. Furthermore, all three stable cell lines were tumorigenic when injected into nude mice. Our data demonstrate that all three Dbl targets need to be activated to promote the full complement of Dbl effects. More importantly, activation of each of these GTP-binding proteins contributes to a different and distinct facet of cellular transformation.

Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1985; 316: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Ron D. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Eva A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2465-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since then, over 15 different oncogene products have been described that bear strong sequence and functional homology to the original Dbl protein (3Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 4Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Operationally, Dbl family members have been defined as proteins that contain the tandem arrangement of a pleckstrin homology domain adjacent to a unique domain (approximately 180 amino acids) found only in members of this family, and hence termed the Dbl homology domain. Many of these proteins possess high oncogenic activity, and indeed, most of the Dbl family members were initially found in gene transfer experiments through their ability to potently transform fibroblasts. Oncogenic activation of these cellular proto-oncogenes often occurs by a specific mutation or a chromosomal rearrangement event, which results in continuous, unregulated activity of the mutated proteins. To date, most Dbl family members have been shown to serve as activators, or guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 for Rho-like proteins (i.e. Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) (3Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Like all GTP-binding proteins, members of the Rho subfamily function as binary molecular switches that are “on” in the GTP-bound state and “off” in the GDP-bound state (5Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 6Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 7Hall A. Science. 1990; 249: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Deactivation (transition from the GTP to the GDP state) is achieved by their intrinsic GTP hydrolytic capability, which is further stimulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Activation of the GTP-binding proteins occurs in response to a variety of stimuli (such as cell cycle progression and growth factor/cytokine stimulation) and is mediated by GEFs, which stimulate the dissociation of bound GDP. GTP then rebinds, thus triggering the conformational change that leads to the activated state of the molecule. Because nucleotide exchange is the only biochemical activity demonstrated by Dbl proteins, and because transformation and exchange activities share common structure/function features (8Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been assumed that the activation of Rho proteins is the basis for the oncogenic activity demonstrated by Dbl proteins. A logical extension of this reasoning is that activated alleles of Rho proteins should be transforming when introduced into cells. Such dominant-positive reagents are typically generated by mutations of residues that are critical for GTP hydrolysis, thus rendering the protein GTPase-defective. When introduced into a cell, the GTPase-defective GTP-binding protein elicits a persistent stimulation of its signaling cascade, resulting in an exaggerated phenotype that directly demonstrates its involvement in a particular pathway. This is exemplified in the case of Ras, in which expression of either the Ras(G12V) or Ras(Q61L) GTPase-defective mutant is oncogenic (9Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. D'Alonzo J.S. Temeeles G.L. Wolanski B.S. Socher S.S. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and indeed, such mutations are found in a significant fraction of human tumors (10Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar). For members of the Dbl family, elucidation of their transformation mechanism has not been straightforward. Some oncogenic activity has been observed upon expression of the GTPase-defective proteins RhoA(Q63L), Rac1(G12V), and Cdc42(G12V) in fibroblasts and in immunocompromised mice (11Avraham H.

Furthermore, dominant-negative mutants of these proteins were shown to block Ras-induced transformation, indicating their critical role in proliferative signaling pathways (12Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 13Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). However, the oncogenic capacity of these proteins has been typically incomplete and weak. Moreover, stable overexpression of GTPase-defective Rho proteins has tended to be difficult. In particular, we have consistently found that significant overexpression of the GTPase-defective alleles (i.e. G12V or Q61L) of Cdc42 in NIH3T3 cells actually has detrimental effects on cell growth. This has prompted us to consider the idea that for proper signaling, Cdc42 must undergo a complete cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis. We have therefore used an alternative scheme for activation of ectopically expressed GTPases; rather than a mutation that blocks GTP hydrolysis, we have generated mutants that possess enhanced intrinsic GTP↔GDP exchange rate but maintain normal GTP hydrolytic activity. Thus, in vivo , these mutated (“fast-cycling”) GTP-binding proteins become activated spontaneously, and more closely reflect their in vivo activation by the Dbl oncoprotein. Indeed, we have previously shown that Cdc42(F28L) is activated in vivo , and that its stable overexpression in NIH3T3 cells is accompanied by a few hallmarks of malignant transformation (18Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Here, we use the fast-cycling versions of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA (i.e. the primary GTP-binding protein targets of Dbl) to assess their relative contributions to the total phenotype exhibited by Dbl-transformed cells. Rac1(F28L) and RhoA(F30L) mutations were made using a polymerase chain reaction strategy identical to that used earlier for generating the Cdc42(F28L) mutant (18Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The reaction included two internal primers harboring the Phe → Leu mutation, two external pET15b primers, and a template of the wild-type gene in pET15b. Expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli was performed exactly as described previously (18Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Leonard D.A. Sartoskar R. Wu J.W. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For transient expression in COS cells, the cDNAs encoding the GTP-binding proteins were subcloned into the (HA-tagged) pKH3 vector or the (Myc-tagged) pCDNA3 vector, using theBam HI-Eco RI restriction sites. For stable expression in NIH3T3 cells, constructs were subcloned into the (HA-tagged) pJ4H vector using the same restriction sites. For focus formation assays, a 3′ Bam HI site was added to all constructs by polymerase chain reaction, and theBam HI-Bam HI fragments were subcloned into theBam HI-digested pZipNeo vector, where correct orientation was verified by restriction digestion. Stable cell lines were generated by co-transfection of NIH3T3 cells with the indicated genes in the pJ4H vector, together with pCDNA3-Neo using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Neomycin-resistant colonies were selected by two consecutive culturing steps in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and neomycin (G418; 600 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant colonies were screened for expression of the desired protein by Western blotting the total lysates with anti-HA antibodies (HA.11; Berkely Antibody Co.). The Dbl-expressing cell line was generated by transformation of NIH3T3 cells with pZip-onco-Dbl (8Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by the isolation of a prominent focus and neomycin selection as described above. For primary focus formation assays, the indicated constructs in the pZipNeo vector were used to transfect subconfluent NIH3T3 cells in 6-well plates using the LipofectAMINE method. After 2 days, each well was split into two 100-mm plates and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Two weeks after transfection, cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet, and foci were scored under a microscope. For secondary focus formation assays, 1000 cells stably expressing the indicated constructs were mixed with 2 × 105 NIH3T3 cells and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. After 10 days, foci larger then 3 mm were scored from fixed and stained plates. Transfection protocols, cell culture and lysis, immunoprecipitation, kinase assays, and soft-agar growth assays were described in detail earlier (18Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Creasy C. Chernoff J. Cerione R. J. Biol.

Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or the binding of [35S]GTPγS as described (23Leonard D.A. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16210-16215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For measurements of GTP hydrolysis, 1 μm purified protein was incubated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm GTP, 100 nm [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in the presence of 15 mm EDTA for wild-type protein or 5 mm EDTA for fast-cycling proteins, at room temperature for 20 min. Hydrolysis was initiated by dilution with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MgCl2, with or without 0.01 μm Cdc42-GAP purified as described previously (23Leonard D.A. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16210-16215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis was measured at room temperature for Cdc42 and Rac1 and at 37 °C for RhoA. This assay has been described in detail (24Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 25Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA for the indicated GTP-binding protein in the pKH3 vector, with or without oncogenic Dbl in the pCMV vector. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells from 60-mm plates were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, 20 μm GTP, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotonin and incubated with 50 μg of recombinant glutathione S -transferase (GST)-PBD (20Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Creasy C. Chernoff J. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). GST-PBD was then precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads, washed three times with lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. Stable cell lines were cultured on dual-chamber microscope slides (Nunc) for 2 days in normal media, and then serum-starved for 12 h and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Slides were then sequentially incubated with anti-vinculin antibodies (Sigma), Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies, Texas Red phalloidin, and Hoechst-33342 (all from Molecular Probes). The slides were visualized and photographed on a Nikon Eclipse 600 fluorescence microscope. The various stable cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, trypsinized, and washed once with growth media and once with phosphate-buffered saline. 107 cells were injected subcutaneously into two dorsal sites of athymic nude mice (CD-1; Charles River Laboratories). Visible tumors (>0.5 cm) formed in the injection sites after the indicated latency and grew progressively for another week. A phenylalanine residue corresponding to position 28 in Ras is highly conserved in the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, in which it has been shown to interact with the guanine base of the nucleotide (26Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 27Feltham J. Dotch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R. Sutcliffe M.

Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Conservative substitution of this residue to a leucine resulted in a reduced affinity of the protein to guanine nucleotides in Ras (30Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cdc42 (18Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), leading to spontaneous activation (i.e. GTP binding) of the mutated protein when expressed in cultured cells. We have generated the corresponding mutations in Rac1 and RhoA (i.e. Rac1(F28L) and RhoA(F30L)) and expressed and purified these mutants to homogeneity from E. coli . The ability of these purified proteins to bind GTPγS was compared, and is shown in Fig. 1 A . As is typical for all GTP-binding proteins, the wild-type versions of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA show only negligible levels (<10%) of [35S]GTPγS binding activity in the presence of 15 mm MgCl2. The addition of EDTA, which chelates the tightly bound Mg2+ ion (31Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leads to complete exchange of the bound GDP for GTPγS (defined as 100% in Fig. 1 A ). The Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA point mutants, on the other hand, exhibit significant [35S]GTPγS binding activity, even in the presence of high Mg2+ (i.e. 63, 76, and 53% of the maximal binding, respectively), indicating a significantly higher basal nucleotide exchange activity. To fully assess the biochemical properties of the mutated GTP-binding proteins, we have also measured their ability to hydrolyze GTP in the presence and absence of the Cdc42-GAP (32Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26059-26062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GTP-binding proteins were complexed with [γ-32P]GTP, and GTP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of Mg2+ (33Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig.1 B, both the point-mutated Cdc42 and Rac proteins showed intrinsic GTP hydrolytic rates that were comparable to their wild-type counterparts. The intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity of RhoA has been consistently observed to be slower than the corresponding activities for Rac and Cdc42, and this activity is slightly reduced (by 30–50%) in the fast-cycling RhoA mutant. A similar affect has been seen when examining the analogous point mutation in Ras (30Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, each of the point mutants is fully responsive to GAP stimulation, yielding turnover numbers for GTP hydrolysis that are virtually indistinguishable from those for the wild-type proteins. Taken together, our in vitro results indicate that Cdc42(F28L), Rac1(F28L), and RhoA(F30L) all exhibit significantly higher GTP ↔ GDP exchange activity compared with their wild-type counterparts but maintain GTP hydrolytic capability. Because of their inherent ability to rapidly undergo GDP-GTP exchange and still hydrolyze GTP (thereby undergoing a fast GTP-binding/GTPase cycle), we have referred to these point mutants as fast-cycling mutants. It was our expectation that these mutants would be constitutively active in vivo (i.e. without the involvement of an extracellular signal or GEF activity), due to the high GTP:GDP ratio in cytosol (34Otero A.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In vivo activation of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho is accompanied by diverse biological phenotypes accomplished through interactions with different target proteins. To assess whether the Phe → Leu mutation indeed results in the spontaneous activation of the different GTP-binding proteins in vivo , we have utilized a modification of an assay developed to assess the activation level of Ras (24Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 25Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the GTP-specific high affinity interaction between the tested GTP-binding protein and the binding domain of its target, PAK-3 (20Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Creasy C. Chernoff J. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which is fused to GST to enable affinity precipitation. Thus, a recombinant GST fusion protein containing the p21-binding domain (PBD, also known as the CRIB (Cdc42/Rac-interaction binding) domain) (35Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) of PAK-3 immobilized on glutathione-agarose was incubated with lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with the different forms of Cdc42 and Rac1. Following extensive washes, the lysates (Fig.2 A, middle panel ) and the precipitated GST-PBD beads (Fig. 2 A, top panel ) were electrophoresed and blotted for the (HA-tagged) GTP-binding proteins. Fig. 2 A, middle panel, shows that each of the GTP-binding proteins were expressed to significant and similar levels. As expected, the co-expression of Cdc42 and Dbl (compare lanes 1 and5 ), as well as Rac1 and Dbl (compare lanes 3 and6 ), resulted in the enhanced precipitation of the GTP-binding protein, indicating that Dbl activates each of these proteins in cells. More importantly, the amounts of the fast-cycling versions of Rac1 and Cdc42 precipitated with GST-PBD were markedly higher than those of the wild-type GTP-binding proteins (comparelanes 1 and 2 or lanes 3 and4 ). We have used this assay also to compare the activation level of the fast-cycling version (F28L) with that of the GTPase-defective version (Q61L) of Cdc42 and Rac1. Under essentially identical experimental conditions, 20% of the expressed Cdc42(Q61L) precipitated with GST-PBD, versus 18% of the fast-cycling, Cdc42(F28L) mutant (± 2%; data not shown). This verifies that a significantly larger fraction of each Phe → Leu mutant is in the GTP-bound state, compared with the corresponding wild-type protein, and is consistent with the idea that the fast-cycling versions of Cdc42 and Rac1 are spontaneously activated when ectopically expressed in cultured cells. Another well characterized signaling end point for Cdc42 and Rac1 is a nuclear transcriptional activator, the c-Jun kinase (JNK1) (21Bagrodia S. Derigard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

We have previously reported that the expression of the Cdc42(F28L) mutant in COS-7 cells leads to activation of JNK1 (18Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We show here that this is also true for the Rac1(F28L) mutant. Fig. 2 B shows the results of an experiment in which wild-type Rac1, the GTPase-defective Rac1(Q61L) mutant, and the fast-cycling Rac1(F28L) mutant were co-transfected into COS-7 cells together with flag-tagged JNK1, and then immunocomplex kinase assays were performed following anti-flag immunoprecipitation. The JNK1 precipitated from cells expressing the Rac1(F28L) mutant exhibited levels of protein kinase activity (measured by the phosphorylation of c-Jun) that were comparable to those measured in cells expressing the Rac1(Q61L) mutant and significantly higher than the activity precipitated from cells expressing wild-type Rac1 or vector alone. We have also established NIH3T3 cell lines that stably express HA-tagged forms of Cdc42(F28L), Rac1(F28L), and RhoA(F30L). Taking advantage of the high affinity interaction between JNK and c-Jun, we examined the endogenous JNK activity in these stable cell lines as well as from cells expressing the oncogenic Dbl protein. Lysates from the different cell lines were incubated with recombinant GST-c-Jun immobilized on glutathione beads. The precipitated GST-Jun·JNK1 complexes were washed, incubated with MgCl2 and [γ-32P]ATP, electrophoresed, and autoradiographed. JNK activity, visualized as 32P incorporation into the GST-Jun protein, is shown in Fig. 2 C . It is clear from these data that JNK activity is stimulated 3–5-fold in cell lines expressing fast-cycling Cdc42, Rac1, or oncogenic Dbl, relative to mock-transfected cells. Stimulation of JNK activity by fast-cycling RhoA, can be detected only in cells expressing relatively high levels of RhoA(F30L), in accordance with previous reports (36Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X.

https://openalex.org/W2054272776,"The mitotic checkpoint is thought to be essential for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation by implementing mitotic delay in response to a spindle defect. To date, however, very little data has become available on the defects of the mitotic checkpoint in human cancer cells. In the present study, impaired mitotic checkpoint was found in four (44%) of nine human lung cancer cell lines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of frequent impairment of the mitotic checkpoint in this leading cause of cancer deaths. As an initial step towards elucidation of the underlying mechanism, we further undertook a search for mutations in a key component of the mitotic checkpoint, known as hsMAD2, and its immediate downstream molecule, p55CDC. No such mutations were found, however, in either 21 lung cancer cell lines or 25 primary lung cancer cases, although we could identify silent polymorphisms and the transcribed and processed hsMAD2 pseudogene that was subsequently mapped at 14q21-q23. The present observations appear to warrant further investigations, such as search for alterations in other components, to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of this fatal disease, and warn against potential misinterpretation when performing mutational analyses for other cancer types based on cDNA templates."
https://openalex.org/W2325028151,"Degradation of chromosomal DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments is one of the characteristics of apoptotic cell death. Here, we examined whether caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is responsible for the DNA fragmentation that occurs upon exposure to various apoptotic stimuli. When human Jurkat cells were exposed to etoposide, or UV or gamma radiation, a caspase-3-like protease was activated, and nuclear DNA was fragmented. Human TF-1 cells, which are dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), also underwent apoptosis accompanied by the activation of caspase-3-like protease and DNA fragmentation, when cultured without the cytokine. Both Jurkat and TF-1 cells expressed two forms of ICAD, ICAD-L and ICAD-S, which were cleaved upon exposure to these apoptotic stimuli. Among eight different caspases examined, recombinant caspases 3 and 7 specifically cleaved ICAD synthesized in a cell-free system. An expression plasmid containing mouse ICAD-L mutated at the caspase-3-recognition sites was then introduced into Jurkat and TF-1 cells. When the transformants were induced to undergo apoptosis (by treatment with etoposide, UV or gamma radiation for Jurkat cells, or factor withdrawal for TF-1 cells) they did not show DNA fragmentation, although they still died as a result of these stimuli. These results indicated that CAD, released from ICAD by caspase activation, is involved in the nuclear DNA fragmentation induced by these apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2090675060,"The t(2;13) and t(1;13) translocations of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) result in chimeric PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR transcription factors, respect-ively. In each chimera, a PAX DNA-binding domain is fused to the C-terminal FKHR transactivation domain. Previously we demonstrated that PAX3-FKHR is more potent than PAX3 because the FKHR transactivation domain is resistant to repression mediated by the PAX3 N-terminus. Here we test the hypothesis that the cis-acting repression domain is a conserved feature of PAX3 and PAX7 and that PAX7-FKHR gains function similarly. Using PAX-specific DNA-binding sites, we found that PAX7 was virtually inactive, while PAX7-FKHR exhibited activity 600-fold above background and was comparable to PAX3-FKHR. Deletion analysis showed that the transactivation domains of PAX7 and PAX7-FKHR are each more potent than either full-length protein, and resistance to cis-repression is responsible for the PAX7-FKHR gain of function. Further deletion mapping and domain swapping experiments with PAX3 and PAX7 showed that their transactivation domains exhibit subtle dose-dependent differences in potency, likely due to regions of structural divergence; while their repression domains are structurally and functionally conserved. Thus, the data support the hypothesis and demonstrate that PAX3 and PAX7 utilize a common gain of function mechanism in ARMS."

https://openalex.org/W2332948343,"We have previously developed an assay to measure DNA homologous pairing activities in crude extracts: The POM blot. In mammalian nuclear extracts, we detected two major DNA homologous pairing activities: POMp100 and POMp75. Here, we present the purification and identification of POMp75 as the pro-oncoprotein TLS/FUS. Because of the pro-oncogene status of TLS/FUS, we studied in addition, the relationships between cell proliferation and POM activities. We show that transformation of human fibroblasts by SV40 large T antigen results in a strong increase of both POMp100 and TLS/POMp75 activities. Although detectable levels of both POMp100 and TLS/POMp75 are observed in non-immortalized fibroblasts or lymphocytes, fibroblasts at mid confluence or lymphocytes stimulated by phytohaemaglutinin, show higher levels of POM activities. Moreover, induction of differentiation of mouse F9 line by retinoic acid leads to the inhibition of both POMp100 and TLS/POMp75 activities. Comparison of POM activity of TLS/FUS with the amount of TLS protein detected by Western blot, suggests that the POM activity could be regulated by post-translation modification. Taken together, these results indicate that POMp100 and TLS/POMp75 activitites are present in normal cells but are connected to cell proliferation. Possible relationship between cell proliferation, response to DNA damage and DNA homologous pairing activity of the pro-oncoprotein TLS/FUS are discussed."

Despite the expression of TRAIL receptors death receptor 4 and death receptor 5, purified TRAIL could not induce programmed cell death (PCD) in any of the thyroid follicular cells examined. However, pre-incubation with cycloheximide before TRAIL facilitated the induction of rapid and massive PCD. This suggested that despite the presence of a labile inhibitor of the TRAIL pathway, TRAIL could mediate PCD under appropriate conditions. To determine whether there were sources of TRAIL in the thyroid that could interact with thyroid follicular cell TRAIL receptors, RNase protection assays were used to determine TRAIL mRNA expression. TRAIL message was expressed in intrathyroidal lymphocytes isolated from a patient with thyroiditis, and unexpectedly, thyroid follicular cells themselves could be induced to express abundant TRAIL message in the presence of the inflammatory cytokines interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 1β.

Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). The processes involved in PCD are tightly regulated, and alterations in its function may result in disorders including cancer and autoimmune disease (4Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp.

Morphological changes indicative of PCD have been observed in normal thyroid glands and appear at increased frequency in thyroid tissue affected by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (7Kotani T.

PCD is also a mechanism by which cytotoxic T lymphocytes can destroy thyrocytes, which in turn may lead to hypothyroidism (7Kotani T. Aratake Y. Hirai K. Fukazawa Y. Sato H. Ohtaki S.

In contrast, suppression of PCD may contribute to thyroid proliferative diseases including goiter, cancer, and Graves' disease (8Tanimoto C. Hirakawa S. Kawasaki H. Hayakawa N. Ota Z. Endocr.

Defining the signaling components of PCD present in thyroid follicular cells is important because it may provide insights into potential pathogenic mechanisms and might lead to the development of pharmacological interventions for treatment of thyroid disease.

TRID and TRUNDD both act as decoy receptors and dominant-negative inhibitors of TRAIL-induced cell death (21Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.F. Yu G. Gentz R. Dixit V.M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). TRID is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein incapable of intracellular signaling due to the lack of a cytoplasmic tail (22Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Gurney A. Skubatch M.

TRUNDD has a truncated death domain. TRAIL, DR4, DR5, and TRUNDD each have a broad tissue distribution, suggesting that regulation may also occur at points beyond expression levels of ligand and receptor. Recently thyrocyte “fratricide” through PCD signaling by the CD95l-CD95 “ligand/receptor pair” has been advanced as an explanation for thyrocyte destruction in thyroiditis (29Giordano C. Stassi G. De Maria R. Todaro M. Richiusa P. Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Whereas this concept is questionable due to technical reasons (30Stokes T.A. Rymaszewski M. Arscott P.L. Wang S.H. Bretz J.D. Bartron J.L. Baker Jr., J.R. Fiedler P. Schaetzlein C.E. Eibel H. Papoff G. Stassi G. De Maria R. Giordano C. Galluzzo A. Bagnasco M. Ruberti G. Testi R. Science. 1998; 2792015aCrossref Google Scholar), PCD does appear to be important in this disease. TRAIL and its two death signaling receptors, DR4 and DR5, are closely related to CD95L and CD95, respectively (10Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R.

Science. 1997; 277: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), suggesting similar mechanisms of death signaling. This prompted us to investigate the expression and regulation of TRAIL, DR4, and DR5 in the thyroid. TRAIL is capable of inducing PCD in thyroid follicular cells, but only in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. From these results, we conclude that the TRAIL death pathway is present and can function in thyrocytes, but that a labile inhibitor of the TRAIL death pathway is present in thyrocytes. In addition, TRAIL expression is up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines in thyrocytes, and TRAIL expressed by a papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line was capable of specifically killing a TRAIL-sensitive cell line. These data indicate that the TRAIL-mediated cell death pathway may be important in thyroid disease. The KAT5 human papillary thyroid carcinoma-derived cell line (31Venkataraman G.M. Yatin M. Ain K.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), BJAB, and SW480, a human colon adenocarcinoma (both obtained from American Type Culture Collection), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). Normal thyroid tissue was obtained from patients at thyroidectomy from the uninvolved, contralateral lobes of thyroids with tumors.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The primary cultures were passaged in CellGro Complete media (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% NuSerum IV (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary thyrocytes were cloned by sparse plating after initial digestion, allowing the intact follicles to become adherent and isolating individual follicles with cloning rings by standard techniques. Thyroglobulin staining was performed as described previously (32Arscott P.L. Knapp J. Rymaszewski M. Bartron J.L. Bretz J.D. Thompson N.W. Baker Jr., J.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to determine thyrocyte purity, and only cultures that were >95% thyroglobulin-positive were used for experiments. Intrathyroidal lymphocytes were isolated from tissue obtained from a patient diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and after two cycles of panning to remove adherent thyrocytes, the nonadherent intrathyroidal lymphocytes were harvested for RNA isolation. Cells were treated with cytokines as described in the figure legends at the following concentrations: IFN-γ, 100 units/ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); TNF-α, 50 ng/ml (Collaborative Biomedical Products); IL-1β, 50 units/ml (Sigma Chemical Co.); and TRAIL (affinity-purified as described previously (19Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar) using bacterial expression from plasmid pET15b-His-FLAG-TRAIL). RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RiboQuant MultiProbe RNase Protection Assay System (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was used for the detection and quantitation of multiple, specific mRNA species.32P-labeled antisense RNA probes were prepared using the human apoptosis hAPO-3 and hAPO-3c template sets (PharMingen), which included probes for human TRAIL, DR4, DR5, and GAPDH. This was performed as described previously (32Arscott P.L. Knapp J. Rymaszewski M. Bartron J.L. Bretz J.D. Thompson N.W. Baker Jr., J.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the probes were hybridized with 2–10 μg of total RNA from treated thyrocytes. After hybridization, the samples were subjected to RNase treatment, followed by purification of RNase-protected probes. The protected probes were resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. We quantified transcripts by autoradiography, followed by densitometry. Relative amounts of message were corrected for RNA loading by comparison with the GAPDH band intensity for each sample. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay (33Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar) as described in Ref. 32Arscott P.L. Knapp J. Rymaszewski M.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and by staining with fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide (PI) quantitated by flow cytometry as described in Ref. 34Darzynkiewicz Z.

Specific inhibition of TRAIL-induced cell death was performed using TRAIL-neutralizing monoclonal antibody clone M180 (a kind gift from Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). PCD was determined by visual examination of morphological changes in the cells (membrane blebbing, rounding up, nonadherence). Western blot analysis of PARP cleavage and flow cytometry analysis of DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining were used to confirm that apoptosis had occurred. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (35Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar) using clone C2-10 anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (PharMingen). Flow cytometry analysis of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) was performed as described previously (34Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong J. Traganos F. Rose N.R. Conway De Macario E. Folds J.D. Lane H.C. Nakamura R.M. Manual of Clinical Laboratory Immunology. 5th ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1997: 334-343Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and harvested from the plates, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min on ice. Nonadherent cells were collected separately and added back to the harvested trypsinized cells before washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol (1 volume of cell suspension:10 volumes of ethanol). The cells were stored at −20 °C overnight before bromodeoxyuridine staining. On the day of staining, cells were centrifuged, washed once with rinsing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). For DNA fragment staining, cell pellets were resuspended and incubated with 25 μl of terminal transferase solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) containing reaction buffer, 80 μm bromodeoxyuridine triposphate, 6.25 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and 1.0 mmCoCl2 for 40 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed once with rinsing buffer and incubated with 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing PI (5 μg/ml) and RNase (200 μg/ml) (Sigma) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Green (anti-bromodeoxyuridine) and red (PI) fluorescence of the cells was determined on a FACSCAN flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed by CellQuest software. Apoptotic cells were defined as having both a euploid DNA content as measured by PI staining and DNA fragmentation greater than control cells as measured by anti-bromodeoxyuridine staining (TUNEL-positive). Dead cells were defined as subdiploid. Other cells (euploid, TUNEL-negative) were considered live. Annexin V staining was performed as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays were performed using the LIVE/DEAD® Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Briefly, KAT5 cells were plated at 5.0 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate and allowed to adhere for 5 h. These cultures were pretreated for 24 h with inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ (100 units/ml) and TNF-α (50 ng/ml) to induce TRAIL expression and washed three times with media to remove cytokines before adding BJAB cells. BJAB cells were labeled with DiOC18stain as described by the kit manufacturer and combined with KAT5 cultures at 4.0 × 104 cells/well. Control and neutralizing antibodies were added to KAT5 cultures 1 h before adding BJAB cells at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. PI was added at 50 μg/ml. The cells were co-cultured overnight. Nonadherent cells were removed and saved for analysis by flow cytometry as described by the kit manufacturer. RNase protection assays were used to determine the expression of DR4 and DR5 mRNA in thyrocytes. SW480 cells were used as a positive control. As shown in Fig.1, four separately isolated, cloned cultures of primary thyrocytes were assayed, and each showed similar levels of expression of DR4 and DR5, respectively. KAT5 cells also expressed DR4 and DR5. To determine whether TRAIL receptors identified in the thyroid are functional for inducing programmed cell death, we treated primary thyrocytes with purified recombinant TRAIL. Fig.2 A shows that the viability of primary thyrocytes is unchanged by the addition of TRAIL to the cell culture media as measured by MTT assay. However, because a labile inhibitor of CD95-mediated cell death has been reported to be present in thyrocytes (32Arscott P.L. Knapp J. Rymaszewski M. Bartron J.L. Bretz J.D. Thompson N.W. Baker Jr., J.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we pretreated cells for 72 h with CHX (a protein synthesis inhibitor), which selectively reduces labile inhibitor activity before TRAIL treatment. Fig. 2 B shows that the addition of TRAIL for 16 h after CHX pretreatment reduces thyrocyte viability by >75% at the highest concentrations of TRAIL used (50, 200, and 800 ng/ml). Further dilutions of TRAIL have diminished ability to reduce viability, indicative of a typical dose response. TRAIL-neutralizing antibody completely inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death in the presence of CHX at all but the highest concentration of TRAIL, thus showing the specificity of the recombinant TRAIL. This experiment is representative of consistent results in assays performed on 15 different tissue samples obtained from patients with various diagnoses. To determine whether the loss of viability seen by MTT assays was due to an active death process rather than cell cycle inhibition, we analyzed cells by staining with fluorescein diacetate and PI, both of which are viable stains that can be measured concurrently by flow cytometry. Both live and dead cells can be measured. After 2 h of incubation with TRAIL, >40% of the cells were dead, and the percentage of dead cells increased to >90% after 24 h (Fig.2 C ). Visual inspection of cells treated with TRAIL and CHX revealed the morphological changes indicative of PCD (data not shown). To definitively prove that the loss of viability was due to PCD, we assayed for phosphatidylserine expression on the outer layer of the plasma membrane by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and for nuclear DNA fragmentation of treated cells by flow cytometry. Fig.2 D shows the results of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining of treated, viable cells 2, 4, and 6 h after TRAIL treatment compared with the untreated control. Intact cells (PI-negative) showed an increased percentage of cells with annexin V binding after 4 (23% above control) and 6 h (38% above control) of treatment. TUNEL staining was also performed to determine whether DNA fragmentation, a specific marker for PCD, occurred in these thyrocyte cultures. As displayed in Fig. 2 E , 70% of thyrocytes treated with TRAIL for 5 h after CHX pretreatment had become apoptotic (euploid/TUNEL-positive) compared with less than 1% of control CHX-treated cells. The papillary thyroid carcinoma-derived KAT5 cell line was used to confirm TRAIL death-inducing activity in a defined thyroid cell line. KAT5 cells are sensitive to CD95-mediated PCD when combined with CHX (data not shown), and cancer cell lines, in general, are more likely to be susceptible to TRAIL (17Gura T. Science. 1997; 277: 768Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As in the primary thyrocytes, TRAIL alone could not reduce viability in KAT5 cells at a concentration of 800 ng/ml as determined by the MTT assay (Fig.3 A ). When combined concomitantly with CHX, TRAIL (6.4 ng/ml) significantly reduced the viability of KAT5 cells (63% reduction) compared with CHX treatment alone (Fig. 3 B ). The reduction in viability was almost completely inhibited by a specific TRAIL-neutralizing antibody. Visual observation of the cell cultures after TRAIL and CHX treatment revealed that the KAT5 cells exhibited morphological changes indicative of PCD including membrane blebbing, rounding up, and loss of adherence (data not shown). To further verify this finding, we used Western blot analysis to determine the cleavage of PARP, an indicator of PCD. The Western blot analysis in Fig. 3 C shows that treatment of KAT5 with TRAIL and CHX induces specific PARP cleavage from the full-size 116-kDa protein to the diagnostic 85-kDa fragment within 6 h, thus confirming that PCD is occurring in these cells. RNase protection assays were performed on total RNA isolated from cloned, normal primary thyrocytes, KAT5 cells, and intrathyroidal lymphocytes derived from a Hashimoto's thyroiditis gland sample to determine whether there was an endogenous production of TRAIL in the thyroid. These cells were treated for 6 h with various types of inflammatory cytokines before harvest and RNA isolation. RNase protection assays revealed that inflammatory cytokines can up-regulate expression of TRAIL mRNA in normal thyrocytes and KAT5 cells. TRAIL mRNA expression significantly increases in response to IFN-γ treatment in both normal thyrocytes and KAT5 cells and shows smaller increases induced by TNF-α and IL-1β treatment in normal thyrocytes. KAT5 cells also show TRAIL mRNA induction by TNF-α but not by IL-1β. The combination of IFN-γ with either TNF-α or IL-1β treatment synergized to produce dramatic increases in TRAIL message in both normal thyrocytes and KAT5 cells. The TRAIL mRNA expression pattern in response to cytokine treatment of the normal thyrocytes shown in Fig. 4 is representative of the results observed with six different patient samples. TRAIL mRNA was also expressed in unstimulated intrathyroidal lymphocytes isolated from a patient with thyroiditis. This suggests that TRAIL may be present within the inflamed thyroid. To determine whether TRAIL expressed by thyroid-derived cells is functional, we performed a cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay. We combined KAT5 cells with TRAIL-sensitive BJAB cells and measured BJAB cell death. Fig. 5 shows that KAT5 cells pretreated with the combination of cytokines that induced the greatest expression of TRAIL (IFN-γ and TNF-α) are capable of inducing cell death in >40% of BJAB cells compared with less than 10% cell death by untreated KAT5 cells. TRAIL-neutralizing antibody was capable of inhibiting BJAB killing by cytokine-treated KAT5 cells, reducing cell death to 25%. A Fas-neutralizing antibody was completely ineffective in inhibiting BJAB cell death. We also obtained similar results with a primary papillary thyroid cancer-derived culture. We have demonstrated that DR4 and DR5 mRNA are expressed in normal primary thyrocytes and in the papillary thyroid cancer-derived cell line KAT5. Primary thyrocytes and KAT5 cells were found to be susceptible to PCD induced by TRAIL, the ligand for DR4 and DR5, in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. This is the first instance in which TRAIL has been shown to kill normal primary cells other than activated T lymphocytes. This proves that the TRAIL death pathway is functional in thyrocytes and is likely to be mediated through DR4 and/or DR5. Expression of DR4 and DR5 by thyrocytes and in vitro susceptibility of thyrocytes to TRAIL (when combined with CHX) suggest that in vivo destruction of thyroid tissue by an endogenous TRAIL source is possible. Activated T lymphocytes are a known source of TRAIL (14Jeremias I. Herr I. Boehler T. Debatin K.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). TRAIL production by activated intrathyroidal T lymphocytes present in autoimmune disease could possibly mediate thyroid destruction. Indeed, we found that intrathyroidal lymphocytes isolated from a thyroiditis-derived thyroid tissue sample express TRAIL mRNA. Additionally TRAIL expression has a broad tissue distribution (10Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar, 11Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Ruppert S. Donahue C.J. Moore A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12687-12690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar), and it is possible that there may be alternative sources of TRAIL in the thyroid. As an example, we demonstrated that TRAIL message is up-regulated in thyrocytes by the same cytokines that are expressed by infiltrating lymphocytes associated with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and papillary thyroid cancer. CHX, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, has been used to increase the sensitivity of cells to the induction of apoptosis by the CD95 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 pathway by selectively reducing the relative concentrations of labile protein inhibitors (36Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 37Natoli G. Ianni A. Costanzo A. De Petrillo G. Ilari I. Chirillo P. Balsano C. Levrero M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1157-1164PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that CHX is able to restore susceptibility to anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody cross-linking in thyrocytes (32Arscott P.L. Knapp J. Rymaszewski M. Bartron J.L. Bretz J.D. Thompson N.W. Baker Jr., J.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to that observed in other cell types where the CD95 pathway is blocked by inhibitors. This suggests that the rate-limiting step in PCD is likely to be the activity of a labile inhibitor that blocks signal transduction, not the induction or activation of pathway components. The similarity of signal transduction mechanisms and the overlap of components of the CD95l- and TRAIL-induced cell death pathways suggest similar means of pathway regulation. Known inhibitors of the CD95 death pathway include FAP-1 (38Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), I-FLICE (FLIP) (39Hu S.

Several inhibitors of the CD95 pathway are known to be expressed in thyrocytes, including both FAP-1 and I-FLICE (data not shown). FAP-1 binds to a carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence motif of the CD95 cytoplasmic domain that is similar to a domain in DR4 (SLVversus SLE). Both DR4 and DR5 have been shown to be FLICE-dependent (26Pan G. Ni J. Yu G. Wei Y.F. Dixit V.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). I-FLICE can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of FLICE (39Hu S. Vincenz C. Ni J. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). TRAIL has two receptors (TRID and TRUNDD) that act as negative regulators of the TRAIL death pathway (26Pan G. Ni J. Yu G. Wei Y.F. Dixit V.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is not known whether any of these inhibitors or receptors are involved in inhibition of the TRAIL-induced death of thyrocytes. Selective removal of TRID by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C did not alter the TRAIL sensitivity of KAT5 cells (data not shown). Determination of the inhibitor(s) of the TRAIL death pathway in thyrocytes is of value because it may suggest possible mechanisms of pharmacological intervention in PCD-influenced thyroid disease. Recently, PCD signaling through the TRAIL-related CD95l-CD95 ligand/receptor pair has received attention as an explanation for autoimmune thyrocyte destruction (29Giordano C. Stassi G. De Maria R.

Data by Giordano et al. (29Giordano C. Stassi G. De Maria R. Todaro M. Richiusa P. Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) suggest that thyrocytes may commit suicide when IL-1β up-regulation of CD95 allows constitutively expressed CD95L to induce PCD in thyrocytes. We have been unable to document CD95L expression in thyrocytes (30Stokes T.A. Rymaszewski M. Arscott P.L. Wang S.H. Bretz J.D. Bartron J.L. Baker Jr., J.R. Fiedler P. Schaetzlein C.E. Eibel H. Papoff G. Stassi G. De Maria R. Giordano C. Galluzzo A. Bagnasco M. Ruberti G. Testi R. Science. 1998; 2792015aCrossref Google Scholar), but this does not preclude the possibility that TRAIL may be acting through its death receptors in a manner postulated for CD95L by Giordano et al. (29Giordano C. Stassi G. De Maria R. Todaro M. Richiusa P. Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Our data suggest three possible nonexclusive scenarios for the involvement of thyrocyte-derived TRAIL in the etiology of thyroid diseases. The first scenario is that inflammatory cytokine-induced thyrocyte-expressed TRAIL could initiate thyrocyte destruction symptomatic of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. This mechanism is similar to that proposed for CD95L as described above (29Giordano C. Stassi G. De Maria R. Todaro M. Richiusa P. Papoff G. Ruberti G. Bagnasco M. Testi R. Galluzzo A. Science. 1997; 275: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 47De Maria R. Testi R. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the fact that this pathway is blocked argues against this. The second scenario is that inflammatory cytokine-induced thyrocyte-expressed TRAIL could mediate thyrocyte evasion of autoimmune attack by killing the invading, cytokine-expressing lymphocytes. This would create a site of immune privilege within the thyroid. The third scenario is that inflammatory cytokine-induced thyroid carcinoma-expressed TRAIL could mediate tumor evasion of the immune system by killing the invading, cytokine-expressing lymphocytes. Supporting this scenario is our data that confirm that inflammatory cytokine-induced TRAIL expression by papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line KAT5 is functional in killing the lymphoid cell line BJAB through a TRAIL-dependent mechanism. In addition, supporting the latter two scenarios are the findings that activated T lymphocytes are known to be susceptible to TRAIL-induced cell death (14Jeremias I. Herr I. Boehler T. Debatin K.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Donahue C.J. Ruppert S. Bauer K.D. Ashkenazi A. Curr.

Sigle B. Schleusener H. Immunobiology. 1988; 176: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Also, there is evidence to suggest that papillary thyroid carcinomas are capable of evading immune attack in some cases (49Matsubayashi S. Kawai K. Matsumoto Y. Mukuta T. Morita T. Hirai K.

If normal thyroid follicular cells lost the capacity to produce TRAIL, they might lose the ability to fight off an autoimmune attack. In summary, we have demonstrated that DR4 and DR5 are expressed, and their ligand, TRAIL, can mediate PCD in thyrocytes. In addition, thyrocytes themselves can be induced to express functional TRAIL capable of killing lymphoid cells. This raises many possibilities for thyroid disease involvement by TRAIL. A greater understanding of the regulation and function of the TRAIL death pathway in the thyroid, including the determination of its endogenous inhibitors, may therefore provide insights into the factors involved in thyroiditis-induced thyroid damage and thyroid cancer. We thank T. Stokes for excellent technical assistance, S. H. Wang and members of the Dixit lab for helpful discussions, and V. Dixit for TRAIL expression vector pET15b-His-FLAG-TRAIL."
https://openalex.org/W2332631121,"The epidermis is continually exposed to harmful mutagens that have the potential to cause DNA damage. To protect the skin from accumulating mutated cells, keratinocytes have developed a highly regulated mechanism of eliminating damaged cells through apoptosis. Bcl-xL is a well-described cell survival protein that when overexpressed in skin can protect keratinocytes from UV radiation-induced apoptosis. To begin to unravel the complex mechanisms that keratinocytes use to survive, we wanted to characterize the role of endogenous Bcl-xL in protecting cells from death. In this study, we describe the development and characterization of an antisense inhibitor to Bcl-xL. We show that this inhibitor reduces Bcl-xL RNA and protein in a concentration-dependent, sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, treatment of keratinocytes and epithelial cells with this inhibitor sensitizes these cells to UV-B radiation and cisplatinum treatment-induced apoptosis. Thus, these results offer direct evidence that Bcl-xL is critical in the protection of skin and epithelial cells from apoptosis and provide a basis for the role of Bcl-xL in keratinocyte and epithelial cell survival."

https://openalex.org/W2334877760,"H19 is an imprinted and developmentally regulated gene whose product remains apparently untranslated. In a previous study on breast adenocarcinomas, we reported that overexpression of the H19 gene was significantly correlated with the presence of steroid receptors, suggesting the putative role of hormones in H19 transcription. To determine the mode of steroid action, we have detected levels of H19 RNA synthesis during mammary gland development by in situ hybridization (ISH): two peaks of H19 transcription occur during puberty and pregnancy. Furthermore, we demonstrated by ISH that in the uterus H19 RNA synthesis is high during estrus and metestrus phases. To test steroid control of H19 transcription, ovariectomized and adrenalectomized mice were supplemented, 1 week after surgery, with 17-beta-estradiol (E2, 20 microg/kg/day), progesterone (P, 1 mg/kg/day) or corticosterone (B, 0.3 mg/ kg/day) for 2 weeks. According to ISH data, E2 and to a lesser extent B stimulated H19 transcription in the uterus, whereas P inhibited it. To confirm the in vivo results, in vitro experiments were performed using cultures of MCF-7 cells (a hormone-sensitive mammary cell line). E2 stimulated the endogenous H19 gene of this cell line and tamoxifen inhibited this effect. Furthermore, we performed transient cotransfections in MCF-7, in HBL-100 (another hormone-sensitive mammary cell line) and in BT-20 (a hormone-insensitive mammary cell line) with various constructs of ERalpha (WT or mutated) and PR-A, in presence or absence of steroid hormones. We demonstrated that ERalpha up-regulated the H19 promoter in MCF-7 and in HBL-100, whereas PR-A did not have any effect per se. Moreover, in MCF-7, PR-A antagonized clearly the ERalpha-mediated promoter enhancement, but in HBL-100 this counteracting effect on the ERalpha up-regulation was not found. Interestingly, the same experiments performed in BT-20 cell line provided very similar results as those obtained in MCF-7 cells, with a clear down-regulation mediated by PR-A on the H19 promoter. All these in vitro data are in agreement with in vivo results. In addition, data obtained with ERalpha mutants indicate that H19 promoter activation is both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent. We have thus demonstrated that H19 gene expression is controlled by steroid hormones; furthermore, this gene is highly expressed in hormone-sensitive organs when the hormonal stimulation is accompanied with a morphological repair."

The activity of this enzyme is stimulated 4–14-fold in vitro by polyunsaturated fatty acids and anionic phospholipids. The structural basis for lipid activation of protein phosphatase 5 was examined by limited proteolysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Trypsinolysis removed the tetratricopeptide repeat domain and increased activity to approximately half that of lipid-stimulated, full-length enzyme. Subtilisin removed the tetratricopeptide repeat domain and 10 residues from the C terminus, creating a catalytic fragment with activity that was equal to or greater than that of lipid-stimulated, full-length enzyme. Catalytic fragments generated by proteolysis were no longer stimulated by lipid, and degradation of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain was decreased by association with lipid. A truncated mutant missing 13 C-terminal residues was also insensitive to lipid and was as active as full-length, lipid-stimulated enzyme. These results suggest that the C-terminal and N-terminal domain act in a coordinated manner to suppress the activity of protein phosphatase 5 and mediate its activation by lipid. These regions may be targets for the regulation of protein phosphatase 5 activity in vivo.

The major structural family of protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, the PPP1 family, includes PP1, PP2A, and 2B, also known as calcineurin, as well as several newer family members about which little is known (1Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that PPP family members are subject to complex regulation. For example, the catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A are bound to regulatory subunits and docking proteins that control their activity, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization (2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 3Lee E.Y. Zhang L. Zhao S. Wei Q. Zhang J. Qi Z.Q. Belmonte E.R. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D270-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to activation by calcium and calmodulin, calcineurin is also associated with proteins that control its intracellular location and activity (4Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol.

Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) is a member of the PPP family with a C-terminal catalytic domain related to those of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin, and an N-terminal domain consisting of three tetratricopeptide repeats or TPRs (6Becker W.

Tetratricopeptide repeats occur in a variety of unrelated proteins and are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (9Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem.

The TPR domain of PP5 interacts with a number of proteins in vitro , including the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (7Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Cdc 16p and Cdc 27p, which are two TPR-containing subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex (12Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. J.

Protein phosphatase 5 has also been shown to associate in vivo with heat shock protein 90 in complexes with glucocorticoid receptors (14Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol.

These findings suggest that the TPR domain docks PP5 to other proteins. These and other observations (8Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.

However, the role of PP5 in these processes and the mechanism(s) that control its activity are not known. We and others (17Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have shown that PP5 can be activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and anionic phospholipids in vitro , suggesting that PP5 may be subject to regulation. In the present study, we investigated the structural basis for the response of PP5 to lipid. Our results show that lipid activates PP5 by binding to its TPR domain and that proteolytic removal of the TPR domain partially activates the enzyme. In contrast, removal of 13 residues from the C terminus generates a fully activated form of PP5 that is rendered insensitive to lipid, indicating that without the C terminus the TPR domain alone cannot regulate activity. These results suggest that both the C terminus and the TPR domain act in concert to inhibit activity and mediate the activation of PP5 by lipid. All materials were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was purified from bovine heart (19Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F.

The PP5 C-terminal truncation mutant, PP5-(1–486), and the PP5 TPR domain construct, PP5-(1–159), were generated by using the polymerase chain reaction containing PP5-specific oligonucleotides and pET-GST-PP5 as template. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned downstream of the GST coding region of the bacterial expression vector pET-21a(+) GST (20Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and sequenced. All constructs were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), and protein was expressed, purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, cleaved from GST, and stored as described previously (17Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins contained an additional four residues at the N terminus, Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser, which are a remnant of the region linking GST to PP5 containing the thrombin cleavage site. Casein, lysine-rich histone (type III-S from calf thymus), and MBP (Life Technologies, Inc.) were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase as described previously (17Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase a was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and phosphorylase kinase as described by Cohen et al. (21Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Stralfors P. Tung H.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The average stoichiometry of phosphorylation for these substrates (mol of phosphate/mol of protein) was 0.2 for casein, 0.6 for histone, 0.5 for MBP, and 0.8 for phosphorylase a . Phosphatase reactions were performed with 2 or 4 nm enzyme in a final volume of 30 μl containing 60 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% ethanol, and 10 μm radiolabeled phosphosubstrate in the absence or presence of a maximally activating concentration of AA, 250 μm. Reactions were initiated with substrate and lipid and incubated at 30 °C for 10–15 min. Reactions were quenched with activated charcoal, and acid-soluble 32Pi was quantified by liquid scintillation as described previously (17Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The phosphate released from each substrate was less than 20% of the total present. The amount of ethanol added to lipid-stimulated or control samples had no effect on activity. Activity toward p NPP was assayed essentially as described previously (17Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C.

To determine phosphatase activity of catalytic fragments in the presence of the TPR domain, catalytic fragments purified from either subtilisin or tryptic digests were preincubated with recombinant PP5-(1–159) for 30 min at 4 °C, 15 min at 22 °C, or 15 min at 30 °C and then assayed as described above. Measurement of phosphatase activity in the presence of peptides corresponding to the C terminus of PP5 was performed by incubating peptides and enzyme at 30 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of substrate. All samples for peptide studies included a final concentration of 1.7% acetonitrile that had no significant effect on phosphatase activity. Peptides representing residues 481–499 or 487–499 of PP5 were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. Synergy (432A) peptide synthesizer. Peptides were solubilized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and bound to C-18 Sep-Pak columns (Waters, Inc.). After washing the columns peptides were eluted in 55–65% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, lyophilized, and re-solubilized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% acetonitrile. Recombinant proteins were incubated with either trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or subtilisin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the absence or presence of 250 μm lipid for 0–120 min at 30 °C. All digests contained 0.4% ethanol, which had no effect on proteolysis. Tryptic digests contained 0.2 mg/ml recombinant protein, 4 μg/ml trypsin, 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.004 nHCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 2–5% glycerol, and 0.4% ethanol. Subtilisin digestion reactions contained 0.2 mg/ml recombinant protein, 8 μg/ml subtilisin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 4 mm CaCl2, 2–5% glycerol, and 0.4% ethanol. For phosphatase assays, an aliquot of the digestion reaction was removed at various times and diluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol containing either 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for trypsin or 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for subtilisin to quench the reaction. Matched samples for SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis analysis were quenched by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). Protein was sedimented and then redissolved in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on SDS gels containing 10 or 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide, and protein bands visualized using R-250 Coomassie (23Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). For zero time points, samples were withdrawn before the addition of protease but were otherwise identical. Proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and transferred to ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) as described by LeGendre et al . (24LeGendre N. Mansfield M. Weiss A. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 75-80Google Scholar). Coomassie-stained protein bands were then subjected to sequence analysis, using either a model 491 or model 470A gas phase sequencer equipped with a model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Samples were digested for 60 min and then treated with the appropriate protease inhibitor and diluted to a final Tris concentration of 15–45 mm. Samples were then subjected to anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q HR 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 25 °C. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 50-ml gradient of 0–750 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, and 4 mm MnCl2. Chromatography buffer also contained either 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor depending on the protease used for digestion. Fractions containing active catalytic fragments, eluting at 140 mm NaCl for subtilisin digests or 220 mm NaCl for trypsin digests, were pooled, dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (4 °C), 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MnCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Fractions containing the tryptic TPR fragment eluting at 280 mm NaCl were pooled, dialyzed, and stored as described above. After anion exchange chromatography, the catalytic fragments were further purified by HPLC on a protein C-4 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 mm, Vydac Hesperia, CA) using a gradient from 18 to 63% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After lyophilization, samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and directly analyzed by MALDI-MS or ESI-MS. The HPLC-purified tryptic catalytic fragment was further digested with 2 mg/ml trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 4 h at 37 °C and analyzed by MALDI-MS. For analysis by ESI-MS, the peptide mixture was purified by using a POROS 50 R2 column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) (25Blackburn, K., and Anderregg, R. (1998) Proceedings of the 46th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Orlando, FL , pp. 219Google Scholar). All MALDI analyses were performed using a Voyager RP time-of-flight spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the linear mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The ESI analysis of the HPLC-purified subtilisin fragment was performed by using a Micromass Platform II (Altrincham, UK) single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The sample was infused into the mass spectrometer at 5 ml/min using a pressure injection vessel (26Tomer K.B. Moseley M.A. Deterding L.J. Parker C.E. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1994; 13: 431-457Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A Micromass Q-Tof (Altrincham, UK) hybrid mass spectrometer, equipped with a quadrupole mass filter and an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer, was used for the analysis of the tryptic peptide mixture of the catalytic fragment after trypsinolysis. Analyses were performed on a 2-μl sample volume using a nanoelectrospray source. Protein phosphatase 5 can be activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and anionic phospholipids in vitro (17Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine how PP5 is activated by lipid, we first asked whether limited proteolysis could generate an active lipid-insensitive form of PP5 by removing a regulatory element. Treatment of PP5 with subtilisin led to a rapid and sustained 12–18-fold increase in activity using 10 μmcasein as substrate (Fig. 1 A ). This activity was comparable to that of full-length PP5 assayed in the presence of a maximally activating concentration of AA, 250 μm. Similar changes in activity were observed regardless of whether PP5 was proteolyzed in the absence or presence of AA (Fig.1 A ). In the absence of AA, subtilisin treatment of full-length 58-kDa PP5 generated a 38-kDa fragment, which was converted over time to a stable 36-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 B ). Activity reached a maximum after digestion for 20 min, which corresponded with the loss of full-length enzyme, and was not further increased by the conversion of the 38-kDa fragment to the 36-kDa fragment (Fig. 1, A andB ). Digestion in the presence of 250 μm AA appeared to generate the same 36- and 38-kDa fragments. In addition, a series of 14–18-kDa fragments appeared that were not observed in digests performed without AA (Fig. 1 C ). The largest of these 14–18-kDa fragments appeared at the earliest time point measured, 5 min. As digestion proceeded these fragments decreased in both size and yield and were no longer observed by 60 min. Endoproteinase Glu-C generated a similar pattern of proteolytic fragments and increase in enzyme activity (data not shown). Tryptic digestion of PP5 caused a 4–8-fold increase in phosphatase activity (Fig. 1 D ) representing 40–50% of the maximal activity of full-length, lipid-stimulated PP5. The increase in activity was observed regardless of whether AA was present or absent during digestion. In the absence of AA, trypsinolysis generated a 39-kDa fragment that was converted over time to a 38-kDa fragment that remained stable up to 2 h, the longest time point measured, and a smaller fragment of 21-kDa that was degraded by 60 min (Fig.1 E ). When proteolysis was performed in the presence of 250 μm AA, these same fragments were generated; however, the 21-kDa fragment was now slowly converted to a series of smaller fragments (Fig. 1 F ). Proteolysis with subtilisin also increased activity toward MBP and histone by 15–20-fold, which was comparable to that of lipid-stimulated, full-length PP5, whereas trypsinolysis resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in activity with these substrates (Fig.2). The increase in phosphatase activity toward histone and MBP was not altered by the addition of AA during proteolysis. However, when AA was included in phosphatase assays, it no longer stimulated the activity of digested enzyme but instead caused a decrease in activity that varied with substrate, being only 10–20% for casein, 20–40% for histone, and up to 90% for MBP (data not shown). To compare their activities accurately, the catalytic fragments of PP5 generated by proteolysis were purified by anion exchange chromatography. Mock digestion or chromatography did not alter the control or lipid-stimulated activity of full-length PP5. In the absence of lipid, the average specific activity of the purified 36-kDa subtilisin-derived fragment toward 10 μm casein was 2170 ± 617 nmol of Pi released per min/mg, which was greater than that of lipid-activated, full-length PP5 (Fig.3). The average specific activity of the 38-kDa trypsin-generated fragment was 462 ± 82 nmol of Pi released per min/mg, 50% the activity of lipid-stimulated, full-length PP5 (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed with phosphorylase a , reduced carboxamidomethylated and maleyated lysozyme, and p NPP (data not shown). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed to determine the identity of proteolytic fragments. The recombinant enzyme contains four residues, Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser, preceding the initial methionine residue of native PP5. The 18–21-kDa fragments generated during trypsinolysis in the absence or presence of AA had identical N termini, Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Met, and thus were all derived from the TPR domain (Table I). Subtilisin generated 14–18-kDa fragments with N termini beginning at Ala4 or Gly6 in the presence of AA, or Glu10 in the absence of AA, indicating that these fragments were also all derived from the TPR domain (Fig. 4 and Table I). Since the TPR domain-derived fragments were more resistant to degradation in the presence of AA than in its absence (Fig. 1,B, C , E, and F ), the effect of lipid on TPR domain degradation was explored further. Protection of the cleaved TPR domain by AA was also observed with other proteases, including endoproteinase Glu-C and chymotrypsin (data not shown). We previously showed that only unsaturated fatty acids with a free carboxyl group can activate PP5 (17Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition to AA, degradation of the TPR domain-derived fragments was reduced by other unsaturated fatty acids that stimulate PP5 (Table II). In contrast, lipid analogs of AA such as arachidonyl alcohol or arachidic acid, which do not stimulate activity, did not protect the TPR domain from rapid degradation. To determine if protection was due to a direct interaction of the TPR domain with lipid, proteolysis of recombinant PP5-(1–159), representing only the TPR domain, was examined. Fig.5 shows that PP5-(1–159) was also digested more slowly in the presence of lipid than in its absence. These results indicate that AA and other lipids that stimulate PP5 activity interact directly with the TPR domain reducing its susceptibility to proteolysis.Table ICharacterization of TPR-containing proteolytic fragmentsProteaseTime digested250 μm AAN terminusProteolytic fragment1-aEstimated from migration of fragments by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.minkDaSubtilisin15+Ala4-Glu-Gly-Glu-Arg-18Gly6-Glu-Arg-Thr-Glu-Subtilisin15−Glu10-Cys-Ala-Glu-Pro-18Subtilisin20+Glu10-Cys-Ala-Glu-Pro-16Trypsin5+/−Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Met1-21Trypsin10−Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Met1-20Trypsin15+Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Met1-20Trypsin60+Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Met1-19Recombinant PP5 was treated with either subtilisin or trypsin, and then samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted, and N-terminal sequence analysis performed.1-a Estimated from migration of fragments by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.

In vitro, the N-terminus of p21 binds and inhibits CDK-cyclin kinase activity, whereas the C-terminus binds and inhibits PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) function. PCNA is essential for processivity of both DNA polymerase delta and epsilon. We have performed a detailed analysis of growth inhibition by the N- and C-terminal regions of p21, and determined whether the N- and C-terminal regions mediate this effect by different mechanisms. Expression of either the N- or the C-terminal region of p21 inhibits DNA synthesis and cell growth, but not as efficiently as full length p21. The effectiveness of the two p21 domains is dependent on their stability which is determined by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The stabilization of the N- and C-terminal region of p21 increases their effectiveness as inhibitors of DNA synthesis to levels comparable to full length p21. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by the N-terminal region of p21 involves suppression of E2F activity. In contrast, inhibition by the C-terminal region of p21 is not accompanied by suppression of E2F activity, but is mediated via PCNA binding. The C-terminal region of p21 therefore inhibits cell growth by a mechanism distinct from that of the N-terminal region containing the CDK-cyclin inhibitory domain."

In this study, we examined this issue in detail by expressing a series of C-terminally deleted PS1 mutants fused to the hydrophilic portion of Escherichia coli leader peptidase in vitro using a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of microsomal membranes. Our results predict that PS1 exists mainly in a seven membrane-spanning structure with its C-terminal end exposed to the luminal space. This was also confirmed by expressing these fusion proteins in cultured cells. We further showed that a ninth hydrophobic segment is tightly bound to the membrane without spanning it.

One of the physiological roles of presenilins has been suggested through genetic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans SEL-12, which codes for a protein highly homologous to mammalian presenilins (11Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), and through analysis of PS1-knockout mice (12Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S.

These studies have suggested that presenilins are involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is known to be involved in many different aspects of the regulation of cell differentiation in C. elegans and higher eukaryotes. Several roles of presenilins in the pathogenesis of FAD have also been suggested. First, in the cerebrospinal fluid of FAD patients or in the medium of cultured cells expressing FAD-linked mutant presenilins, elevation of the level of amyloid β protein consisting of 42 amino acid residues (Aβ42), which is thought to play a key role in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease, especially for senile plaque formation, has been observed (14Borchelt D.R.

This suggests that FAD-associated mutations cause the disease by elevating the production of Aβ42 either intracellularly or extracellularly. Furthermore, analysis of neuronal cell primary cultures derived from PS1 knockout mouse embryos implied that PS1 is required for γ-secretase cleavage of Aβ from amyloid precursor protein (18De Strooper B.

Second, several works have shown that wild-type or mutant presenilins are involved in the regulation of the cellular apoptotic pathway (19Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N.

However, the mechanisms underlying both the physiological and pathogenic functions of presenilins at the molecular level remain to be elucidated. To understand the function(s) of presenilins at the molecular level, conformational information on these proteins in membranes is indispensable. Several previous reports have suggested different models for the membrane topologies of these or related proteins differing in the number of membrane-spanning segments (six to eight), but in all of them the C terminus is exposed to the cytosolic space (23Dewji N.N. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14025-14030Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Podlisny M. Selkoe D.J.

A. 1998; 95: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study, we re-examined this issue using a series of fusion proteins consisting of C-terminally deleted PS1 and a reporter sequence, with special emphasis on the C-terminal half region, where significant discordance still exists. Although two previous studies involved similar strategies (25Lehmann S. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12047-12051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Li X. Greenwald I. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1015-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), in our study special attention was paid when choosing the reporter fragment to be fused because we consider it possible that the relatively hydrophobic nature of the extreme C-terminal region of PS1 would affect the results if the N-terminal portion of the reporter is also hydrophobic. The results we obtained using a series of such fusion proteins confirmed the notion that the N-terminal and the large hydrophobic loop regions of PS1 face the cytosol, as suggested by several previous studies. However, by using a reporter sequence that does not include hydrophobic residues in the vicinity of the N-terminal portion of the reporter region just after the fused point, we unexpectedly observed that a significant fraction of the molecules expressed in vitro or in cultured cells exposed their C-terminal ends to the luminal space on the ER membrane. In addition, we show here that the eighth and ninth hydrophobic segments do not span the membrane and that, despite this, the latter is tightly bound to the lipid bilayer from the cytosolic face. Based on the data presented in this study, we here propose a “seven membrane-spanning and one membrane-embedded” model for the topological structures of presenilins. Possible causes for the discrepancy between our results and the models proposed by several other groups are also discussed. cDNAs for four contiguous parts spanning the whole coding region of human PS1 were amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene) by PCR using four sets of oligonucleotides as primers (Table I). The four PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, then subcloned into appropriate vectors, and finally recombined between theEco RI and Xho I sites of the Bluescript II vector (Stratagene) to reconstitute the whole PS1 coding region. For the most N-terminal region, we subcloned the cDNAs for both of the two known variants in which VRSQ between the 26th and 29th amino acid residues is retained or deleted, respectively. Throughout this study, the VRSQ-deleted variant was used. However, the amino acid residue number of PS1 used in this study is based on that of the VRSQ-containing variant. The 1.4-kilobase pair Eco RI-Xho I fragment containing the whole PS1 coding region was excised and subcloned between the Eco RI-Xho I sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA-PS1.Table IPCR primers used for PS1 subcloningAmino acid residuePrimer1–156SenseGGCGAATTC TCCACC ATGACAGAGTTACCTGCACCG1-aAn Eco RI restriction site (underlined) and a Kozak sequence (boldface) were introduced just before the initiation codon (double underlined).AntisenseCGGATCGATATTTATACAGAACCACCAGG1-bCla I, Sph I, and Bsp EI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced at the junctions on adjoining sites, respectively, without changing the encoded amino acids for convenience for further construction.157–269SenseGGCATCGATGCTATAAGGTCATCCATGCC1-bCla I, Sph I, and Bsp EI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced at the junctions on adjoining sites, respectively, without changing the encoded amino acids for convenience for further construction.AntisenseCAACCAGCATGCGAAGTGGACCTTTCGGACA1-bCla I, Sph I, and Bsp EI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced at the junctions on adjoining sites, respectively, without changing the encoded amino acids for convenience for further construction.270–401SenseCACTTCGCATGCTGGTTGAAACAGCTCA1-bCla I, Sph I, and Bsp EI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced at the junctions on adjoining sites, respectively, without changing the encoded amino acids for convenience for further construction.AntisenseCAGTCTCCGGAGGCTGTTGCTGAGGCTTTAC1-bCla I, Sph I, and Bsp EI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced at the junctions on adjoining sites, respectively, without changing the encoded amino acids for convenience for further construction.402–467SenseCAGCCTCCGGAGACTGGAACACAACCAT1-bCla I, Sph I, and Bsp EI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced at the junctions on adjoining sites, respectively, without changing the encoded amino acids for convenience for further construction.AntisenseCCGCTCGAGCTAGATATAAAATTGATGGA1-cAn Xho I restriction site (underlined) was introduced just after the stop codon.1-a An Eco RI restriction site (underlined) and a Kozak sequence (boldface) were introduced just before the initiation codon (double underlined).1-b Cla I, Sph I, and Bsp EI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced at the junctions on adjoining sites, respectively, without changing the encoded amino acids for convenience for further construction.1-c An Xho I restriction site (underlined) was introduced just after the stop codon.

Takahashi N. Shioda A. Kobayashi T. Nakai T. Miura S. Kouki T. Kikuyama S. Adv. Comp. Endocrinol. 1997; 2: 921-925Google Scholar).

ABam HI site (underlined) was introduced to the N-terminal flanking region, and 6× His tag (boldface) was introduced to the C-terminal end, and Xho I restriction site (lowercase letters) was introduced to the C-terminal flanking region. Amplified PCR fragment digested with Bam HI and Xho I was used for the construction of PS1-GH as in the case of the PS1-LPase fusion construction described above. Anti-LPase polyclonal antibody LP-1 was raised against N-terminally 6× His-tagged LPase spanning amino acids 104–323, which was expressed in E. coli using pET16b (Novagen). Polyclonal antibody LOOP1 against the mouse PS1 loop region (332–371 aa) was raised by injecting a rabbit with glutathione S -transferase fusion protein containing this region expressed in E. coli using pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was used after purification using an Affi-Gel matrix (Bio-Rad) to which a fusion protein consisting of maltose-binding protein and 263–407 aa of human PS1 expressed using pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) was attached. This antibody cross-reacts with the corresponding region of human PS1. For immunoprecipitation, samples were diluted with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA) and then incubated with the antibody for 1 h at room temperature and further for 1 h in the presence of Pansorbin cell, fixedStaphylococcus aureus cells (Calbiochem). After centrifugation, the pellets were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and proteins were extracted with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature. Western blotting was performed after the proteins had been separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected using an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Linearized plasmids were transcribed in vitro from the T7 promoter located upstream of the multicloning site of pcDNA3.1(+) using T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transcribed mRNAs were used for translation in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (31Mori M. Miura S. Tatibana M. Cohen P.P. J. Biochem.

Human placenta tissue was homogenized in PBS(−) (0.2 g/liter KH2PO4, 2.16 g/liter Na2HPO4, 7H2O, 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl) in the presence of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then centrifuged at 1,500 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pelleted membrane fraction was resuspended in 0.1 mNa2CO3 and then incubated on ice for 30 min. One-half of it was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and then the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed, together with the uncentrifuged half, for the presence of C-terminal fragment (CTF) by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. COS-1 and CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose medium and F12 medium, respectively, both of which were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells cultured on 35-mm dishes were washed once with PBS(−) and then preincubated for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose without cysteine and methionine but supplemented with dialyzed 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

After 5 h labeling, the cells were washed three times with PBS(−), and then the proteins were extracted with extraction buffer (PBS(−) supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm antipain, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm chymostatin, and 10 μm pepstatin) and processed for immunoprecipitation. Hydropathy analysis of the predicted primary structure of PS1 revealed 10 distinct hydrophobic regions (HR1 to HR10) that are candidate membrane-spanning segments (Fig. 1 A ). In order to determine which of these regions actually span the membrane, we adopted a deletion strategy based on the assumption that polytopic membrane proteins are inserted into the membrane sequentially from the N terminus without the requirement of a more distal C-terminal region (33Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). According to this assumption, when a series of C-terminally deleted mutants for a polytopic membrane protein is expressed in the presence of ER membrane, localization of the C-terminal end of each deletion mutant should reflect the topology of the corresponding point when the full-length protein is expressed. Thus, when a reporter protein is fused to the C terminus of such a deletion mutant, the localization of the reporter protein according to the membrane should reflect that of the fusion point in the wild-type protein if the reporter region is neutral as to membrane translocation. As a reporter protein, we used the C-terminal hydrophilic region of E. coli leader peptidase (LPase). In E. coli , LPase is expressed as an inner membrane protein, the C-terminal region of which contains an active site located in the periplasmic space (34Moore K.E. Miura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8806-8813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this portion should not interfere with its translocation across the membrane. Moreover, it is known that, when expressed in vitro in a eukaryotic system in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, this protein retains the same topogenic ability as inE. coli , and the C-terminal hydrophilic region localized in the luminal space undergoes N -glycosylation efficiently (35Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter property also enabled us to determine whether or not this portion is localized in the luminal space. For the analysis of PS1 topogenicity, based on the results of hydropathy analysis, a series of C-terminally deleted PS1 mutant cDNAs truncated at the points just prior to the hydrophobic regions (PS1-ΔH1-C to PS1-ΔH10-C , Fig. 1 B ) and just after HR10, the most C-terminal hydrophobic segment (PS1-ΔC), were constructed, and they, together with the whole PS1 coding region (PS1-full ), were fused in frame to the sequence encoding the C-terminal region of LPase corresponding to 104–323 amino acid residues. When choosing a reporter, especially for the construction of a fusion protein with full-length PS1, the hydrophilic property of the N terminus of the reporter fragment is important to prevent fortuitous production of a hydrophobic segment at the junction, because the extreme C-terminal portion of PS1 is relatively rich in hydrophobic residues. The N terminus of the above LPase region is hydrophilic enough to prevent the creation of such hydrophobic segments together with the C terminus of PS1, as judged by hydropathy analysis (data not shown). These fusion constructs were transcribed in vitro , and the synthesized mRNAs were translated in an in vitro translation system using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and in the presence or absence of MS. The translation products were analyzed by fluorography. We assessed the membrane orientation of the reporter portion of each fusion protein expressedin vitro in the presence of MS using two distinct criteria as follows: 1) susceptibility of the reporter portion to proteinase K added via the cytosolic space; and 2) N -linked glycosylation, specific for the luminal space of ER, of the consensus sequence present in the reporter portion. Fig.2 shows a fluorogram of the in vitro translation product for each fusion construct. These data indicate first that, in the presence of MS, translation products with slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility, as compared with those in the absence of the membrane, were predominant for PS1-ΔH2-C-LP, PS1-ΔH4-C-LP, PS1-ΔH6-C-LP, PS1-ΔC-LP, and PS1-full-LP (lanes 1 and 2 for each set in Fig. 2); however, in the cases of PS1-ΔH1-C-LP, PS1-ΔH3-C-LP, PS1-ΔH5-C-LP, PS1-ΔH7-C-LP, PS1-ΔH8-C-LP, PS1-ΔH9-C-LP, and PS1-ΔH10-C-LP (lanes 1 and 2 for each set in Fig. 2), no such mobility shift was observed. These results suggest that, for the former constructs, an N -linked glycosyl chain was attached to the reporter portion as a result of its translocation through the membrane and subsequent exposure to N -glycosyltransferase, whose active site resides in the luminal face of ER. This was confirmed by endoglycosidase H treatment, which is known to removeN -linked glycosyl chains from a polypeptide. Such treatment effectively restored the mobility to the extent that was observed for the translation products in the absence of microsomal membranes for all of the five constructs above (Fig.3).Figure 3The mobility shift is due toN -glycosylation. The in vitro translation products obtained in the presence of MS from the plasmids exhibiting a mobility shift (PS1-ΔH2-C-LP, lanes 1–3 ; PS1-ΔH4-C-LP, lanes 4–6 ; PS1-ΔH6-C-LP, lanes 7–9 ; PS1-ΔC-LP, lanes 10–12 ; PS1-full-LP,lanes 13–15 ) were treated with endoglycosidase H (EndoH+ , lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 ) and then electrophoresed side by side with the products obtained in the absence of MS (ER−, lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, and13 ) and those in the presence of MS without endoglycosidase H treatment (ER+ and EndoH−, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 ).

We have examined the oligomerization of a MutS protein from Thermus aquaticus that binds to heteroduplex DNAs at elevated temperatures. Analytical gel filtration, cross-linking of MutS protein with disuccinimidyl suberate, light scattering, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry establish that the Taq protein is largely a dimer in free solution. Analytical equilibrium sedimentation showed that the oligomerization ofTaq MutS involves a dimer-tetramer equilibrium in which dimer predominates at concentrations below 10 μm. The ΔG 02–4 for the dimer to tetramer transition is approximately −6.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mol of tetramer. Analytical gel filtration of native complexes and gel mobility shift assays of an maltose-binding protein-MutS fusion protein bound to a short, 37-base pair heteroduplex DNA reveal that the protein binds to DNA as a dimer with no change in oligomerization upon DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2067590274,"Amylase release from parotid acinar cells is mainly induced by the accumulation of intracellular cAMP, presumably through the phosphorylation of substrates by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). However, the molecular mechanisms of this process are not clear. In a previous study (Fujita-Yoshigaki, J., Dohke, Y., Hara-Yokoyama, M., Kamata, Y., Kozaki, S., Furuyama, S., and Sugiya, H. (1996) J. Biol.

To study the formation of the solubleN -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex containing VAMP2 in parotid acinar cells, we prepared rabbit polyclonal antibody against the peptide corresponding to Arg47-Asp64 of VAMP2 (anti-SER4256). The recognition site of anti-SER4256 overlaps the domain involved in binding target membrane SNAREs (t-SNARES). Then we examined the condition of VAMP2 by immunoprecipitation with anti-SER4256. VAMP2 was not included in the immunoprecipitate from solubilized granule membrane fraction under the control conditions, but incubation with cytosolic fraction and cAMP caused immunoprecipitation of VAMP2. The effect of cytosolic fraction and cAMP was reduced by addition of PKA inhibitor H89. Addition of both the catalytic subunit of PKA and the cytosolic fraction allowed immunoprecipitation of VAMP2, whereas the PKA catalytic subunit alone did not. These results suggest that (1Quissell D.O. Dobrosielski-Vergona K. Biology of the Salivary Glands.

Dobrosielski-Vergona K. Biology of the Salivary Glands. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 181-200Google Scholar). Although most regulated exocytosis systems are mediated by elevation of intracellular calcium ions, there are some exocytosis systems that are also regulated by intracellular cAMP. For example, glucagon-induced insulin release from pancreatic beta cells and luteinizing-hormone secretion from pituitary cells are mediated by cAMP (2Ämmälä C. Aschcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Nature. 1993; 363: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Macrae M.B. Davidson J.S. Millar R.P. van der Merwe P.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these systems, however, the amount of secretion induced by cAMP alone is less than that induced by calcium. In contrast, amylase secretion from parotid acinar cells is mainly regulated by intracellular cAMP without elevation of calcium. Therefore, this is an appropriate system in which to study the mechanism of cAMP-dependent exocytosis. In calcium-dependent systems, several calcium-binding proteins such as synaptotagmin, syncollin, and calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion, were identified as candidates for the calcium sensor(s) that suppress exocytosis at low concentrations of cytosolic calcium ions and enhance by binding with calcium (4DeBello W.M. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 947-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Elferink L.A. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H.

Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In cAMP-regulated exocytotic systems, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 is thought to play an essential role in the process. During amylase secretion from parotid acinar cells, the activity of PKA was enhanced (1Quissell D.O. Dobrosielski-Vergona K. Biology of the Salivary Glands. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 181-200Google Scholar), and the catalytic subunit of PKA was shown to be sufficient to cause amylase secretion in permeabilized acinar cells (8Takuma T. Ichida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22124-22128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that PKA phosphorylates a protein involved in exocytosis. Several proteins were reported to be phosphorylated upon β-adrenergic stimulation (9Baum B.J. Colpo F.T. Filburn C.R. Arch. Oral Biol. 1981; 26: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Jahn R. Söling H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it is not clear which phosphorylation is crucial for triggering cAMP-dependent exocytosis. We previously reported (12Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Dohke Y. Hara-Yokoyama M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) is localized at the secretory granule membrane of rat parotid acinar cells and that it plays an important role in cAMP-dependent amylase secretion. However, target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs) such as syntaxin1 or SNAP-25 were not detected in rat parotid acinar cells. In adipocytes, VAMP2 is also localized to vesicles that store the glucose transporter GLUT4, and functions cooperatively with syntaxin4 in the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface (13Cain C.C.

Neutrophils and mast cells also express syntaxin4 and VAMP2, and these are possibly involved in the exocytosis of secretory granules (15Brumell J.H. Volchuk A. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. Ciutat A.-M.

The combination of VAMP2 and syntaxin4 is possibly a common pairing in regulated exocytosis and vesicular trafficking outside the neuron. If these SNARE proteins are involved in cAMP-dependent amylase secretion, the formation of the SNARE complex may be regulated by phosphorylation by PKA. SNARE proteins are thought to function in the recognition and docking between vesicles and target membrane by interacting with each other. It has been reported that the interaction of recombinant syntaxin4, and SNAP-23 was modulated by phosphorylation of syntaxin4 by exogenous PKA (23Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, Foster et al. (23Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that VAMP2 binding to syntaxin4 was not affected by PKA phosphorylation of syntaxin4. In this study, we tried to identify the t-SNAREs that interact with VAMP2 in parotid acinar cells and to clarify the regulatory mechanism of VAMP2. To study the condition of VAMP2 in rat parotid acinar cells, we prepared antibodies against VAMP2, and immunoprecipitated VAMP2 using the antibody. Whether VAMP2 is immunoprecipitated or not may depend on the proteins bound to VAMP2. Collagenase and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH. Trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, and control rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose 4FF was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of Ser2-Pro20, Arg47-Asp64of VAMP2 were synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-SER4253 and anti-SER4256 were raised against each conjugated peptide and purified using peptide-coupled affinity columns (Fig.2 A ). Affinity-purified anti-syntaxin4 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Amira Klip (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). Parotid glands were minced and dispersed by trypsin and collagenase. Dispersed acinar cells were homogenized with 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.5. The nuclear fraction was removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The resultant supernatant and pellet were used as the cytosolic and total membrane fractions, respectively. Secretory granules of the rat parotid glands were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (24Dohke Y. Hara-Yokoyama M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Kahn R.A. Kanaho Y. Hashimoto S. Sugiya H. Furuyama S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with some modification. Homogenization was performed with 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5. After centrifugation, the Percoll suspension was fractionated from the bottom into 20 tubes. Secretory granules were recovered in the densest fraction. The specific activity of amylase in the final granule fraction was usually 4.5-fold higher than that in the homogenate. Purified whole granules were suspended in buffer A (1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5) containing leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and antipain (10 μg/ml), homogenized and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was suspended in buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and used as the granule membrane fraction. Total membrane and secretory granule membrane fractions were suspended in solubilizing buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5) containing 4% Triton X-100, and incubated for 45 min. Unsolubilized materials were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min). The supernatants were dialyzed against buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100 overnight. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min, the supernatants were obtained as solubilized membrane fractions. Solubilized total membrane fraction (200 μg) and solubilized granule membrane fraction (6 μg) were suspended in reaction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5) in the absence or presence of cytosolic fraction (50 μg), and/or 0.2 mmcAMP, a catalytic subunit of PKA (6 units), and then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Samples were added to protein A-Sepharose 4FF conjugated with normal rabbit IgG, and were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were recovered and incubated with anti-SER4256 conjugated with protein A-Sepharose 4FF at 4 °C for 2 h. Then protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation and boiled in sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were separated on 12 and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with anti-syntaxin4 (1:1,000) and anti-SER4253 (1:10), respectively. Immunoreactivity was determined by means of the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In our previous study (12Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Dohke Y. Hara-Yokoyama M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), neither syntaxin 1 nor SNAP-25, which interact with VAMP2 in neuronal cells, were detected in rat parotid acinar cells. A candidate for the t-SNARE target of VAMP2 is syntaxin4 because it binds to VAMP2 in vitro (22Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arrarás J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and is reported to interact with VAMP2 in adipocytes (25Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of syntaxin4 in parotid acinar cells, cytosolic and total membrane fractions of rat parotid acinar cells were prepared by centrifugation. Similar fractions were prepared from skeletal muscle to serve as positive controls for immunoblotting (22Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arrarás J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis of these samples showed that 35-kDa protein, which reacts with anti-syntaxin4 antibody, is detected in pellets of both parotid acinar cells and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 A ). Next, the intracellular localization was analyzed. Cytosol, total membrane, and granule membrane fractions from parotid acinar cells were prepared and used for Western blotting analysis. Syntaxin 4 was detected in the total membrane fraction, but not in the granule membrane fractions where the majority of the VAMP2 was detected (Fig. 1 B ). The difference in localization suggests that syntaxin4 and VAMP2 function as classical t-SNAREs and vesicle SNAREs, respectively, in rat parotid acinar cells. This is consistent with the previously reported result that botulinum neurotoxin C1 did not inhibit cAMP-dependent amylase secretion (12Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Dohke Y. Hara-Yokoyama M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), because syntaxin4 does not have a cleavage site for botulinum neurotoxin C1. The total membrane fractions were solubilized with Triton X-100, and the extracts were used for immunoprecipitation using anti-SER4256. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-SER4253. VAMP2 was not detected in the precipitates from untreated extracts (Fig.2 B , lane 1 ). Because VAMP2 was present in the solubilized total membrane fraction, it seems likely that the epitope was masked by another protein bound to VAMP2. We attempted to find conditions under which VAMP2 could be made accessible to the antibody. After incubation with the cytosolic fraction, a small amount of VAMP2 was precipitated (Fig. 2 B ,lane 2 ). Addition of 0.2 mm cAMP increased the amount of precipitated VAMP2 (Fig. 2 B , lane 4 ), whereas cAMP alone had no effect (Fig. 2 B , lane 3 ). Because PKA is present in the cytosolic fraction, the effect of cAMP is probably to activate PKA. This result suggests that VAMP2 is masked by some other proteins that dissociate upon the activation of PKA. We performed immunoprecipitation from Triton X-100-solubilized granule membrane fractions. Again, VAMP2 was not immunoprecipitated from the extract (Fig.3 A , lane 1 ). Therefore, syntaxin4 is probably not the protein that binds to VAMP2 to inhibit the access of antibody, because syntaxin4 was not detected in the granule membrane fraction. In the same way as the solubilized total membrane fraction, the addition of cytosol allowed a small amount of immunoprecipitation of VAMP2 from the solubilized granule membrane fraction (Fig. 3 A , lane 2 ), and this was enhanced by cAMP (Fig. 3 A , lane 4 ). PKA inhibitor H89 decreased the amount of VAMP2 in the precipitate, supporting the hypothesis that the effect of cAMP and the cytosolic fraction is due to the activation of PKA (Fig. 3 A , lane 5 ). H85, which does not have inhibitory activity for PKA, did not affect the precipitation (Fig. 3 A , lane 6 ). High concentrations of cytosolic calcium ion also induce a small amount of amylase secretion, although cAMP is the main regulator of amylase exocytosis (26Yoshimura K. Nezu E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of cAMP and calcium on immunoprecipitation. Reactions 1–3 contained 1 mm EGTA, eliminating free calcium ions, whereas the concentration of calcium ion in reactions 4 and 5 is buffered at 10 μm. Calcium ion neither allowed VAMP2 precipitation itself (Fig. 3 B , lane 4 ), nor enhanced the effect of cAMP (Fig. 3 B , lane 5 ). This is consistent with our previous finding that VAMP2 is involved in cAMP-dependent, but not in calcium-dependent amylase secretion (12Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Dohke Y. Hara-Yokoyama M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If the effect of cytosolic fraction and cAMP is due to the activation of PKA, exogenous PKA should also induce the precipitation. We used purified catalytic subunit of PKA in the experiment. Although all reactions contained 2 mm ATP and 10 mm Mg2+, amounts that are sufficient for phosphorylation, PKA subunit alone did not induce the precipitation of VAMP2 (Fig.4A, lane 4 ). In contrast, incubation with both cytosolic fraction and PKA subunit efficiently induced precipitation similar in extent to cytosolic fraction and cAMP (Fig. 4 A , lanes 3 and 5 ). It was confirmed that the effect of cytosolic fraction and cAMP is at least partly due to the activity of PKA. Because addition of cytosolic fraction was necessary, a cytosolic factor other than PKA is also necessary for this reaction. To determine whether this cytosolic factor is a protein or not, we treated cytosolic fraction with trypsin. Treatment with trypsin significantly decreased the ability of cytosol to allow immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 B , lane 3 ). Cytosolic fraction protected by trypsin inhibitor before incubation with trypsin retained the activity (Fig. 4 B , lane 4 ). Therefore, the activity is attributable to some protein. Another issue is the substrate of PKA. To determine whether the substrate is cytosolic factor(s) or granular membrane protein(s), we performed the phosphorylation reaction separately and mixed cytosolic and solubilized granule membrane fractions. After incubation of the cytosolic fraction with PKA at 30 °C for 10 min, H89 (final concentration, 10 μm) and the solubilized granule membrane fraction were added to the mixture and incubated at 30 °C for an additional 10 min. VAMP2 was precipitated under these conditions as efficiently (Fig. 4 B , lane 5 ) as seen with the cytosolic and solubilized granule membrane fractions incubated with PKA in the same reaction (Fig. 4 B , lane 2 ). Next, the solubilized granule membrane fraction was incubated with PKA at 30 °C for 10 min, following which H89 and the cytosolic fraction were added and incubated for an additional 10 min. In this case, the efficiency of precipitation was decreased (Fig. 4 B ,lane 6 ). Therefore, phosphorylation of some protein in the cytosolic fraction, but not in the granule membrane fraction, is sufficient for the immunoprecipitation of VAMP2. However, the immunoprecipitation occurring due to the phosphorylation of the solubilized granule membrane fraction is not negligible (Fig.4 B , lane 6 ). This result may indicate that the inhibitory activity of H89 was incomplete. H89 did not completely inhibit the immunoprecipitation caused by incubation with cytosolic and solubilized granule membrane fractions and cAMP either (Fig.3 A , lane 5 ). Another possible explanation is that a small amount of the protein phosphorylated by PKA is also present in the granule membrane fraction. In that case, another cytosol-specific protein would also be required because incubation of the solubilized granule membrane and catalytic subunit of PKA without the cytosolic fraction induced no immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 A , lane 4 ). We demonstrated here that the putative t-SNARE binding region of VAMP2 is exposed in a cAMP-dependent manner, which causes immunoprecipitation of VAMP2 with antibody that binds to Arg47-Asp64 of VAMP2 (anti-SER4256). The ability of anti-SER4256 to immunoprecipitate VAMP2 probably reflects the state of VAMP2 and its binding protein in the solubilized granule membrane fractions. When anti-SER4256 cannot immunoprecipitate VAMP2, it suggests that the epitope on VAMP2 is masked by some unidentified protein(s). Disruption of this binding allows VAMP2 to be immunoprecipitated. The epitope of the antibody is included within the region that is necessary for binding to t-SNAREs (27Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Therefore, through the exposure of this region, VAMP2 gains the ability to interact with t-SNAREs. In our previous study, we have shown that VAMP2 plays an essential role in cAMP-dependent amylase secretion (12Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Dohke Y. Hara-Yokoyama M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13130-13134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clarified how cAMP regulates the function of VAMP2. The main function of cAMP is thought to be to activate PKA, but it is unknown what protein mediates between the activation of PKA and exocytosis. The exposure of the t-SNARE binding region of VAMP2 also took place through the activation of PKA. This is the first report of a biochemical function of PKA in cAMP-mediated exocytosis. A postulated model of this regulatory mechanism is shown in Fig.5. VAMP2 is possibly masked by some protein X under the control conditions. Upon stimulation, activated PKA phosphorylates some cytosolic protein Y , which subsequently removes X from VAMP2 directly or indirectly. Consequently, VAMP2 interacts with t-SNAREs. Although the t-SNARE proteins involved in amylase secretion have not been identified, syntaxin4 and SNAP-23 are promising candidates because of their VAMP2 binding activity (22Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arrarás J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 28Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The disassembly of the complex containing VAMP2 is probably the first step of cAMP-dependent exocytosis of amylase. What proteins are X and Y ? One candidate forX is t-SNARE. However, X is distinct from syntaxin4, because syntaxin4 is not present in the granule membrane fractions. If X is t-SNARE, the removal of X from VAMP2 probably implies the disassembly of pre-existing SNARE complex on the granule membrane, which corresponds to the priming step of the exocytotic process. In this case, a candidate for the cytosolic factorY is α soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (α-SNAP). α-SNAP was reported to be phosphorylated by PKA, and its binding affinity to the SNARE complex was reduced by the phosphorylation (29Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11945-11949Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The meaning of the reduced binding affinity is not clear. However, the possibility was proposed that dissociation of α-SNAP is necessary for efficient disassembly of the SNARE complex (29Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11945-11949Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). If this is the case, α-SNAP phosphorylation by PKA promotes the disassembly of the pre-existing SNARE complex. There is another possibility that X is not t-SNARE, but some inhibitor of secretion. In this case, the cytosolic factor Y removes X from VAMP2 to promote the exocytotic process, just as Rab-like small GTP-binding protein displaces a member of the Sec1 protein family from t-SNARE to initiate SNARE complex formation in yeast (30Lupashin V.V. Waters M.G. Nature. 1997; 276: 1255-1258Google Scholar). In either case, cAMP-dependent dissociation of X from VAMP2 induces the formation of the SNARE complex that is necessary for exocytosis. In parotid acinar cells, cAMP is a main inducer of exocytosis. Cytosolic free calcium, which alone causes only a small amount of amylase release, significantly augments cAMP-dependent secretion (26Yoshimura K. Nezu E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Baldys-Waglegorska A. Pour A. Moriarty C.M. Dowd F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 929: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predicted that the exocytotic process in amylase secretion can be separated into cAMP-dependent docking and sequential calcium-enhanced fusion steps (32Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In chromaffin and neuronal cells, most vesicles are already docked to the target membrane and await only calcium ions to trigger the calcium sensor and allow membrane fusion (33Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar, 34Banerjee A. Barry V.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast, it seems that the exocytotic process of amylase secretion is arrested before docking and that cAMP triggers the docking step. In this study, we found that the exposure of the t-SNARE binding region of VAMP2 occurred upon stimulation by cAMP but not by calcium elevation. These results support our hypothesis that the docking step of amylase secretion is initiated in a cAMP-dependent manner by activation of VAMP2. This regulatory mechanism is expected to be common to cAMP-dependent exocytotic systems. We thank Dr. Amira Klip and Leonard Foster for the anti-syntaxin4 antibody and for helpful comments on the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2320035433,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia is typically characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) in which 5' portions of the BCR gene are fused to a large portion of the ABL gene. Our studies and those of others indicate that Bcr sequences within the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein are critically involved in activating the Abl tyrosine kinase and actively participate in the oncogenic response, which is generated by the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. We investigated the role of the Bcr protein in the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl. Reduction of the level of the Bcr protein by incubating cells with a 3' BCR anti-sense oligodeoxynucleotide increased the growth rate and survival of hematopoietic cell lines expressing Bcr-Abl. Also, enforced expression of Bcr in Bcr-Abl cell lines strongly reduced transformation efficiency. Induction of Bcr expression drastically reduced the phosphotyrosine content of Bcr-Abl in Rat-1 fibroblasts transformed by P185 BCR-ABL and in hematopoietic cells expressing P210 Bcr-Abl within days following induction of Bcr. Rat-1/P185 cells maintained for three weeks after Bcr induction had dramatically reduced amounts of phosphotyrosine proteins compared to cells in which Bcr expression was repressed by the addition of Tet. In contrast Bcr expression did not decrease the phosphotyrosine content of either v-Src or activated Neu tyrosine kinase. Importantly, the phosphotyrosine content of total P160 BCR (induced plus endogenous) was strongly reduced by inducing expression of Bcr, indicating that the induced Bcr protein was not a target of the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl but instead functioned as an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl. These results show that the Bcr protein can function as a negative regulator of Bcr-Abl, but that the inhibitory effects of Bcr are dependent on achieving an elevated level of Bcr expression relative to Bcr-Abl."
https://openalex.org/W2333749150,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) stabilizes the cellular genome. Mice defective in the MMR gene PMS2 are susceptible to spontaneous thymic lymphoma and sarcomas. To determine the sensitivity of PMS2 knockout mice to environmental carcinogens and the protective effect of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), heterozygous PMS2 knockout mice and human MGMT (hMGMT) transgenic mice were mated and the PMS2-/- and PMS2+/+ with or without hMGMT offspring were treated at 5 weeks of age with 50 mg/kg N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). MNU produces carcinogenic O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) adducts, resulting in thymic lymphoma in mice, which can be prevented in normal mice by overexpression of hMGMT. A significantly higher incidence of thymic lymphomas was observed in MNU-treated PMS2-/- mice, compared to wildtype PMS2+/+ mice (100 vs 52%; P < 0.001). The mean latency of lymphomas was also significantly shortened in PMS2-/- mice (81 vs 102 days, P < 0.01). Transgenic expression of hMGMT significantly but incompletely blocked MNU lymphomagenesis in PMS2-/- mice. The incidence of lymphomas in PMS2-/-/hMGMT+ mice was reduced to 80% (P < 0.01) and mean latency increased to 91 days (P < 0.05). Thymic lymphomagenesis was efficiently blocked in PMS2+/+/hMGMT+ mice with rapid repair of O6-meG. Since O6-meG:T mismatches in MMR+ cells may trigger mismatch repair resulting in abortive repair and cell death whereas in the absence of MMR, these mismatches are converted to A:T, we predicted that G to A point mutations in codon 12 of the K-ras gene would occur. In this study, we found G to A point mutations in codon 12 of the K-ras gene in many tumors. Thus, in MMR deficient tissues, methylating agents induce point mutations in cells with a higher rate of cell survival which together are potently carcinogenic in the thymus. These data suggest that PMS2 defective lymphomas may arise by the concerted action of environmental and perhaps endogenous methylation of DNA coupled to genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2323120019,"We initiated a transgenic model for primary pulmonary neuroendocrine cell (PNEC) hyperplasia/neoplasia using v-Ha-ras driven by the neural/neuroendocrine (NE)-specific calcitonin promoter (rascal). Previously, we showed that nitrosamine treated rodents develop PNEC hyperplasia but non-NE lung tumors, with variable outcomes presumably reflecting ras activation in multiple cell lineages. Interestingly, all rascal transgenic mouse lineages develop hyperplasias of NE and non-NE cells but mostly non-NE lung carcinomas, with rascal mRNA in differentiated PNECs and tumor cells. Analyses of embryonic lung demonstrate rascal mRNA in undifferentiated epithelium, consistent with expression in a common pluripotent precursor cell. These unexpected observations indicate that v-Ha-ras can lead to both NE and non-NE hyperplasia/neoplasia in vivo, opening new avenues for studies of lung carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2322829624,"Previous work by us and others has implicated a role for Ral guanine exchange factors (RalGEFs) in Ras-induced cell growth and oncogenic transformation. Here we show for the first time that RalGEFs are involved in Ras-induced differentiation as well. Expression of oncogenic Ras in F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells is known to induce differentiation to a primitive endoderm (PrE)-like phenotype, but the downstream signal transduction mechanisms involved are unclear. We found that PrE differentiation is induced by the Ras effector domain mutants, RasV12G37 and RasV12E38, but not by RasV12C40. Accordingly, expression of constitutively active forms of RalGEF (Rlf-CAAX) or Rafl (Raf-CAAX) is sufficient to induce differentiation. Inhibition of RalGEF activity by expression of dominant negative Ral completely abolishes Rlf-CAAX- and RasV12G37-induced differentiation, while it reduces differentiation by RasV12 and Raf-CAAX. Finally, while Rlf-CAAX does not increase Erk activity, inhibition of MEK blocks both Ras- as well as Rlf-CAAX-induced differentiation, suggesting that RalGEFs induce PrE differentiation in a manner depending on basal MEK or Erk activity. Based on these results we conclude that Ras induces PrE differentiation of F9 EC cells via an interplay of Erk-and RalGEF-mediated pathways."

Optimal T cell activation is achieved by the delivery of two signals: one mediated via the TCR upon binding of the antigen-major histocompatibility complex presented by antigen-presenting cells, and the other is delivered through costimulatory receptors (1Weiss A.

Subsequent to TCR engagement, long lasting TCR down-regulation has been observed (4Viola A. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1996; 273: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), resulting in a state of sustained desensitization and unresponsiveness to renewed antigenic stimuli (5Dubois P.M. Andris F.

Interestingly, it was recently shown that distinct modes of T cell activation have a differential effect on the fate of cell surface expressed TCRs: whereas TCR ligation induces rapid TCR internalization and degradation (7Valitutti S.

Christensen M.D. Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 260-267PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that activation-induced TCR down-regulation may trigger the termination of an immune response and/or induce tolerance (10Schonrich G. Kalinke U. Momburg F. Malissen M.

Eventually, the TCRs are re-expressed on the cell surface and the cells regain their responsiveness to antigenic stimuli. Accordingly, the mechanisms controlling the down-regulation of the various TCR subunits, their synthesis, assembly, and re-expression on the cell surface appear to play a critical role in T cell function. Several key factors govern the assembly and transport of multisubunit receptors to the cell surface. The molecular chaperons calnexin and calreticulin have been implicated in facilitating TCR assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (11Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Although all TCR subunits are required for the formation of the complex, the ζ chain has a distinctive role in TCR assembly and cell surface transport: it was demonstrated that the assembly proceeds according to a certain order, in which the last component to join the complex is the disulfide-linked ζ-ζ homodimer (16Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that in T cell hybridomas ζ chain is synthesized in restricted amounts compared with the reminder TCR chains (16Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 17Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Moreover, in ζ-deficient T cell hybridomas, partial TCR complexes devoid of the ζ chain were primarily targeted to lysosomal degradation. The few ζ-deficient TCRs (∼5%) that reached the cell surface were non-functional (17Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in T cells isolated from ζ-deficient mice (18Ohno H. Aoe T. Taki S. Kitamura D.

Immunol. 1997; 9: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ζ is the limiting chain for optimal receptor assembly and that it is critical to TCR cell surface expression. In the study presented here, we address the question of how T cell activation affects ζ expression and consequently, TCR expression. Our investigation was based on our previous observations (21Wang L. Bronstein N. Hsu V. Baniyash M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the activity of the ζ gene 5′-flanking region is transcriptionally up-regulated following T cell stimulation. We now describe the effect of T cell activation on endogenous ζ chain expression and how the latter affects the entire TCR complex. Our results show that ζ chain expression, as opposed to that of the other TCR subunits, is tightly and uniquely controlled at several checkpoints. Following T cell activation, ζ protein levels are modified in a biphasic pattern as reflected by an initial rapid degradation, which is followed by a transcriptionally dependent recovery. Finally, we demonstrate that even though adequate levels of ζ chain and the other TCR subunits are expressed within the cell following 24 h of activation, virtually no TCRs appear on the T cell surface. These results indicate that there is yet another checkpoint which controls TCR assembly and/or transport to the cell surface following activation. Taken together, our observations show that following T cell activation, TCR expression is tightly controlled as reflected by its rapid down-modulation and slow re-expression. The unique characteristics of ζ chain expression detected during these processes highlight the key role played by ζ in this cascade of events.

Kruisbeek A.M. Baniyash M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 166-171PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning densitometry was performed using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer and Molecular Analyst software. Splenocytes (200 × 106/ml) were lysed as described previously with either Tris (26Caplan S. Zeliger S. Wang L. Baniyash M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4768-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or MES (27Caplan S. Baniyash M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20705-20712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) buffers containing 0.5% Triton X-100, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell pellets were lysed for 15 min on ice with gentle mixing and centrifuged (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were separated and designated the detergent-soluble fractions while the pellet was designated the detergent-insoluble fraction. The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3ε antibodies and samples were subjected to 13% SDS-PAGE or to two-dimensional non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE as described previously (26Caplan S. Zeliger S. Wang L. Baniyash M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4768-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were incubated with the desired specific antibody, washed, and incubated with protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The specific proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham). For labeling of cell surface-expressed proteins, cells (10 × 106/ml) were subjected to biotinylation in a buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm Nacl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 50 μg/mld-biotynil-ε-amidocaproicacid-N -hydroxysuccinimide ester (biotin-ester) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), for 50 min at 25 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mm ammonium chloride and washes with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. We previously showed that the ζ gene 5′-flanking region is responsive to PMA stimulation (21Wang L. Bronstein N. Hsu V. Baniyash M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether the endogenous ζ gene is also affected by PMA stimulation, we measured ζ mRNA levels in EL-4 cells stimulated with PMA. As shown in Fig.1 A , ζ mRNA levels were up-regulated early after PMA treatment and remained high during 18 h of continuous stimulation. mRNA levels of CD3δ (Fig.1 A ), were relatively unaffected by this treatment. Although cultured EL-4 cells are frequently used as a model for various T cell activation studies, they differ significantly from normal T lymphocytes in their functional characteristics. Therefore, we used an experimental system that more faithfully mimics physiological conditions, namely a whole splenocyte population to which anti-CD3 antibodies were added as stimulators. The anti-CD3 antibodies were “presented” by splenic antigen-presenting cells bearing Fcγ receptors, allowing cell-cell interactions and T cell activation mediated via the TCR and costimulatory molecules. As shown in Fig. 1 B , upon TCR-mediated activation, ζ mRNA was up-regulated in normal T cells similarly to what was observed in EL-4 cells (Fig.1 A ). Maximum levels of up-regulated ζ mRNA were generally 2–3-fold higher than in untreated cells. Unlike ζ mRNA, which remained highly up-regulated up to 19–24 h following stimulation, CD3δ mRNA was relatively unchanged under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that TCR-mediated mRNA up-regulation is not characteristic of all T cell receptor genes. To determine at which level activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation is controlled, we designed experiments using the transcriptional inhibitor Act-D and/or the translational inhibitor CHX. The inhibitors were added to the cells 12 h after their activation with anti-CD3 antibodies. Cells were harvested at different time intervals after the addition of the inhibitors and ζ mRNA was analyzed. In cells treated with CHX, ζ mRNA levels were superinduced, as compared with those in non-treated activated cells (Fig.2, A and B ), indicating that a short-lived protein controls ζ mRNA levels, either transcriptionally (repressor) or post-transcriptionally (RNase). When activated cells were treated with Act-D, ζ mRNA levels rapidly dropped to the level measured in non-activated cells (Fig. 2,A and B ). The addition of CHX to activated cells together with Act-D neither prevented a reduction in ζ mRNA nor significantly stabilized ζ mRNA levels, as compared with the results obtained with Act-D alone (Fig. 2, A andB ). These findings indicate that activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation is mainly controlled at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, treatment of resting cells with CHX and Act-D (Fig. 2 B, inset ) demonstrated that ζ mRNA steady-state levels are controlled at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, suggesting that steady-state ζ expression and activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation are controlled by distinct mechanisms. The results of the experiments presented here are in accord with our previous studies (21Wang L. Bronstein N. Hsu V. Baniyash M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the activity of the ζ gene 5′-flanking region is up-regulated following T cell stimulation. Our findings strongly indicate that activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation is transcriptionally controlled. After finding that activation of normal T cells induces ζ mRNA up-regulation, we analyzed the effect of T cell activation on ζ protein expression. As shown in Fig.3 A , the ζ chain undergoes rapid degradation in activated T cells: between 1 and 4 h following stimulation 50% of the ζ protein was degraded. ζ Protein levels remain low during at least 17–19 h of continuous stimulation (Fig. 3 B ). Only after 21–24 h of activation did the ζ protein levels return to the basal level. Similar results were obtained for CD3 δ, albeit the recovery rate was slower. Immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the CD3γ and CD3ε chains revealed a pattern essentially similar to the one obtained for the δ chain (data not shown). These findings indicate that the rapid degradation observed following T cell stimulation is a property common to all the TCR subunits. However, the recovery rate of ζ and δ differs in that the latter does not attain the level of untreated cells even after 21–24 h of stimulation. These results provide further evidence that in contrast to the CD3 γ, δ, and ε subunits, ζ protein levels are differentially regulated. We have previously identified two TCR populations expressed on the T cell surface, one of which is linked to the actin-based cytoskeleton via the ζ chain and localized to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton-enriched fraction (Refs. 26Caplan S. Zeliger S. Wang L. Baniyash M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4768-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 27Caplan S. Baniyash M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20705-20712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref.28Caplan S. Baniyash M. Immunol. Res. 1995; 14: 98-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The latter population includes 20–40% of the receptors. Furthermore, we (27Caplan S. Baniyash M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20705-20712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and others (29Rozdzial M.M. Malissen B. Finkel T.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 623-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that upon T cell activation (within 2–15 min), 30–50% of the detergent-soluble ζ chains translocate to the cytoskeletal fraction and become detergent-insoluble. Thus, it was necessary to determine whether the reduced ζ protein levels observed following activation in the detergent-soluble fraction are due solely to degradation, or also involve massive translocation to the cytoskeleton. We found that the activation-dependent ζ protein degradation also occurs in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 3 C ) with kinetics closely resembling those of the soluble fraction (Fig. 3, A and B ). We demonstrated that upon T cell activation, ζ chain is rapidly degraded and its recovery to normal levels occurs 21–24 h after continuous stimulation (Fig. 3). In parallel, upon activation and prior to the recovery of the ζ protein, ζ mRNA was up-regulated (Fig.1 B ). This sequence of events, graphically depicted in Fig.4 A , led to the supposition that ζ protein recovery depends on ζ mRNA up-regulation. To test this hypothesis, we used CsA to block activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation. The rationale for using CsA was based on our computer analysis of the ζ gene 5′-flanking sequence, that allowed us to localize a putative NF-AT responsive element (21Wang L. Bronstein N. Hsu V. Baniyash M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is well established that CsA exerts its inhibitory effect on the activation-dependent gene transcription of several cytokine and cell surface receptors, primarily by repressing the function of the transcription factor NF-AT (30Ho S. Clipstone N. Timmermann L. Northrop J. Graef I. Fiorentino D. Nourse J. Crabtree G.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: S40-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 31Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that CsA could inhibit activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation. To this end, we activated normal splenocytes in the presence or absence of CsA and analyzed ζ mRNA expression. As depicted in Fig. 4 B , ζ mRNA was up-regulated in splenocytes following TCR-mediated activation. This response was largely impaired in the presence of CsA. The incomplete abrogation of activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation by CsA was most likely due to the basal activation levels of the splenocytes used in the experiment: NF-AT has already been translocated to the nucleus. CD3δ expression was relatively unaffected under these experimental conditions. These results imply that the NF-AT transcription factor is directly or indirectly involved in T cell activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation. Furthermore, these observations are in accord with our results (Fig. 2) indicating that activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level. Based on the above findings, we next analyzed whether ζ mRNA up-regulation is required for the recovery of ζ protein expression to the normal level. To test this hypothesis, splenocytes were activated in the presence or absence of CsA and the levels of ζ protein were analyzed. Fig. 4 C shows that CsA also impaired full recovery of ζ protein to normal levels after activation-induced degradation. Therefore, blockage of ζ mRNA up-regulation by CsA also prevents ζ protein recovery to normal levels. Hence, activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation appears to be required for assuring ζ protein recovery. However, the involvement of additional CsA-sensitive factors in ζ protein recovery, other than ζ mRNA, cannot be ruled out. Following 24 h of activation, ζ protein levels return to normal and significant amounts of δ protein (Fig. 3 B ) and of the other TCR components (data not shown), are present as assessed by Western blot analysis. We next examined whether the newly synthesized TCR subunits are assembled and re-expressed on the cell surface. For this purpose, we activated the cells for 24 h and then labeled cell surface expressed proteins by biotinylation. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3 antibodies, and the co-immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by two-dimensional (non-reducing/reducing) SDS-PAGE, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.5 A (left panels ) shows a typical experiment where the CD3 and α/β TCR subunits are readily biotin-labeled whereas the ζ chain is poorly detected. Unlike the CD3 and α/β subunits, which comprise large extracellular domains containing 4–9 lysine residues (the major target sites for biotinylation), the ζ chain has an extracellular domain of nine amino acids with only one lysine residue. Therefore, ζ is less efficiently biotinylated than the other TCR subunits. The presence of the ζ protein in the co-immunoprecipitated complex was verified by immunoblotting with anti-ζ antibodies (Fig. 5 A ,inset ). Cells activated for 6 h, expressed virtually no cell surface TCR, correlating with very low levels of ζ protein at this time (Fig. 5 A, inset, and Fig. 3 A ). Following 24 h of activation, cell surface levels of TCR remained very low, even though the levels of ζ protein and the remaining TCR subunits were comparable to those of the control (Fig. 5 A, inset, and Fig. 3 B ). Similar results were obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using anti-TCR α/β antibodies (data not shown). Correlative with the failure of cell surface TCR re-expression following activation, we detected a previously undescribed monomeric form of the ζ chain (Fig. 5 B ), which migrated as a 16-kDa band. This was localized on the diagonal following separation on two-dimensional non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE. The identity of the 16-kDa monomer as the ζ chain was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, using both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-ζ antibodies directed against different ζ peptides. The ζ monomer was apparent about 7 h following activation (data not shown) and peaked at around 24 h. Interestingly, the ζ monomeric form could not be immunoprecipitated by anti-CD3 antibodies, as opposed to the ζ-ζ homodimer (Fig. 5 A ), indicating that only the latter can assemble with the other TCR subunits to form an intact complex. In the present study, we focused on the characterization of the regulatory mechanisms controlling TCR ζ chain expression during activation of normal T cells, and assessed how the latter affects the expression of the entire TCR complex. We found that following T cell activation ζ mRNA is significantly up-regulated, while the CD3 δ, γ, and ε mRNA levels are relatively unchanged, indicating that ζ expression is differentially regulated. Interestingly, the TCRα and TCRβ mRNA were reported to be down-regulated under similar conditions (32Paillard P. Sterkers G. Vaquero C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), again emphasizing the unique regulation of the ζ chain. Our results indicate that activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation is transcriptionally controlled. This conclusion is supported by three findings: 1) up-regulation of the activity of the ζ gene 5′-flanking region following T cell stimulation, as demonstrated in our previous study (21Wang L. Bronstein N. Hsu V. Baniyash M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 2) Activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation is transcriptionally controlled, as indicated in our present experiments with Act-D and CHX, and 3) blockage of ζ mRNA up-regulation by CsA treatment. Run-on analysis did not lead to conclusive results (data not shown), due to the limited sensitivity of this assay to detect a 2–3-fold increase in activation-induced ζ gene transcription. Cumulatively, our results strongly indicate that activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation is controlled mainly at the transcriptional level. The finding that activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation is blocked by CsA enables us to add the ζ gene to the expanding list of genes that serve as targets for this immunosuppressive drug. It is well established that CsA impairs the function of the phosphatase calcineurin, which is required for inducing the translocation of NF-AT from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting NF-AT transcriptional activity (30Ho S. Clipstone N. Timmermann L. Northrop J. Graef I. Fiorentino D. Nourse J. Crabtree G.R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 80: S40-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 31Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Thus, CsA, through its effect on NF-AT, exerts its inhibitory activity on various genes critical to the immune response. These include genes encoding for a number of cytokines and the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (31Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Our data provide the first evidence that CsA also impairs the up-regulation of a member of the TCR complex. Although an indirect effect of CsA on ζ mRNA up-regulation cannot be ruled out, its specific inhibitory effect on activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation, together with our previous observation that the ζ gene 5′-flanking region contains a putative NF-AT-binding site (21Wang L. Bronstein N. Hsu V. Baniyash M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that NF-AT is involved in controlling activation-dependent ζ mRNA up-regulation at the transcriptional level. The finding that CD3δ expression was not modified by CsA treatment is in accord with previously published studies, showing that δ expression is mainly controlled at the post-transcriptional level and that no NF-AT-binding sites were identified in the CD3δ enhancer (33Wilkinson M.F. Georgopoulos K. Terhorst C. MacLeod C.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 2355-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 34Georgopoulos K. van den Elsen P. Bier E. Maxam A. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2401-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Leiden M.J. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our present results highlight the complexity of the mechanisms regulating ζ expression. While CsA blocked activation-induced ζ mRNA up-regulation, treatment of activated cells with CHX induced ζ mRNA superinduction. This effect may be due to the elimination of a short-lived repressor(s) present during ζ up-regulation. We have previously identified three functional regions localized upstream of the murine ζ gene: a basic promoter, an activator region, and a region displaying negative regulatory properties (21Wang L. Bronstein N. Hsu V. Baniyash M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The latter is a plausible candidate for binding the putative repressor, whose exact function remains to be elucidated. We next assessed the effect of ζ mRNA up-regulation on ζ protein levels. To this end, we followed the fate of ζ protein expression at different time points after T cell activation. Surprisingly, a biphasic pattern of ζ expression was observed, beginning with rapid degradation and followed by recovery to basal levels. These results were obtained upon analysis of both the detergent-soluble and -insoluble receptors. Whether the ζ chain in each of the fractions is independently degraded or whether the detergent-soluble ζ chain is targeted to the cytoskeletal compartment for subsequent degradation, remains to be further investigated. The rapid degradation of the TCR components measured following short-term activation tallies with previously published studies (7Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 8D'Oro U. Vacchio M.S. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Immunity. 1997; 7: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Lauritsen J.P.H. Christensen M.D. Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 260-267PubMed Google Scholar), showing that T cell activation (up to 3 h) leads to the down-regulation and lysosomal degradation of the TCR subunits. We have extended their findings and followed the fate of ζ expression up to 24 h after activation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence demonstrating that ζ protein levels return to normal only after 21–24 h of continuous stimulation. Earlier in this “Discussion,” we indicated that ζ and CD3δ are differentially controlled. This is also supported by the distinct recovery rates observed for CD3δ and ζ. Although CD3δ is also degraded following activation, it fails to return to normal levels within 21–24 h of continuous stimulation. Thus, ζ appears to be the first TCR chain to fully recover following activation. The consensus that ζ chain is the limiting factor for receptor formation, and the finding that the remainder of the TCR chains show partial recovery following 24 h activation, led us to question whether at this stage, the newly synthesized TCR chains could be assembled to form an intact complex and be transported to the cell surface. Our analysis revealed that levels of cell surface-expressed TCR were very low following 24 h of activation and remain low for up to 3 days provided the activating antibody is continuously present (Fig. 5 and data not shown). This is in agreement with previous studies (4Viola A. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1996; 273: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) showing that activation-induced TCR down-regulation is a long-lasting phenomenon (at least 48 h). Thus, we found that although the levels of ζ and the other TCR subunits measured after 24 h of activation were relatively high, the receptor was not expressed on the cell surface. This indicates that re-expression of the TCR following activation is restricted by a yet unidentified post-translational mechanism. A putative factor that might play a role in this checkpoint is the oxidizing redox conditions in the cell which are known to be modified upon activation (36Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). In our analyses, we detected a previously undescribed monomeric ζ form, whose appearance correlated with the failure of the TCR complex to reach the cell membrane. Although the mechanisms controlling TCR assembly are poorly understood, it is well established that oxidizing redox conditions in the ER are essential to correct folding and disulfide bond formation (14Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 15Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the monomeric ζ form may be considered a “marker” indicating that the ER redox conditions following 24 h of activation do not permit correct TCR complex formation. It is also possible that the monomeric ζ form physically interferes with TCR complex assembly. It is generally assumed that surface expression of the TCR proteins reflects their assembly status, since unassembled TCR subunits or partial TCR complexes either fail to exit the ER or are degraded in the lysosome (16Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 17Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cumulative evidence indicates that the ζ chain is the last component to join the partial TCR complex. Therefore, any obstacle impeding the correct assembly of the ζ dimer would lead to the formation of partial TCR complexes that cannot exit the ER (16Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 17Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The significance of the appearance of the monomeric ζ form in normal activated T cells and its possible role in preventing cell surface TCR re-expression, merits investigation. Our findings indicate that the normal outcome of T cell activation is transient ζ degradation followed by a recovery to normal levels. We have also shown that this recovery can be blocked by CsA. These results might be relevant in explaining the specific down-regulation of ζ protein observed in T cells isolated from tumor-bearing hosts (37Zier K. Gansbacher B. Salvadori S. Immunol.

https://openalex.org/W2335246604,"Using subtractive immunization to identify cell surface epitopes expressed in a metastasis-specific fashion on cells of the rat MT-W9 mammary carcinoma model, we generated a monoclonal antibody called M-N#1. This antibody binds specifically to metastasizing cells of the MT-W9 series and also to certain other metastasizing rat mammary carcinoma cell lines. We demonstrate that the M-N#1 antibody recognizes a fucosylated N-glycosyl sugar modification, and furthermore show that the epitope specificity of the M-N#1 antibody is for blood group antigen B subtypes 2, 3 and 4 with slight cross-reactivity with blood group antigen A subtype 2. The expression of these carbohydrate epitopes on MT-450 cells is functionally important, because the M-N#1 antibody efficiently inhibits MT-450 tumour growth in spontaneous metastasis assays. These results suggest that expression of the subtypes of blood group antigen B recognized by the M-N#1 antibody does not directly participate in the metastatic cascade but rather confers a growth or survival advantage on the tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W2324611633,"Clonogenic murine B cell precursors are normally ultrasensitive to apoptosis following genotoxic exposure in vitro but can be protected by expression of an E mu-BCL-2 transgene. Such exposures are likely to be mutagenic. This in turn suggests that a level of in vivo genotoxic exposure that usually has minimal pathological consequences might become leukaemogenic when damaged cells fail to abort by apoptosis. If this were to be the case, then the cell type that becomes leukaemic and the chromosomal/molecular changes that occur would also be of considerable interest. We tested this possibility by exposing E mu-BCL-2 and wild-type mice of differing ages to a single dose of X-irradiation of 1-4 Gy. Young (approximately 4-6 weeks) transgenic mice developed leukaemia at a high rate following exposure to 2 Gy but adult mice (4-6 months) did not. Exposure to 4 Gy produced leukaemia in both young and adult transgenic mice but at a higher frequency in the former. Leukaemic cell populations showed clonal rearrangements of the IGH gene but in most cases analysed had immunophenotypic features of an early B lympho-myeloid progenitor population which has not previously been recorded in radiation leukaemogenesis. Molecular cytogenetic analysis of leukaemic cells by banded karyotype and FISH revealed a consistent double abnormality: trisomy 15 plus an interstitial deletion of chromosome 4 that was confirmed by LOH analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1990654724,Zipper Protein Kinase (ZPK) is a leucine zipper protein localized to the nucleus which exhibits serine-threonine kinase activity and is associated with the stress dependent signal transduction pathway. ZPK forms heterodimers with leucine zipper containing transcription factors such as the cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and Myc. Furthermore ZPK phosphorylates both Myc and CREB. Overexpression of ZPK in NTera-2 human teratocarcinoma cells results in inhibition of PKA induced transcriptional activation by CREB and prevents retinoic acid induced differentiation of the cells to neurons. Our results suggest that ZPK stifles neural differentiation of NT-2 cells partly due to its inhibitory effect on CREB function.

To investigate the role of this phosphorylation, Ser-16 was substituted with alanine or glutamic acid in full-length v-Mos (an Env-Mos fusion protein that contains 31 additional amino acids at the amino terminus of c-Mos), its mouse c-Mos equivalent version (v-Mos residues 32-374, hereafter referred to as Mos), and mouse c-Mos. Constructs expressing mutant versions of Mos were transfected into COS-1 and NIH3T3 cells in a transient and stable manner, respectively. Synthesis and proteolysis of Mos were evaluated by pulse-chase analysis of 35S-methionine-labeled proteins. Our findings indicate that the S16A mutant of Mos was highly unstable. It accumulated to approximately 10% of the level of wild-type Mos or its S16E mutant. In addition, the S16A mutation but not the S16E mutation inhibited Mos interaction with a cellular protein, p35, suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser-16 may promote Mos interaction with p35. As expected from its destabilizing effect, the S16A mutation caused a dramatic decrease in the cellular transforming activity of Mos (determined by soft-agar colony-formation assay with the stably transfected NIH3T3 cells), which is known to correlate with its CSF function. Efficient ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of c-Mos requires proline as the second residue from the amino-terminus. In contrast to Mos, neither the stability nor protein kinase activity of v-Mos (in which c-Mos residue Pro-2 becomes Pro-33) was affected by the S16A mutation. To provide further proof that, similar to c-Mos, the S16A mutant is recognized by the proteolysis system through Pro-2, we show that the effect of the S16A mutation is reversed by the Pro-2-Ala mutation. Thus, our results indicate that Ser-16 has an important role in the regulation of c-Mos and that phosphorylation at Ser-16 may inhibit proteolysis of c-Mos."

To elucidate its biological role, we generated transgenic mice expressing LTK under the control of cytomegarovirus enhancer and beta-actin promoter. The transgenic mice exhibited growth retardation and most of the transgenic mice died within several months after birth. Interestingly, although LTK was expressed in several major organs, the activation (tyrosine-phosphorylation, kinase activity, and multimerization) of LTK was observed selectively in the heart, where LTK was localized on intracellular membrane, presumably on endoplasmic reticulum. Echocardiography showed that the transgenic heart underwent severe concentric hypertrophy, which resulted in reduced cardiac output, low blood pressure, and increased heart rate. Histological examination of the heart exhibited focal degeneration of cardiomyocytes. These histological changes were considered to be due to apoptosis, based on the finding that the sarcolemmas of the degenerative cardiomyocytes were well preserved. In addition, expression of fetal genes, such as atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal alpha-actin, was markedly induced in the transgenic heart. These results indicate that a certain tissue-specific mechanism of activating LTK exists in the heart and that the activated LTK resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte degeneration and gene reprogramming. These findings will provide novel insights into the activating mechanism and biological role of LTK in vivo."
